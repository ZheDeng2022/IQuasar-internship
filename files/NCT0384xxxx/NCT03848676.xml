  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients at clinical relapse who progressed during&#xD;
      Proteasome Inhibitors (PIs) or Immunomodulating Drugs (IMiDs)-based therapies and who are&#xD;
      assigned to antiCD38-based salvage treatments, will be enrolled. We will collect bone marrow&#xD;
      (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients at specific timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline (BM, PB and buccal swab)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  every 3 month (PB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  achievement of response (≥ Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)) (BM and PB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relapse or refractory status to antiCD38-based treatments (BM and PB) Samples will be&#xD;
           processed and stored in the &quot;Hematological Laboratory&quot; located in the University of&#xD;
           Turin (Italy) for various proposed analyses: at specific time-points CD138+ (Plasma&#xD;
           Cells-PCs) and marker CD138/19+ (B cells) will be immunomagnetically enriched from the&#xD;
           BM mononuclear cells and frozen as viable cells in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); PB&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from whole blood by density-gradient&#xD;
           centrifugation, and frozen as above; plasma fraction from PB and BM will be obtained by&#xD;
           centrifugation and stored frozen; a buccal swab will be obtained at the time of&#xD;
           enrollment as a source of control germline DNA and stored frozen.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Evaluation of cell-intrinsic mechanisms on BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) will be performed on&#xD;
           marker CD138+ purified cells to evaluate their genomic profile, and on buccal swab DNA&#xD;
           to restrict the analysis to variants or structural abnormalities that have a clear&#xD;
           somatic status, and are therefore specific to the tumor cells. In details:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 WGS: libraries will be prepared with TruSeq™(Kit Illumina) DNA Polymerase Chain&#xD;
           Reaction (PCR)-Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) from 500ng of&#xD;
           genomic DNA, aiming for an average target insert of 300bp. Sequencing will be performed&#xD;
           on a 150bp-paired end protocol, at a target depth of 40x for tumor samples and 30x for&#xD;
           normal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 WES: libraries will be prepared with SureSelectXT Human All Exon V6 (Agilent&#xD;
           technologies int., Santa Clara, CA) from 100ng of genomic DNA, aiming for an average&#xD;
           target insert of 300bp. Sequencing will be performed on a 150bp-paired end protocol,&#xD;
           aiming for a target depth of 200x for tumor samples and 100x for normal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Data analysis: next generation sequencing scoring system output format files&#xD;
           (*.FASTQ files) will be aligned to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment&#xD;
           Tool (BWAmem), and deduplicated aligned Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files will be&#xD;
           analyzed using the following published tools available at the Wellcome Trust Sanger&#xD;
           Institute (WTSI):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. accurate genome-wide allele-specific copy number (ASCAT) and Battenberg for clonal&#xD;
                and subclonal copy number changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. BRASS for structural variations (large inversions and deletions, translocations,&#xD;
                internal tandem duplication).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Caveman and Pindel for Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and small&#xD;
                insertion-deletions (indels).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clonal composition of the sample and the genomic evolution of myeloma over time will&#xD;
           be inferred from the adjusted cancer cell fraction of the variants identified, clustered&#xD;
           and analyzed using a hierarchical bayesian Dirichlet process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mutational processes operative at various phases of MM will be analyzed using a&#xD;
           Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) approach to extract mutational signatures from&#xD;
           the array of substitutions in their 5' and 3' context.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The possible driver mutation role of all extracted missense mutation will be evaluated&#xD;
           by the recently published dN/dS algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RNA-seq on marker CD138+ purified cells to evaluate transcriptomic profile will be&#xD;
           performed using TruSeq Stranded Messanger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA) Library Prep Kit&#xD;
           (Illumina, San Diego, CA) on 500 ng total RNA, followed by sequencing, aiming for&#xD;
           100x106 total reads per sample. DNA excision repair protein (ERCC) spike-in mix will be&#xD;
           added to facilitate normalization of the expression levels between samples. Reads will&#xD;
           be aligned with Tophat2 to call SNVs, indels, and detect gene fusions. Cufflinks2 will&#xD;
           be used to profile gene expression and detect novel transcript isoforms. Overall gene&#xD;
           transcript expression levels will be quantified using the Reads Per Kilobase Million&#xD;
           (RPKM) metric based on uniquely mapping reads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Flow cytometry analysis will be performed on BM samples to examine potential&#xD;
           determinants of immunotherapy sensitivity/resistance and the expression of specific&#xD;
           targets including marker Cluster of Differentiation 38 (CD38), B-cell maturation antigen&#xD;
           (BCMA), marker Cluster of Differentiation 33 (CD33), Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1),&#xD;
           and marker Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19) prior to treatment, at response and at&#xD;
           relapse. We will evaluate MM percent positive cells and Mean Fluorescence Intensity&#xD;
           (MFI) in order to monitor the antigen expression during the evolution of the disease.&#xD;
           Receptor density will also be performed. Moreover the European cytoflow consortium of&#xD;
           International Myeloma Foundation (EuroFlow-IMF) MM minimal residual disease (MRD) panel&#xD;
           will be applied to monitor MRD in particular by using a multiepitope (ME) antiCD38 to&#xD;
           detect possible determinants of resistance. Moreover this panel will allow us to monitor&#xD;
           the phenotype evolution of the clonal population, looking in particular at the shift&#xD;
           towards more immature cells, which has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance to&#xD;
           bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Storage of viable marker CD138-: we will evaluate distribution of marker CD38 also on&#xD;
           marker CD138- cells and we will determine if genomic or immunophenotypic lesions&#xD;
           responsible for resistance could be present also in the marker CD138- fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluation of cell-extrinsic mechanism on BM and PB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Flow Cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations will be performed in the same BM&#xD;
           and PB to evaluate T-cells population (marker CD38+, marker Cluster of Differentiation 4&#xD;
           (CD4+), marker Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8+), Tregs cells) and other regulatory&#xD;
           and suppressive immune populations like Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). T&#xD;
           cells will be measured at baseline, response and at relapse, and they could help in&#xD;
           evaluating the interaction between B and T cell compartments in patients receiving&#xD;
           immunotherapies. Moreover, evaluation of some immune checkpoints on T cells at baseline&#xD;
           and post-treatment will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RNA-seq of lymphocyte subpopulations will be performed to identify the frequencies of&#xD;
           the various helper and effector lymphocyte populations, and correlate those with&#xD;
           response to treatment or lack thereof. We will also perform RNA-seq on different marker&#xD;
           CD4+ T-lymphocytic subpopulations in responsive and non-responsive MM to identify&#xD;
           potential suppressive signatures in the latter group. The same lymphocyte subpopulations&#xD;
           will be analyzed in BM samples from 10 healthy subjects (BM biopsy in lymphoma negative&#xD;
           staging).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of a broad spectrum of cytokines produced and secreted by MM and other cells&#xD;
           within the BM microenvironment: cytokines and chemokines related to MM bone and&#xD;
           microenvironment will be measured in BM and PB plasma from patients at each time-point.&#xD;
           The laboratory assays will be performed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
           (ELISA) kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BM biopsy: bone biopsies from MM patients at baseline and after Monoclonal Antibody&#xD;
           Therapy (mAbs therapy) will be evaluated for the expression of suppressive molecules&#xD;
           such as, marker Cluster of Differentiation 80/86 (CD80/86), marker Cluster of&#xD;
           Differentiation 40 (CD40) in the tumor cells and in the BM lymphoid population by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: After comprehensively characterizing the genomic, transcriptomic and immunophenotypic&#xD;
      features of CD138+ cells, and having a clear picture of the effector/suppressive immune&#xD;
      population in MM, we will then correlate these features with clinical data. In detail, we&#xD;
      will create a database including the following columns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline clinical characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognostic factors: International Staging System (ISS), Revised International Staging&#xD;
           System (R-ISS), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), cytogenetic analysis by Fluorescence In&#xD;
           Situ Hybridization test (FISH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior therapies and relevant clinical results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best response: responses will be defined according to the International Uniform Response&#xD;
           Criteria. Responders are defined as subjects with at least a VGPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of Response (DOR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS) and&#xD;
           Time to Progression (TTP) data In this aim, we will look for correlation between&#xD;
           biological features and disease response or lack thereof, to understand which&#xD;
           cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic features are better predictors of response. Because of&#xD;
           the time needed before disease response can be assessed, this analysis will be performed&#xD;
           after at least 1 year of treatment or at earlier progression. In a first analysis,&#xD;
           biological features will be associated with best response to treatment, PFS and other&#xD;
           baseline clinical, prognostic and treatment variables using linear models. Subsequently,&#xD;
           starting from year 3, when enough follow-up will allow a meaningful analysis of PFS and&#xD;
           OS, Kaplan-Meier and Coxregression models will be fitted to identify possible&#xD;
           independent prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the relatively small size of the cohort will limit statistical power and the&#xD;
      possibility to perform subgroup analysis, this attempt to identify biomarkers could improve&#xD;
      the clinical management of the patient, by prioritizing the vast array of salvage treatments&#xD;
      in MM and thus decreasing costs.&#xD;
