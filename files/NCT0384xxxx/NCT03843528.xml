  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated (MTD) of vorinostat used in&#xD;
      combination with low-dose azacitidine after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&#xD;
      (alloHCT) for prevention of relapse of childhood myeloid malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents ages 1 to 21 years of age who are undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation for a myeloid malignancy (AML, MDS, JMML, MPAL) will be&#xD;
      eligible. There are no restrictions on donor type, conditioning, stem cell source, of GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated on a single arm, and will initially receive 2 cycles of&#xD;
      standard post-transplant azacitidine at a dose of 32mg/m2/dose IV/subcutnaeous for 5 days, in&#xD;
      28 day cycles. This is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tolerance of 2 cycles of azacitidine has been established, patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive vorinostat orally at different dose levels, depending on the stage of the study. The&#xD;
      dose level assignments will be conducted on a standard 3+3 design, whereby dose-escalation is&#xD;
      peformed if previous patients tolerated the dose without dose-limiting toxicities, and&#xD;
      dose-reduction is performed if dose-limiting toxicities are seen. The starting dose will be&#xD;
      100mg/m2/dose on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 28 day cycles. This will be in addition to&#xD;
      receiving azacitidine at the fixed dose above. In order to start each cycle, participants&#xD;
      will be required to meet specific clinical parameters to ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of vorinostat between patients will be escalated or de-escalated until criteria for&#xD;
      finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, and this will complete the study.&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive the prescribed dose of vorinostat for up to 7 cycles (9&#xD;
      total cycles of azacitidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed for dose-limiting toxicities primarily during the first two course&#xD;
      of combined therapy (cycles 3 and 4), but are continued to be tracked until the completion of&#xD;
      all potential combined treatment (1 year or 7 combined cycles, whichever is earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat used in combination with&#xD;
      low-dose azacitidine after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for&#xD;
      childhood myeloid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the vorinostat used in combination&#xD;
           with low-dose azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe rates of relapse, transplant related mortality, graft-versus-host disease,&#xD;
           and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the effect of epigenetic modification on lymphocyte reconstitution in the&#xD;
           post-alloHCT setting.&#xD;
