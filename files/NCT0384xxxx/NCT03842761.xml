  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is the evaluation of safety and tolerability in patients&#xD;
      with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification A and B]&#xD;
      over different dose regimes of BI 685509 compared to placebo. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      investigate pharmacokinetics of different doses of BI 685509 in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment (CTP A and CTP B). In addition, another secondary objective is to&#xD;
      compare safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in patients with mild to moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment (CTP A and CTP B) of single BI 685509 dose to individually matched healthy&#xD;
      volunteers&#xD;

             CKD-EPI formula at screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local&#xD;

             or hemolysis when bilirubin will be almost exclusively indirect hyperbilirubinemia)].&#xD;
             Self-limited and resolved historical events of decompensation like ascites or&#xD;
             encephalopathy are allowed if they have occurred at least 6 weeks prior to screening&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient Group 2: Patients with CTP B (with liver stiffness &gt;15 kPa during screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key inclusion for Healthy Volunteer group&#xD;

&#xD;
        Key exclusion for all trial participants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing chronic alcohol or drug use, which in the investigator's opinion, makes the&#xD;
             patient an unreliable trial participant or unlikely to complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts based on&#xD;
             the investigator´s judgment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient Group 2: recent decompensation event (refractory ascites, recurrent variceal&#xD;
             hemorrhage, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or&#xD;
             hepatorenal syndrome) within 6 weeks of screening&#xD;
