    <textblock>
      Four clinical trial institutions that meet the national qualification are selected as&#xD;
      clinical research centers. After informed consent of the subjects and meeting the selection&#xD;
      criteria, the subjects will be included in this clinical study. After the follow-up, all the&#xD;
      data were sorted out and analyzed. Finally, the data of the two groups were compared to prove&#xD;
      whether the high-pressure-resistant peripherally inserted central venous catheter developed&#xD;
      by L&amp;Z US, Inc. was not inferior to the control group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subcutaneous detection of blood vessel movements less than three times, and finally completed catheterization and confirmed that the end of the catheter in the pre-positioning proportion of the total number of patients (catheterization success refers to the chest X-ray and other fluoroscopy means to confirm that the end of the catheter is located in the middle and lower segment of superior vena cava).</description>

    <description>Success of one puncture refers to entering the target vein only once. If the puncture needle failed to penetrate the vein once and retreated to the subcutaneous area, then exploratory puncture was the second puncture.</description>
