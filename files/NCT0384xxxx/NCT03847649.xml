  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects being treated with durvalumab has on&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers doing this study also want to evaluate if prednisone (a type of steroid),&#xD;
      when given together with durvalumab, can reduce any side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy&#xD;
      drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune&#xD;
      system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune&#xD;
      response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
      Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000&#xD;
      people. This drug seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than&#xD;
      standard treatment alone or if people can be re-treated with durvalumab after previous side&#xD;
      effects&#xD;
