      This study is a multicenter phase I/II study of the treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The objective of Phase I part is to study the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      LAE001 monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      the drug, the Phase II part is to assess the efficacy of LAE001 in prolonging the&#xD;
      failure-free survival (FFS) of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study of this study is a dose-escalating study with enrollment of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have never received chemotherapy or who&#xD;
      have received chemotherapy (chemotherapy failure or intolerance), and preferential enrollment&#xD;
      of patients who had failed chemotherapy. The phase II study is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled multicenter study based on ADT, and only patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-sensitive prostate cancer will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of a completed phase I dose-escalation trial and preclinical data on&#xD;
      the drug, the initial dose proposed for this study is 50 mg BID, and one cycle will be 28&#xD;
      days. The escalated doses are 100 mg BID and 125 mg BID, two dose groups. If two or more&#xD;
      cases of DLT occur for 100 mg BID, the dose may be reduced to 75 mg BID for investigation. If&#xD;
      DLT occurs in two or more out of six patients for a certain dose group, the group with the&#xD;
      dose preceding the testing dose will be determined to be the MTD dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RP2D will be determined based on a comprehensive analysis of the safety, pharmacokinetic,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and efficacy data of dose escalation. Where the MTD is determined, MTD is&#xD;
      usually taken as the RP2D, or a dose lower than MTD is selected as the RP2D based on the&#xD;
      combined data. If it is determined from the safety data that the dose can still be further&#xD;
      increased, but the pharmacokinetic data indicate that the plasma concentration of LAE001 has&#xD;
      reached steady-state saturation, the lowest dose that reaches steady-state saturation will be&#xD;
      taken as the RP2D. According to the above principles, if the overall incidence of DLT at the&#xD;
      dose is &lt; 1/3, this testing dose will be determined as the RP2D. Six patients will be further&#xD;
      enrolled and treated at the RP2D dose for sufficient pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on top of&#xD;
      ADT therapy. Its primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of LAE001 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. About 60 patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the LAE001 treatment group (Group A) and placebo treatment control group&#xD;
      (Group B) based on a 2:1 ratio on top of basic ADT therapy. Participant will be treated until&#xD;
      the occurrence of disease progression (clinical evidence required), intolerance, judgement by&#xD;
      the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to continue receiving treatment, death, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent.&#xD;
