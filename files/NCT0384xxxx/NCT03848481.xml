    <textblock>
      This clinical research trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV),&#xD;
      a naturally occurring homolog of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) in children and young&#xD;
      adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). CBDV has effects independent of CB1 and CB2 receptor&#xD;
      activation and a good safety profile. This proposal addresses the Foundation for Prader Willi&#xD;
      Research's five year PWS Research Plan: Program 1, Clinical Care Research: seeks to evaluate&#xD;
      treatments that aim to reduce behavioral symptoms, such as irritability, in order to improve&#xD;
      the quality of life of both the individual with PWS and their families. GW Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      will provide the CBDV drug and matching placebo and additional funding to the site.&#xD;

    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability Subscale (ABC-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the ABC-I score. The ABC-I is a well-characterized outcome that is accepted by the FDA for the purpose of labeling, and is one of the best and most validated outcome measures in the developmental disabilities. An inclusion cutoff of 18 or higher on the ABC-I at screening was chosen based on multiple medication trials with irritability as the primary target.</description>

    <measure>Repetative Behavior Scale- Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>

    <measure>Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the CY-BOCS score. The CY-BOCS is 10-item clinician measure designed to assess the severity of obsessive compulsive symptoms in children and adolescents over the previous week. It consists of four primary sections including Obsessions checklist, Severity items for Obsessions, Compulsions checklist and severity items for Compulsions and a set of investigational items. Improvement on this scale was associated with improvements in caregiver quality of life in our 8-week study of intranasal oxytocin.</description>

    <measure>Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ActiGraph GT9X-BT activity monitors</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Sleep Behaviors. Actigraph activity monitors are a well validated activity sleep monitoring device that has been utilized widely in clinical trials and health research, measuring sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I will be used as a measure of improvement and contains a 7 point scale as follows: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I is a clinician rated global measure of improvement and has been used as a measure in previous clinical psychopharmacology trials.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montefiore Einstein Rigidity Scale-Revised-PWS (MERS-R-PWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Montefiore-Einstein Rigidity Scale-Revised-PWS (MERS-R-PWS) is designed to assess three domains of rigid behavior in individuals with PWS:&#xD;
Behavioral Rigidity (e.g., Insistence on sameness, things must be done in his/her way, etc.)&#xD;
Cognitive Rigidity (e.g., Special interests, inflexible adherence to rules, etc.)&#xD;
Protest (in response to deviation from rigidity; e.g., tantrum, irritability, arguing) The MERS-R-PWS is a clinician-rated scale and takes about 20 minutes to complete. It will be completed only for subjects who display rigid behaviors at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) subscales in lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is an informative rating instrument that was empirically derived by principal component analysis to measure behavior in those with developmental disability and ASD. It contains 58 items that resolve into 5 subscales. The subscales and the respective number of items are as follows: (a) irritability - 15 items, (b) lethargy/social withdrawal - 16 items, (c) stereotypic behavior - 7 items, (d) hyperactivity/noncompliance - 16 items, and (e) inappropriate speech - 4 items. The ABC was designed to be completed by any adult who knows the patient well, such as a parent/caregiver or teacher. This instrument measures behavior on a four-point severity scale where 0 = no problem at all, 1 = behavior is a problem but in a slight degree, 2 = problem is moderately serious, and 3 = problem is severe in degree.</description>

             study, interferes with the conduct of the study, confounds interpretation of study&#xD;

             greater than 460 msec, then 2 additional ECGs will be conducted in the same sitting, 5&#xD;
             minutes apart. If not recognized at screening, then a full triplicate repeat showing&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Female subjects who are pregnant will be excluded from the study. If a female subject&#xD;
             is able to become pregnant, she will be given a pregnancy test before entry into the&#xD;
