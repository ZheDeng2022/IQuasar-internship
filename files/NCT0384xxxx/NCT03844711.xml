      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation,&#xD;
      a qualification of impairment of respiratory muscle function, including hyperinflation and&#xD;
      muscle weakness. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation is indicated for patients and is recommended&#xD;
      for even the most severe cases. However some patients do not conclude conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols, due to exercise intolerance, are then an electrical estimation and&#xD;
      muscle training respiratory adjuvant treatments for patients. and little has been explored&#xD;
      about the effects and methodologies of using transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic&#xD;
      stimulation (TEDS) in healthy subjects. The objective of this study on stage I is to evaluate&#xD;
      the acute effect of transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic stimulation on respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, cardiac variability, thickness, resistance, mobility and diaphragmatic activation&#xD;
      comparing different frequencies of electrical stimulation in healthy individuals. The&#xD;
      objective of this study on stage II is to evaluate the effects of transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      diaphragmatic stimulation, compared to inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, security of the technics, thickness and diaphragmatic function in healthy&#xD;
      individuals.The objective of this study on stage III is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;

      diaphragmatic function in patients with exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Methods: The Stage I is a cross-over Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in the first stage of&#xD;
      this research, which will be performed at the Exercise Research Laboratory (LAPEX) of the&#xD;
      School of Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Dance of the Universidade Federal do Rio&#xD;
      Grande do Sul, the Stage II and is a randomized crossover clinical trial, to be performed at&#xD;
      the Exercise Physiology Laboratory (LAFIEX) of Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA).&#xD;
      Healthy individuals aged between 20 and 60 years, fully aware and cooperative, randomized&#xD;
      into two groups will be included: one group that will perform TEDS and another that will&#xD;
      perform IMT in a single session. TEDS will be applied with symmetrical biphasic pulsed&#xD;
      current, frequency 30 Hertz (Hz), pulse width 0.5 ms, rise time of 1 second, sustain of 1s,&#xD;
      descent of 2 s, maintaining respiratory rate of 15 rpm, intensity necessary to obtain muscle&#xD;
      contraction visible, for 30 minutes or until muscle fatigue, daily. The IMT will be performed&#xD;
      with the PowerBreath device with a charge of 50-60% of the PImax, for 30 breaths and Stage&#xD;
      III will be an RCT, which will be performed at the Hospitalization Units of Hospital de&#xD;
      Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA). In the first stage only healthy individuals will be&#xD;
      included, who will be randomized to TEDS, in the first day (group 1) the parameters will be&#xD;
      with 30 hertz (Hz) frequency and the second day (group 2) will be with 80 Hz, with one-day&#xD;
      interval between interventions. The TEDS will be applied with symmetrical biphasic pulsed&#xD;
      current, pulse width 0.4 ms, rise time of 1 second (s), 1s lift, 2 s descent, maintaining&#xD;
      respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, intensity required to obtain visible muscle&#xD;
      contraction, for 20 minutes or until muscle fatigue. In this stage, heart rate variability,&#xD;
      thickness and diaphragmatic mobility by ultrasonography, diaphragmatic activation by&#xD;
      electromyography, inspiratory muscle endurance with powerbreath, and respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength by manovacuometry, before and at the end of treatment, the following variables will&#xD;
      be measured. In the second stage patients with COPD (GOLD III and IV) hospitalized for&#xD;
      exacerbation of the disease, who will be randomized into three groups: one group that will&#xD;
      perform TEDS, another will perform IMT and a third group that will only perform conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The TEDS will be applied with symmetrical biphasic pulsed current, frequency&#xD;
      30 Hz, pulse width 0.4 ms, rise time of 1 second, sustain of 1s, decrease of 2 s, maintaining&#xD;
      respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute (rpm), intensity required to obtain visible&#xD;
      muscle contraction for 20 minutes or even muscle fatigue daily. The IMT will be performed&#xD;
      with the Power Breath device with load referring to 30-60% of PImax, during 30 breaths daily.&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy will be HCPA standard. In this stage, before and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment, the following variables will be measured: respiratory muscle strength through&#xD;
      manovacuometry, pulmonary function through spirometry, diaphragmatic thickness through&#xD;
      echocardiography, diaphragmatic function through respiratory electroneuromyography, Body&#xD;
      Mass-Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise Capacity (BODE) Index with mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), functional capacity through the six-minute walk test, dyspnoea by the Borg Scale and&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale, cardiovascular variables and time of hospitalization&#xD;
      through the electronic medical record. The interventions will be carried out from the&#xD;
      patient's hospitalization to the hospital discharge.&#xD;
