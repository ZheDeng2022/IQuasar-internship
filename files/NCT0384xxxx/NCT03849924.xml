    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether a brief psychological intervention, known as a self-affirmation&#xD;
      intervention which works by allowing one to recognise their own value, can improve&#xD;
      well-being. This study also evaluates whether more of these interventions will lead to&#xD;
      greater increases in well-being, and also measures self-esteem and anxiety to examine their&#xD;
      potential involvement in the self-affirmation process. Participants are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either a self-affirmation intervention group, a 'booster' self-affirmation group whereby they&#xD;
      receive the intervention twice, or a control group (no intervention). Participant's&#xD;
      well-being, self-esteem and anxiety are assessed at baseline (before the intervention), 1&#xD;
      week, and 2 weeks after the intervention. It is hypothesised that those who undergo&#xD;
      self-affirmation will have more improved levels of well-being than those who do not; those&#xD;
      who undergo the self-affirmation twice will have the most improved levels of well-being. It&#xD;
      is also hypothesised that self-esteem and state anxiety will be involved in the&#xD;
      self-affirmation process and potentially mediate the effects of self-affirmation on&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjective well-being, refers to an appraisal of one's own life as a whole. Subjective&#xD;
      well-being is regularly being used by governments as a measure of observing social progress,&#xD;
      informing new policy and promoting behaviour change, in comparison to more objective measures&#xD;
      of social progress such as gross domestic product. A key aim of government policies is&#xD;
      therefore to find the most efficient, cost-effective ways to improve people's subjective&#xD;
      well-being, to determine the most efficient ways of improving quality of life. There are&#xD;
      currently a number of ways in which the government is attempting to address this, with&#xD;
      programs in place that are designed to improve people's well-being, such as Altogether Better&#xD;
      (Yorkshire and Humber Strategic Health Authority) and Target Well-being (Federation of&#xD;
      Groundwork Trust), as well as NHS programmes and free well-being courses. However, these&#xD;
      programmes were not always found to be effective in improving people's well-being,&#xD;
      particularly when the programmes involved health awareness activities. This limited&#xD;
      effectiveness of programmes involving health awareness activities makes them unlikely to be&#xD;
      cost-effective as a well-being intervention. This suggests the importance of developing an&#xD;
      effective intervention to improve people's well-being, that could also be used within&#xD;
      government/NHS well-being programs, to enhance the effectiveness of said programs in&#xD;
      improving well-being to make them more cost-effective, particularly in those promoting health&#xD;
      awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-affirmation theory provides an approach to improve subjective well-being by overcoming&#xD;
      feelings of threat to the self. A threat to one's sense of self could undermine one's&#xD;
      subjective well-being. Self-affirmation theory states that people strive to maintain a&#xD;
      positive, moral and adaptive self-image, and that threats to the self (e.g., a smoker being&#xD;
      told that smoking is bad for them), motivates them to defend their global sense of self&#xD;
      (e.g., by convincing themselves that the information is flawed). According to&#xD;
      self-affirmation theory, people's sense of self can also be protected by bolstering&#xD;
      self-image in a domain that is not under direct threat. For example, if one feels that their&#xD;
      sense of self is threatened in a certain domain (e.g., by anti-smoking messages), then one&#xD;
      can bolster self-image by compensating in another domain (e.g., by doing charity work). There&#xD;
      is a large amount of evidence to support this theory, mostly from studies in which&#xD;
      self-affirmation manipulations (i.e. by reminding people of their 'core values') have been&#xD;
      found to be effective in overcoming threats to the self and promoting receptiveness to&#xD;
      health-risk communications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of self-affirmation in overcoming threats to the self is not specific to&#xD;
      health-risk communications as research has found self-affirmation also to be effective in&#xD;
      overcoming threats to the self that occur within other domains, such as self-esteem, anxiety&#xD;
      and well-being, suggesting that they could be employed to protect subjective well-being&#xD;
      across populations at a low cost. There are limitations associated with research in this area&#xD;
      however, as there have only been very few studies that have looked at the effects of&#xD;
      self-affirmation on well-being and their samples are often limited and lack generalisability.&#xD;
      Also, no research to date has measured whether more self-affirmation interventions would&#xD;
      produce greater effects. This is of importance as research has regularly demonstrated&#xD;
      evidence of dose dependant relationships between a psychological intervention and its&#xD;
      subsequent effects, with a greater number of psychological interventions being associated&#xD;
      with greater effects. It would also be beneficial if research were to be conducted to&#xD;
      determine the effects of self-affirmation in a sample of people who are already undergoing a&#xD;
      well-being intervention (e.g., a government programme or NHS course), to see whether&#xD;
      self-affirmation can enhance the effectiveness of the intervention in improving well-being,&#xD;
      as this has not yet been explored and could help to make the intervention more&#xD;
      cost-effective. Therefore, the present study aims to confirm this positive effect of&#xD;
      self-affirmation on subjective well-being in a sample that consists of a wider range of&#xD;
      backgrounds and demographics that are already undergoing a well-being intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this, there has been research that has looked at examining mediators of the&#xD;
      self-affirmation process, however the mechanisms for explaining the effects of&#xD;
      self-affirmation are not yet clearly understood. Some research has found evidence of&#xD;
      self-esteem acting as a mediator in the self-affirmation process. However, more research&#xD;
      needs to be conducted to confirm these findings as they have been inconsistent, with some&#xD;
      research showing no evidence of self-esteem acting as a mediator. Furthermore, other research&#xD;
      has found that self-affirmation led to reductions in state anxiety. This suggests state&#xD;
      anxiety may be acting as a mediator in the self-affirmation process, as undergoing&#xD;
      self-affirmation resulted in changes in state anxiety, with the self-affirming effects&#xD;
      possibly being occurring due to reductions in state anxiety. As there has been no research&#xD;
      that has addressed this possibility of state anxiety acting as a mediator in the&#xD;
      self-affirmation process, research should be conducted on this as this as this would allow&#xD;
      greater understanding of the mechanisms involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the present study will test the ability of self-affirmation to promote and/or&#xD;
      protect subjective well-being by comparing differences in subjective well-being in those that&#xD;
      undergo self-affirmation interventions with those that do not. The study will also compare&#xD;
      the difference between the effects of one self-affirmation intervention with that of two&#xD;
      self-affirmation interventions (i.e. the 'booster' condition), to determine whether there is&#xD;
      a dose-dependent relationship of the effects of self-affirmation. The present study will also&#xD;
      measure the effects of self-affirmation on self-esteem and state anxiety to test the&#xD;
      possibility of mediators of the self-affirmation process. Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      an NHS college which runs free courses that are designed to help people improve their health&#xD;
      and/or well-being. It is likely that those who attend this college may feel threatened by the&#xD;
      courses, such as feeling threatened by opening-up and talking through issues during the&#xD;
      courses, which would lead to defensive processing and undermine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      courses in their aim of improving people's well-being. Self-affirmation could help to&#xD;
      overcome these feelings of threat by reducing defensive processing, which could then enhance&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the courses in helping people improve their well-being. This is a&#xD;
      particularly important population to recruit from as the courses ran by the college often&#xD;
      promote health awareness, which research has identified as being less effective in improving&#xD;
      well-being. Self-affirmation interventions could therefore help to improve the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has three aims; the first aim is to confirm previous findings that brief&#xD;
      self-affirmation interventions can enhance and protect subjective well-being, in a sample of&#xD;
      people already undergoing a well-being intervention, to see whether self-affirmation can&#xD;
      enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. The second aim is to examine the possibility&#xD;
      of mediators involved in producing the effects of self-affirmation, namely state anxiety,&#xD;
      self-esteem and self-esteem domains, to increase understanding of the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      the self-affirmation process. State anxiety and self-esteem have been decided upon due to the&#xD;
      inconsistent findings surrounding self-esteem acting as a mediator of self-affirmation and&#xD;
      the lack of research on state anxiety acting as a mediator of self-affirmation. The third aim&#xD;
      is to measure whether this effect of self-affirmation on subjective well-being is greater in&#xD;
      those that undergo a greater number of self-affirmation interventions, as to whether or not&#xD;
      there is a dose-dependent relationship between self-affirmation and its' effect on subjective&#xD;
      well-being. This could then be used in practice to further enhance the positive effects of&#xD;
      self-affirmation, by providing more self-affirming interventions for example. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that there will be higher levels of subjective well-being, after controlling for&#xD;
      baseline scores, in those that receive a self-affirmation intervention compared to those that&#xD;
      do not. Also, this effect will be greater, with more improved levels of subjective&#xD;
      well-being, in those that receive the self-affirmation intervention twice compared to those&#xD;
      that only receive it once. This is hypothesised due to findings from research in other&#xD;
      domains of more psychological interventions producing greater effects; known as a&#xD;
      dose-dependent relationship. It is also hypothesised self-esteem and state anxiety will act&#xD;
      as mediators in the self-affirmation process, based on previous findings of relationships&#xD;
      between them and self-affirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants- Based on the medium effect size of f = 0.25 for a within/between-participants&#xD;
      MANOVA of three levels and three dependent variables, G-power software was used to conduct a&#xD;
      power analysis to calculate the required sample size. A medium effect size was used for this&#xD;
      analysis as there has been little previous research on self-affirmation in which there were&#xD;
      three levels of the between participants factor and three dependant variables. As the&#xD;
      analysis required an F-test with a between-factors MANOVA with three levels, also assuming an&#xD;
      error probability of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80, it presented a required sample&#xD;
      size estimated to be N = 81.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study aimed to recruit a total of 100 participants to allow for attrition.&#xD;
      This was calculated based on findings of a median retention rate (participants that had&#xD;
      completed baseline and follow-up) of 89% from 151 longitudinal randomised control trials&#xD;
      (RCT). However, these RCT's were clinical trials in which participants were often offered&#xD;
      incentives for participating, with follow-up regularly being retrieved from medical files, as&#xD;
      84% of all trials were conducted in a hospital or general practice (GP) setting. Therefore,&#xD;
      as the participants in the present study were not offered any incentives for participation&#xD;
      and the study is not being carried out in a hospital setting, there are likely to be higher&#xD;
      attrition rates when compared to those calculated based on previous RCT's. To account for&#xD;
      this likelihood of higher attrition rates, the initial participant recruitment aim of 90&#xD;
      participants was rounded up to 100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are to be recruited via opportunity sampling from an NHS college, in the&#xD;
      North-West area of England, which runs a variety of free courses lasting from 2-8 weeks.&#xD;
      These courses aim to enhance people's health and well-being. Examples of the courses run by&#xD;
      the college include courses on improving sense of control, recovery from depression and anger&#xD;
      management. Participants will be recruited from this college as it is likely that those who&#xD;
      attend these college courses may feel threatened by the nature of the courses, by having to&#xD;
      talk through personal issues during the courses for example, which may then inhibit the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the courses in improving well-being. The present study therefore recruited&#xD;
      people from this college in order to see whether self-affirmation could help people to&#xD;
      overcome feelings of threat generated by the courses, and so enhance the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      courses in improving well-being; increasing the cost-effectiveness of the courses.&#xD;
      Participants will not be offered any incentives for participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Analysis- To measure the effectiveness of the randomisation procedure a MANOVA,&#xD;
      using SPSS, will be conducted. The independent variable will be condition with 3 levels:&#xD;
      'standard' self-affirmation, 'booster' self-affirmation and a control. The dependant&#xD;
      variables will be age, gender and baseline measures of subjective well-being, self-esteem and&#xD;
      state anxiety. If the multivariate and univariate tests are non-significant then this will&#xD;
      demonstrate that the participants were successfully randomised to the conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the effects of self-affirmation on subjective well-being a mixed 3 x 3 ANOVA,&#xD;
      using SPSS, will be conducted. The between-participants factor will be condition with 3&#xD;
      levels ('standard' self-affirmation vs 'booster' self-affirmation vs control), and the within&#xD;
      participants factor will be time with 3 levels (baseline assessment vs 'booster' assessment&#xD;
      vs follow-up assessment). The dependent variable will be subjective well-being. An ANCOVA&#xD;
      will be conducted to explore any significant interactions. For the ANCOVA, the&#xD;
      between-participants factor will be condition, the dependent variable will be follow-up&#xD;
      scores and the covariate will be baseline scores. Mediator analysis will also be conducted to&#xD;
      examine whether self-esteem and state anxiety act as mediators in the self-affirmation&#xD;
      process. This will be done using R software via the 'mediation' package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations- Ethical approval has been granted via HRA and REC ethics.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that by completing and handing in the questionnaire they are&#xD;
      consenting to participate in the study. Participants will be informed that they do not have&#xD;
      to participate in the study if they do not want to and they can choose to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study, and withdraw their data, at any time. Participants will also be informed that their&#xD;
      data will remain anonymous and confidential as participants' names, and any other&#xD;
      identifiable information, will not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the follow-up nature of the study, the participants' baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires will need to be matched. In order to match the participants' two&#xD;
      questionnaires, whilst keeping their data anonymous and confidential, they will be asked to&#xD;
      create an identifiable code and state this on both questionnaires. Data storage will comply&#xD;
      with the requirements of the Data Collection Act 1998. All manual data (i.e. participant&#xD;
      questionnaires) will be immediately transferred onto a protected university computer, by&#xD;
      copying the data onto an Excel spreadsheet once the data has been collected. The manual data&#xD;
      will be shredded immediately after it has been transferred onto the protected university&#xD;
      computer. All data will be stored on the protected university computer under password&#xD;
      protected folders and removed once the 5-year data storage period ends, via deleting the&#xD;
      files and removing them from the recycling bin, only the chief and principal investigators&#xD;
      will have access to the protected university computer. Study data and material may be looked&#xD;
      at by individuals from the University of Manchester, from regulatory authorities or from the&#xD;
      NHS Trust, for monitoring and auditing purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although participants will originally be informed that the questionnaires are assessing&#xD;
      personal and social beliefs, participants will be verbally debriefed on the true nature of&#xD;
      the study by the principal investigator, after the follow-up questionnaires have been&#xD;
      completed. Not informing participants of the true nature of the study, that it will involve&#xD;
      using self-affirmation, is necessary as research has found that awareness of the&#xD;
      self-affirmation process may diminish its impact. Participants' demographic variables will&#xD;
      also be assessed (e.g., age, gender, income), which some may find intrusive. However,&#xD;
      participants will be advised that they do not have to provide this information if they do not&#xD;
      wish to and instead they can leave this blank. Appropriate contact details from the&#xD;
      University of Manchester will be provided to participants to allow them to contact someone if&#xD;
      they have any issues surrounding the research, during or after the study.&#xD;
