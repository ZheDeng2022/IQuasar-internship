      This phase II trials studies how well pembrolizumab and vactosertib work after standard of&#xD;
      care chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver that can be&#xD;
      removed by surgery (resectable hepatic metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vactosertib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      vactosertib after standard of care chemotherapy, but before liver metastases surgery, may&#xD;
      help shrink the cancer prior to surgery. This study also investigates pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      vactosertib after liver metastases surgery, decrease the risk of the cancer recurring (coming&#xD;
      back).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the change in the populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)&#xD;
      induced by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus vactosertib in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety/toxicity profile of pembrolizumab-based treatment in the&#xD;
      perioperative setting for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with resectable hepatic&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the efficacy of pembrolizumab plus vactosertib in patients with CRC with&#xD;
      resectable hepatic metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact of pembrolizumab-based treatment on PD-L1 expression in tumor&#xD;
      cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), in patients with mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based treatment in patients with mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic CRC treated with immunotherapy (including but not limited to microsatellite&#xD;
      instability (MSI) testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate change in TIICs, PDL-1 expression, and T cell repertoires as well as&#xD;
      molecular profiles with response/resistance and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify immune response messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression analysis to&#xD;
      derive signatures associated with tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To identify genomic mutations and gene copy aberrations associated with response and&#xD;
      resistance to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate changes in microbiome composition and diversity with diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and vactosertib&#xD;
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days a week followed by a 2-day resting period for 2 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard&#xD;
      of care surgical removal of liver metastases approximately 2 weeks (minimum 1 week) after&#xD;
      last dose of vactosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTIONAL ADJUVANT TREATMENT: After surgery, eligible patients may also receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and vactosertib every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients who do not undergo optional adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      are followed up at 14 days and then every 90 days for up to 1 year. Patients who undergo&#xD;
      optional adjuvant treatment are followed up at 30 days and then every 90 days for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
