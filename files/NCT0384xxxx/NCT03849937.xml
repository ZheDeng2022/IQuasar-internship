      Objectives AIM 1. Establish acceptability and preliminary efficacy of online CHATO modules&#xD;
      through pilot testing with NH staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. Develop and pilot test the data collection tool with consultant and advisory panel&#xD;
      input. Interviews of NH administrators and staff who participate in the pilot testing of&#xD;
      CHATO and a process evaluation will be used to identify and develop supports for&#xD;
      implementation and sustainability in preparation for future CHATO testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes The R61 will prepare for the R01 pragmatic trial by establishing&#xD;
      feasibility of online modules and preliminary efficacy of CHATO with NH staff. The research&#xD;
      design is a randomized clinical trial. One NH will provide initial feasibility testing. Any&#xD;
      modifications to the modules will be made. Then six nursing homes (estimated N=150 staff)&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to intervention or wait-list control groups. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be knowledge gain for staff completing CHATO training. Additional outcomes include&#xD;
      resident quality measures related to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)&#xD;
      on both resident and facility levels and facility level data related to inappropriate use of&#xD;
      psychotropic medications to control BPSD. Implementation strategies will be assessed by&#xD;
      survey and leadership interviews completed by an external evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration Changing Talk Online (CHATO) training is a course is to increase&#xD;
      awareness of the importance of effective communication with older adults and to use&#xD;
      evidence-based person-centered communication during interactions with older adults in nursing&#xD;
      homes and other health care settings. The total program is approximately 3 hours, split into&#xD;
      3 modules. Each module is approximately an hour, depending on the individual user. Each NH&#xD;
      will work with the research team for three months to plan, implement, and collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population This course is designed for staff in nursing homes, independent&#xD;
      and assisted living, and health care settings in the community that include registered&#xD;
      nurses, nursing assistants, nursing home dieticians, direct care professionals, other&#xD;
      administrations and support employees. All the employees at all seven nursing homes will be&#xD;
      asked to participate. Assignment of NHs to intervention and wait-list control groups will be&#xD;
      at random. A sample of 150 training participants are estimated.&#xD;

      Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus: The population afflicted with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and other dementias will expand from 5 to 16 million by 2050, increasing&#xD;
      dementia care costs from $259 billion to $1.1 trillion. Of today's 1.4 million nursing home&#xD;
      (NH) residents, 61% have moderate to severe dementia, and up to 90% of them exhibit&#xD;
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as physical and verbal&#xD;
      aggression, agitation, and wandering. These behaviors are associated with depression as well&#xD;
      as reduced quality of life and lower survival rates in persons with dementia (PWD). BPSD also&#xD;
      stress family caregivers and precipitate NH placement. In the NH, BPSD increase time to&#xD;
      provide care, and NH staff, primarily Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) who provide most&#xD;
      direct care, report that BPSD represent the most stressful aspect of their job. Considering&#xD;
      additional costs for CNA burnout and turnover, It is estimated that BPSD increase costs of&#xD;
      dementia care by 25 to 35%. With national NH rates for a semi-private room of $82,200 per&#xD;
      year, reducing BPSD may save up to $20,000 per resident annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As cognitive and communication abilities decline due to dementia, NH residents become unable&#xD;
      to convey care preferences and needs and staff communication becomes infantilizing,&#xD;
      impersonal, and task-oriented resulting in BPSD. As verified in the investigator's past&#xD;
      research using behavioral coding and sequential analyses of video-recorded care, staff&#xD;
      elderspeak (communication that sounds like baby talk) is linked to resident resistiveness to&#xD;
      care (RTC), a subset of BPSD that disrupt nursing care. NH residents were more than twice as&#xD;
      likely to be resistive to care when staff used elderspeak compared to normal communication.&#xD;
      Thus, improving communication has great potential as a nonpharmacological intervention to&#xD;
      reduce BPSD in NH care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: The Communication Predicament of Aging theory establishes the link between&#xD;
      elderspeak and BPSD. Elderspeak derives from stereotypical views of older adults as less&#xD;
      competent than younger persons. When younger people talk with older adults, they modify their&#xD;
      speech by simplifying, clarifying, and altering the underlying affective quality of messages.&#xD;
      The resulting implicit message of incompetence begins a negative feedback loop for older&#xD;
      persons, who react with depression, withdrawal, and dependency. Elderspeak is especially&#xD;
      threatening to self-concept and personhood, critical to the wellbeing of PWD who are likely&#xD;
      to respond with BPSD. The Need-driven Dementia-compromised Behavior model recognizes BPSD as&#xD;
      the expression of unmet needs of PWD. Communication, that staff can modify to prevent BPSD,&#xD;
      is an essential constant part of the environment connecting PWD to others and affirming their&#xD;
      self-concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychotropic medications are often used inappropriately to control BPSD in NH residents with&#xD;
      dementia. Alarmingly high rates persist, despite negative outcomes, an FDA black box warning&#xD;
      of increased mortality for older adults with dementia, and a recent Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services (CMS) mandate to reduce off-label prescribing of antipsychotics. CMS and&#xD;
      the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care target reductions in psychotropic drug use&#xD;
      as top priority. Despite reductions in antipsychotic rates (one type of psychotropic&#xD;
      medication) ranging from 3 to 12% from 2011-2016, up to 20% of NH residents received&#xD;
      inappropriate antipsychotic medication in 2017. Research demonstrates that educating direct&#xD;
      care providers in behavioral interventions to control BPSD also reduces psychotropic drug use&#xD;
      (antipsychotics, hypnotics, antidepressants, antianxiety, sedative, anticonvulsant and mood&#xD;
      stabilizers), although evidence is limited by lack of rigorous clinical trials that also&#xD;
      evaluate approaches that influence intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently completed R01 clinical trial that tested Changing Talk (CHAT) communication&#xD;
      training (NR011455) provides preliminary data for this CHATO pilot. CHAT decreased staff&#xD;
      elderspeak that reduced resident RTC and increased staff awareness of elderspeak's negative&#xD;
      effects. CHAT NHs also saw a significant reduction in psychotropic medication use after the&#xD;
      training versus averaged state rates. Despite the success of CHAT in reducing elderspeak and&#xD;
      RTC, investigators found challenges to educating NH staff that limited participation in CHAT&#xD;
      including turnover, absenteeism, heavy workloads, and personal conflicts. Each CHAT session&#xD;
      was held multiple days and times. Still, as few as 44% of staff in one NH completed at least&#xD;
      two of the three sessions, although this rate is higher than that noted for other NH staff&#xD;
      training programs. Although successful in reducing RTC, the classroom format limits staff&#xD;
      access and participation and feasibility for widespread dissemination. Creative, efficient&#xD;
      approaches are needed to overcome NH staff education barriers. An online web conference&#xD;
      training with multiple NHs as an alternative format was first evaluated for increasing access&#xD;
      and dissemination. However, engagement of individual staff was limited with this approach. To&#xD;
      facilitate dissemination, online CHAT modules (CHATO) were developed to provide the same CHAT&#xD;
      content with asynchronous and independent access for busy NH staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI worked with an instructional designer, item writer, and media team to transition CHAT&#xD;
      content, including 20 video clips of NH staff-resident interactions, to the online CHATO&#xD;
      modules. Scripts from the original CHAT were narrated to maintain content, integrating adult&#xD;
      learning theories and principles for online learning, and eliminating a need for advanced&#xD;
      literacy skills. Interactive scenario and game-based activities engage staff. For example,&#xD;
      participants watch a video clip, select problem communication in the transcript, type their&#xD;
      improved communication, and compare it to suggested corrections. Moderated online discussions&#xD;
      are included in the modules that are supported on Training-Source.org, a free and publicly&#xD;
      available learning portal. IT functionality and content equivalency of the newly developed&#xD;
      CHATO online modules was demonstrated by a convenient university-affiliated sample of nurses,&#xD;
      CNAs, and students with NH experience. Although the group testing CHATO may not represent all&#xD;
      NH staff, findings confirm that CHATO is feasible and comparable in content and effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While CHAT effectively reduced RTC, the in-person classroom format required an onsite&#xD;
      interventionist, which limits accessibility and feasibility for dissemination. A pilot test&#xD;
      of acceptability and preliminary efficacy of online CHATO modules is the next logical step.&#xD;
      The pilot will prepare for a pragmatic clinical trial that will test the effects of improved&#xD;
      staff communication (from CHATO) on resident BPSD and effects on psychotropic medication use.&#xD;
      This research will address the gap in rigorous trials testing nonpharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to decrease BPSD that also identify strategies to improve intervention&#xD;
      dissemination. The goal is to increase access to CHATO training, as a tool to reduce BPSD and&#xD;
      inappropriate psychotropic medication use to improve dementia care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The R61 will prepare for the R01 pragmatic trial by establishing feasibility of online&#xD;
      modules and preliminary efficacy of CHATO with NH staff. The research design is a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. One NH will provide initial feasibility testing. Any modifications to the&#xD;
      modules will be made. Then 6 nursing homes (estimated N=150 staff) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to intervention or wait-list control groups. The primary outcome will be knowledge gain for&#xD;
      staff completing CHATO training. Additional outcomes include resident quality measures&#xD;
      related to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) on both resident and&#xD;
      facility levels and facility level data related to inappropriate use of psychotropic&#xD;
      medications to control BPSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff Knowledge Gain. At time 1, nursing home staff in both groups will complete baseline&#xD;
      pre-tests of knowledge and rating of communication. The immediate intervention group will&#xD;
      then complete the online CHATO modules within a one-month period. This includes assessments&#xD;
      of post-test knowledge, communication rating, program evaluation, and diffusion of innovation&#xD;
      surveys at Time 2. Also, at Time 2, the wait-list control group will repeat the pre-tests of&#xD;
      knowledge and communication rating and will then complete the CHATO online module training&#xD;
      over a one-month period, followed by Time 3 collection of post-test knowledge, communication&#xD;
      rating, program evaluation, and diffusion of innovation surveys. Knowledge gain and&#xD;
      communication rating data will be compared between the intervention and wait-list control&#xD;
      groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training. The immediate and&#xD;
      wait-list groups will be compared at baseline to identify important covariates for analyses&#xD;
      of changes in outcomes. Changes in knowledge from Time 1 (baseline) to Time 2 will be&#xD;
      compared between immediate and wait-list groups using model estimates obtained with a linear&#xD;
      mixed model (LMM) approach to account for repeated measures and clustering within nursing&#xD;
      homes. Next, pre- to post-training changes in knowledge will be combined for immediate and&#xD;
      wait-list groups and also tested using LMM approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resident Quality Measure Outcomes. In addition, nursing homes in both groups will provide&#xD;
      monthly summary reports for behavioral symptom occurrence for the facility (in aggregate as&#xD;
      well as for individual residents [deidentified]). A nursing home aggregate antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication use report will also be collected and analyzed. The BPSD and medication reports&#xD;
      will be provided for the one-month period before baseline data collection and for each month&#xD;
      thereafter until the post-training assessment of the wait-listed nursing homes is completed&#xD;
      (a total of seven months for both groups). Resident outcomes data will be compared between&#xD;
      the intervention and wait-list control groups and within nursing homes before and after the&#xD;
      CHATO training. Initially, seven months of data will be plotted to examine changes in nursing&#xD;
      homes and resident outcomes. Pre- to post-training differences will be compared between&#xD;
      immediate and wait-listed groups with a LMM approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Strategies and Process Evaluation. An Implementation Toolkit for NHs and a&#xD;
      CHATO Training Manual have been created to provide support and implementation suggestions to&#xD;
      pilot nursing homes. Several consultants provided feedback and additional resources to be&#xD;
      included in these materials. Each NH will be given a three-month period to complete the CHATO&#xD;
      training. One month for orientation, team development, and planning, one month to complete&#xD;
      the three-week training, and one month for staff recognition and follow up. The CHATO&#xD;
      Research Team will meet with the NH leadership at the beginning and end of this three-month&#xD;
      period, manage CHATO training virtual discussion board, and provide technical assistance as&#xD;
      necessary. The process evaluation includes an online implementation survey which identifies&#xD;
      the strategies NHs used to implement the training and includes the Artifacts of Culture&#xD;
      survey. The survey uses the Diffusion of Innovation framework and mirrors the Implementation&#xD;
      Toolkit. Additional process evaluation activities include: Leadership phone interviews&#xD;
      completed by the consultants and external evaluators at LeadingAge and open-ended questions&#xD;
      asked of direct care staff in the CHATO virtual discussion.&#xD;
