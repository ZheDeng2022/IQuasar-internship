  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimorbidity (i.e., the coexistence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) is&#xD;
      increasingly recognized as a pressing public health problem. Effective interventions&#xD;
      targeting coexisting depression and obesity are critical given the high prevalence and&#xD;
      worsened outcomes for patients with both conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENGAGE-2 is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      outcomes and mechanisms of an integrated depression and obesity intervention that combines&#xD;
      collaborative stepped depression treatment and evidence-based behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      treatment. The Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight-2 (I-CARE2) intervention&#xD;
      synergistically integrates 2 proven national programs: the Program to Encourage Active and&#xD;
      Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression care and the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program&#xD;
      for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 of the ENGAGE project, investigators developed a new protocol to quantify&#xD;
      activation and connectivity of the Affective, Cognitive Control, and Default Mode brain&#xD;
      circuits from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among 108 depressed obese&#xD;
      patients. Investigators implement the same fMRI protocol in this second phase of the project&#xD;
      to examine the mechanistic role of these brain circuits as potential neural targets in&#xD;
      treatment engagement and response in the I-CARE2 intervention. A new sample of 105 depressed&#xD;
      obese patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the I-CARE2 intervention (n=70) or&#xD;
      usual care (n=35). Study assessments occur at 0 (baseline), 2 and 6 months. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that 1 or more of the neural targets under study will moderate (baseline state)&#xD;
      and/or mediate (change at follow-up) the effect of the I-CARE2 intervention versus usual care&#xD;
      on health behaviors (problem-solving ability, dietary intakes, physical activity) and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (weight loss, depression, anxiety).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study are adult patients with comorbid depression and obesity from&#xD;
      outpatient clinics in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UI&#xD;
      Health). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive intervention or usual care&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The I-CARE2 intervention synergistically integrates the PEARLS program for depression care&#xD;
      the GLB program for weight loss. The PEARLS program provides problem-solving therapy (PST) as&#xD;
      first-line for treating depression, with as-needed antidepressant medication intensification.&#xD;
      Adapted from the original Diabetes Prevention Program, the GLB program promotes healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle change for weight loss and increased physical activity. For combination treatment,&#xD;
      the I-CARE2 intervention provides 9 individual counseling sessions (4 weekly, 2 biweekly, and&#xD;
      then 3 monthly; 1 hour each) and participant self-study materials (GLB videos, handouts,&#xD;
      weight and activity tracking) over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the funding mechanism for this project, the specific aim of the ENGAGE-2 pilot&#xD;
      study is to test the degree to which engaging the validated self-regulation target(s)&#xD;
      produces desired behavior change important for weight management and mood.&#xD;

Correlation between the SD short form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, hypothesized to measure similar attributes) is 0.83 and correlation between the SRI short form and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS, hypothesized to measure a related but slightly different construct, the propensity to doze during activities) is 0.46, similar to the correlations between the SD full banks and PSQI (0.85) and between SRI full banks and the ESS (0.45).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress is measured using Perceived stress scale (PSS). PSS measures the perception of stress (i.e., the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful). PSS contains 14 items, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often.&quot; After reversing the scores on 7 positive items, a sum of score is calculated with higher score indicating higher perceived stress. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.84 to 0.86.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability is measured using Sheehan Disability Scale. The Sheehan Disability Scale is a validated questionnaire that measures functional disability and is sensitive to treatment effects in clinical trials. Patients rate the extent to which their symptoms impair work/school, social, and family life on a visual analog scale from0 to 10 and answer the number of days when their symptoms cause them to miss work/school and be unproductive at work/school.</description>

    <measure>Generic health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Generic health related quality of life is measured using SF-8 Health Survey. The SF-8 is an 8-item version of the SF-36 that measures overall health-related quality of life. Physical and mental health composite scores are computed using the scores of 8 questions and range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the lowest level of health and 100 indicating the highest level of health. Correlation between the SF-8 and the SF-36 is 0.825 for physical health component and 0.881 for mental health component.</description>
