      This is a Phase 2 prospective, open-label treatment study of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      MT1621 in TK2 deficient patients who participated in the retrospective Study MT-1621-101.&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated with dC/dT and did not participate in MT-1621-101 may also be&#xD;
      allowed to enroll with Sponsor approval. There is also a sub-study being conducted at one&#xD;
      site in Spain that allows for inclusion of patients who previously discontinued dC/dT&#xD;
      treatment due to elevated liver transaminases under a different titration, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and safety monitoring schedule. For all patients, it is important to ensure that collection&#xD;
      of clinical and functional measurements prior to treatment with dC/dT are sufficient to serve&#xD;
      as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating safety and efficacy.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 2 prospective, open-label treatment study of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      MT1621 in TK2 deficient patients who participated in the retrospective Study MT-1621-101.&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated with dC/dT and did not participate in MT-1621-101 may also be&#xD;
      allowed to enroll with Sponsor approval. There is also a sub-study being conducted at one&#xD;
      site in Spain that allows for inclusion of patients who previously discontinued dC/dT&#xD;
      treatment due to elevated liver transaminases under a different titration, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and safety monitoring schedule. For all patients, it is important to ensure that collection&#xD;
      of clinical and functional measurements prior to treatment with dC/dT are sufficient to serve&#xD;
      as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment into this study, patients will transition from their current chemical-grade&#xD;
      dC/dT or dCMP/dTMP to the same dose of MT1621, or continue use of MT1621 at their current&#xD;
      dose (by weight), up to a maximum of 400 mg/kg/day. Patients who are on a dose &lt;400 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      dC/dT or dCMP/dTMP will initiate treatment with MT1621 at the same dose (by weight), and the&#xD;
      Investigator will have the options of continuing at this dose or escalating to a higher dose,&#xD;
      with the highest dose being 400 mg/kg/day MT1621. The dose may be reduced for tolerability&#xD;
      reasons. Sub-study patients will initiate the study at 130 mg/kg/day MT1621 and be titrated&#xD;
      monthly, up to a maximum of 400 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be assessed upon enrollment, at 1 month, every 3 months through 18&#xD;
      months, every 6 months through 36 months, then annually thereafter, and at end of study&#xD;
      participation. For sub-study patients, safety will also be assessed at Month 2 and one week&#xD;
      after each new dose level. For patients who did not participate in Study MT-1621-101,&#xD;
      specific assessments for each patient will be determined by the Sponsor in discussion with&#xD;
      the Investigator based on data collected as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating&#xD;
      safety and efficacy. MT1621 should be administered with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate sparse PK sampling at steady state using sparse sampling methodology.&#xD;
      For sub-study patients, PK sampling will be done on Day 1 of administration of each new dose&#xD;
      level and after 4 weeks of treatment at the patient's highest dose level. PK sampling will&#xD;
      also be collected 1 week after starting each new dose level.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent by the parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR)&#xD;
             and/or assent by the patient (when applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmed genetic mutation in the TK2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Absence of other genetic disease or polygenic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current treatment with nucleos(t)ides for TK2 deficiency. Patients who were not&#xD;
             previously enrolled in MT 1621 101 will require Sponsor approval to ensure that&#xD;
             collection of clinical and functional measurements prior to treatment are sufficient&#xD;
             to serve as baseline assessments for purposes of evaluating safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients must not be breastfeeding, have a negative pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
             (females ≥10 years old), and have no intention to become pregnant during the course of&#xD;
             the study. Female patients who are of childbearing potential (ie, following menarche&#xD;
             until ≥1 year post-menopausal if not anatomically and physiologically incapable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant) must agree and commit to the use of highly effective methods of&#xD;
             birth control for the duration of the study and for 30 days after the end of the&#xD;
             study. Acceptable methods are defined as those that result, alone or in combination,&#xD;
             in a low failure rate (ie, &lt;1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as&#xD;
             surgical sterilization, an intrauterine device, or hormonal contraception in&#xD;
             combination with a barrier method. In certain countries (if permitted by law), women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential may instead agree to abide by heterosexual sexual abstinence&#xD;
             during the study and for 30 days after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male patients with sexual partners should use condoms for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug to prevent passing study drug to the&#xD;
             partner in the ejaculate. Male participants should be advised not to donate sperm for&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to maintain current treatment regimen and current exercise regimen for the&#xD;
             duration of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness to comply with the study protocol, including but not limited to, all study&#xD;
             procedures, study visits, and study drug compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of liver disease, or liver function test results (ALT, AST, or total&#xD;
             bilirubin) ≥2× upper limit of normal without prior Sponsor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other significant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Study&#xD;
             Sponsor, may confound interpretation of the clinical course of TK2 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sub-Study Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent by the parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR)&#xD;
             and/or assent by the patient (when applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmed genetic mutation in the TK2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Absence of other genetic disease or polygenic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Discontinued treatment with chemical grade dC/dT in Study MT-1621-101 because of&#xD;
             clinically concerning elevations of liver function test values, after both initial&#xD;
             dosing and after a temporary discontinuation and rechallenges with dC/dT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients must not be breastfeeding, have a negative pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
             (females ≥10 years old), and have no intention to become pregnant during the course of&#xD;

             procedures, study visits, and study drug compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sub-Study Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Abnormal liver function, defined as: History of meeting Hy's Law criteria (as&#xD;
             described in the FDA DILI Guidance), liver function test results (ALT, AST, or TBL) ≥2&#xD;
             x ULN at or within 3 months of baseline, or any known underlying hepatic conditions,&#xD;
             without prior Sponsor approval. Note: Patients meeting Hy's Law criteria should be&#xD;
