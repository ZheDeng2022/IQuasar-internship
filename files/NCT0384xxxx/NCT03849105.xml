      A multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, dose-finding phase I/II study to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, dosing schedule, and preliminary efficacy of carrier-added&#xD;
      4-L-[131I]iodo-phenylalanine (131I-IPA), administered as single or repetitive injections in&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first dose level of 2 GBq, 131I-IPA will be administered in one of three different&#xD;
      dosing regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single dose regimen (1f group): Full 131I-IPA activity (2.0 GBq at the 2 GBq dose level)&#xD;
           will be administered 1- 3 days prior to 1st XRT as a single injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fractionated dose regimen (3f - parallel group): 131I-IPA activity will be administered&#xD;
           in 3 fractions corresponding to ⅓ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0 GBq dose&#xD;
           level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above, 1- 3 days prior to&#xD;
&#xD;
           1st XRT. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA fractions will be administered after 5-9 XRT fractions&#xD;
           (subject to investigator's discretion and day of IMP administration) following the&#xD;
           previous 131I-IPA fraction. The remainder of XRT fractions will be given following the&#xD;
           3rd 131I-IPA fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fractionated dose regimen (3f - sequential group): 131I-IPA activity will be&#xD;
           administered in 3 fractions corresponding to ⅓ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0&#xD;
           GBq dose level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above 1- 3 days&#xD;
           prior to 1st XRT. The 2nd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered after all 18 XRT&#xD;
           fractions have been completed, and the 3rd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered 1 week&#xD;
           after the 2nd 131I-IPA fraction. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA injections should be given on&#xD;
           the same day of the week, and some hours after administration of the respective XRT dose&#xD;
           of that day. The day of IMP administration is subject to change at investigator's&#xD;
           discretion. The three different treatment groups at the first (2.0 GBq) dose level&#xD;
           (131I-IPA single dose 1f and 131I-IPA fractionated dose either 3f parallel or 3f&#xD;
           sequential) will be recruited in parallel, as appropriate. Patients will be allocated to&#xD;
           one of the three IPA dosing regimens. N=3 patients will be enrolled for each of the&#xD;
           three treatment schedules. A 10th patient can be added to any of the three groups, in&#xD;
           order to corroborate evidence for possible differences in safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the entry dose level of 2 GBq will undergo 131I-IPA brain SPECT for tumour&#xD;
      dosimetry (performed in all patients), whole body planar imaging for determination of&#xD;
      biodistribution and whole body safety dosimetry. In addition, these patients will be&#xD;
      comparatively assessed for possible differences in safety and/or efficacy among the different&#xD;
      dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation beyond 2 GBq will be made using the fractionated dosing regimen only, unless&#xD;
      the outcome of the 2 GBq dose level suggests otherwise. The best treatment schedule (3f&#xD;
      parallel or 3f sequential, see above) for higher doses shall be selected after completion of&#xD;
      the 2 GBq dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be made in steps of 2.0 GBq, i.e. 4.0 (3*1.33 GBq), 6.0 GBq (3*2.0 GBq),&#xD;
      up to 8.0 GBq (3*2.67 GBq) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, using cohorts&#xD;
      of N=3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MTD has not been reached at 8.0 GBq, dose escalation may further proceed, increasing the&#xD;
      dose fractions to a total dose 131I- IPA greater than 8 GBq using cohorts of N=3 as follows:&#xD;
      10 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3*3.33 GBq); 12 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3*4 GBq), etc., until MTD is reached or until&#xD;
      a satisfactory anti-neoplastic efficacy is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of possible anti-neoplastic effects during dose escalation, only amino&#xD;
      acid-based molecular imaging (preferably 18F-FET-PET) will be used, which allows assessment&#xD;
      of treatment-induced changes based on a single post-therapeutic imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTD is defined as the dose level, inducing dose limiting toxicity (DLT), in not more than 1/6&#xD;
      of the subjects receiving such dose. MTD will be determined on day 45 from the first IPA&#xD;
      injection. DLT is defined as grade 4 neurotoxicity or any other grade 4 toxicity according to&#xD;
      NCI-CTC (version 4.03). If DLT is observed in 1 subject of a cohort, 3 additional patients&#xD;
      will be treated at the same dose level, under which such toxicity occurred. If one or more of&#xD;
      these patients (i.e. 2/4, 2/5 or 2/6) experience grade 4 toxicity, MTD will have been&#xD;
      exceeded for the respective dose level. In such a case, 3 additional patients will be treated&#xD;
      at the preceding dose level. Therapy-induced early necrosis, (also termed pseudo-progression,&#xD;
      which has been associated with improved survival will not be classified as DLT if&#xD;
      asymptomatic, or if symptomatic and at least partially reversible within three months with or&#xD;
      without therapy. Disease progression/PsPD will be diagnosed according to the current RANO&#xD;
      criteria (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest dose under which no more than 1/6 of the patients experience DLT will be declared&#xD;
      the MTD level. Safety, tolerability and evidence of anti-tumour effects will be compared&#xD;
      between all dose levels, in order to identify a most suitable dose level (MSDL) for the phase&#xD;
      II part. The MSDL will not necessarily be identical to the MTD, but might be selected by&#xD;
      jointly considering efficacy, safety and radiation protection aspects. The identification of&#xD;
      the MSDL will be made by a Drug Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), based on an integrated&#xD;
      review of efficacy and safety from the first part. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the&#xD;
      first part results, the DSMB will make a conclusion regarding safety and efficacy, and&#xD;
      recommend to the sponsor a dosing strategy and dose level (MSDL) for the phase II part, if&#xD;
      merited. Prior to initiating phase II, the sponsor commits to submit a substantial amendment,&#xD;
      containing a summary of the phase I results to the Austrian BASG, other competent&#xD;
      authorities, and the responsible Ethics Committee, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon establishment of the MSDL, 12-22 further patients will be treated at the MSDL (Phase&#xD;
      II). If unequivocal evidence of efficacy is observed, another 10 patients shall be included&#xD;
      in the phase II part. It is planned to include approximately 34 (22+12) patients with&#xD;
      recurrent GBM with the option to extend phase II study by another 10 patients if the results&#xD;
      are encouraging (22+22 patients).&#xD;
