  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 (erbB-2/neu) is a member of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family. ERBB2 gene which&#xD;
      encodes human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is a major proliferative driver activating&#xD;
      downstream signaling through PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK. HER2 overexpression or gene amplification&#xD;
      is associated with sensitivity to trastuzumab and lapatinib in breast cancer. Among actual&#xD;
      lung cancer biomarker, HER2 remains apart. HER2 involvement is known for a long time but&#xD;
      clinical research has been stopped for many years since the first clinical trials in&#xD;
      unselected patients were negative. Recently trastuzumab + pertuzumab + docetaxel has been&#xD;
      tested for first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA trial).&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary end point showed that patients who received pertuzumab, trastuzumab,&#xD;
      and docetaxel (pertuzumab group) had a significantly longer median progression-free survival,&#xD;
      as assessed by independent reviewers an did those who received placebo, trastuzumab, and&#xD;
      docetaxel (control group) (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.62). There is thus a&#xD;
      strong rational for treating HER2 mutated lung cancer patient with these drugs.&#xD;

             Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),&#xD;
             including any female who has undergone:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Or who is post-menopausal:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total&#xD;
                  cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in&#xD;
                  questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an&#xD;
                  estradiol value &lt;40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrolment due to the potential for&#xD;
                  inhibition of cytochrome enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins. For&#xD;
                  most forms of HRT, at least 2 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT&#xD;
                  and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the&#xD;
                  type and dosage of HRT. If a female subject is determined not to be&#xD;
                  post-menopausal, they must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately&#xD;
                  below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to&#xD;
             the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception during the study&#xD;
             and for at least 7 months after the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
             Contraceptive methods acceptable to IFCT, when used consistently and in accordance&#xD;
             with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A non-hormonal intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1%&#xD;
                  per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is&#xD;
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to&#xD;
                  investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 7 months&#xD;
                  after the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly,&#xD;
                  foam suppository or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm&#xD;
                  with spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Oral contraceptives are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for&#xD;
             15 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. A male with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and&#xD;
             participate in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence&#xD;
             during the study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a&#xD;
             beneficiary of social security insurance.&#xD;
