  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eBACH is a randomized intervention to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on brain&#xD;
      structure and function, as well as to determine how exercise-induced training effects relate&#xD;
      to cardiovascular function via related brain changes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To determine the neurobiology of exercise and cardiovascular factors: (1A) Body- to&#xD;
      -Brain hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in peripheral markers of cardiovascular health&#xD;
      (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, peripheral vascular function) will precede and partly&#xD;
      explain (statistically mediate) some of the exercise -induced changes in functional and&#xD;
      structural features of areas defining visceral control circuits. (1B) Brain- to -Body&#xD;
      hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in functional and structural features of areas defining&#xD;
      visceral control circuits precede and partly explain (statistically mediate) consequent&#xD;
      changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine mediators of cardiovascular function that are under&#xD;
      neural regulation, including baro-reflex sensitivity and heart rate variability. Aim 2: To&#xD;
      determine the neurobiology of exercise self--reported correlates of cardiovascular function:&#xD;
      (2A) Exercise will induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks, and these changes will partly explain exercise- induced&#xD;
      reductions in cardiovascular responsivity to challenges in daily life. (2B) Exercise will&#xD;
      induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by an functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) emotion processing and regulation paradigm, and these changes will partly explain&#xD;
      exercise- induced improvements in affect measured in daily life by EMA and by conventional&#xD;
      self- report instruments. The public health significance of this research is that it is&#xD;
      designed to more precisely define and refine neurobiological targets to improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular function and health.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>150 individuals between the ages of 26 and 58 will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; Aerobic Exercise group or Physical Activity and Health Information group. The aerobic group will meet 2 times a week for 60 minutes over a 12-month period. Both groups will be asked to wear activity monitors every 6 weeks. Both groups will have fitness testing and cardiovascular assessments completed at baseline, 6 months (optional) and following the completion of the 12-month intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Neither the investigator, nor outcomes assessors will know participants' group assignment. Participants will be instructed to refrain from speaking about their group's activities when visiting the lab for 6 month (if applicable) and follow-up assessments.In addition, special care was taken to ensure that non-blinded laboratory staff (i.e. staff member notifying participants of their group assignments, staff monitoring the intervention) are not located in the same proximity in the laboratory, further preventing accidental unblinding.</masking_description>

    <description>Guidelines for exercise programming (ACSM, 2018) will be followed including a warm up and cool down, progressive and gradual increments in duration, and instruction regarding avoidance of physical activity related injury. The exercise group will receive moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 60 minutes per day, twice a week, for 12 months. They will also exercise on their own for 30 minutes, 1 time a week, for 12 months. This gives a total of 3 exercise sessions a week. The prescribed intensity will be based on their maximal fitness testing heart rate and then calculated per a research grade method. They will maintain a minimum heart rate from their specific calculation that will be monitored by Polar Heart Rate straps.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age - individuals aged 26-58 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gender &amp; Ethnicity - men and women are both eligible to participate. The eBACH study&#xD;
             expects the study population to be approximately 50% women. All ethnic groups are&#xD;
             eligible for the study. The eBACH study expects the study population to be&#xD;
             approximately 30% minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ambulation - study participants must be able to walk without pain or use of an&#xD;
             assisted walking device. This will be determined during the initial phone screen.&#xD;
             Ambulation will also be assessed in person as the potential subject must be able to&#xD;
             complete the VO2 Max test on a treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical Activity Level - all participants must exercise less than 100 minutes per&#xD;
             week and have a VO2max percentile level less than 75 based on the ACSM Guidelines for&#xD;
             Exercise Testing (10th edition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residency - Since the intervention is 12 months in duration, all potential&#xD;
             participants must reside in the Pittsburgh area and plan on residing in the area for&#xD;
             at least one year after randomization. It is recommended that the study coordinator&#xD;
             during the second screen assess potential participants' distance from the exercising&#xD;
             sites since the study requires 2 visits per week. The further a participant is from an&#xD;
             intervention site, the higher the probability they will be unable to adhere to the&#xD;
             protocol. In addition, participants must have reliable transportation to complete the&#xD;
             outcome measures and the intervention requirements. Questions related to these&#xD;
             considerations are asked during the phone screen and should also be assessed during&#xD;
             the baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to be randomized - To be eligible, all potential study participants must&#xD;
             be willing to be randomized to either of the intervention arms. Individuals that&#xD;
             insist on participating only if they can choose which arm they belong to should not be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or plans to become pregnant over the next year - any woman who is&#xD;
             pregnant via the pregnancy test at the baseline visit will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
