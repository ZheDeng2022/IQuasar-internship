      This study deploys a novel digital pill with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (TDF/FTC) among MSM with&#xD;
      substance use to monitor PrEP adherence. The investigators will enroll N=15 HIV uninfected&#xD;
      MSM with self reported substance use who are on PrEP or initiating PrEP to use digital pills&#xD;
      over encapsulating TDF/FTC for 3 months. The investigators will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      using digital pills in this study population as well as understand the acceptability of&#xD;
      digital pills for adherence measurement using semi-structured individual interviews.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will measure adherence over time, as well as episodes of&#xD;
      suboptimal PrEP adherence.&#xD;

      Eligible study participants will be screened and enrolled at Fenway Health (Boston, MA).&#xD;
      Participants will complete a quantitative assessment on their history fo substance use,&#xD;
      sexual risk and PrEP adherence, and be trained to use the digital pill for 90 days and&#xD;
      instructed to take PrEP daily during the course of the study. Participants will return each&#xD;
      month for a study visit to assess their use of the technology. At study visit 1 and 3, we&#xD;
      will obtain dried blood spots (DBS) to measure drug levels and to confirm adherence detected&#xD;
      by the digital pill. The investigators will also obtain drugs of abuse screens from DBS. At&#xD;
      the final study visit (3 months), participants will undergo a semi-structured qualitative&#xD;
      interview to understand the user response to digital pills.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of Digital Pills to Measure PrEP Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' engagement with the digital pill system (DPS) was measured over the 90-day study period. The percentages for the total expected ingestions recorded by DPS each month were compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digital Pill Performance - Number of Recorded Ingestions</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The total number recorded ingestions recorded by the digital pill system (DPS) - which included both the number of Reader-detected and manually-reported ingestions - was collected. The Reader-detected ingestions count was used to reflect the number of times the DPS was operated correctly. Successful DPS operation was defined as ingestion of a digital pill, proper use of the wearable Reader, and confirmation of the ingestion on both the Reader and the app. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digital Pill Performance - System Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of the digital pill system (DPS) in measuring PrEP adherence. To analyze the performance of the DPS, the ground truth of PrEP ingestion events was defined as the pill counts obtained each month (i.e., the number of unused pills returned, subtracted from the number of pills previously dispensed). The number of DPS-recorded ingestions - which included the number of both Reader-detected and manually-reported ingestions - was compared with the aggregate pill count at each monthly timepoint; this was defined as the overall performance metric for the DPS. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digital Pill Performance - Manually Reported Ingestions</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of manually reported ingestions was collected. The percentages for instances of manually reported ingestions were calculated. The two instances for manually recording ingestions included, a lack of engagement with the Reader or failure to use the Reader properly, and when reported ingestion was not detected by the Reader despite supporting use metrics indicating proper Reader use. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digital Pill Performance - Successful Operation of System</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of instances in which ingestions were successfully detected by the Reader (i.e., the radio frequency emitter was activated, and the ingestion was recorded by the DPS) was collected. The total number of instances in which manually reported ingestions were not detected by the Reader, despite supporting use metrics (e.g., accelerometer data) indicating proper Reader use was also collected. These counts were combined and interpreted as the number of times that the DPS was operated correctly. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dried Blood Spot Correlation With Digital Pill Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>We dichotomized TFV-DP levels using a cutoff of ≥700 fmol/punch to indicate at least four doses of PrEP ingested per week. Using TFV-DP in DBS &lt;700 vs ≥700 fmol/punch as a dichotomous variable, and considering the granular continuous adherence data from the digital pill, we then calculated a point biserial correlation between TFV-DP in DBS and digital pill adherence. Additionally, drug concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate as measured in dried blood spot collection at months one and three were compared to DPS-recorded PrEP adherence.</description>

        <title>Feasibility of Digital Pills to Measure PrEP Adherence</title>
        <description>Participants' engagement with the digital pill system (DPS) was measured over the 90-day study period. The percentages for the total expected ingestions recorded by DPS each month were compared.</description>
        <time_frame>Months 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
        <population>One participant was temporarily lost to follow-up, so they were excluded from analysis.&#xD;
In Month 1, the total number of DPS-recorded ingestion events (411) exceeded the total expected ingestion events from pill counts (402), as a result of one participant returning nine more unused pills than anticipated at the end of the month. The total expected ingestions for Month 1 is listed as 411 in the table below for clarity.</population>

          <population>One participant was temporarily lost to follow-up, so they were excluded from analysis.&#xD;
In Month 1, the total number of DPS-recorded ingestion events (411) exceeded the total expected ingestion events from pill counts (402), as a result of one participant returning nine more unused pills than anticipated at the end of the month. The total expected ingestions for Month 1 is listed as 411 in the table below for clarity.</population>

        <description>The total number recorded ingestions recorded by the digital pill system (DPS) - which included both the number of Reader-detected and manually-reported ingestions - was collected. The Reader-detected ingestions count was used to reflect the number of times the DPS was operated correctly. Successful DPS operation was defined as ingestion of a digital pill, proper use of the wearable Reader, and confirmation of the ingestion on both the Reader and the app. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>

        <description>Accuracy of the digital pill system (DPS) in measuring PrEP adherence. To analyze the performance of the DPS, the ground truth of PrEP ingestion events was defined as the pill counts obtained each month (i.e., the number of unused pills returned, subtracted from the number of pills previously dispensed). The number of DPS-recorded ingestions - which included the number of both Reader-detected and manually-reported ingestions - was compared with the aggregate pill count at each monthly timepoint; this was defined as the overall performance metric for the DPS. Cumulative data collected at months 1, 2, and 3 are reported in the data table below.</description>

        <title>Dried Blood Spot Correlation With Digital Pill Adherence</title>
        <description>We dichotomized TFV-DP levels using a cutoff of ≥700 fmol/punch to indicate at least four doses of PrEP ingested per week. Using TFV-DP in DBS &lt;700 vs ≥700 fmol/punch as a dichotomous variable, and considering the granular continuous adherence data from the digital pill, we then calculated a point biserial correlation between TFV-DP in DBS and digital pill adherence. Additionally, drug concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate as measured in dried blood spot collection at months one and three were compared to DPS-recorded PrEP adherence.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>(1) Most participants were White and well-educated, limiting generalizability. (2) Opportunities for technical DPS improvements arose during the study, which required some participants to temporarily manually record doses. (3) The assay utilized for TFV-DP has not been cross-validated and may result in errors in assayed concentration of TFV-DP. (4) Reliance on pill counts may have decreased the measured accuracy of the DPS among participants who did not return unused pills each month.</limitations_and_caveats>
