  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to measure plasma levels of bupivacaine following&#xD;
      erector spinae (ESP) regional block in patients undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most frequent types of cancer in women. Mastectomy is important&#xD;
      in treating these cases; however, sometimes it is associated with acute and chronic pain.&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia, combining drug therapy and regional anesthesia, can help in preventing&#xD;
      acute and perhaps chronic pain in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae block is a new regional anesthesia technique that has emerged to treat&#xD;
      thoracic pain following thoracic and breast surgery. It consists of injecting local&#xD;
      anesthetics in the space located between the erector and paravertebral muscles using&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. The injection can be done at the level of T5 allowing distribution of&#xD;
      the drug to upper and lower dermatomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of local anesthetic injected after erector spinae block should aim to maximize&#xD;
      analgesia while minimizing the chance of toxic systemic concentrations. Defining the rate of&#xD;
      absorption of local anesthetics into the blood after an erector spinae block will therefore&#xD;
      help anesthesiologists determinate optimal analgesic doses, in terms of both safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will determine bupivacaine pharmacokinetics after single shot&#xD;
      erector spinae block with bupivacaine, to further define the right dose and duration of&#xD;
      surveillance in post-anesthesia care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the erector spinae block, the patient will be placed in the sitting position. Using an&#xD;
      ultrasound machine with a high frequency linear probe (Sonosite, HFL50 15-6MHz) placed in the&#xD;
      parasagittal plane, 3cm away from the midline, the anesthesiologist will position an&#xD;
      insulated hyperechoic needle (50-80 mm, 22 gauge, SonoPlex STIM, Nanoline, Pajun, Germany) at&#xD;
      the level of the 5th thoracic vertebrae, between the erector spinae and the paravertebral&#xD;
      muscles. The anesthesiologist will confirm the correct position of the needle with the&#xD;
      injection of 1 mL of 5% dextrose. Then, after negative aspiration, he will inject bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.5% with epinephrine 5 mcg/mL in 5 ml aliquots for a total dose of 2mg/kg of ideal body&#xD;
      weight (maximum of 150mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of injection will be considered as T0. Collection of 4.5mL of blood will be performed&#xD;
      at T10min, T20min, T30min, T45min, T60min, T90min, T120min, T180min, and T240min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tubes will be immediately placed on ice to be ultimately sent to the laboratory for&#xD;
      centrifugation and measurement of bupivacaine level using liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for each of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will then be induced in the operating room with no additional bupivacaine&#xD;
      allowed by the anesthesiologist or the surgeon. After surgery, in the Post-Anesthesia Care&#xD;
      Unit, the level of the sensory block will be identified by pinprick and the quality of&#xD;
      analgesia will be evaluated using a verbal numerical rating scale, and opioid consumption&#xD;
      will be noted.&#xD;
