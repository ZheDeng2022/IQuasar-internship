    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a new intervention, fluoroquinolone (FQ)&#xD;
      Preprescription Authorization (PPA) strategy, to reduce and prevent Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infection (CDI) in hospital intensive care units (ICUs). The investigators will model a&#xD;
      successful FQ PPA strategy in several Wisconsin ICUs and compare whether the intervention has&#xD;
      improved outcomes in reducing CDIs. An additional goal of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      environmental and work system factors using systems engineering models in order to determine&#xD;
      the most successful way to implement these new strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a&#xD;
      fluoroquinolone (FQ) Preprescription Authorization (PPA) as an antibiotic stewardship (AS)&#xD;
      strategy to target and prevent CDI, promote appropriate antibiotic use, and reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of resistant bacteria. This will contribute to the long-term goal of reducing&#xD;
      the burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which is an essential step in improving&#xD;
      the safety and quality of healthcare. FQ PPA is a particularly promising AS strategy to&#xD;
      reduce CDI. Although FQs are one of the most frequently utilized classes of antibiotics in&#xD;
      inpatient acute care facilities and are closely associated with risk for CDI, FQ usage has&#xD;
      not been the focus of control efforts in endemic settings in the US. The proposed study will&#xD;
      use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 design to simultaneously evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of an FQ PPA intervention to reduce CDI as well as the key considerations for&#xD;
      implementing such an intervention successfully. Intensive care units in acute care hospitals&#xD;
      throughout Wisconsin will participate in this stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The specific aims for the proposed study are to: 1) determine the impact of a FQ PPA&#xD;
      on hospital-onset and healthcare-associated CDI rates and other clinical outcomes compared&#xD;
      with usual care; and 2) evaluate the implementation of FQ PPA using a systems engineering&#xD;
      approach. For aim 1, electronic health record data will be used to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      FQ PPA on hospital-onset and healthcare-associated CDI, as well as other important clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. For aim 2, surveys and interviews with healthcare providers will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the contextual, implementation, and work system factors that contribute to&#xD;
      successful implementation of a FQ PPA intervention. In addition to addressing an urgent need&#xD;
      to identify effective AS strategies, this study will provide a framework to implement and&#xD;
      evaluate other interventions for healthcare-acquired infection (HAI) prevention. Regardless&#xD;
      of the results, the proposed study will generate data, tools and methods with widespread&#xD;
      applicability for AS initiatives in healthcare-associated infection prevention.&#xD;
