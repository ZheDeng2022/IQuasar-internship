  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, representing at least 75% of all&#xD;
      primary malignant brain tumors. Histopathologically, gliomas are classified into different&#xD;
      subgroups including astrocytomas (60-70%), oligodendrogliomas (10-30%), ependymomas (&lt;10%)&#xD;
      and mixed gliomas (i.e. oligoastrocytomas) depending on the cell type from which they&#xD;
      originate. The World Health Organization currently classifies gliomas based on&#xD;
      histopathological analysis in which the presence (or absence) and the degree of specific&#xD;
      histopathological features determines the grade of malignancy. Grade I (pilocytic&#xD;
      astrocytoma) and grade II (diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma,&#xD;
      and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) are termed low-grade gliomas (LGGs), whereas grade III&#xD;
      (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) and&#xD;
      grade IV (glioblastoma) represent high-grade gliomas (HGGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the incurable nature of gliomas, the maintenance or improvement of the patient's&#xD;
      quality of life are extremely important. The benefits of multimodal treatment strategies, in&#xD;
      terms of prolonged survival or delay of progression, have to be carefully balanced against&#xD;
      the side effects of the treatment, which may adversely influence patient's functioning and&#xD;
      well-being during his/her remaining life span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring a brain tumor patients functioning and well-being goes far beyond assessing&#xD;
      (progression-free) survival or tumor response to treatment on imaging. A more integrated way&#xD;
      to measure patients functioning and well-being is the assessment of a patient's&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL is defined as a personal self-assessed ability&#xD;
      to function in the physical, psychological, emotional, and social domains of day-to-day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis&#xD;
      of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma.&#xD;

      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis&#xD;
      of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma and to set up a database which contains&#xD;
      general patient characteristics, tumor information, treatment strategy and follow-up data of&#xD;
      each included patient. This large-scale database will allow the investigator to investigate&#xD;
      several relevant research questions in a well-documented group of glioma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRQOL is a multidimensional concept covering physical, psychological and social domains as&#xD;
      well as symptoms induced by the disease and the treatment. Currently there is no single gold&#xD;
      standard tool to measure HRQOL, and several valid measures of HRQOL in brain tumor patients&#xD;
      are available. In this study the investigator will use the EQ-5D questionnaire to report&#xD;
      patient's HRQOL. The EQ-5D is widely used and has been validated in many different patient&#xD;
      populations. It has been designed so that patients can describe the extent to which they have&#xD;
      a problem in each of the five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities,&#xD;
      pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression The timing of the HRQOL questionnaires will depend on&#xD;
      whether a patient will be diagnosed with either a LGG or a HGG. Moreover, as the current&#xD;
      treatment strategies for LGG patients and for relapsed HGG patients are highly variable, the&#xD;
      investigator scheduled the HRQOL measurements not in function of the treatment, but rather in&#xD;
      function of the classical, standard-of-care patient follow-up (either 3 or 6 monthly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there are missing data for some patients, the question arises as to whether patients&#xD;
      with missing data differ from those who returned completed forms. As a consequence, missing&#xD;
      data presents problems in the analysis and the interpretation of the results. Hence, the&#xD;
      amount of missing data should be minimized. A regular check on missing data will be performed&#xD;
      by the CTA. In case the HRQOL form was not completed by the included patient, the patient&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone or e-mail and he/she will be asked to provide an answer to the&#xD;
      different questions of the HRQOL questionnaire in order to avoid missing data. In case the&#xD;
      patient is unable to complete the HRQOL questionnaire, the CTA will report the reason for&#xD;
      non-completion in the database.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life is assessed using the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Level scale), which has 2 components. The description component measures health status in terms of 5 dimensions; mobility (ability to walk), self-care (ability to wash or dress by oneself), usual activities (performance in work, study, housework, family or leisure activities), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension. Each level of each dimension corresponds to a 1-digit number. All together a 5-digit number describes the patient's health state (3,125 (55) different health states are possible). In the evaluation component, the respondents evaluate their overall health status by valuing health-related quality of life from 0 (corresponding to the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (corresponding to the best health you can imagine).</description>
