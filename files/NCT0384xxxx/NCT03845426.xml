  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Factors affecting the pulpal prognosis of injured teeth. Dental injuries may affect the&#xD;
      survival of teeth. It is recommended to monitor the injured teeth at regular intervals to&#xD;
      ensure that the appropriate treatment is delivered promptly. In order to conclude what&#xD;
      treatment is required, a correct diagnosis must be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, reaching this diagnosis can be difficult as injured teeth often respond erroneously&#xD;
      to many of the diagnostic tests used, thereby affecting our ability to interpret the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to identify the clinical factors that affect the ability of the blood supply&#xD;
      of a tooth to survive an injury. This will help ensure that patients are provided with the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment with the avoidance of delays that may affect the long-term survival of&#xD;
      the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that attend the Edinburgh Dental Institute trauma clinic will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The patients, seen on this clinic, are assessed in regular&#xD;
      intervals in a systematic way, as per accepted and validated international guidelines on the&#xD;
      subject of dental trauma. There are specific investigations and clinical assessments that are&#xD;
      carried out on the initial and each review appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will attempt to identify those teeth that lose their vitality at different points&#xD;
      following the injury and will attempt to link this to the nature of the injury suffered. The&#xD;
      data will be collected from the patients' routine dental trauma assessment and no additional&#xD;
      investigations will be required. As per routine practice the patients are reviewed for one&#xD;
      year following their injury unless otherwise indicated. All responses to the investigations&#xD;
      will be collected and combined to identify the prognostic factors associated with the loss of&#xD;
      vitality of traumatised teeth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dento-alveolar trauma may affect the quality of life of patients and the long term prognosis&#xD;
      of the teeth. Following dental trauma regular monitoring and follow up of the teeth is&#xD;
      required to ensure that the appropriate treatment is delivered promptly. Although there is&#xD;
      information in the literature focused on child and adolescent dental trauma, there is limited&#xD;
      information regarding traumatised permanent teeth. Permanent teeth have differing healing&#xD;
      capacity after injury and this is dependent on the degree of root formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial assessment of patients that have suffered from dental trauma, negative&#xD;
      responses to investigations assessing the health of the vasculature might lead clinicians to&#xD;
      initiate unnecessary and irreversible treatment on traumatised teeth. Equally false positive&#xD;
      results might delay treatment which might have an effect on the outcome, leading to the&#xD;
      development of healing complications such as infection and root resorption. By collecting and&#xD;
      analysing the clinical factors, we aim to identify which of aspects of the assessment might&#xD;
      influence the prognoses of the teeth.&#xD;
