      We propose to explore the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)&#xD;
      therapy in the pain management of postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the addition of TENS therapy to the pain management of women&#xD;
           post-cesarean section leads to less opioid medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of TENS therapy as a means of alternative pain relief for women&#xD;
           post-cesarean section with a history of opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s) We hypothesize that patients that receive TENS therapy&#xD;
      will report lower pain scores and request less opioid medication than the control group. We&#xD;
      anticipate improved control in particular in the group of women with a history of opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we believe that the TENS therapy will show benefits in other postpartum&#xD;
      outcomes including time to bowel movement, level of sedation, and time to out of bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, we anticipate that this pilot study will support the application of TENS therapy in&#xD;
      postpartum pain management.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW. This study is a pilot randomized interventional trial. Two categories of&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to an invention or control group, using a random&#xD;
      number generator: normal cesarean without associated comorbidity, or cesarean in women with a&#xD;
      history of opioid addiction. The control group will receive usual care. The intervention&#xD;
      group will receive usual care plus TENS therapy beginning 8 hours after cesarean section and&#xD;
      continuing to discharge. Both groups will receive medications for pain as requested or&#xD;
      ordered by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PROCEDURES. Patients will be identified for participation in their prenatal visit,&#xD;
      and will be approached for study inclusion. Physicians that have a direct treatment&#xD;
      relationship with the patient will inform the patient about the study and invite them to&#xD;
      enroll. Consent for participation will be reviewed with the principal investigator and signed&#xD;
      prior to delivery hospitalization. Randomization will follow consent, and patients randomized&#xD;
      to intervention will have teaching performed about how to use the device at the time of&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following cesarean delivery, subjects will be re-approached in the Postpartum Unit at Robert&#xD;
      Wood Johnson University Hospital by study staff. The TENS device will be again reviewed, and&#xD;
      provided to the patient, with review of instructions for use. The patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be educated on the proper way to utilize the TENS unit. They will&#xD;
      apply the the patches of the TENS unit around the C-section site. Starting 8 hours after&#xD;
      C-Section, the TENS unit will be turned on and will remain on until the patient is&#xD;
      discharged, to be removed for toilet and showering at the patient's discretion. Once the TENS&#xD;
      unit is applied and turned on, the patient will not have to do anything else to maintain the&#xD;
      therapy. Study staff will provide a record for documentation of time on/off for the unit. On&#xD;
      the day of discharge, study staff will collect the device, and conduct a short survey about&#xD;
      pain score. They will then review pain scores, pain medication usage and other secondary&#xD;
      outcomes in the patient's chart. Finally, pain will be reassessed at the subject's outpatient&#xD;
      postpartum visits by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION. Our research team members will collect the following data points from the&#xD;
      patient's inpatient medical record: pain scale scores, medication requests/prescriptions&#xD;
      (including name, type, and amount), time to first bowel movement, subjective incision&#xD;
      complaints, and time to OOB. Participants will complete a survey before discharge which will&#xD;
      solicit additional information about the postpartum recovery experience with or without TENS&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY. Study duration will be no more than 12 weeks. This will include up to 6&#xD;
      weeks prior to delivery for study approach and consent, delivery hospitalization, and 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum for pain assessments at postpartum visits. There will be no long term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY and SECONDARY ENDPOINTS. Primary endpoint of this pilot study is a total of 10 normal&#xD;
      patients undergoing cesarean, and 10 patients with history of opioid addiction. Intervention&#xD;
      will be performed in 5 patients in each group. Safety data will be reviewed following the&#xD;
      first 10 patients to evaluate for worsening patient scores relative to controls.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot feasibility study to evaluate effectiveness and acceptability in our patient population of TENS use throughout delivery hospitalization. We aim to have 20 participants total: 5 in control and 5 in intervention without history of opioid addiction, and 5 in control and 5 in intervention with history of opioid addiction/misuse. This sample size is comparable to other shorter term pilot studies. This pilot study will serve as the basis for larger trials in the future, with larger sample size powered to demonstrate reduction in pain scores. We anticipate recruitment for this trial will take approximately 6-9 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Starting 8 hours after cesarean section, the TENS unit will be applied with charges above and below the incision. The device will be set to high frequency (&gt;75 Hz) for pain relief. Intensity of stimulation will be set to patient threshold using the forearm as a guide. Stimulation will be turned on titrated to the level which is felt but not painful for the patient. It will remain on until the patient is discharged, to be removed for toilet and showering at the patient's discretion. Once the TENS unit is applied and turned on, the patient will not have to do anything else to maintain the therapy.</description>
