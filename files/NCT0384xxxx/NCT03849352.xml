  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this small study is to assess the feasibility of remotely delivering a diet&#xD;
      and lifestyle intervention following treatment of CRC through telecommunications and digital&#xD;
      technology. A DBCI will be implemented among a population of people living with and beyond&#xD;
      CRC to help identify if patients find this an easy and achievable way to communicate with a&#xD;
      Registered Dietitian. The information gained from this small scale feasibility will be used&#xD;
      to help develop a larger study on supporting people with CRC to make a lifestyle change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty four percent of Colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are thought to be preventable, showing it&#xD;
      has a strong correlation with lifestyle factors. A recent report by the World Cancer Research&#xD;
      Fund and American Institute of Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) on diet, physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      and CRC reported numerous findings linking lifestyle with primary prevention of CRC.&#xD;
      Approximately six out of ten people diagnosed with bowel cancer in England and Wales survive&#xD;
      for 10-years or more and rates of survival have more than doubled in the last 40-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term 'cancer survivors' denotes all people who are living with a diagnosis of cancer, and&#xD;
      those who have recovered from the disease. The term is not universally accepted and survivors&#xD;
      are increasingly being referred to as people 'living with and beyond cancer. This covers a&#xD;
      wide variety of circumstances including people at diagnosis, during and post treatment, and&#xD;
      those with recurrence therefore including people with potentially differing nutritional&#xD;
      needs. People can be struggling with a poor nutritional intake due to treatment side effects&#xD;
      or may need to optimise their nutritional status preoperatively or require advice post&#xD;
      treatment for optimum recovery and rehabilitation. However, compared to the vast amount of&#xD;
      research with respect to CRC incidence there is a paucity of research on diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      factors influencing CRC recurrence and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second WCRF and AICR expert report in 2007 undertook a systematic literature review to&#xD;
      assess the role of food, nutrition and PA in people diagnosed with cancer. The report&#xD;
      included randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating dietary interventions, however, there&#xD;
      were no conclusions drawn. This was attributed to poor quality designs and varying&#xD;
      intervention duration of the studies. The third WCRF and AICR expert report, in 2018, stated&#xD;
      new evidence had accrued since the second report but primarily within breast cancer therefore&#xD;
      a review of the evidence was undertaken in this group leaving a gap in the evidence base with&#xD;
      regard to CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of secondary prevention studies are based on expert conclusion with the third WCRF&#xD;
      recommending survivors who have completed treatment should follow the general advice for&#xD;
      cancer prevention. The current strongest primary prevention evidence is that CRC risk is&#xD;
      decreased by being physically active in addition to a higher consumption of wholegrains,&#xD;
      dietary fibre and dairy products. Risk is increased by the consumption of red and processed&#xD;
      meat, more than two alcoholic drinks per day and being overweight or obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review of the literature of lifestyle interventions in RCTs in people with CRC has&#xD;
      identified 6 published studies (in preparation). The review identified that all current&#xD;
      studies used a variety of dietary and physical activity interventions, data collection tools&#xD;
      and inconsistent timing of interventions commencing from 6 months to 5 years post diagnosis.&#xD;
      None of the published RCTs achieved changes in dietary intake and any small changes that&#xD;
      occurred were not sustainable with participants reverting to their usual dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One conclusion from the review was that no studies used appropriate methods to support&#xD;
      behaviour change such as healthcare professionals trained in behaviour change techniques and&#xD;
      methods of support, for example, digital technology. It has been demonstrated that such&#xD;
      techniques would help support people to make lifestyle changes and from a research&#xD;
      perspective can eliminate administration-intensive tasks, variation in interpretation and&#xD;
      recording errors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion with the PPI group of The Royal Marsden Hospital (NHS Foundation Trust) and&#xD;
      Institute of Cancer Research provided a valuable insight into the variance in opinion as to&#xD;
      when and how people could be asked to make lifestyle changes. The support provided by family&#xD;
      members and / or carers was identified as a critical factor in supporting people to make&#xD;
      lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has recently been an increased interest in the use of digital behaviour change&#xD;
      interventions (DBCIs) and smartphone applications in the healthcare setting, including in the&#xD;
      management of diet, PA and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review of DBCIs amongst cancer survivors identified fifteen studies and&#xD;
      concluded DBCIs can improve PA and Body Mass Index (BMI), in this patient group, with mixed&#xD;
      results for improved dietary behaviours.&#xD;
