  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal surgical approach in functional mitral regurgitation (MI) was questioned in&#xD;
      favour for prosthetic replacement due to the reduced risk of recurrent MI . However,&#xD;
      adjustable mitral rings may provide an alternative . In this first-in-man trial, a novel&#xD;
      balloon-adjustable mitral-ring was assessed regarding clinical safety and feasibility. 5&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled according to the inclusion/ exclusion criteria and subsequently&#xD;
      implanted with the study device. Study visits will be performed preoperatively,&#xD;
      perioperatively, at discharge, at 30 days, 3 months and 6 months. Primary outcome parameter&#xD;
      will be morbidity and mortality at 30 days following implantation.&#xD;

    <description>The Kephalios Device 1 is an adjustable annuloplasty ring, to be implanted by open surgery, having a hollow structure that comprises a flat rigid ring surrounding a deformable cage. The unique feature of the Kephalios Device 1 is that its annular shape and dimension can be finely adjusted percutaneously by an external actuator (three-balloon catheter) independently in the three areas corresponding to P1, P2 and P3</description>
