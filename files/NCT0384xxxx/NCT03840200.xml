    <textblock>
      This is a study in participants with advanced breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer to&#xD;
      investigate the dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ipatasertib in&#xD;
      combination with rucaparib. The study consists of two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1)&#xD;
      in participants with previously treated advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate&#xD;
      cancer and a Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2) in participants with advanced prostate cancer who&#xD;
      have had at least one line of prior therapy with second-generation androgen-receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-targeted agents (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide).&#xD;

      There are two parts in the study. A Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) in participants with&#xD;
      previously treated advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer. There will be&#xD;
      a 7-day run-in period with ipatasertib alone prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. After the completion of&#xD;
      the ipatasertib run-in period, participants will begin Cycle 1, Day 1 of the ipatasertib and&#xD;
      rucaparib combination treatment. Each cycle has 28 days. Participants will be split into 4&#xD;
      cohorts: Dose Level 1 group - 300 mg ipatasertib once daily (QD) + 400 mg rucaparib twice&#xD;
      daily (BID), Dose Level 2a: 300 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 2b: 400&#xD;
      mg ipatasertib QD + 400 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 3: 400 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg&#xD;
      rucaparib BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2) - The recommended dose identified in Part 1 (highest dose&#xD;
      level of ipatasertib and rucaparib with an acceptable safety profile and less than one-third&#xD;
      of participants experience a dose limiting toxicity) will be evaluated in participants with&#xD;
      advanced prostate cancer who have had at least one line of prior therapy with&#xD;
      second-generation androgen-receptor (AR)-targeted agents (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide,&#xD;
      apalutamide).&#xD;
