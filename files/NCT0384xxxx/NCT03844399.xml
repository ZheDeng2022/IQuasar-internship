  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the addition of 3D ultrasound guidance during standard care ablation&#xD;
      or biopsies of liver or kidney tumours. 3D ultrasound only differs from conventional 2D&#xD;
      ultrasound in that the ultrasound transducer is mounted on a special assembly that moves the&#xD;
      transducer in precise, stepped movements while a succession of 2D images are collected by the&#xD;
      computer. Special software written specifically for 3D ultrasound precisely aligns these 2D&#xD;
      images into a 3-demensional volume , allowing area in question to be viewed in many different&#xD;
      planes. 3D ultrasound is a safe, fast, non-invasive imaging procedure. Ultrasound images will&#xD;
      be checked against the pre- and post- procedure CT images to make sure the tumours were&#xD;
      completely removed or properly targeted during biopsy.&#xD;

      Images will be acquired by a physician on patients who are undergoing a liver or kidney&#xD;
      ablation or biopsy procedure who are well enough to provide consent. Patients will be imaged&#xD;
      during the ablation procedure according to the standard of care, and subsequent analysis will&#xD;
      commence following the acquisition. The devices being used are all property of the LHSC&#xD;
      health network that have been licensed for clinical use through Health Canada. In addition,&#xD;
      3D ultrasound only differs from conventional 2D ultrasound in that the ultrasound transducer&#xD;
      is mounted on a special assembly that moves the transducer in precise, stepped movements&#xD;
      while a succession of 2D images are collected by the computer. Special software written&#xD;
      specifically for 3D ultrasound precisely aligns these 2D images into a 3-dimensional volume,&#xD;
      allowing the area in question to be viewed in different planes. The clinical 2D an d3D&#xD;
      ultrasound images will be checked against the pre- and post- procedure CT images to make sure&#xD;
      the tumours were completely removed.&#xD;
