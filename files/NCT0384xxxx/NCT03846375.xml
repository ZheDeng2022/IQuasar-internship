  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a naturalistic cohort pre-post study investigating aspects of emotional processing&#xD;
      and how possible changes in emotional processing is related to the successful treatment of&#xD;
      non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation in a program of Dialectical Behavior Therapy.&#xD;
      In addition we wish to identify to what extent the intensity and frequency of non-suicidal&#xD;
      self-injury and suicidal ideation is related to difficulty in emotion regulation, as&#xD;
      indicated by self-report measures and psychophysiological measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This naturalistic pre-port study tests if Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) - an established&#xD;
      therapy addressing emotion regulation and reduction of non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation - result in increased emotion regulation capacity, indicated by lowered heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) and self-report measures. The study will also test the impact of DBT on&#xD;
      lowered non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation. Standard Clinical symptom scales will&#xD;
      be included in order to control for anxiety, depression, as well as a measure of impulsivity,&#xD;
      which is common co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since DBT was developed in the 80ies, DBT has gathered increased empirical support as a&#xD;
      treatment that reduce suicidality, para-suicidal behavior, experienced and expressed anger,&#xD;
      and increased social skills. In DBT, emotional dysregulation is assumed to arise from a&#xD;
      combination of biological vulnerability and living in an invalidating environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-harm and chronic suicidality is considered to be an emotion regulation strategy. In DBT,&#xD;
      the ability to regulate emotions adaptively requires a set of skills; the ability to&#xD;
      experience emotions, the ability to label emotions, and the ability to modulate stimuli that&#xD;
      serve to reactivate negative or positive emotions. In the absence of these skills, or&#xD;
      instances where the individual is hindered from applying them, more maladaptive behavior is&#xD;
      learned and applied. Individuals that engage in non-suicidal self-injury often report greater&#xD;
      emotion dysregulation than those without an non-suicidal self-injury history. Such behavior&#xD;
      can e.g. be self-inflicted harm, cutting, burning, or hitting , and/or suicidal ideation.&#xD;
      Non-suicidal self-injury is viewed as a learned emotion regulation strategy; because such&#xD;
      behavior instantly can decrease the experience of negative affect. Therapies that focus on&#xD;
      increasing adaptive emotion regulations skills have demonstrated reduced non-suicidal&#xD;
      self-injury and suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological manifestations of emotions rely on an activation of the Autonomic Nervous&#xD;
      System. The individual experience of emotions is reciprocally related to the continuously&#xD;
      changing levels of physiological arousal. The functioning of this system is in turn related&#xD;
      to adapting to environmental demands. A well established measure of Autonomic Nervous&#xD;
      activity is variation in inter-beat-intervals due to respiratory influence on heart rate,&#xD;
      i.e. respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which is predominately a parasympathetic related&#xD;
      innervation of the heart. Hence, HRV is considered a psychophysiological index of emotion&#xD;
      regulation abilities. HRV is considered an index of the nervous system's ability to flexibly&#xD;
      adapt to changing environmental demands and is considered a biological index of emotion&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We include a matched control sample of healthy controls to complete the battery of&#xD;
      measurements at baseline assessment of emotion regulation functions (pre-intervention&#xD;
      assessments). This will give the opportunity to characterize the group of patients with&#xD;
      non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation included in the current planned study in&#xD;
      relation to previous research findings of the same functions in samples of patients with&#xD;
      non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation. The combination of clinical, cognitive and&#xD;
      psychophysiological measures is a unique feature of this study, and will provide new&#xD;
      information regarding the mechanisms underpinning clinical change following DBT, and possibly&#xD;
      validate heart rate variability as a possible psychophysiological outcome measure for studies&#xD;
      on treatment for non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Multilevel between-group analyses will be conducted to test for the&#xD;
      between-group effects on the measures at baseline. Furthermore, a multiple regression&#xD;
      analyses, so that dimensional variables can be included as independent variables in the&#xD;
      model, for the pre and post measures. Regression analyses also allow for adjusting for the&#xD;
      effects of possible confounders on the outcome measures, such as age, sex, and intensity of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis will be conducted to examine&#xD;
      moderator and mediator effects on the outcome measures. Interpretation of the strength of&#xD;
      experimental effects will be guided by the use of effect size statistics. Baseline measures&#xD;
      of demographics, life experiences, and symptoms may also be used to predict outcomes or as&#xD;
      covariates in our analyses.&#xD;
