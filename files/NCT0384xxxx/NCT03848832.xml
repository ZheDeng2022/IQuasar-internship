  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RSBQ is a caregiver-completed questionnaire that measures the frequency of current disease characteristics (45 items); each item rated on a 3-point scale (0-2). Higher scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much a participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. (1 = very much improved, to 7 = very much worse.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RSBQ subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 45 items in the caregiver-completed RSBQ encompass 8 subscales: 1) general mood, 2) breathing problems, 3) hand behaviors, 4) face movements, 5) body rocking/expressionless face, 6) night-time behaviors, 7) anxiety/fear, 8) walking/standing. Higher scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Global Impressions - Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment relative to the clinician's experience with participants who have the same diagnosis, rating from 1 = normal, not at all ill, to 7 = extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9-items Motor Behavioral Assessment (MBA-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MBA-9 was derived from the full MBA scale (37 Rett syndrome symptoms) by selecting the items deemed amenable to change and which reflect areas of meaningful clinical change. The severity of current symptoms are rated by the investigator on a 5-point numerical scale, from 0 = normal or never, to 4 = very severe or constant. Higher total scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CSHQ is a caregiver-completed sleep screening instrument designed for school-aged children, including 33 items within 8 subscales reflecting the following sleep domains:1) bedtime resistance, 2) sleep onset delay, 3) sleep duration, 4) sleep anxiety, 5) night wakings, 6) parasomnias, 7) sleep-disordered breathing, 8) daytime sleepiness. Each item is answered with 1 of 3 markers: &quot;usually&quot; for 5 or more times a week, &quot;sometimes&quot; for 2-4 times a week, and &quot;rarely&quot; for never or 1 time a week. Higher scores reflect more disturbed sleep behavior.</description>
