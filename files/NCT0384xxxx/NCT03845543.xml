  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BIBLIOS trial investigates the efficacy and safety of BTK treatment of patients suffering&#xD;
      from critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 5) with the Luminor-14 Paclitaxel coated Percutaneous&#xD;
      Transluminal Angioplasty Balloon catheter of iVascular. An expected total of 150 patients&#xD;
      will be treated. Infrapopliteal lesions will be treated during this trial. The Paclitaxel&#xD;
      eluting balloon Luminor-14 is designed for percutaneous transluminal angioplasties in which&#xD;
      the balloon will dilate the artery upon inflation. The balloon is coated with Paclitaxel&#xD;
      intended to avoid cellular proliferation. The drug is released by means of rapid inflation as&#xD;
      to release a high dose in a short amount of time. Patients will be invited for a follow-up&#xD;
      visit at 1, 6 and 12 months post-procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as&#xD;
      freedom from major adverse limb events, defined as above the ankle target limb amputations or&#xD;
      major reintervention to the target lesions at 6 months. The primary safety endpoint is&#xD;
      freedom from major adverse limb event at 30 days. The secondary endpoints consist of&#xD;
      functional flow in target vessel, freedom from clinically driven target lesion&#xD;
      revascularisation, above the ankle amputation free survival and limb salvage at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, and also procedural success, wound healing status and wound healing time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      Luminor-14 DCB for the treatment of infrapopliteal lesions patients with critical limb&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be&#xD;
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the&#xD;
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should be geographically stable,&#xD;
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study, and remain available for long term&#xD;
      follow-up. The patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients&#xD;
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after&#xD;
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the index procedure the following will be collected: an informed consent for data&#xD;
      collection, demographics, medical history, medication record, physical examination, clinical&#xD;
      category of acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category), the resting ankle-brachial index&#xD;
      (ABI), life quality and if applicable a wound assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure the guidewire will cross the entire study lesion after which the lesion&#xD;
      will be assessed through angiography. A pre-dilatation with a standard non-drug-coated&#xD;
      balloon will be performed followed by a dilatation of the lesion with a Luminor-14 balloon&#xD;
      (iVascular). If dilatation was not successful (&gt;30% stenosis, perforation, occlusive or flow&#xD;
      limiting dissection) prolonged inflation should be attempted after which bail-out stenting&#xD;
      with a non-drug-coated dedicated BTK stent is allowed in case of inadequate results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the results of&#xD;
      the procedure. Patients will be invited on weekly follow-up, with special attention to wound&#xD;
      healing status at each visit until the wound is completely healed. The other required&#xD;
      follow-up visits are 1,6 and 12 months follow-ups. During these visit the following data will&#xD;
      be collected: medication record, physical exam, wound assessment and healing status, quality&#xD;
      of life, duplex ultrasound of target vessel and possible adverse events.&#xD;
