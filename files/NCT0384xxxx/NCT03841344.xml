  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is progressive life limiting disease with a median&#xD;
      survival of less than 3 years without treatment. Current drug trials in PAH commonly use&#xD;
      simple tests for example the 6-minute walk test, blood tests such as N-terminal&#xD;
      pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and BNP, and haemodynamic measures such as&#xD;
      PAP and PVR obtained by RHC as endpoints. These tests are surrogate markers of disease&#xD;
      severity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. There is now evidence suggesting that&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the follow up of patients with PAH with&#xD;
      high accuracy for the detection of treatment failure, this is because MRI can track changes&#xD;
      occurring in the heart by direct visualisation of cardiopulmonary morphology and function, an&#xD;
      advantage over existing methods. However, the reproducible of MRI measurements in patients&#xD;
      with PAH is not known, and the comparative repeatability of MRI in relation to traditional&#xD;
      candidate endpoints such as walk tests and blood tests used in drug trials is not known.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but severe and progressive disorder, with a&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 50 in 1,000,000 of the population. The condition is incurable&#xD;
      with high morbidity and mortality despite the development of effective treatment options. The&#xD;
      emergence of goal orientated therapy initially focused interest on prognostic markers that&#xD;
      can both inform the clinician regarding disease severity at presentation and be used to&#xD;
      follow-up response to therapy and aid in decisions regarding listing for transplantation. A&#xD;
      number of effective therapies are available but are very expensive and there is an urgent&#xD;
      need for non-invasive and specific markers to assess treatment response and guide therapy.&#xD;
      Accurate follow up with reproducible measurements of the heart and pulmonary vasculature are&#xD;
      essential in order to accurately characterise treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a non-ionising and non-invasive technique provides accurate&#xD;
      and reproducible information on cardiac morphology and function. MR imaging is becoming an&#xD;
      established technique in the evaluation of patients with PAH, allowing direct visualisation&#xD;
      and accurate analysis of the structure and function of the right ventricle (RV). There is a&#xD;
      pressing need to validate and standardise MRI methods in pulmonary hypertension to allow&#xD;
      clinical translation nationally and internationally and to support trials of novel disease&#xD;
      modifying therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the repeatability and capability of detecting change of&#xD;
      MR imaging measurements in comparison with walk tests and blood tests in patients with PAH,&#xD;
      and define the optimal MRI analysis protocol for use in clinical practice and in future&#xD;
      studies in PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the inter-observer and inter-scan variability of MRI in healthy volunteers and&#xD;
           patients with PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the inter-observer and inter-scan variability of MRI with walk tests and blood&#xD;
           tests, in healthy volunteers and patients with PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the capability of MRI to detect change in PAH patients with start or change of&#xD;
           therapy in comparison to walk test and blood test data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare MRI endpoints with associated clinical data including haemodynamic measures&#xD;
           obtained by right heart catheterisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the following groups will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment naïve patients with PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with PAH undergoing changes in their treatment regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with PAH who are NOT undergoing changes in their treatment regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH treatment will be as per standard of care. No new therapies are being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruit sufficient incident treatment naïve patients with PAH and patients with PAH on&#xD;
      monotherapy whose treatment is to be changed to achieve approximately 40 completers. This&#xD;
      number is based on prior MRI reproducibility studies investigating the reproducibility of&#xD;
      right ventricular measurements in healthy subjects and in those with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      It is planned that at least 30% of patients will be treatment naïve. 20 healthy volunteer&#xD;
      subjects will be recrited&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedule Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension Baseline study visit: During the&#xD;
      baseline visit, blood draw, 6 minute walk test (+/- shuttle walk test) and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      MRI will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit: A follow-up visit will then occur at any time between 1 and 12 months after&#xD;
      baseline. Patients with PAH, will be admitted for a one or two day visit. Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      MRI, blood draw, 6 minute walk test (+/- shuttle walk test) in the morning. Patients will&#xD;
      take their usual medications approximately 1 hour prior to their MRI. These investigations&#xD;
      will be repeated in the afternoon in the same way and in the same order. Patients will&#xD;
      refrain from, exercise, caffeinated drinks and alcohol, between investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers Recruited by open advertisement within the hospital and university. Male&#xD;
      or female subjects aged 18-60 years. Subjects will attend for a half day baseline visit for&#xD;
      MRI, walk tests and blood tests. The follow up visit, including MRI, blood draw and walk&#xD;
      test(s) will be as described for patients with PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI protocol will include measurement of candidate markers from the right heart and&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Biventricular volume, mass and function. Analysis from both the 4 chamber and short axis&#xD;
      images. Analyses will include and exclude trabecular mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Interventricular septal curvature and left ventricular eccentricity III. Pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial flow, pulmonary arterial area change and pulsatility IV. Dynamic contrast enhanced&#xD;
      perfusion imaging (first pass pulmonary transit time, full-width-half-maximum, delayed&#xD;
      enhancement washout time) V. Myocardial and pulmonary tissue characteristics pre and post&#xD;
      contrast T1 mapping of heart and lungs and myocardial late gadolinium enhancement pattern VI.&#xD;
      Other MRI endpoints including composite measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of MRI will be undertaken blinded to the patient's covariate data (walk tests and&#xD;
      blood tests). Two experienced (one primary, one secondary) independent observers will analyse&#xD;
      all the MRI studies. In the event of discrepancy between observers, the images will be&#xD;
      reviewed by a third observer (radiologist) and all three observers should reach consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker and walk test evaluation - The patient will be bled via a needle or cannula.&#xD;
      Whenever possible, blood tests will precede the walk test and MRI. Candidate prognostic&#xD;
      biomarkers, Pro NT BNP and BNP, will be tested. Incremental shuttle walk test and the 6&#xD;
      minute walk test will be performed &gt;45 minutes apart and both tests will be repeated in the&#xD;
      afternoon to determine the between measurement reproducibility for comparison with MRI. Walk&#xD;
      tests will be performed in accordance with standard protocols.&#xD;
