  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is the agent of choice for induction and maintenance of day care anesthesia in&#xD;
      children and has a wide acceptance among pediatric anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergence agitation (EA) is a frequent postoperative complication in pediatric patients&#xD;
      receiving inhalational anesthetics with a rapid recovery, e.g. sevoflurane Magnesium sulfate&#xD;
      is a non anesthetic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, Regional anesthetic techniques&#xD;
      have major two benefits which are lowering anesthetic requirements intraoperatively and&#xD;
      providing adequate postoperative pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate is an adjuvant that alters the perception and duration of pain by serving&#xD;
      as an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors. Caudal injection of bupivacaine&#xD;
      with magnesium sulfate in pediatric patients after inguinoscrotal operations provided&#xD;
      adequate postoperative analgesia without producing many side effects. Caudal block with local&#xD;
      anesthetic with or without adjuvants may prevent emergence agitation with effective&#xD;
      postoperative pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So the aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of caudal versus intravenous&#xD;
           magnesium sulfate infusions in controlling emergence agitations after inhalational&#xD;
           sevoflurane anesthesia in children who will undergo lower abdominal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg dialed in 10 cm&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be divided to 3 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bupivacaine group (B group) (group 1) N = 31 :-&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Magnesium sulfate caudal group (MC group) (group 2) N = 31 :-&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnesium sulfate I.V group (MV group) (group 3) N = 31 :-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative assessment in the ( PACU):-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The oxygen saturation (SO2), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) are&#xD;
           monitored by the observer blinded to group allocation on admission and 10 mins till&#xD;
           discharge (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60mints, time of discharge) from the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergence agitations (Pediatric anesthesia emergency delirium scale (PAED) The presence&#xD;
           of Emergence agitation and its severity will be measured using (PAED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of Pain and its severity will be measured using FLACC scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of first postoperative administration of fentanyl in mints&#xD;

      Participants and methods All participants will receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be divided to 3 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bupivacaine group (B group) (group 1) N = 31 :- The participants will receive caudal&#xD;
           block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           + I.V injection of 10 cm saline over 10 mins then, followed by I.V infusion 50 cm saline&#xD;
           with rate 10-20 ml/h according to child weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Magnesium sulfate caudal group (MC group) (group 2) N = 31 :- The participants will&#xD;
           receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg plus Magnesium sulfate 50 mg diluted&#xD;
           in 10 cm saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  I.V injection of 10 cm saline over 10 mins then, followed by I.V infusion of 50 cm&#xD;
                saline with rate 10-20 ml/h according to child weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnesium sulfate I.V group (MV group) (group 3) N = 31 :- The participants will receive&#xD;
           caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           + I.V injection of Magnesium sulfate 30mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline over 10 mins then,&#xD;
           followed by I.V infusion one ampule of Magnesium sulfate 500mg diluted in 50 cm saline&#xD;
           with rate 10 mg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard monitoring is used during anesthesia and surgery include :-&#xD;
           electrocardiography, non-invasive arterial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation using&#xD;
           pulse oximeter and end-tidal concentrations are measured using capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An intravenous line is secured before induction of anesthesia, all participants will&#xD;
           receive a standardized rapid sequence induction of anesthesia and oxygen administration&#xD;
           for 3 minutes. Anesthesia is induced with Inhalation of 8% sevoflurane without use of&#xD;
           muscle relaxant, cricoid pressure is applied and the trachea intubated with a&#xD;
           suitable-size endotracheal tube. Maintained end-tidal sevoflurane concentration will be&#xD;
           between 2.5-3.5 and will be titrated. The participants will breath spontaneously during&#xD;
           surgery and tidal volume will be adjusted to maintain normocarbia. I.V injection of 0.2&#xD;
           mg/kg dexamethasone after induction as a prophylaxis of post-operative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting of Mg sulfate. Caudal block will be performed to participants before surgical&#xD;
           incision with 1 of 2 investigators using the following technique :- The Participants are&#xD;
           placed in left lateral position after induction of general anesthesia. The back of the&#xD;
           participant including the sacral hiatus are carefully sterilized with an antiseptic&#xD;
           solution and sterile drapes will be placed around the injection site. The technique will&#xD;
           be done by introducing a 23-gauge hypodermic needle perpendicular to the sacrococcygeal&#xD;
           membrane with the bevel in the direction of the long fibers of the membrane. The needle&#xD;
           will be inserted until there is release of impedance as it pierced the sacrococcygeal&#xD;
           membrane. Then, it is directed upwards so that it make an angle of 20-30° with the skin&#xD;
           about 2 mm so that the whole bevel will be inside the sacral canal. The injection will&#xD;
           be made over a period of about 60 s and then a small elastoplast dressing is placed over&#xD;
           the injection site and the participant will be placed supine. Intraoperative analgesic&#xD;
           supplement will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Caudal block will be failed if HR &amp;/or MAP increased 10 more than the previous basal&#xD;
           value of beginning of surgery.participants will be fasting 4-6 hours for solid foods and&#xD;
           2 hours for clear fluids. Balanced fluid therapy containing Na Cl, glucose, K and Ca&#xD;
           will be infused according to body weight as follows :1st 10 kg 4 ml/kg/hour, 2nd 10 kg 2&#xD;
           ml/kg/hour and 1 ml//hour for every 1 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then, anesthetic gas discontinued and replaced O2 100%. At the end of the operation the&#xD;
           trachea is extubated, The participants will be transferred to the postanesthesia care&#xD;
           unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intraoperative assessment:-&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SO2) are&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  The occurrence of intraoperative bradycardia (defined as heart rate below 60 beats&#xD;
                min for ages above 1 years), requiring atropine.&#xD;

      quantitative data will be presented in the form of mean and standard Deviation. One-way ANOVA&#xD;
      test will be used to compare between quantitative data of the three groups. Paired t-test&#xD;
      will be used to study between two values in the same group. Pain score, sedation score will&#xD;
      be represented by median and range and will be analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test to compare&#xD;
      between the three groups. Mann-Whitney test will be used for comparison between 2 groups&#xD;
      separately. Significance will be considered when P-value is less than 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The primary outcomes was the incidence of emergence agitation. A previous study&#xD;
      on the effect of magnesium sulfate infusion on the incidence and severity of emergence&#xD;
      agitation in children under going adenotonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia reported a&#xD;
      72% incidence of emergence agitation. (14). We presumed that a clinically significant&#xD;
      difference would be 50% between the incidence of agitation in the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. With a power of 85% (a = 0.05, two-tailed), the sample size was calculated to be 93&#xD;
      patients (31 in each group). The sample size was calculated using Power Analysis and Sample&#xD;
      Size 12 software (NCSS, Kay seville, ut USA).&#xD;
