             The subject and/or their legally authorized representative must sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is ≥18 years of age upon signing the Informed Consent Form;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV (metastatic) squamous&#xD;
             or non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Part A only:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ▪ Subject has received, and then progressed or been intolerant to up to 3 lines&#xD;
                  of prior therapy in the metastatic setting, including approved chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  targeted therapy, immunotherapy and antibody therapy, if eligible. Subjects who&#xD;
                  have received &gt;3 lines of prior therapy may be eligible for Part A, upon&#xD;
                  discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects will be eligible for Part A irrespective of PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects will be eligible for Part A irrespective of EGFR or ALK mutation&#xD;
                       status. However, subjects with an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK&#xD;
                       translocation must have received and then progressed or been intolerant to&#xD;
                       at least 1 prior line of approved targeted therapy to be eligible for Part&#xD;
                       A.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Part B only:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject is undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy for&#xD;
                       metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject's most recent tumor assessment is consistent with PD according to&#xD;
                       RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The Investigator has determined that PD should be confirmed within 4-8&#xD;
                       weeks, and pembrolizumab treatment will continue pending PD confirmation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject is willing to undergo a confirmatory scan 4-8 weeks from the prior&#xD;
                       scan that indicated progression on pembrolizumab&#xD;

                    -  There is no evidence of rapid disease progression or clinical deterioration&#xD;
                       in the subject that would preclude continuation of pembrolizumab treatment&#xD;
                       pending confirmation of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Part C only:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject has received no prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
                       Subjects previously treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are&#xD;
                       eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months&#xD;
                       prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject has provided a formalin-fixed tumor sample from a biopsy of a tumor&#xD;
                       lesion either at the time of or after the diagnosis of metastatic disease&#xD;
                       AND from a site not previously irradiated, to assess for PD-L1 status.&#xD;
                       Biopsies obtained PRIOR to the administration of any systemic therapy to&#xD;
                       treat the subject's tumor (such as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) will not be&#xD;
                       permitted for analysis. The tissue sample must be received by the central&#xD;
                       laboratory vendor prior to enrollment. Fine needle aspirates, Endobronchial&#xD;
                       Ultrasound (EBUS) or cell blocks are not acceptable. Needle or excisional&#xD;
                       biopsies, or resected tissue is required. If the tumor specimen is not&#xD;
                       evaluable for PD-L1 expression by the central laboratory, an additional&#xD;
                       tumor specimen may be submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject's tumor has PD-L1 expression of ≥50%, as determined by&#xD;
                       immunohistochemistry (IHC) at a central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject's tumor does not harbour an EGFR sensitizing (activating) mutation&#xD;
                       or ALK translocation. EGFR sensitizing mutations are mutations that are&#xD;
                       amenable to treatment with TKIs (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, afatanib,&#xD;
                       osimertinib). ALK translocations are amendable to treatment with TKIs such&#xD;
                       as crizotinib, alectinib and ceritinib. Investigators must produce the&#xD;
                       source documentation of the EGFR mutation and ALK translocation status in&#xD;
                       all subjects with non-squamous histology AND for subjects in whom testing is&#xD;
                       clinically indicated. If either an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK&#xD;
                       translocation is detected, additional information regarding the mutation&#xD;
                       status of the other molecule is not required. If the clinical site is unable&#xD;
                       to provide the source documentation, EGFR and ALK testing should be&#xD;
                       performed per institutional standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has measurable disease for response assessment as defined by RECIST v1.1 by&#xD;
             the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1&#xD;
             (see Appendix 11);&#xD;

             significant toxic effects of prior anti-cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy or surgery before entering this study, except for alopecia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has no major existing comorbidities or medical conditions that would preclude&#xD;
             therapy in the opinion of the Investigator;&#xD;
