      The current study will compare hormone levels of AMH, FSH and inhibin B in blood specimens&#xD;
      collected by venipuncture and fingerstick in a sample of pre-menopausal women ages 18-45&#xD;
      years with normal menstrual cycles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment have led to greater survival rates in&#xD;
      patients with malignancies. However, these life-saving treatments, especially alkylating&#xD;
      agents, often lead to premature ovarian failure, infertility and related long-term health&#xD;
      problems. It is difficult to predict whether, and the extent to which, patients will&#xD;
      experience these problems. There are no early clinical signs of decreased fertility&#xD;
      potential; even young women who maintain cyclic menses after therapy are at high risk of&#xD;
      infertility, early menopause and related health problems. Preliminary studies suggest that&#xD;
      several surrogate measures of fertility potential are different in cancer survivors compared&#xD;
      with controls. These include follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, anti-mullerian&#xD;
      hormone (AMH) and inhibin B. Large longitudinal studies are needed to validate these measures&#xD;
      with gold standard outcomes such as pregnancy rates, pregnancy outcomes and time to&#xD;
      menopause. The main impediment to assessing the value of these markers and generating data&#xD;
      that is useful to cancer survivors is the need for frequent and timed blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily or frequent trips to the clinical center are not practical and reduce the compliance of&#xD;
      even the most motivated patients. The hypothesis that will be tested by this study is that&#xD;
      blood spot assays can be developed that provide robust, personalized data for surrogate&#xD;
      markers of reproductive function which can be used to assess reproductive potential in women;&#xD;
      furthermore, bloodspots collected at home are an acceptable method for reproductive hormone&#xD;
      measurement in women with and without a history of cancer. The current study will compare&#xD;
      hormone levels of AMH, FSH and inhibin B in blood specimens collected by venipuncture and&#xD;
      fingerstick in a sample of subjects.&#xD;

    <description>A capillary blood sample from a finger-prick is applied to Whatman #903 filter paper, allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 4 hours, and then stored until analysis in the laboratory. Subjects willing to conduct a finger stick at home will collect an additional dried blood spot sample for secondary outcome measures. At home blood spot cards will be compared to those obtained in the office to determine adequacy of collection.</description>
