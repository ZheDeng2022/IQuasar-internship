    <textblock>
      Debriefing after simulation plays a crucial role in student learning and medical practice.&#xD;
      This paper focuses on impact of computer debriefing technique on knowledge retention of&#xD;
      midwives during screen-based simulation of neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simulation, including screen-based simulation, is employed in medicine to enhance competency&#xD;
      and improve care. It has been practiced for centuries in its primitive form as uses of wax&#xD;
      Venus or obstetrics dolls to teaching anatomical knowledge or know-how/gestures. Many&#xD;
      benefits come from simulations as the capacity to practiced procedures without any risk to&#xD;
      the patient, the possibility of trainees to commit errors and learn from these errors, the&#xD;
      repeatability of scenario that can be different or presented to learners many times, and then&#xD;
      the opportunity to improved technical and non-technical skills among learners. Specifically,&#xD;
      screen-based simulation has many advantages as portability (easy to move), distribution and&#xD;
      replicability (usable by many learners at differences places in the world), repeatability&#xD;
      (people not faced frequently in their regular practice), even be remotely usable.&#xD;
      Screen-based simulation appears in literature to be a complement of mannequin simulation.&#xD;
      Indeed, since last years the development of computer science has made it possible to create&#xD;
      new kind of simulators in the medical field for the acquisition of knowledge, know-how and&#xD;
      technical gestures, more realistic and interactively rich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debriefing is considered as a part of simulation-based training and cannot be separated of&#xD;
      simulators. Debriefing improve professional practice, clinical skills and competences. It&#xD;
      exists different debriefing methods: post simulation debriefing, in-simulation debriefing,&#xD;
      verbal instructor debriefing, video-assisted instructor debriefing, self-debriefing or also&#xD;
      multimedia debriefing. However, debriefing is considered by many as a communication between&#xD;
      student/learner and teacher, after a situation (e.g. simulation), and about this experience.&#xD;
      It is not just a feedback on performance but also a communication process about the impact of&#xD;
      the experience or performance explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a computer integrated debriefing of technical and&#xD;
      non-technical skills on retention and performance of neonatal resuscitation management by&#xD;
      trainee's midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty student in midwifery in fourth year will participate. The study protocol is the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline knowledge questionnaire, randomization of the participants. Day one: Tutorial of the&#xD;
      simulator, First scenario (+/- debriefing depending of the allocation group), second scenario&#xD;
      (+/- debriefing depending of the allocation group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day two (two month later): knowledge questionnaire, tutorial of the simulator, one scenario&#xD;
      (+/- debriefing depending of the allocation group).&#xD;
