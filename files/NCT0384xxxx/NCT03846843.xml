  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1, 2-part, crossover study in approximately 33 adult subjects (12&#xD;
      subjects in Part 1 and 21 subjects in Part 2), with varying degrees of cirrhosis with&#xD;
      analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data after Part 1 to guide dose regimen selection and PK&#xD;
      sampling time points for OCR-002 in Part 2.&#xD;

      Part 1: Dosing Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-dose, partially randomized, 4-period crossover study to evaluate 5 g OCR-002 oral&#xD;
      solution administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under fasting conditions&#xD;
      following discontinuation of lactulose in 12 subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and&#xD;
      C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics of phenylacetic acid (PAA) and&#xD;
      phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) following a single 5 g dose of OCR-002 oral solution&#xD;
      administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under fasting conditions following&#xD;
      discontinuation of lactulose as compared to a single 5 g intravenous dose of OCR-002 under&#xD;
      fasting conditions in subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of pharmacokinetic data will be conducted after completion of Part 1 in order to&#xD;
      determine the dose regimen of OCR-002 oral tablets to use in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Dosing Periods 1, 2 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple-dose, randomized, 3-period crossover study to evaluate OCR-002 oral tablets in&#xD;
      subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B). The purpose is to characterize the PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) of OCR-002 tablets after TID administration for 5 days in subjects with&#xD;
      cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B).&#xD;
