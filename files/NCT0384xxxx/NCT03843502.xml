  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kava is a dietary supplement on the US market and is experiencing a resurgence of its use.&#xD;
      Its pharmacokinetic information, however, is lacking which is important for its future&#xD;
      effective usage as a dietary supplement or potentially as a botanical therapeutics. This&#xD;
      phased trial, based on the recommendation from NIH, is to collect pharmacokinetic data of&#xD;
      kava in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kava is used in the South Pacific Islands for relaxation and socialization. It is available&#xD;
      in the US as a dietary supplement, and was used in Europe in the 1990s to treat mild to&#xD;
      moderate anxiety. Some clinical trials suggested kava's efficacy in treating generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (GAD), although a recent meta-analysis was inconclusive. While the&#xD;
      mechanisms behind kava's anxiolytic activity are not well-established, its clinical use shows&#xD;
      no signs of addiction or withdrawal. Kava thus is a promising and potentially novel&#xD;
      anxiolytic with a unique mechanism of action. Although kava has been extensively consumed by&#xD;
      humans for centuries, its pharmacokinetics have never been characterized in humans. Such&#xD;
      knowledge is essential for its future studies of its anxiolytic potential and dose&#xD;
      optimization. This study will characterize kava pharmacokinetics, which will set a solid&#xD;
      foundation for its future clinical development. To establish kava pharmacokinetics, each&#xD;
      participant will take three 75 mg kava capsules in a single dose and the absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of kava will be assessed, corresponding to the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic curve. Serum liver biochemistries will then be monitored for up to three&#xD;
      months to test liver function response to kava.&#xD;
