  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple center, single-arm, open-label, 12-month follow-up phase IV pragmatic&#xD;
      clinical trial. Men with unilateral prostate cancer meeting eligibility criteria for the drug&#xD;
      (as per the EEA Marketing Authorisation) will receive TOOKAD® VTP under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the occurrence and dynamics of the time with toxicities&#xD;
      (urinary incontinence Grade 2 and over and/or erectile dysfunction Grade 2 and over) in&#xD;
      patients 12 months following TOOKAD® VTP. Prior to the TOOKAD® VTP, patients will undergo&#xD;
      routine ultrasound examination in the operating room for morphometric description of the&#xD;
      prostate and to facilitate accurate treatment guidance for the treatment with TOOKAD® VTP.&#xD;
      Treatment will then be applied to the prostate gland as a hemi-ablation procedure designed to&#xD;
      destroy the lobe of the prostate gland that contains the cancer. Afterwards, patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 12 months with clinical evaluation, data collection on erectile and urinary&#xD;
      functions at 1, 2, 3 6 and 12 months, using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite&#xD;
      (EPIC), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and International Prostate Score&#xD;
      Symptom (IPSS) questionnaires on Quality Of Life (QOL) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      testing at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical follow-up of patients will follow local standard of care processes, based on&#xD;
      recommendations in the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase IV pragmatic trial using optimal dose of TOOKAD® and optimal&#xD;
      light-energy level conditions that were determined during development and approved by the&#xD;
      European Commission.&#xD;

    <description>TOOKAD is administered as part of focal VTP under general anaesthetic. TOOKAD® VTP consists of the combination of a single, 10-minute IV infusion of TOOKAD® at the dose of 3.66 mg/kg, followed by the illumination of the zone to be treated with a 753-nm laser light delivered through transperineal interstitial optical fibers at a power of 150 mW/cm and light energy of 200 J/cm applied over 22 minutes and 15 seconds.</description>
