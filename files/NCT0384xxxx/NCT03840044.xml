  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare airway physiologic reactions to physical exercise in a&#xD;
      cold air environment (-5°C, 60% relative humidity) between normal volunteers and subjects&#xD;
      with mild/moderate asthma. For this purpose, the investigators intend to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of a cold air exercise test on the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, functional airway integrity, local and systemic inflammation and on the airway&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also features as an exploratory study for a subsequent interventional study in&#xD;
      order to establish the feasibility of the cold air exercise protocol and to determine the&#xD;
      extent of the effects in subjects with mild/moderate asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is already demonstrated that exercising during cold air exposure and at a high altitude&#xD;
      may induce asthmatic symptoms, a variable degree of airway obstruction and increased&#xD;
      neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. Therefore, in this project, the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate the feasibility, of a shorter standardized &quot;cold air exercise&#xD;
      test&quot; (a submaximal exercise challenge in a controlled cold air (-5°C, relative humidity 60%)&#xD;
      environment) and to compare the respiratory physiologic reactions to physical exercise during&#xD;
      cold exposure between healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. For this purpose, they&#xD;
      intend to evaluate the effect of a cold air exercise test on FEV1, respiratory symptoms,&#xD;
      functional airway integrity, local and systemic inflammation and on the airway microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study features as an exploratory study for a subsequent interventional study, that will&#xD;
      assess the protective effect of azithromycin versus placebo on the cold air exercise induced&#xD;
      changes in patients with mild/moderate asthma (ALASCAIR2 study). The present preparatory&#xD;
      study is needed to standardize the cold air exercise test in a controlled environment so that&#xD;
      it would be possible to use it as challenge test in an interventional study and to identify&#xD;
      the most appropriate design for such a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the proportional change in FEV1, pre to&#xD;
      post a 90 minutes submaximal exercise in a cold air environment between healthy volunteers&#xD;
      versus mild/moderate asthmatics, calculated as a time-weighted average over the 30 minutes&#xD;
      post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in FEV1, calculated as a time-weighted average over the 30&#xD;
      minutes after the cold exercise test. At each time point (pre-exposure, 5' post-exposure, and&#xD;
      at 15, 25 and 35 minutes post-exposure), FEV1 (L) will be measured in triplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They want to evaluate whether the exercise test in a cold air environment produces&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms (such as nasal discharge or obstruction, dyspnea, cough and/or mucus&#xD;
      production, etc.), has an impact on airway integrity (nasal patency, airflow obstruction,&#xD;
      lung ventilation inhomogeneity &amp; small airway dysfunction, bronchial hyperreactivity, cough&#xD;
      reflex hypersensitivity), induces local or systemic inflammatory changes (biomarkers in nasal&#xD;
      fluid, sputum and blood) or changes to the airway microbiome (in nasal fluid and sputum) in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and in mild/moderate asthmatics. The study group also want to compare the&#xD;
      observed changes induced by the cold air exercise test between the healthy volunteers and the&#xD;
      mild/moderate asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of this study include the observed changes in (respiratory) symptom&#xD;
      score, Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory&#xD;
      Flow (FEF25-75), Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), histamine provocative concentration&#xD;
      causing 20% drop in FEV1 (PC20), cough threshold C2 &amp; C5, sputum differential cell count,&#xD;
      biomarkers in nasal fluid, sputum and blood, nasal and sputum microbial communities between&#xD;
      the healthy volunteers and the mild/moderate asthmatics.&#xD;
