  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle portion of the eye.&#xD;
      The greatest challenge for the treatment of uveitis is patients who have inflammation&#xD;
      involving the posterior segment, either primarily in the vitreous (intermediate uveitis), the&#xD;
      choroid or retina (posterior uveitis), or involving the entire eye (panuveitis). The term&#xD;
      &quot;uveitis&quot; denotes a heterogeneous collection of diseases including infections, systemic&#xD;
      immune-mediated diseases like sarcoidosis, and immune-mediated syndromes confined to the eye&#xD;
      like sympathetic ophthalmia. Despite the progress in recent decades, uveitis and the related&#xD;
      intraocular inflammation are comparable to diabetes or macular degeneration as a cause of&#xD;
      lost quality-adjusted life years due to visual morbidity, and as such are a significant&#xD;
      public health problem. The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group Guidelines&#xD;
      recommend the use of corticosteroids as the first-line therapy for patients with active&#xD;
      uveitis. However, long-term corticosteroid treatment can cause serious systemic and ocular&#xD;
      side effects, such as hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataract, and glaucoma that limit&#xD;
      its use in the treatment of uveitis. Alternatively, immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) drugs are&#xD;
      given as steroid-sparing agents and have shown good clinical results for both systemic&#xD;
      diseases and ocular inflammatory diseases. Given the side effects of chronic corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy and better understanding of the mechanisms of autoimmune-mediated uveitis, the aim of&#xD;
      the treatment for patients with noninfectious uveitis is steroid-free remission with IMT.&#xD;
      While uveitis is a heterogeneous disease with polygenic and environmental factors, most forms&#xD;
      of immune-mediated uveitis are thought to be due to an imbalance between regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms that inhibit the immune system and inflammatory mechanisms, which have evolved to&#xD;
      rid the body of infectious organisms, but which can result in immune-mediated, often chronic&#xD;
      disease if they are activated outside the context of the immediate infection. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of non-infectious uveitis involves the rupture of peripheral tolerance,&#xD;
      resulting in auto-aggressive Th1 or Th17 lymphocytes reaching the eye. L-12 and IL-23 are two&#xD;
      key cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 polarization in uveitis, respectively. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these two cytokines share a common subunit (p40). Ustekinumab, a humanized anti-p40&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, is able to target both IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, thus disrupting Th1 and&#xD;
      Th17 immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreasing the dose as well as the duration of treatment with GC is of particular importance&#xD;
      in uveitis, and ustekinumab, which selectively inhibits Th1 and Th17 pathways in the&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade, could provide a ideal additional therapy for non-infectious severe&#xD;
      uveitis (NISU) to reach this objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ustekinumab for the treatment of NISU.&#xD;
