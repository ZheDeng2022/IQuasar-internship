  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well Uber health intervention works in eliminating transportation&#xD;
      barriers for disadvantaged patients with cancer that has spread to nearby tissue, lymph&#xD;
      nodes, or other places in the body, undergoing ambulatory palliative radiotherapy. Uber&#xD;
      health intervention provides free transportation to disadvantaged patients and may reduce the&#xD;
      amount of missed radiotherapy appointments, patient anxiety, and the amount of unplanned&#xD;
      emergency department visits, as well as improve quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients can&#xD;
      reduce the 6-month rate of unplanned emergency department (ED) visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients for&#xD;
      the duration of a palliative radiotherapy course will improve prescribed treatment completion&#xD;
      rates and reduce treatment delays and overall time to treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients for&#xD;
      the duration of a palliative radiotherapy course will have an impact on physician choice for&#xD;
      therapeutic modality, [3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT) versus&#xD;
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) versus stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT)] and the fractionation schedules to minimize patient inconvenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients&#xD;
      for the duration of a palliative radiotherapy course can reduce the short-term (6- months)&#xD;
      rate of grade &gt;= 3 radiation related adverse events as measured by the Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients for&#xD;
      the duration of a palliative radiotherapy course can improve the patient?s experience,&#xD;
      functional outcome, and overall quality of life as measured by the European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To test whether eliminating transportation barriers for disadvantaged cancer patients for&#xD;
      the duration of a palliative radiotherapy course can reduce re-treatment rates, improve the&#xD;
      progression free survival rates, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine if living within San Francisco County versus the surrounding counties&#xD;
      (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo) within the San Francisco Bay Area has an impact on&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Uber rides to and from scheduled radiotherapy appointments for up to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in mean pain score on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain score consists of responses to two items with responses ranging from 1=&quot;Not at all&quot; to 4=&quot;Very Much&quot;. The raw score is calculated by estimating the mean of the two items that make up the pain scale with a resulting total range of 1-4. These scores are then transformed to standardized scale score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for the pain scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <description>The global health status score consists of responses to two items with responses ranging from 1=&quot;very poor&quot; to 4=&quot;excellent&quot;. The raw score is calculated by estimating the mean of the two items that make up the global health scale with a resulting total range of 1-7. These scores are then transformed to standardized scale score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for the global health status represents a higher quality of life.</description>
