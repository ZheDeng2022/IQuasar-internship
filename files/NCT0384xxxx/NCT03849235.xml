    <textblock>
      Fatty liver disease is a globally widespread disease The identification of valid biomarkers&#xD;
      and targets for potential treatments requires in-depth knowledge about the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      the postprandial liver. The study will consist of five work packages (WP) including blood&#xD;
      tests and liver biopsies taken after fasting or ingestion of a standardized meal in: healthy&#xD;
      controls (WP 1), patients with NAFLD (WP 2), and patients with cirrhosis (WP 3) ; before and&#xD;
      after a standardised meal in healthy controls (WP 4), and before and after glucagon in&#xD;
      healthy controls (WP5)&#xD;
