  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial.The primary purpose of this&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after the use of Eptifibatide injection. Patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolytic therapy, mechanical&#xD;
      thrombolysis, angioplasty and so on were treated with Eptifibatide injection on the first&#xD;
      day, followed by the second day, the third day, the discharge day and the 90 days.&#xD;

      The study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial.A total of 220 patients&#xD;
      (Age≥18years) with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolysis, mechanical&#xD;
      thrombolysis, angioplasty, etc., were treated with Eptifibatide, providing informed consent&#xD;
      and medication.The recommended dose of this study was: first, 135ug / kg was injected&#xD;
      intravenously or intraductal (within 5 minutes), followed by continuous intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of 0.75 ug / kg / min for 24 h. In special cases, it is up to the operator to decide whether&#xD;
      to reinject or increase the dosage according to experience. The maximum dose for the first&#xD;
      time was 180ug / kg, if necessary, with a 10-minute interval of intravenously or intraductal&#xD;
      injection, and a maximum dose of 180ug / kg, intravenously / intraductal injection of no more&#xD;
      than 360ug / kg. Continuous intravenous infusion does not exceed 2ug/kg/ Min. Then the second&#xD;
      day, the third day, the discharge and 90 days visit. Follow-up information included vital&#xD;
      signs and physical examination, observation of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, NIHSS&#xD;
      scale, and recording of current drug use by AE,SAE.The trial is anticipated to last from&#xD;
      January 2019 to December 2019 with 220 subjects recruited form 15 centers in China. All the&#xD;
      related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      Chinese GCP standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety&#xD;
      during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics&#xD;
      Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.&#xD;
