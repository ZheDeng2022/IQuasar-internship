  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously completed a clinical trial with long-term vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation in healthy humans during a season with negligible ultraviolet B radiation&#xD;
      (UVB) in terms of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) increase. In this study (submitted,&#xD;
      unpublished), a temporary increase was identified during the first three weeks. Individually,&#xD;
      this temporary increase was found in 14 out of 19 participants. This phenomenon has not been&#xD;
      described elsewhere in the literature. This could be possible due to less frequent sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that this phenomenon is actual and not an artefact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the serum 25(OH)D increase after short-term vitamin&#xD;
      D3 supplementation in a new group of healthy participants with more frequent 25(OH)D&#xD;
      sampling. Furthermore, to investigate the influence of sex, age, weight, height, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), number of fatty fish meals per week, 25(OH)D start level and 30 genetic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, open and non-blinded clinical trial. No randomisation was used, as&#xD;
      all participants received identical treatment. 25(OH)D sampling was increased from once a&#xD;
      week to twice a week. Demographic data (gender, age, weight, height) was collected/measured&#xD;
      and registered in prior to study start. The number of daily consumed fatty fish meals was&#xD;
      recorded in a questionnaire.&#xD;

      Background The investigators have previously completed a clinical trial with long-term&#xD;
      vitamin D3 supplementation in healthy humans during a season with negligible UVB in terms of&#xD;
      serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) increase. In this study (submitted, unpublished), a&#xD;
      temporary increase was identified during the first three weeks. Individually, this temporary&#xD;
      increase was found in 14 out of 19 participants. This phenomenon has not been described&#xD;
      elsewhere in the literature. This could be possible due to less frequent sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis The investigators hypothesized that this phenomenon is actual and not an&#xD;
      artefact. As this phenomenon was not present in all participants, the investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesized that influential parameters could include sex, age, weight, height, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), number of fatty fish meals per week, 25(OH)D start level and genetic parameters&#xD;
      (30 pigment single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single-centre, open and non-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants will receive packages containing sufficient vitamin D3 tablets&#xD;
      (Cholecalciferol, Apovit, Takeda Pharma A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) to cover the consumption&#xD;
      corresponding to one week. They will be instructed to consume one vitamin D3 tablet per day&#xD;
      corresponding to 85 microgram (ug) (3400 international unit (IU)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior intake of vitamin D supplementation Participant will be instructed to not use vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation or participate in a sun holiday at least three weeks prior to study start and&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Tablets will be counted each week, where the participant will be given&#xD;
      supplementation for the following week to control for compliance and adverse events&#xD;
      registered. Participants will be instructed to correct deviations in intake of study&#xD;
      medication in between each blood sample period with ± ½ tablet per day. A failure to comply&#xD;
      with study medication with more that three tablets per week will lead to exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analysis Serum 25(OH)D will be analysed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometer (LC-MS/MS), which is the current most accurate method for this analysis. This&#xD;
      method has been cross checked against another clinical laboratory and proven reliable. Serum&#xD;
      25(OH)D will also be analysed by the in-house laboratory for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical variability To minimize analysis variance, at least triplet analyses (technical&#xD;
      replicates) will be performed of 25(OH)D analysis. All 25(OH)D samples from the same subject&#xD;
      will be analysed in one batch. An internal standard solution with 25(OH)D will be used in&#xD;
      each run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total relative standard deviation (SD) varies between 4.9% at 20 nmol/l and 14.1% at 222&#xD;
      nmol/l reflecting experimental variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological variability By including 7 measuring time points for serum 25(OH)D per&#xD;
      participant, the intra-individual variability will be reduced. Serum 25(OH)D is known to&#xD;
      variate with season and solar exposure. This study was therefore conducted during winter&#xD;
      half-year, when ambient UVB radiation and solar-exposed body areas are negligible at this&#xD;
      time of the year (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic parameters SNP genotyping. A total of 30 pigment SNPs will be investigated. A&#xD;
      subgroup of these SNPs have previously been shown to influence the vitamin D3 supplementation&#xD;
      induced 25(OH)D increase (paper submitted, unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SNPs were genotyped using the iPLEX1 Gold kit (Agena Bioscience Inc., Germany) as&#xD;
      previously described. SNPs with genotype subgroups containing less than five subjects were&#xD;
      merged with other allele-sharing subgroups (e.g. genotype AA with AG and not with GG).&#xD;
      Heterozygote subgroups with less than five subjects was merged with an allele-sharing&#xD;
      subgroup displaying insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) difference in influence on the 25(OH)D increase&#xD;
      rate. SNPs with no allele dose effect or dominant allele effect on 25(OH)D were excluded. For&#xD;
      SNPs with dominant allele effect, subgroups with no significant differences in influence on&#xD;
      25(OH)D increase rate were merged according to allele sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants: eligibility criteria All participants must reside in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization No randomisation will be used, as the aim of this study is to reproduce a&#xD;
      biological phenomenon. Blinding will therefore not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of study According to a previous vitamin D3 supplementation study (submitted,&#xD;
      unpublished) the difference in 25(OH)D from study start to study end was 48 nanomol per liter&#xD;
      (nmol l-1) with an SD of 29 nmol l-1. In this present shorter study with vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation, the detectable difference in 25(OH)D was expected to be half of that, i.e.&#xD;
      24 nmol l-1. Given a significance level of 5% and a power of 80 %, 13 participants are&#xD;
      required. The investigators aim to include 19 participants, allowing six drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed using the program Power and Sample Size Calculation&#xD;
      version 3.1.2.2014 available online on the website:&#xD;
      http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/PowerSampleSize&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All participants will be assigned with a unique study number prior to study&#xD;
      start. Demographic data (gender, age, weight and height will be collected/measured and&#xD;
      registered prior to study start. The number of daily consumed fatty fish meals was recorded&#xD;
      in a questionnaire. All forms will be marked with the participants unique study number.&#xD;
      25(OH)D samples will be analysed after study end. The participant study number linked to&#xD;
      participant contact details were held in a separate sheet kept securely and in line with the&#xD;
      regulation of the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background diet and change in diet during intervention The number of daily consumed fatty&#xD;
      fish meals was recorded in a questionnaire during the study period as this parameter&#xD;
      potentially can influence the primary outcome measure, 25(OH)D increase over time. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be examined for errors to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background health status and lifestyle, and changes in health status and lifestyle during&#xD;
      intervention The health status of the participants and start of new medication was monitored&#xD;
      weekly throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Mild temporary side effects will not lead to discontinuation of study&#xD;
      medication. Participants will be monitored with blood samples measuring ionised calcium and&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase. Adverse events such as hypercalcemia or kidney stone will lead to&#xD;
      exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Individual data will be tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to&#xD;
      assess whether the data are normally distributed. Normally distributed data will be tested by&#xD;
      Student's t-test. Pair-wise comparison of ionised calcium (Ca2+) levels at different time&#xD;
      points will be performed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following models will be investigated separately: linear, inverse, quadratic, cubic,&#xD;
      power, sigmoid and exponential. Determination of the best suitable model (power model) will&#xD;
      be based on R2 values and the accordance between the individual investigations and group&#xD;
      investigation of the 25(OH)D increase over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the influence of parameters on the 25(OH)D slope will examined separately. The&#xD;
      influence of separate significant parameters is not independent and therefore subsequently&#xD;
      investigated by a stepwise forward selection of separate significant parameters deployed in a&#xD;
      combined general linear model (GLM) according to P-value.25 The influence of parameters on&#xD;
      the occurrence of a temporary peak in the serum 25(OH)D over time will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be statistically analysed using SPSS 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      U.S.A.). P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. No interim analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion and interpretation The discussion and interpretation of study results will include&#xD;
      a consideration of the important study limitations that constitute a bias and discussion of&#xD;
      limitations of generalisation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions The Conclusion section will be related directly to the initial statement of&#xD;
      hypothesis and justified by the accompanying data.&#xD;
