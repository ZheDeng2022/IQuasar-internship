  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine primarily if there is a difference in perceived pain in&#xD;
      patients receiving urethral bulking with calcium hydroxylapatite using local lidocaine versus&#xD;
      local lidocaine plus nitrous oxide gas. Patients will be randomized to a control group (local&#xD;
      lidocaine plus room air) or a intervention group (local lidocaine plus 50% nitrous oxide/50%&#xD;
      oxygen inhaled mixture). Their pain will be assessed immediately after the procedure, and&#xD;
      their recollection of pain will also be assessed at their 2 week post-procedure visit. There&#xD;
      are other secondary outcome measures as well; please see outcome measures section for full&#xD;
      description.&#xD;

    Due to staffing changes in the hospital, we will be unable to complete this study for the&#xD;
    requested 84 subjects. As such, we have decided to close this study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain</measure>
    <time_frame>upon enrollment and immediately after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed both before the procedure upon enrollment immediately after the procedure using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS), where patients will mark their pain level along the scale from &quot;no pain&quot; at 0cm to &quot;pain as bad as it possibly could be&quot; at 10cm; the change in pain score between the before and after procedure VASs (i.e. the baseline pain score subtracted from the post-procedure pain score) is the primary outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recollection of change in pain</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Recollection of pain measured by a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS) completed 10 minutes after the procedure; this will be compared to the baseline pain score on VAS from prior to the procedure, again to determine the patient's perceived change in pain during the procedure. The VAS used has patients mark their pain level along the scale from &quot;no pain&quot; at 0cm to &quot;pain as bad as it possibly could be&quot; at 10cm. The score on the VAS at baseline is subtracted from the score on the VAS at 10 minutes to get the change in pain as the patient remembered it.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedure time</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Time from the initial insertion of the cystoscope (for the injection of calcium hydroxylapatite) to final removal of the cystoscope</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment and then again at the patient's 1-2 week post-procedure visit.</time_frame>
    <description>A change in the patient's UDI-6 score, measured prior to procedure and then again at the 1-2 week post-procedure visit. UDI-6 is a measure of the severity of urinary symptoms the patient experiences, with minimum score of 0 (indicating no bother from urinary symptoms) and maximum score of 100 (indicating maximum bother from urinary symptoms). We will be assessing the change in this score from baseline, by subtracting the post-procedure score at 1-2 weeks from the baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment and then again at the patient's 1-2 week post-procedure visit.</time_frame>
    <description>A change in the patient's ISI score, measured prior to procedure and then again at the 1-2 week post-procedure visit. ISI score measures severity of incontinence symptoms on a scale of 0 to 12, where 0 is no symptoms and 12 is maximal incontinence symptoms. We will calculate the change in score by subtracting the post-procedure score at 1-2 weeks from the baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 week post op visit</time_frame>
    <description>Score on PGI-I at the patient's 1-2 week post-procedure visit. This score assesses who the patient feels their post-procedure condition is compared to prior to the procedure on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is &quot;very much better&quot; and 7 is &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
