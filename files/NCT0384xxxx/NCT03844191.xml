  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess tolerability of the weight-adjusted dose of RUC-4 (mg/kg)&#xD;
      required to achieve 80% or more inhibition of the initial slope of platelet aggregation to 20&#xD;
      ÂµM ADP by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) within 15 minutes of SC administration of&#xD;
      RUC-4 with return toward baseline values within 4 hours in healthy volunteers and subjects on&#xD;
      aspirin with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In the Dose Expansion Part, VerifyNow&#xD;
      PRUTest will be used to measure platelet aggregation in addition to LTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the goal of RUC-4 therapy is to achieve maximal antiplatelet therapy as rapidly as&#xD;
      possible, first the tolerability of the weight-adjusted dose (mg/kg) that inhibits&#xD;
      ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 80% or more in 5 of 6 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      identified. A similar dose escalation will be subsequently performed in subjects with CAD who&#xD;
      are taking aspirin. To facilitate administration using a single weight-adjusted (mg/kg) dose&#xD;
      for a defined group of subjects weighing between 55 and 120 kg, the study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and biologic effect on platelet aggregation of the weight adjusted (mg/kg) dose&#xD;
      when administered to subjects with weights at either end of this range.&#xD;
