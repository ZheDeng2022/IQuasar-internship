      This study is composed of two phases. Phase 1 will determine baseline demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of participants, currently drinking harmful amounts of alcohol, who would be&#xD;
      interested in an alternative treatment option to reduce alcohol consumption. Once baseline&#xD;
      data is collected, participants will then be informed that the intervention is an exercise&#xD;
      programme and those interested will be offered participation in Phase 2: a two-arm randomised&#xD;
      controlled study. If eligible, participants will be randomly assigned to either: 1) a 12 week&#xD;
      combined exercise programme and NHS standard care group, or 2) 12 weeks of NHS (National&#xD;
      Health Service) standard care only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to study the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial in this&#xD;
      cohort and to determine the effectiveness of the exercise programme to reduce alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, improve physical and mental health among people drinking harmful amounts of&#xD;
      alcohol, compared to standard NHS care. Assessment visits, measuring alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      mental health and physical health, will be conducted at baseline, and at Weeks 13, 24, 36 and&#xD;
      48 since commencement of the intervention period. Focus groups will take place during the 2nd&#xD;
      and 12th week of the exercise programme where qualitative feedback on the exercise programme&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol-dependent patients often experience depression, anxiety and stress, and it is thought&#xD;
      that these may be important factors associated with increased alcohol consumption. Regular&#xD;
      moderate/high-intensity exercise has been repeatedly reported to reduce depression, anxiety&#xD;
      and stress, with regular exercise also shown to be effective in achieving a pleasurable&#xD;
      state, improving coping mechanisms and increasing self-confidence among substance-dependent&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, exercise-based therapy may be perceived by alcohol-dependent patients&#xD;
      as a less stigmatising therapy option than traditional medication and counselling treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a small number of studies suggest that regular exercise is effective in improving&#xD;
      fitness levels among alcohol-dependent adults, there is a lack of consensus regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of regular exercise to reduce alcohol consumption. Of a recent systematic review, 3&#xD;
      of the 5 studies reported that regular exercise reduced alcohol consumption and craving of&#xD;
      alcohol. However, while a recent meta-analysis didn't find evidence of exercise significantly&#xD;
      reducing alcohol consumption, the three small studies that were assessed all found that&#xD;
      exercise training induced some reductions in alcohol consumption; suggesting that regular&#xD;
      exercise may be effective in reducing alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is composed of two phases. Phase 1 will determine the characteristics of&#xD;
      participants currently drinking harmful amounts of alcohol who would be interested in being&#xD;
      offered a new, alternative treatment to reduce alcohol consumption. During their NHS standard&#xD;
      care (Phase 1; Visit 1), potential participants will be asked by either a member of the study&#xD;
      team, or by the standard care team, if they &quot;would you be willing to consider taking part in&#xD;
      a study to look at new ways of treating people addicted to alcohol?'. While no specific&#xD;
      details of the intervention will be provided at this time, participants who are interested&#xD;
      will be given the participant information sheet (Phase 1) which will include further details&#xD;
      of the study. A member of the study team will contact potential participants and, if they are&#xD;
      happy to take part, another visit (Phase 1; Visit 2) will be arranged for patients to&#xD;
      complete the demographic questionnaires. Visit 2 will take place at one of the study sites&#xD;
      and written informed consent will be taken before the patient completes the study&#xD;
      questionnaires which will determine characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity, marital&#xD;
      status, educational background, employment status, smoking status, number of previous&#xD;
      attempts to reduce alcohol consumption, family history of addiction, other drug intake,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption (7 Day Drinking Diary), dependence of alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire), severity of alcohol dependence (SADQ),&#xD;
      alcohol craving (Penn Alcohol Craving Scale), impact of alcohol consumption on daily life&#xD;
      (Alcohol Problems Questionnaire), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), anxiety&#xD;
      (Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire) and current physical activity levels&#xD;
      (short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete Phase 1 of the study will be invited to participate in Phase 2 of&#xD;
      the study on the same day (i.e. at the end of Visit 2 of Phase 1 of the study). Interested&#xD;
      participants will be provided with full information regarding the nature of the randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial - i.e. that this is an exercise-based intervention study - and will be given&#xD;
      a separate participant information sheet (Phase 2). A member of the study team will contact&#xD;
      potential participants and, if they are happy to participate, the screening visit will be&#xD;
      arranged. Participants who decline enrolment into the exercise-based randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will be asked if they are willing to take part in a short telephone interview to&#xD;
      enquire about reasons for not wanting to partake in the study. Both participants who agree,&#xD;
      and do not agree, to take part in the short telephone interview will be offered NHS standard&#xD;
      care. The telephone interviews will be audio-recorded, with participants consent, and&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim. This will allow us to identify the characteristics of participants who&#xD;
      are interested in exercise. Baseline demographics and characteristics of participants offered&#xD;
      the intervention, who consent to provision of data, will be recorded and compared to the&#xD;
      demographics of those who decline to participate in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who agree to participate in Phase 2 of the study will undergo screening for&#xD;
      eligibility. Written informed consent for Phase 2 of the study will be undertaken with a 2nd&#xD;
      informed consent form. This visit will be conducted by a member of the study team at one of&#xD;
      the NHS hospital sites and current medications and medical history will be recorded, as well&#xD;
      as the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ), to provide a screening measure of&#xD;
      physical readiness for exercise. Only if the participant meets the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will they be allowed to continue into the study. Participants who do not meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be informed that they are not eligible and will be offered&#xD;
      NHS standard care. At the end of the screening visit, an accelerometer (Actigraph) will be&#xD;
      provided to participants who will be asked to wear it for seven consecutive days in order to&#xD;
      measure baseline physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return the accelerometer (from the screening visit) during the baseline&#xD;
      testing visit and will complete the Alcohol Self-Efficacy Scale, Perceived Stress Scale and&#xD;
      Short Form (SF-36) questionnaire, before having all physical health measurements (resting&#xD;
      heart rate, resting blood pressure, stature, body mass, waist circumference,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness) recorded. A venous blood sample will be collected to measure full&#xD;
      blood count and liver enzyme biomarkers, while a finger-prick capillary blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected to measure phosphatidylethanol (PEth); a marker of alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the baseline testing visit is completed, participants will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups: 1) a 12 week combined exercise (moderate/high-intensity) programme and NHS&#xD;
      standard care group (n=48), or 2) 12 weeks of NHS standard care only group (n=48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise programme will take place in a local sports centre facility in East London, and&#xD;
      will be delivered by qualified exercise coaches linked to West Ham United Football Club.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to complete two sessions each week for 12 consecutive weeks, in&#xD;
      addition to receiving NHS standard care consisting of counselling and support. Each session&#xD;
      will begin with a 30 minute education talk (covering topics regarding the physical and mental&#xD;
      health benefits of exercise and behaviour change) and will be followed by a 30-60 minute&#xD;
      exercise session. Each exercise session will begin with a standard low-intensity 10 minute&#xD;
      warm-up/stretch and end with a low-intensity 5 minute cool-down. The main body of the&#xD;
      exercise session will utilise a combination of different exercise modalities, including&#xD;
      pad-boxing, football and circuit training. The duration of exercise sessions will be&#xD;
      gradually increased as follows: Weeks 1-2: 30 minutes; Weeks 3-4: 40 minutes; Weeks 5-6: 50&#xD;
      minutes; Weeks 7-12: 60 minutes. Recruitment of participants will be split into three&#xD;
      separate intakes and each exercise group will consist of approximately 15 patients.&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise programme will be invited to participate in focus groups on the&#xD;
      3rd session (week 2) and 24th session (week 12) of the exercise programme. The two focus&#xD;
      groups will each last approximately 1 hour each and will be conducted by a member of the&#xD;
      study team who is fully trained and experienced in undertaking focus group discussions.&#xD;
      During the week 2 focus group, the topics for discussion will be the participant's knowledge&#xD;
      and beliefs regarding exercise, their barriers to being physically active, their attitude and&#xD;
      motivation to being physically active, their expectations of the exercise programme, and what&#xD;
      challenges they foresee during the programme. During the week 12 focus group, the topics for&#xD;
      discussion will be the participant's experience of the programme, the potential benefits of&#xD;
      the programme and what impact it has had on their alcohol consumption, physical health and&#xD;
      quality of life. The focus groups will be audio-recorded, with patients consent, and fully&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim, anonymized and coded. A thematic analysis will be undertaken to&#xD;
      identify recurring and salient themes that are conceptually and inherently significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomised to the NHS standard care only group will not receive the&#xD;
      exercise programme but will be provided with NHS standard care at one of the NHS study sites.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with the name of their alcohol key worker and will receive a&#xD;
      weekly one-to-one counselling alcohol addiction session lasting 1 hour where support and&#xD;
      behavioural interventions will be offered, in line with current NHS practice. Drug therapy&#xD;
      will be offered if indicated in line with standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the 12 week intervention period, participants in both the combined&#xD;
      exercise programme and NHS standard care group, and the NHS standard care only group will&#xD;
      complete 4 follow-up testing visits: at Week 13, Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48 after&#xD;
      commencement of the study. These follow-up visits will coincide with the participants&#xD;
      routine, clinically-necessary hospital visits. All follow-up visits will be conducted by a&#xD;
      member of the study team at one of the NHS hospital sites. At the start of each of the&#xD;
      follow-up visits, a member of the study team will verify that the participant is still happy&#xD;
      to continue with their participation in the study. Participants will complete the alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, physical health, mental health and physical activity questionnaires (the same as&#xD;
      the baseline testing visit) at each follow-up testing visit. The finger-prick capillary blood&#xD;
      sample, collected to measure phosphatidylethanol (PEth); a marker of alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      will only be collected at the Week 24 follow-up visit. At the end of the Week 13 and Week 48&#xD;
      visits, the participant will be given an accelerometer and asked to wear it for seven&#xD;
      consecutive days in order to measure physical activity levels over the next week. A visit&#xD;
      window of 2 weeks will be set for the Week 13 follow-up testing visit while a visit window of&#xD;
      4 weeks will be set for the Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48 follow-up testing visits to allow&#xD;
      for missed or rescheduled appointments.&#xD;
