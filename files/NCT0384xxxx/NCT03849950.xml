  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will undertake a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial to implement and&#xD;
      evaluate a proactive model of care (SMARTCare) during active cancer treatment that&#xD;
      incorporates self-management support (SMS). Patients allocated to the control arm will&#xD;
      receive care from ambulatory clinic nurses trained in SMS. Patients allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will will receive care from ambulatory clinic nurses trained in SMS, in&#xD;
      addition to being given access to a web-based, self-management education program and&#xD;
      nurse-led health coaching during the first four months following the first systemic therapy&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management describes patient's behaviours and skills to manage the physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial impact of their illness. Empirical evidence shows that patient activation in&#xD;
      self-management results in improved disease control and quality of life (QOL), and lower&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations (ED+H) and costs in other chronic&#xD;
      conditions. Previous research conducted by the investigators of this study has shown that the&#xD;
      quality of SMS in ambulatory care was poor and patients felt unprepared to manage&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicities. Building on previous work, this study will evaluate a&#xD;
      multi-faceted proactive model of care that includes: (1) training in self-management support&#xD;
      (SMS) strategies for ambulatory nursing staff; (2) a web-based self-management education&#xD;
      program for patients; and (3) provision of proactive, nurse-led health coaching during the&#xD;
      first four months following the first systemic therapy administration. Using a&#xD;
      computer-generated permuted blocks randomization scheme (permuted blocks of random size)&#xD;
      stratified by cancer type and centre, 160 evaluable patients will be enrolled across the&#xD;
      three participating regional cancer centres. 80 patients will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm and 80 to the control arm. The primary objective of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of the SMARTCare intervention to the active comparator&#xD;
      (control arm). The secondary objectives are to: (1) assess the effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      symptom control, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, patient activation&#xD;
      and self-efficacy; (2) evaluate the effect of the intervention on service outcomes: ED+H and&#xD;
      resource utilization; and (3) evaluate implementation outcomes: fidelity, adherence and&#xD;
      adoption. In addition, patients randomized to the intervention arm will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a sub-study interview at the end of the study to gain further knowledge about&#xD;
      the SMARTCare intervention components from the patient's perspective.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Assessed at 4-6 months post first dose +/- 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention to patients will be evaluated using the Intervention Acceptability Questionnaire that has been developed for the study. The 3-section questionnaire (I-Can-Manage Cancer Modules; Health Coaching Calls; Overall Acceptability) asks patients to rate agreement statements from &quot;Disagree Strongly&quot; to &quot;Agree Strongly&quot;. Individual scores for each statement in each section will be recorded.&#xD;
Audio recorded end of study qualitative interviews (approximately 30 minutes) will be conducted by a member of the study steering committee. The interviewer will follow a SMARTCare Patient Interview Guide. The guide consists of open-ended questions focusing on: (1) access, use, content and utility of the I-Can-Manage Cancer Modules; (2) logistics/timing/dose, content and utility of Health Coaching; and (3) General Comments. Interview transcripts will be analyzed in NVIVO to identify common themes.</description>
