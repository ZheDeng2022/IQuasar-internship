  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study of KN026 in subjects with HER2 positive&#xD;
      advanced breast and Gastric Cancer. The standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design was used for dose escalation.&#xD;
      There are 3 proposed dose levels which are 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, but dosing interval may be&#xD;
      adjusted during the study (such as QW, OR Q2W, OR Q3W) based on emerging data from this trial&#xD;
      and/or from phase 1 trial of KN026 in other country. Dose escalation will continue until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or if MTD is not found, dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      until the MAD of 20 mg / kg is reached.&#xD;
