      There are so many contradictions over central lymph node dissection in unilateral&#xD;
      cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated thyroid carcinoma.In order to provides a new theoretical&#xD;
      basis for the operation of central lymph node in cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer,researchers are going to complete this study to evaluate the significance of&#xD;
      contralateral central lymph node dissection in unilateral cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid carcinoma.At the same time,it may play a certain impact on the revision of surgical&#xD;
      guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Being the most common thyroid malignant tumor,differentiated thyroid carcinoma often&#xD;
      metastasize to the neck lymph nodes in the early stage,especially to the central lymph&#xD;
      node.For management of cervical lymph nodes ,the 2015 American Thyroid Association Management&#xD;
      Guidelines suggest that thyroid+Prophylactic unilateral or bilateral central lymph node&#xD;
      dissection should be undertaken in the patients with cN0(Clinically N0) progression (T3, T4)&#xD;
      and cN1b(Clinically N1b).Chinese guidelines recommend that, in order to avoid operative&#xD;
      complications as far as possible (i.e. effective protection of the parathyroid gland and&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerve), lymph node dissection in the central area on the same side of the&#xD;
      lesion should be performed at least.However, in 2017, the second edition of National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) thyroid tumor guidelines believed that if lymph nodes in&#xD;
      the central region were negative,preventive central region lymph node dissection was not&#xD;
      recommended.In conclusion,there are so many contradictions over central lymph node dissection&#xD;
      in unilateral cN0 differentiated thyroid carcinoma.However,we also can draw a conclusion that&#xD;
      it may bring some benefits if bilateral central lymph node dissection were undertaken In some&#xD;
      cases.According to researchers' preliminary clinical trials,it is not only that there is a&#xD;
      great probability of metastasis in the ipsilateral central lymph nodes , contralateral&#xD;
      metastasis is also possible,and even sometimes contralateral central lymph region metastas&#xD;
      may occur without ipsilateral central lymph nodes metastasis.In order to provides a new&#xD;
      theoretical basis for the operation of central lymph node in cN0 differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer,researchers are going to complete this study to evaluate the significance of&#xD;
      contralateral central lymph node dissection in unilateral cN0 differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma.At the same time,it may play a certain impact on the revision of surgical&#xD;
      guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;
