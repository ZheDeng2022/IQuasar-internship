    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 1358894&#xD;
      in plasma when given as oral single dose together with multiple oral doses of itraconazole&#xD;
      (Test, T) as compared to when given alone as oral single dose (Reference, R).&#xD;

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), Pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually&#xD;
             active must use adequate contraception with their female partner throughout the study&#xD;
             and until 1 month after the last administration of trial medication. Adequate methods&#xD;
             are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses an adequate contraception method&#xD;
                  in addition, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception (e.g.&#xD;
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that started at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.&#xD;
                  diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a female partner&#xD;
                  is not allowed throughout the study and until 1 month after the last&#xD;
                  administration of trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
