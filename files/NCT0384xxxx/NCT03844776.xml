      There was no evidence to judge the effects of preventative antibiotics for extractions of&#xD;
      severely decayed teeth, teeth in diseased gums, or extractions in patients who are sick or&#xD;
      have low immunity to infection. Undertaking research in these groups of people may not be&#xD;
      possible or ethical. However, it is likely that in situations where patients are at a higher&#xD;
      risk of infection that preventative antibiotics may be beneficial, because infections in this&#xD;
      group are likely to be more frequent and more difficult to treat To the best of knowledge, no&#xD;
      adult study has compared the effects of single dose of Co-Amoxiclave and full oral course&#xD;
      before or after dentoalveolar surgery. The current study has formally considered this&#xD;
      comparison as a potential valuable trail for reducing the postoperative complications in&#xD;
      adult patients who have had surgical removal of teeth under LA.&#xD;

      A comparison of single preoperative dose of Co-amoxiclav versus postoperative full course of&#xD;
      Amoxicillin/ Co-amoxiclav in prevention of postoperative complications in dentoalveolar&#xD;
      surgery: a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background considerations Prophylactic antibiotics and corticoid in a single dose regimen did&#xD;
      not bring any benefit on mandibular third molar surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth extraction is a surgical treatment to remove teeth that are affected by decay or gum&#xD;
      disease or impacted wisdom teeth or those causing pain or inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of infection after extracting wisdom teeth from healthy young people is about 10%;&#xD;
      however, it may be up to 25% in patients who are already sick or have low immunity.&#xD;
      Infectious complications include swelling, pain, pus drainage, fever, and also dry socket.&#xD;
      Treatment of these infections is generally simple and involves patients receiving antibiotics&#xD;
      and drainage of infection from the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of Antibiotics to prevent&#xD;
      complications following tooth extractions. The findings revealed that there is evidence that&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of infection, dry socket and pain following third&#xD;
      molar extraction and result in an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. However,&#xD;
      patients at a higher risk of infection are more likely to benefit from prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics, because infections in this group are likely to be more frequent, associated with&#xD;
      complications and be more difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry socket is a complication that occurs frequently after tooth extraction, causing&#xD;
      discomfort to the patient, pain, and a fetid odor. Another study was carried out to&#xD;
      investigatethe incidence and risk factors which played the main role in dry socket following&#xD;
      surgical removal of impacted third molar in an Iranian population. The outcome of this study&#xD;
      revealed that the incidence of dry socket was 19.14%. Age, gender, systemic disorder, and&#xD;
      antibiotics use prior to surgery revealed no significant associations with dry socket.&#xD;
      However, incidence of dry socket was significantly relevant to smoking, oral contraceptive&#xD;
      use, menstruation cycle, difficulty of the surgery according to pre-surgery radiograph&#xD;
      evaluation and perception of surgeon post-surgery, length of surgery, and number of carpules&#xD;
      used to reach anesthesia. Tolstunov's study demonstrated that the post-extraction socket&#xD;
      bleeding is very important for the proper uncomplicated socket healing. If the irrigation&#xD;
      solution has not used at the end of extraction, the normal blood clot has a higher likelihood&#xD;
      to form, and therefore, can potentially lead to an uncomplicated socket healing without&#xD;
      development of alveolar osteitis. Socket bleeding at the extraction site creates a favorable&#xD;
      environment for the formation of a blood clot - a protective dressing - necessary for a&#xD;
      favorable osseous healing of the socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was no evidence to judge the effects of preventative antibiotics for extractions of&#xD;
      severely decayed teeth, teeth in diseased gums, or extractions in patients who are sick or&#xD;
      have low immunity to infection. Undertaking research in these groups of people may not be&#xD;
      possible or ethical. However, it is likely that in situations where patients are at a higher&#xD;
      risk of infection that preventative antibiotics may be beneficial, because infections in this&#xD;
      group are likely to be more frequent and more difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of knowledge, no adult study has compared the effects of single dose of&#xD;
      Co-Amoxiclave and full oral course before or after dentoalveolar surgery. The current study&#xD;
      has formally considered this comparison as a potential valuable trail for reducing the&#xD;
      postoperative complications in adult patients who have had surgical removal of teeth under&#xD;
      LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single prophylactic dose of&#xD;
      Co-Amoxiclave and full oral course in preventing postoperative complications (PC) after a&#xD;
      surgical removal of upper and lower teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods This randomized double-blind clinical trial included 50 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with dentoalveolar surgery. Patients received either preoperative single dose of&#xD;
      625mg Co-Amoxiclav and 1g paracetamol associated with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash or&#xD;
      postoperative full course of Co-Amoxiclav for 5 days with 0.9% normal saline irrigation or&#xD;
      postoperative full course of amoxicillin 500 mg for five days with 0.9% normal saline&#xD;
      irrigation. Patients were reviewed 5 days following the surgery and evaluated if they had&#xD;
      alveolar infection, alveolar osteitis, trismus, edema and pain. Difficulty of surgery was&#xD;
      reported by the surgeon by using (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty five patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be involved in the study and&#xD;
      undergo surgical removal of their teeth. . Patients refusing the preoperative dose of oral&#xD;
      co-amoxiclav, and unwilling to take part were excluded. Patients who are allergic either to&#xD;
      co-amoxiclve or amoxicillin were also excluded. To be included in the study, the tooth must&#xD;
      need surgery and require an osteotomy for extraction with use of a motorised drill. Patients&#xD;
      will be divided in 3 groups according to the follow up protocol. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of three groups. Patients and assessor will not be aware of the exact&#xD;
      treatment which will carry out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 1: 0.9% normal saline irrigation immediately after the surgery with course of&#xD;
           Co-Amoxiclav 625 mg 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash following the surgery for 5 days&#xD;
           (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 2: 625 mg Co-Amoxiclav and 1g Paracetamol preoperatively and 0.2%&#xD;
           chlorhexidine mouthwash immediately before the surgery with course of Metronidazole 500&#xD;
           mg and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash following the surgery for 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 3: 625 mg Co-Amoxiclav and 1g Paracetamol preoperatively and 0.2%&#xD;
           chlorhexidine mouthwash immediately before the surgery with course of amoxicillin 500 mg&#xD;
           and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash following the surgery for 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be done under local anaesthesia. A standard extraction technique of&#xD;
      surgery will be employed for the patient in first group. This include a buccal full-thickness&#xD;
      flap, buccal trough (osteotomy) and extraction of the tooth), followed by a traditional&#xD;
      end-of-surgery debridement protocol consisting of a gentle curettage, socket irrigation with&#xD;
      approximately 5 ml of sterile normal saline solution , socket suctioning and placement of&#xD;
      stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of alveolar osteitis may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. An empty socket, which is partially or totally devoid of blood clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exposed bone may be visible or the clot may be filled with food debris which&#xD;
                reveals the exposed bone once it is removed. The exposed bone is extremely painful&#xD;
                to touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Surrounding inflamed soft tissues may overlie the socket and hide the dry socket&#xD;
                from casual examination (Daly et al., 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomsof alveolar osteitis may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Dull, aching, throbbing pain in the area of the socket, which is moderate to severe&#xD;
                and may radiate to other parts of the head such as the ear, temple and neck. The&#xD;
                pain normally starts on the second to fourth day after the extraction,[ and may&#xD;
                last 10-40 days.The pain may be so strong that even strong analgesics do not&#xD;
                relieve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intraoral halitosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Bad taste in the mouth (Fragiskos, 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs and symptoms of oral infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Oral swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Tenderness with touch&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Pus drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Difficulty fully opening your mouth or swallowing. Power calculation A study with&#xD;
                45 subjects was reported to have 90% power to detect a difference in success rate&#xD;
                of 21% (Bortoluzzi et al, 2013) in a continuous outcome measure assuming a&#xD;
                significance level of 5% and a correlation of 0.5 between responses from the&#xD;
                different subjects.&#xD;
