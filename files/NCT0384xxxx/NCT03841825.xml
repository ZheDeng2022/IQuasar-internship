    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment (i.e. braces) makes it hard to keep good oral hygiene. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research study is to compare the use of text message reminders versus multiple in-person&#xD;
      sessions of oral hygiene instructions and motivation on improving oral hygiene measurements.&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last up to 6 months and will consist of 4 study visits to&#xD;
      the VCU Orthodontic clinic which are also regular visits for treatment. Measurements to&#xD;
      assess participant's oral health will be taken during these visits. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups which may include receiving different types of text&#xD;
      messages, repeated in-person oral hygiene instructions, or both, or neither.&#xD;
