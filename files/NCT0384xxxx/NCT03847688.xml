  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating illness. It affects a person's&#xD;
      family and personal relationships, work, education, and life. It changes sleeping and eating&#xD;
      habits and significantly impairs patients' general health. The disorder affects Veterans more&#xD;
      than the general population, both as an isolated illness and in conjunction with&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidality. Symptoms in a notable proportion of&#xD;
      patients (~30%) do not respond to behavioral and pharmacological interventions, and new&#xD;
      treatments are in great need. One such treatment, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),&#xD;
      has been cleared by Food and Drug Administration for treatment in MDD. TMS is effective in&#xD;
      around 60% of patients with treatment-resistant MDD but is associated with significant&#xD;
      financial and time burden. Further insights into the neurobiological effects of TMS and&#xD;
      markers for functional recovery prediction and treatment progression are of great value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal is to use human electrophysiology (electroencephalography,&#xD;
      hereafter EEG, in particular) and machine learning to predict treatment response in&#xD;
      candidates for TMS treatment and also study TMS's mechanism of action. Doing so has several&#xD;
      benefits for patients, as prediction of treatment helps providers in screening out the&#xD;
      patients for whom TMS is ineffective and understanding the mechanism allows us to refine and&#xD;
      individualize the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 35 patients with treatment-resistant MDD and record resting&#xD;
      state EEG signal with a dense electrode array before and after a 6-week clinical course of&#xD;
      TMS treatment. The investigators will use machine learning (Sparse regressions) to predict&#xD;
      treatment outcome using functional connectivity (Coherence) maps derived from the EEG signal.&#xD;
      The investigators also will use classifiers to track changes in functional connectivity&#xD;
      through the course of treatment. Based on our preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that weaker functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex (where the stimulation is&#xD;
      delivered) and parietal/posterior midline sites predict better response to treatment and that&#xD;
      TMS treatment will enhance these connections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected here would be used as a seed and preliminary data for future federal (NIH&#xD;
      and the VA) career development awards which will focus on the use of EEG to better understand&#xD;
      brain function and neuromodulation treatments.&#xD;
