  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It can be difficult to differentiate cellulitis from non-infectious mimics, like venous&#xD;
      stasis. One way of determining the difference is feeling skin surface temperature. However,&#xD;
      this is a subjective measure that is inherently unreliable. It might be possible to objectify&#xD;
      this measurement by using a non-contact infrared thermometer at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is therefore to assess whether objective difference in skin surface&#xD;
      temperature in an area of suspected cellulitis, relative to non-affected skin, has diagnostic&#xD;
      utility. It will use the diagnosis of cellulitis by an infectious diseases physician as the&#xD;
      gold standard and compare blinded temperature difference between affected and unaffected&#xD;
      limbs to that standard. It is hypothesized that measurement of skin surface temperature by&#xD;
      non-contact infrared thermometer will help differentiate cellulitis from many non-infectious&#xD;
      conditions that mimic cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who are hospitalized, the study also plans to see whether a change in this&#xD;
      temperature difference is predictive of response to treatment when compared to the FDA&#xD;
      standard for early response and patient reported symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic, prospective cohort study. Patients with suspected cellulitis who receive&#xD;
      an infectious diseases consult (in the emergency room or urgent clinic) will be approached&#xD;
      for consent and enrollment. The goal is to enroll approximately 50 patients with a minimum of&#xD;
      10-15 cases of non-cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurements will not be made available to the treating teams. This is an observational&#xD;
      study only comparing the potential value of these measurements to usual clinical care.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who undergo an infectious diseases consultation for suspected cellulitis of the upper or lower limbs are eligible to be enrolled. Patients who consent to participation will have chart data extracted and undergo a skin surface temperature measurement of the affected area and surrounding skin using a commercially available infrared thermometer. The dimensions of suspected cellulitis are also measured.&#xD;
Patients with cellulitis admitted to hospital undergo daily measurements of temperature and dimensions. These patients are also asked standardized questions about their symptoms based on the patient global impression of improvement scale.</description>
