  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The criteria usually considered to evaluate the quality of life are the presence or absence&#xD;
      of a stomy, alteration of the transit or the sexual dysfunctions. Quality of life has been&#xD;
      improved by introducing an Enhanced Postoperative Rehabilitation Program After Surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS). It is a multidisciplinary medical and paramedical care aimed at minimizing the&#xD;
      sources of stress allowing a significant reduction in postoperative complications and length&#xD;
      of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the emotional feelings of patients, their fatigue, the quality of their&#xD;
      relationships with others and their experience of the disease are not usually considered.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, these criteria influence the quality of life and constitute the fundamental&#xD;
      bases of the psychological well-being, essential in the recovery processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to enrich the ERAS program by introducing an individualized support of well-being&#xD;
      and stress management aimed at increasing the quality of life of patients. The purpose is to&#xD;
      make the patient more autonomous by allowing him/her, to implement stress management&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the project is to improve the psychological well-being of patients operated&#xD;
      on for colorectal cancer by offering stress management sessions in order to promote&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to demonstrate the impact of stress management sessions on the&#xD;
      length of stay and to study the link between the efficiency of these sessions and the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients before the surgery.&#xD;
