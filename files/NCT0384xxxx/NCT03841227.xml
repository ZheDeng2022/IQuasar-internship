  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the central component of fibromyalgia (FM), the focus of research on current&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches has been techniques that may modify the dysfunctional neuroplasticity&#xD;
      process, such as transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation in order to counteract the&#xD;
      dysfunction responsible for triggering and maintain the symptoms of FM. Although this&#xD;
      technique is gaining space in research and in the clinical scenario, many questions remain to&#xD;
      be answered, such as time of treatment, place to be stimulated and neurophysiological&#xD;
      clarification of the mechanisms involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the presented scenario, the present project was organized, being a double-blinded&#xD;
      parallel randomized controlled trial with 20 female patients with FM diagnosed according to&#xD;
      the criteria of the American Society of Rheumatology (2010 - reviewed in 2016) between 19 and&#xD;
      65 years of age, randomized to receive active or simulated anodic pole over the left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (10 patients in each group). Twenty 20-minute&#xD;
      sessions, with a current intensity of 2 milliamperes, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to respond to the objectives of this study, the IFC will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      after the intervention, through rs-fMRI using seed-based correlation analysis (SCA). The&#xD;
      investigators have a secondary objective to correlate structural connectivity through the&#xD;
      technique of diffusion tensors imaging (DTI) with measures of pain, functional capacity,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and catastrophism to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that in FM there is a syndrome of dysfunction in basal intrinsic functional&#xD;
      connectivity (IFC) and that the tDCS has a neuromodulatory effect capable of reducing&#xD;
      connectivity between brain areas related to chronic pain and other neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      components of FM, such as the ventrolateral thalamus, cortex motor, prefrontal cortex,&#xD;
      insular cortex, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray matter, among others. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that a higher cortico-thalamic IFC and between regions with high density of opioid&#xD;
      receptors have a positive predictive response in the treatment of tDCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome that is characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, unrepairable sleep, cognitive alterations, depressive and neurovegetative symptoms,&#xD;
      whose neurobiological process is multiple and complex. Although it is of great relevance to&#xD;
      the individual and to society, this pathology often does not receive the necessary attention&#xD;
      by the organs that define the priorities of health care. Population prevalence, according to&#xD;
      the criteria of the American Society of Rheumatology, reaches 5.4%, and the costs of care,&#xD;
      taxes and early retirement due to disability are estimated at more than the US $ 29 billion&#xD;
      per year in the United States. It is known that conventional pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      produce insignificant responses in more than 50% of patients. It is postulated that these&#xD;
      high rates of failure are due in part to a lack of knowledge about pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms. What is known so far is that the peripheral mechanisms contribute to the FM&#xD;
      picture, but dysfunction in central neurobiological pathways surely commands the process,&#xD;
      perpetuating the dysfunctional process that includes central sensitization (CS). CS comprises&#xD;
      the symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome that culminates in a state of hypersensitivity that&#xD;
      expresses the imbalance of the excitation/inhibition processes that sustain this condition of&#xD;
      non-pathological pain. Functional alterations of the motor cortex and its connections with&#xD;
      subcortical structures that constitute the neuromatrix of pain have now been demonstrated.&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)&#xD;
      technique, has also demonstrated that high intrinsic functional connectivity (IFC) is related&#xD;
      to pain intensity on FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the central component of FM, the focus of research on current therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches has been techniques that may modify the dysfunctional neuroplasticity process,&#xD;
      such as transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation in order to counteract the dysfunction&#xD;
      responsible for triggering and maintain the symptoms of FM. Although this technique is&#xD;
      gaining space in research and in the clinical scenario, many questions remain to be answered,&#xD;
      such as time of treatment, place to be stimulated and neurophysiological clarification of the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the presented scenario, the present project was organized, being a double-blinded&#xD;
      parallel randomized controlled trial with 20 female patients with FM diagnosed according to&#xD;
      the criteria of the American Society of Rheumatology (2010 - reviewed in 2016) between 19 and&#xD;
      65 years of age, randomized to receive active or simulated anodic pole over the left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (10 patients in each group). Twenty 20 minute&#xD;
      sessions, with a current intensity of 2 milliampere, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to respond to the objectives of this study, the IFC will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      after the intervention, through rs-fMRI using seed-based correlation analysis (SCA). The&#xD;
      investigators have a secondary objective to correlate structural connectivity through the&#xD;
      technique of diffusion tensors imaging (DTI) with measures of pain, functional capacity,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and catastrophism to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that in FM there is a syndrome of dysfunction in basal IFC and that the&#xD;
      tDCS has a neuromodulatory effect capable of reducing connectivity between brain areas&#xD;
      related to chronic pain and other neuropsychiatric components of FM, such as the&#xD;
      ventrolateral thalamus, cortex motor, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, hippocampus,&#xD;
      periaqueductal gray matter, among others. The investigators believe that a higher&#xD;
      cortico-thalamic IFC and between regions with high density of opioid receptors have a&#xD;
      positive predictive response in the treatment of tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypothesis is proven, the IFC data may serve as a biological marker associated with&#xD;
      the perception of pain and its clinical presentation, and consequently, open the possibility&#xD;
      of including IFC as a diagnostic parameter and therapeutic response. In addition to the&#xD;
      possible contribution to knowledge production, this project aims to transfer the technology&#xD;
      acquired and developed to the community, and thus benefit millions of people suffering from&#xD;
      chronic FM pain with limited diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives, as well as extending&#xD;
      the knowledge acquired for other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression.&#xD;
