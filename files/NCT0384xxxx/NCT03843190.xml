  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators approach will be a 12-month cluster randomized trial with a waitlist&#xD;
      control that recruits 240 older AA women through public housing communities and senior&#xD;
      centers in North Carolina. The rationale for these aims is that the successful completion is&#xD;
      expected to provide evidence that a community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a&#xD;
      national infrastructure can help a vulnerable, underserved population lose weight and improve&#xD;
      their physical function. For older, obese, frail individuals, this could improve their CVD&#xD;
      risk factors, quality of life, enhance their health; reduce their healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      illness, and disability; and decrease their adverse geriatric outcomes. After completing&#xD;
      these aims, the investigators expect that they will have proven that the community-based,&#xD;
      peer-led weight loss program can improve both weight and physical function among older, obese&#xD;
      AA women. This also could help other demographic groups with obesity and poor physical&#xD;
      function. Eventually, it could help older adults maintain their health and independence in&#xD;
      the community&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older African American (AA) women have the highest prevalence of both obesity and frailty. In&#xD;
      academic, expert-led interventions, obese, frail, older individuals both lost weight and&#xD;
      improved their physical function. However, because of high personnel costs and nonexistent&#xD;
      nationwide infrastructure, large-scale implementation of these interventions is impractical.&#xD;
      The long-term goals are to eliminate the health disparities of obesity and frailty in older&#xD;
      AA women. This proposal's overall objective is to determine the effects of a low-cost,&#xD;
      community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure on obesity,&#xD;
      physical function, and healthcare utilization in older AA women. To treat obesity and frailty&#xD;
      in older AA women, it is critical to test a weight loss intervention that 1) has preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of benefit; 2) is acceptable to older AA women; 3) is affordable; and 4) can be&#xD;
      broadly disseminated. Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) is a national, nonprofit,&#xD;
      community-based, peer-led weight loss program that meets these criteria. First, the&#xD;
      applicant's retrospective database analyses of TOPS showed two important results: 1)&#xD;
      Participants who renew their annual membership lose and maintain significant weight loss&#xD;
      (SWL) for up to 7 years; and 2) Compared to their younger counterparts, older women are more&#xD;
      likely to achieve SWL. Second, the applicant started three TOPS chapters for older AA women&#xD;
      in a successful pilot study. Though the study ended in 2012, one of the chapters is still&#xD;
      active almost 6 years later. Third, TOPS is affordable; it only costs $92 annually. Finally,&#xD;
      TOPS has a nationwide infrastructure with chapters in all 50 states. Since obese, frail,&#xD;
      older individuals in academic, expert-led weight loss interventions can improve their&#xD;
      physical function, the central hypothesis is that a low cost, community-based, peer-led&#xD;
      weight loss program with a national infrastructure can provide SWL, improved physical&#xD;
      function, and lower healthcare utilization for AA women, an underserved, vulnerable&#xD;
      population. The rationale for the proposed research is that TOPS and academic, expert-led&#xD;
      weight loss interventions share components critical to successful weight loss; therefore,&#xD;
      TOPS can deliver similar outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the&#xD;
      following aims in obese, frail, older AA women: Determine the effect of TOPS on 1) weight&#xD;
      change and cardiovascular disease risk factors; 2) physical function and quality of life; and&#xD;
      3) healthcare utilization. This project is innovative because it uses a &quot;community to&#xD;
      academia&quot; approach to treat the health disparities; our study population focuses on older AA&#xD;
      women with decreased physical function; our outcomes focus on weight, physical function, and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization; and our unique study settings. The proposed research is significant&#xD;
      because determining the real-world effectiveness of the TOPS program and its impact on&#xD;
      weight, physical function, and healthcare utilization in AA women can have a widespread&#xD;
      impact on the older population at large. Thus, it has the potential to reduce adverse&#xD;
      geriatric outcomes among all older individuals.&#xD;
