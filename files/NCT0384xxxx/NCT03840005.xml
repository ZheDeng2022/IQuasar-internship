  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the potential of Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to slow down&#xD;
      the progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in a randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, &quot;proof of concept&quot; study. The primary objective of the study will be to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in patients with PD. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited form a cohort of patients who have been diagnosed with PD within the last 3 years&#xD;
      and are potentially suitable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence from previous research and the work carried out by other groups that&#xD;
      UDCA rescues the function of the mitochondria (mitochondria are the &quot;powerhouse&quot; of the cell)&#xD;
      in PD patient tissue and other models of PD. This suggests that UDCA may slow down the&#xD;
      worsening of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UDCA has been in clinical use for the treatment of liver disease (primary biliary&#xD;
      cholangitis) for over 30 years. The investigators therefore know that it is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with liver disease but the investigators don't know yet whether this is&#xD;
      also the case in patients with PD. Furthermore, the dose used for patients with liver disease&#xD;
      (15 mg/kg) is not high enough for UDCA to get into the brain. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      need to double the dose to 30 mg/kg. This higher dose was also safe in clinical trials for&#xD;
      liver disease, but is currently not used routinely in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to generate clinical data to examine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability &amp; potential effectiveness of 48 weeks exposure to UDCA compared to placebo.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will determine the usefulness of novel objective readouts (namely the&#xD;
      objective sensor based quantification of motor progression &amp; 31P-MRS/imaging-based in vivo&#xD;
      quantification of ATP) which may allow a reduction of the sample size (&amp; thus cost) of future&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre parallel group trial in&#xD;
      patients with PD who have been diagnosed ≤ 3 years ago. 30 patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      UDCA at a dose of 30 mg/kg or matched placebo using a 2:1 split (20 patients on UDCA, 10 on&#xD;
      placebo). This will include 48 week exposure period &amp; a subsequent 8 week washout period.&#xD;
      Detailed evaluations of all patients will take place at Screening, Baseline, 12, 24, 36, 48 &amp;&#xD;
      56 weeks. The trial medication will be taken at 3 equal doses per day, to be taken orally&#xD;
      with food. The dose will be increased gradually by 250 mg (1 capsule) every 3 days until&#xD;
      patient reaches a dose of 30 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Contact 1 (Telephone Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to the site staff having received a reply slip from the patient indicating their&#xD;
      interest to participate in the study, a suitable time &amp; date will be arranged with the&#xD;
      respective patient to undergo telephone screening by a member of the research team to check&#xD;
      potential eligibility, including a brief review of relevant medical history. The Chief&#xD;
      Investigator (CI)/ Principal Investigator (PI) will check the screening record made after the&#xD;
      telephone screening call. Any patients not deemed eligible to be invited for their screening&#xD;
      visit will be contacted by a member of the research team to inform them of this outcome.&#xD;
      Patients deemed eligible will be invited to a screening visit. The date of diagnosis &amp;&#xD;
      confirmation of the PD diagnosis &amp; any other uncertainties relating to the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed subsequent to this telephone screening&#xD;
      assessment for those patients who seem eligible but are outside the Sheffield Teaching&#xD;
      Hospitals (STH)/ University College London Hospitals (UCLH) geographical area by requesting&#xD;
      copies of relevant clinic letters or contacting their PD Clinical Consultants directly. The&#xD;
      telephone screening call will be repeated if the patient cannot attend visit 0 (screening&#xD;
      visit) within 1-8 weeks to ensure that s/he would still fulfil the telephone screening&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telephone screening call will not be undertaken for study patients who are already&#xD;
      patients of either site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0: Screening (Time -1 - 8 weeks prior to baseline visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit the research team will answer any further questions, check the patient's&#xD;
      eligibility for the study as far as possible and, if the patient wishes to participate in the&#xD;
      study, obtain written consent. A clinical diagnosis of PD is based on the opinion of the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI) after review of the patient's clinical history, examination&#xD;
      findings &amp; response to PD medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written informed consent process will be undertaken by the PI or by an appropriately&#xD;
      trained member of the research team as delegated by the PI/ CI. This study will not include&#xD;
      vulnerable patients or patients who lack capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI (or authorised delegate) will complete the following screening assessments/procedures&#xD;
      with the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/Exclusion Review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information &amp; medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data regarding PD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous genetic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of date for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by PIs or other experts in&#xD;
           movement disorders (this may include review of medical records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination (including assessment of modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage), including&#xD;
           weight, height &amp;vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montgomery-Asberg Depression rating scale (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of post-menopausal state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety bloods (full blood count, urea &amp; electrolytes, liver function tests, blood&#xD;
           glucose, HbA1C, lipid profile)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum sample (approach. 20 ml stored at -80 degrees Celsius)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of physical activity monitor &amp; activity diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the patient fulfils the immediate eligibility criteria, arrangements will be&#xD;
      made for the patient to attend a baseline appointment approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      screening visit. This interval enables review of the patient's blood results to confirm final&#xD;
      eligibility. If more than 8 weeks have elapsed since the screening visit, the screening visit&#xD;
      &amp; screening assessments should be repeated before proceeding to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study but who are subsequently found not to meet the study&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be contacted by the research nurse or other member of the research&#xD;
      team to inform them that they are not eligible to join the study. If any concerns about the&#xD;
      patient's health or well-being are identified from out-of-range blood results or abnormal&#xD;
      assessment scores, a member of the research team will inform the patient's General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following written consent, randomisation will take place at the baseline visit. All patients&#xD;
      will be assigned a unique patient ID number at screening that will link all of the clinical&#xD;
      information collected for them on the study database, these will be in the format Sxx/nnnn;&#xD;
      where xx is a unique number assigned to the site by the Trial Manager &amp; nnnn is a unique&#xD;
      number starting at 0001 &amp;incrementing by 1. Once the patient ID number has been entered, the&#xD;
      system will supply a randomisation number which will identify the treatment pack to be&#xD;
      dispensed. The randomisation will be 2:1 in favour of UDCA. The randomization system will&#xD;
      stratify by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site Study Teams&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local PI, supported by an appropriate member of the research team will monitor patient&#xD;
      well-being, record adverse events, titrate &amp;prescribe study medication. Since the 'treating'&#xD;
      nurse or doctor will review all blood results &amp; be aware of any reported side effects, a&#xD;
      separate member of the research team will act as a blinded assessor, undertaking the&#xD;
      MDS-UPDRS &amp; other outcome measures after appropriate training. Ideally the blinded assessor&#xD;
      will undertake the MDS-UPDRS Part 3 with the patient in the &quot;OFF&quot; state, followed by the&#xD;
      complete MDS-UPDRS, Non-Motor Symptom assessment Scale (NMS-Quest) &amp; MADRS once the patient&#xD;
      is in the &quot;ON&quot; state. The practically defined &quot;OFF&quot; medication state refers to the patient&#xD;
      assessment conducted in the absence of their regular medication with the aim of exposing the&#xD;
      severity of the underlying PD. Efforts should be made to ensure that the same outcome&#xD;
      assessor is present at all visits but sites should identify back-up personnel to cover staff&#xD;
      absences &amp; avoid cross-over of 'assessing' &amp;'treating' team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will attend a further clinic visit where baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      performed. Results of blood tests &amp; ECG will be reviewed prior to baseline evaluation to&#xD;
      ensure patient eligibility. They will be asked to attend in the &quot;practically defined OFF&quot;&#xD;
      state. The following assessment will be undertaken in the &quot;practically defined OFF&quot; state:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of eligibility/inclusion/exclusion review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of any Adverse Events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optogait &amp;Opals sensor-based objective quantification of motor impairment (Sheffield&#xD;
           Patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be invited to take their PD medication following the assessment. The PI or&#xD;
      authorised delegate will record any reported serious adverse events &amp; changes to concomitant&#xD;
      medications, including PD medication. In addition, the predicted progression will be&#xD;
      calculated, following the model developed by Williams-Gray &amp; co-workers. The Prognostic Model&#xD;
      developed by Williams-Gray &amp;co-workers identified the following three parameters as&#xD;
      associated with more rapid PD progression: 1. Higher age, 2. Higher UPDRS motor examination&#xD;
      axial score (items 27-30), 3. Lower animal naming fluency (patients will be asked to name as&#xD;
      many animals as possible in a 1-minute time frame). The assessor will then complete the&#xD;
      following procedures with the patient in the &quot;practically defined ON&quot; stage (typically 30-60&#xD;
      min after patient has taken PD symptomatic medication):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDS-UPDRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NMS-Quest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDQ-39&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31P- MRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample for genetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety bloods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of patient diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return of physical activity monitor &amp;activity diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised at this visit to receive either active of placebo medication (2:1&#xD;
      ratio). The PI or appropriately delegated medically qualified member of the study team will&#xD;
      complete &amp;sign a study-specific prescription form for presentation to pharmacy by the&#xD;
      patient. The prescription form will details the baseline medication allocation print-out from&#xD;
      the randomisation computer system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be provided with a study-specific diary by their local research team at the&#xD;
      baseline visit, in which to record any alterations in the dose of trial medication or&#xD;
      concomitant medications taken. Patients should be advised to contact the study team promptly&#xD;
      should they develop loose stools rather than waiting for the next study visit or scheduled&#xD;
      telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: 12 week follow-up clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend a clinic visit twelve weeks after the baseline visit, having taken all&#xD;

    <description>Motor symptoms will be measured using the MDS-UPDRS part 3 motor subsection. Part III of the scale will be completed at baseline, visit 3 (24 weeks), visit 5 (48 weeks).&#xD;
The scale consists of four parts; Part I &quot;Non-motor experiences of daily living&quot; (13 questions), Part II &quot;Motor Experiences of daily living&quot; (13), Part III &quot;Motor Examination&quot; (33) and Part IV &quot;Motor Complications&quot; (6). Each question has five responses that are linked to common clinical terms: 0=Normal, 1=Slight, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe. Whereas each response is tailored to the question, the progression of impairment is based on consistent infrastructure. &quot;Slight&quot; refers to symptoms with sufficiently low frequency/intensity to cause no impact on function; &quot;Mild&quot; refers to symptoms of frequency/intensity sufficient to cause modest impact on function; &quot;Moderate&quot; refers to symptoms sufficiently frequent/intense to impact considerably, but not prevent, function; &quot;Severe&quot; refers to symptoms that prevent function.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: PD is a clinical diagnosis as defined by the Queen&#xD;
        Square Brain Bank criteria (bradykinesia defined as slowness of initiation of voluntary&#xD;
        movement with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude on repetitive actions and at&#xD;
        least one of the following: Rigidity, 4-6 Hz rest tremor). The diagnosis will have been&#xD;
        made by the treating clinician and confirmed by the PI on site after review of the clinical&#xD;
        history, examination findings and response to PD medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Queen Square brain bank criteria MAY be used to help assist in the diagnosis although&#xD;
        this need not be a formal inclusion criteria, and the relevance of a positive family&#xD;
        history of PD, or a confirmed genetic basis for an individual's symptoms will be evaluated&#xD;
        in the context of other clinical features in determining diagnosis and eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease ≤ 3 years ago by a clinician with particular&#xD;
             expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders (typically one of the&#xD;
             PIs or their consultant colleagues). The date of diagnosis will be verified by a&#xD;
             review of the medical records.&#xD;
