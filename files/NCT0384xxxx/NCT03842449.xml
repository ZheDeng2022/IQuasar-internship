  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France is the country of Europe where the prevalence of pregnant women smokers is the highest&#xD;
      (35.9% before pregnancy and in the 3rd quarter 21.8% in 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator's country, among the smokers of early pregnancy with the usual care, only&#xD;
      30% manage to stop during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a clearly identified risk factor for the course of&#xD;
      pregnancy and the unborn child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) expired in pregnancy monitoring consultation is part&#xD;
      of the recommendations of the consensus conference &quot;Pregnancy and Tobacco&quot; (ANAES, October&#xD;
      2004) and the parliamentary report on smoking by JL Touraine and D. Jacquat (Feb 2012).&#xD;
      However, this recommendation has not entered the current practice. The research aims to&#xD;
      justify the clinical relevance of this recommendation by demonstrating the positive impact of&#xD;
      expired CO measurement on the rate of discontinuation during pregnancy.&#xD;
