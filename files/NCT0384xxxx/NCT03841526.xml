      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      crossover comparison in a clinical research center (CRC) setting, followed by a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, partially double-blinded, 3-arm parallel comparison in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of Glucagon Ready-to-Use (RTU) to&#xD;
      prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia (EIH) in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D),&#xD;
      who perform regular, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise.&#xD;

Subjects are asked to rate from 0=not confident at all (min.) to 3=extremely confident (max.), their level of confidence in avoiding severe problems with hypoglycemia during 5 common specific situations and 3 general situations relevant to people with diabetes. Subject is asked using the same scale to rate their perception of their spouse/partner's confidence in the subject's ability to avoid serious problems due to hypoglycemia.
