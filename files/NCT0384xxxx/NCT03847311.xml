    <textblock>
      Cancer in general, and breast cancer in specific, is a significant health problem in the USA&#xD;
      and the rest of the world. With the improvement of new surgical approaches and chemotherapies&#xD;
      to manage breast cancer, the number of patients with breast cancer are now living longer.&#xD;
      This great achievement created an unexpected problem. For some breast cancer patients, with&#xD;
      bone metastases, the pain is worse than the cancer. The golden standard to manage pain is&#xD;
      opioids. Patients with cancer-induced bone pain are now taking increasing doses of opioids to&#xD;
      control their pain. Sadly, opioids come with significant side effects that limit the amount&#xD;
      of opioids that can be safely given. Many attempts have been tried to create better regiments&#xD;
      for pain control to lower the need for opioids. There has not been significant success in&#xD;
      that area. A better approach would be to add a non-opioid agent that has dual mechanisms of&#xD;
      action. This may create synergism to better control pain while lowering the doses of opioids&#xD;
      needed and lowering side effects. Sulfasalazine poses such quality it is a safe&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug with established safety profile. It has been in use for over 50 years&#xD;
      for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. In addition to its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory characteristics, sulfasalazine has the capacity to decrease the survival of&#xD;
      cancer cells, also to lower the number of inflammatory mediators released by cancer cells. In&#xD;
      short, sulfasalazine inhibit the influx of cysteine into cancer cells and the efflux of&#xD;
      glutamate. Cysteine is needed for cell survival against oxidative stress, while glutamate&#xD;
      activate pain receptors. Therefore, sulfasalazine will act as anti-inflammatory, an agent to&#xD;
      accelerate cancer cells death and decreasing the released glutamate which activate pain&#xD;
      receptors. This one agent with 3 mechanisms of actions may lower the amount of opioid needed&#xD;
      for these patients while maintaining or improving their pain. Lowering of opioid dosing may&#xD;
      also improve the side effects associated with opioid use. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      co-administer sulfasalazine with opioids to cancer patients and characterize their pain and&#xD;
      the opioid use. Our hypothesis is that adding sulfasalazine to the pain medication, will&#xD;
      lower the amount of opioids used and lower the side effects. This may improve the quality of&#xD;
      life for patients and decrease the risks of using high amount of opioids for the patients,&#xD;
      their families, and society in general.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, approximately one in two men and one in three women will develop&#xD;
      cancer. Today, more than 15 million people live with cancer in the United States alone. The&#xD;
      direct annual medical cost of cancer is over 86 billion US dollars. The indirect cost,&#xD;
      representing loss of wages and productivity, exceeds 130 billion US dollars annually. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 90% of all cancer patients report pain. About 63% of patients with advanced&#xD;
      stage cancer or with metastasis suffer from pain that is classified as &quot;moderate to severe&quot;.&#xD;
      The majority of cancer patients suffer from excruciating pain. Even those who survive cancer&#xD;
      may still experience pain. Of all cancer survivors, 59% report pain secondary to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Even after patients are cured from their cancer, 33% of these patients will&#xD;
      still suffer from severe pain due to their chemotherapy. Inadequate pain management results&#xD;
      in 67% of patients with severe pain. Notably, 32% of cancer patients reported a desire for&#xD;
      suicide secondary to their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids have been the gold standard to treat cancer pain. Sadly, there are many side effects&#xD;
      associated with chronic opioid use. It has been shown in animal models that chronic use of&#xD;
      opioids has been associated with paradoxical effects. Rats that have been exposed to chronic&#xD;
      opioids developed hyperalgesia, which is an exaggerated response to a painful stimulus and&#xD;
      allodynia, which is a painful response to a non-painful stimulus. There have been several&#xD;
      mechanisms proposed to explain the paradoxical hyperalgesia phenomena observed. This&#xD;
      phenomenon has been recognized in patients inflected with chronic pain and managed with&#xD;
      chronic opioid. It has been long observed that patients with chronic pain require gradually&#xD;
      increasing doses of opioids. The reasons for this increase in opioid requirement may be&#xD;
      complicated. While the progression of the disease may play a significant part in increasing&#xD;
      doses of opioid, other factors such as tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia cannot be&#xD;
      ignored. Tolerance is a characteristic of opioids that is well investigated and results in&#xD;
      increasing the doses of opioids to maintain the original analgesic effects. Changing of brain&#xD;
      circuitry enables opioids to play a sinister role allowing it to produce pain. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients develop physical dependence with their use of opioids. A more significant aspect of&#xD;
      chronic use of opioid is the psychological dependence on opioids. While its understandable&#xD;
      and necessary for cancer patients to have opioids to control their pain, finding adjuvant&#xD;
      pain control therapy may lessen the amount of opioids needed. Using neuropathic pain&#xD;
      medications as adjuvants to supplement opioids had mixed results. Therefore, a different&#xD;
      agent with different mechanism is action may be needed for better pain control with less&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cells have high metabolic rate that generate high oxidative stress burden. Cancer&#xD;
      cells require glutathione to combat oxidative stress for survival. Cysteine is required for&#xD;
      the synthesis of glutathione. Cells acquire cysteine be exchanging intracellular glutamate&#xD;
      for the extra cellular cysteine through the Cysteine/Glutamate antiporter. Excreting&#xD;
      glutamate results in increased pain through the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor&#xD;
      (NMDA). If an agent can be identified that inhibits the Cysteine/Glutamate antiporter, the&#xD;
      cancer cells will have less chances of survival secondary to decreased glutathione that's is&#xD;
      needed for protection from oxidative stress. Additionally, decreased amount of the glutamate&#xD;
      secreted from the cells may lower the amount of pain produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfasalazine is a safe and well-established anti-inflammatory drug with potent inhibitory&#xD;
      properties of the cysteine/glutamate antiporter. Utilizing sulfasalazine for cancer patients,&#xD;
      in conjunction with opioids, may reduce the amount of opioids needed in two different&#xD;
      methods. First, sulfasalazine may decrease the survival rate of cancer cells, thus lowering&#xD;
      the mechanical burden of the cancer. Second, sulfasalazine may decrease the amount of&#xD;
      glutamate released by cancer cell resulting in less activation of the NMDA receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator proposes a clinical trial to administer sulfasalazine to initially focus on&#xD;
      breast cancer patients with pain. The pain may be from the primary tumor or from metastasis.&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesis that sulfasalazine will reduce cancer pain, the amount of the&#xD;
      opioids needed, and the undesirable side effects associated with high doses of opioid.&#xD;
