    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety in mother and neonate/infant of M281&#xD;
      administered to pregnant women who are at high risk for Early Onset Severe Hemolytic Disease&#xD;
      of the Fetus and Newborn (EOS-HDFN). The effectiveness of the investigational drug M281 will&#xD;
      be measured by looking at the percentage of participants with live birth at or after&#xD;
      gestational age (GA) 32 weeks and without a need for an intrauterine transfusion (IUT)&#xD;
      throughout their entire pregnancy.&#xD;
