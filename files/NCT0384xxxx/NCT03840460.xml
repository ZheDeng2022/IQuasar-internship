  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several types of early pre-cancerous lesions found in the pancreas which have the&#xD;
      potential to develop into pancreatic cancer. Although different patients' pancreatic cancers&#xD;
      or pre-cancerous pancreatic lesions have many similarities we believe that subtle differences&#xD;
      can affect how they behave and therefore influence individual patient outcomes. Many factors&#xD;
      may account for the differences seen in pancreatic lesion behaviour, for example molecular&#xD;
      and genetic differences (the DNA and RNA present which control how a cell grows and divides),&#xD;
      differences in how the immune system responds to the lesion, differences in the environment&#xD;
      immediately around the lesion in the pancreas, known as the tumour microenvironment and&#xD;
      differences in the micro-organisms which colonize a particular patient, known as their&#xD;
      microbiota .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project studies the molecular makeup of pancreatic lesions and their microenvironment at&#xD;
      various stages (from pre-cancerous lesions all the way through to more advanced disease) to&#xD;
      see if we can use this information to divide patients into different groups whose lesions may&#xD;
      behave in similar ways. We will be trying to find out if there are molecular reasons why some&#xD;
      patients respond to particular treatments when others do not, why some patients experience&#xD;
      more toxicity with particular treatments and why some patients' disease behaves particularly&#xD;
      aggressively when other patients' disease does not. We will also be investigating the&#xD;
      particular micro-organisms colonizing individual patients to see if these impact a patient's&#xD;
      outcome. Understanding what makes one person's pancreatic lesion behave differently to&#xD;
      another's could lead to better treatment, where a personalized therapeutic strategy could be&#xD;
      applied for every single patient.&#xD;

      The main objective is to describe the incidence and distribution of tumour biomarkers, and to&#xD;
      identify molecular subgroups from a multicentre series of patients who are investigated for&#xD;
      and subsequently diagnosed with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or a precursor lesion or a&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine disease control rate (CR, PR and SD &gt;24 weeks),&#xD;
      duration of response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in locally&#xD;
      advanced / metastatic patients or relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      early stage curative / pre-cursor lesion patients, associated with the identified molecular&#xD;
      subtypes of PDAC pancreatic cancer and relevant anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify molecular predictors of response or toxicity to standard of care anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies in PDAC/PanNET. The study also has a number of exploratory objectives listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the number of patients assessable for each biomarker of interest and the&#xD;
      prevalence of biomarker expression in the study population, exploratory endpoints of this&#xD;
      study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the predictive value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a&#xD;
           biomarker to predict responsiveness or resistance to a specific anti-cancer treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the prognostic value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a&#xD;
           biomarker to predict outcome regardless of a specific anti-cancer treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of biomarker expression among IPMN, MCN, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
           evaluation of their prognostic value.&#xD;
