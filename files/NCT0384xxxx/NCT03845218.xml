      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of blinding eye diseases. It is caused mostly by&#xD;
      mutations in photoreceptor-expressed genes. RP affects about 2 million people globally. There&#xD;
      is no cure, butut treatment and diagnosis can be guided by certain tests. Researchers want to&#xD;
      see how well these tests capture stages of RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out how well certain tests track changes in retinitis pigmentosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 12 and older with RP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 visits about 6 weeks apart. Both will include all the tests below.&#xD;
      Each visit will last 5 6 hours, or a visit can be split into 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give their medical and eye history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an eye exam. Their pupils will be dilated with eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pictures of participants retinas will be taken. Their retinas will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take several eye tests. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit in a dark room and press a button when they see lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      View a bright background then press a button when they see lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Look into a bowl and press a button when they see lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit in the dark with their eyes patched. Then they will take eye-numbing drops and wear&#xD;
      contacts as lights flash. A small electrode taped to their forehead will record signals from&#xD;
      their retinas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minors will give written consent to stay in the study when they turn 18. After the study&#xD;
      ends, they may also be asked to give consent for researchers to continue to use their study&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the nature of photoreceptor&#xD;
      dysfunction in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients using focal static and kinetic&#xD;
      psychophysical tests to develop functional outcome measures for the clinical trial study in&#xD;
      RP. Correlation of novel spatial functional maps with other functional measures (such as&#xD;
      visual acuity and multifocal electroretinography) will help provide a full description of&#xD;
      functional change. Employing new imaging methods to visualize and analyze structural changes&#xD;
      in the retina will allow for the evaluation of structural changes that underlie disease&#xD;
      progression. Developing these measures has the potential to advance the field by elucidating&#xD;
      the process of photoreceptor degeneration as well as being a scaffold for which candidate&#xD;
      therapies could be trialed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 120 participants with a diagnosis of RP will be enrolled. Up to&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers will also be enrolled for a total accrual ceiling of 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single center, observational, cross-sectional repeatability study of&#xD;
      patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The goal of Aim 1 is to identify measures that could be&#xD;
      used in future studies to track the extent of functional retina over time. The goal of Aim 2&#xD;
      is to evaluate structural measures for RP. The goal of Aim 3 is to assess the participant s&#xD;
      performance on questionnaires assessing visual function. The goal of Aim 4 is to survey the&#xD;
      cytokine/lymphokine profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be the limits of agreement in&#xD;
      repeatability calculations of the tests performed. Secondary outcome measures will include&#xD;
      analysis of parameter testing based on severity groups. Macular thickness as measured by&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT), as well as ellipsoid zone band length will be quantified.&#xD;
      Functional testing with photopic perimetry and scoptopic perimetry and kinetics will be&#xD;
      quantified. Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) will be analyzed by subfield and possible&#xD;
      ring analyses. Correlations of questionnaire scores with objective measures will be analyzed.&#xD;
