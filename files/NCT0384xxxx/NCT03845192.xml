    <textblock>
      In infants less than two years old the new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) will be measured during&#xD;
      general anaesthesia. It will evaluated if and how ORI-monitoring gives earlier warning of&#xD;
      hypoxaemia than conventional oxygen saturation measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is a new development in multiple wavelength pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      reflecting the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) continuously and non-invasively by an&#xD;
      index. In contrast to established standard oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements, ORI detects&#xD;
      a drop of PaO2 until the threshold of 100 mmHg. During anaesthesia induction-associated&#xD;
      apnoeic periods ORI may detect a drop of PaO2 early enough for the anaesthesiologist to&#xD;
      interrupt the intubation procedure and re-start oxygenation. In contrast, due to the flat&#xD;
      upper part of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, SpO2 stays at values above 90% until&#xD;
      PaO2 falls below 60mmHg. At this point, SpO2 drops rapidly and a pro- longed hypoxic dip is&#xD;
      the consequence. To avoid this potentially harmful hypoxic dip, continuous monitoring of PaO2&#xD;
      using ORI would be advantageous during anaesthesia induction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study aims to evaluate the time benefit between alarm of hypoxaemia by the&#xD;
      ORI-monitoring and the start of the dropping of oxygen saturation. Pre-set and pre-described&#xD;
      ORI-alarms will be checked for their utility and a new ORI-alarm will be defined that is&#xD;
      potentially more useful. As secondary endpoints the study examines the correlation of ORI&#xD;
      with PO2, the influence of patient or measurement characteristics on the correlation of ORI&#xD;
      with PO2 and the influence of the measurement site on ORI-measurement.&#xD;
