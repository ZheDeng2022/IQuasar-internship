  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of hemodynamic supportive medication on spinal vasculature, patients&#xD;
      scheduled for arterial dilation of the lower limb were chosen as our study population. The&#xD;
      spinal cord perfusion is not compromised in these patients, however, most patients suffer&#xD;
      from hypotension during this kind of surgery, due to the non-invasive type of surgery and the&#xD;
      vasodilating effects of the anesthetics. Therefore, continuous administration of vasoactive&#xD;
      medication (phenylephrine or dobutamine) is often required in order to increase blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of a continuous administration of&#xD;
      phenylephrine or dobutamine on the spinal oxygenation, assessed by NIRS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive standard anesthesia care during the surgical procedure. Before induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia, baseline MAP will be defined and 6 additional sensors (stickers) will be&#xD;
      applied to the back of the patient at three levels: 1 at the upper thoracic level(T3-T4), 2&#xD;
      at the lower thoracic level (T9-T10) and 2 at the lumbar region (L1-L2) and 1 on the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle of the upper arm. Two sensors are routinely applied to the forehead to measure&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and a BIS sensor is applied to measure depth of anesthesia. In all&#xD;
      patients a non-invasive cardiac output monitor (Clearsight; EdwardsTM LifeScience, Irvine,&#xD;
      CA, USA) is routinely used. This monitor provides a continuous arterial pressure waveform in&#xD;
      a non-invasive way and facilitates continuous evaluation of blood pressure. Hereby, efficient&#xD;
      adaptation of the administration of vasopressors is feasible. Through an intravenous line,&#xD;
      anesthetics will be administered. Vasopressor agents will be administered through a dedicated&#xD;
      second intravenous line. After induction of anesthesia, an endotracheal tube is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vasopressor agent will be administered continuously after intubation in order to maintain&#xD;
      blood pressure in a range from MAPbaseline -20% to normal (preoperative) values&#xD;
      (MAPbaseline). If MAP decreases to a value lower than MAPbaseline -20%, a higher dose of&#xD;
      vasopressor will be administered. If MAP increases to a value above MAPbaseline, the dosing&#xD;
      rate will be decreased. According to the group to which the patient has been randomized,&#xD;
      phenylephrine or dobutamine will be administered and the dose will be adjusted to MAP during&#xD;
      a 30-minute study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total drug amount for phenylephrine and dobutamine will not exceed 5 mg, resp. 30 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed after 30 minutes of continuous medicamentous hemodynamic support&#xD;
      administration (i.e. 30 minutes after intubation) or if administration of phenylephrine or&#xD;
      dobutamine exceeds 1 µg/kg/min or 10 µg/kg/min, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the administration of the study medication does not achieve the desired result, management&#xD;
      of the hemodynamics will be left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist and the&#xD;
      patient will be excluded from further data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endovascular surgical procedure can start without delay and the duration of surgery will&#xD;
      not be prolonged because of the measurements and blood pressure management&#xD;
