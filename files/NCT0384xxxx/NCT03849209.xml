    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration represents the gold-standard for the pathological&#xD;
      diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions. New needles design allowed to obtain samples suitable&#xD;
      for histological evaluation (endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy). the aim was to&#xD;
      compare two different techniques during ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy, for diagnosis&#xD;
      of suspect pancreatic solid lesions.&#xD;

      Materials and methods This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study comparing the&#xD;
      slow-pull technique with the standard suction technique during Ultrasound-guided fine-needle&#xD;
      biopsy in patients with pancreatic solid lesions. The study involved three referral centers&#xD;
      for pancreatico-biliary diseases: the Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit. ARNAS Civico-Di&#xD;
      Cristina-Benfratelli Hospital, Palermo, Italy; the Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit.&#xD;
      Marche Polytechnic University, Ospedale A. Murri, Fermo, Italy; the Gastroenterology Unit.&#xD;
      AUSL Bologna, Bellaria-Maggiore, Bologna, Italy. The protocol was approved by the&#xD;
      institutional medical ethical committee at each participating institution and written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from all patients for participation in the study. All&#xD;
      consecutive patients with a newly diagnosed pancreatic solid lesions suitable for endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition were considered for enrollment. Written informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained from all patients before the procedure. All the endoscopic ultrasound procedures&#xD;
      were carried out by a skilled endosonographer with the patients under conscious sedation or&#xD;
      deep sedation according to the anesthesiological guidelines approved in each participating&#xD;
      center. All Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy were done using a 20 Gauge needle (EchoTip&#xD;
      ProCore 20G with ReCoil Stylet™, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA). The ReCoil Stylet´s has&#xD;
      an automatic recoiling capability designed to help users to manage more easily the stylet,&#xD;
      thus minimising the risk of contamination. Before puncturing, color doppler examination was&#xD;
      performed to exclude the presence of interposing vessels. The needle tip was sharpened by&#xD;
      withdrawing the stylet of approximately 2 mm, and then it was advanced into the lesion under&#xD;
      real-time endoscopic ultrasound guidance. In patients randomized to the stylet slow-pull&#xD;
      techniques, 15 to-and-fro movements within the lesion were performed while gently pulling the&#xD;
      needle stylet slowly and continuously upwards. In patients randomized to the standard suction&#xD;
      technique, 15 to-and-fro movements within the lesion were performed using a 10-mL suction&#xD;
      syringe. In both sampling procedures the fanning technique was used to maximized sample&#xD;
      acquisition. Tissue samples were expelled onto slides by reinserting the stylet and the&#xD;
      visible core was physically lifted off the slides placing it into a formalin vial for&#xD;
      histological evaluation. For the macroscopic adequacy, the endosonographer evaluated for the&#xD;
      presence of a visible core defined as a worm-like material whitish/yellowish or red, not&#xD;
      including fluid-like specimens in the formalin vial, which was judged to be adequate to&#xD;
      perform a pathological analysis. The pathologists were &quot;blinded&quot; on which group the vials&#xD;
      received were belonging to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using random sequences generated by a computer and then closed in&#xD;
      consecutive numbered envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of blood contamination of the specimen was based on the pathologist evaluation of&#xD;
      the formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples and defined as significant when a&#xD;
      large amount of blood cells made pathological diagnosis difficult to be made. On the other&#xD;
      hand, blood contamination of the specimen was defined as not significant when no or only few&#xD;
      blood cells were present without any influence on the pathological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity was defined as the true positive rate whereby the test was the final cytologic&#xD;
      diagnosis, Specificity as the true negative rate (proportion of actual negatives that are&#xD;
      correctly identified as such), positive predictive value was defined as the number of true&#xD;
      positive divided the number of positive calls (true positive and false positive), negative&#xD;
      predictive value was defined as the number of true negative divided the number of negative&#xD;
      calls (true negative and false negative). Diagnostic accuracy was defined as the ratio&#xD;
      between the sum of true positive and true negative values divided by the total number of&#xD;
      masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success was defined as the capability of sampling the target lesion associated with&#xD;
      the presence of a visible core, according to endosonographer's judgment, potentially useful&#xD;
      for the final pathological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were defined based on the criteria expressed by Cotton et al. [Cotton PB.&#xD;
      Gastrointest Endosc 2010;71:446-54] Samples positive for malignancy were considered&#xD;
      diagnostic for malignancy, while in patients with negative Ultrasound-guided fine-needle&#xD;
      biopsy, surgical specimen evaluation, results of other diagnostic investigations and/or a&#xD;
      clinical follow-up of at least 6 months were used to establish the definitive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The sample size was calculated based on the results of a previous study&#xD;
      [Nakai Y H. Dig Dis Sci. 2014;59:1578-85] that showed that blood contamination of the&#xD;
      specimen was lower with the stylet slow-pull technique as compared with the standard suction&#xD;
      technique (25% vs 70%), with a consequent increase in the diagnostic accuracy. Based on these&#xD;
      data we calculated for a difference of 25%, at a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided&#xD;
      test), a final sample size of 110 patients (55 patients in each group). Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be reported as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) or as median with interquartile range.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentage and will be compared either&#xD;
      using the chi-square test (with Yates' correction when appropriate) or Fisher exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical was conducted using the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      value, negative predictive value, and overall diagnostic accuracy for each arm were&#xD;
      investigated by comparing the results with the definitive diagnosis. Statistical tests were&#xD;
      considered significant at a corresponding p value of &lt;0.05. Data handling and analyses were&#xD;
      done with SPSS 14.&#xD;
