    <measure>Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Antibody Response Rate at 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seronegative at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Adults and Adolescents: 6 weeks post Vaccination 2 (up to approximately 86 days), Children: 6 weeks post Vaccination 1 (up to approximately 43 days)</time_frame>
    <description>VZV antibody titers were measured using a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The VZV antibody response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a post-vaccination VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL for participants whose baseline VZV antibody titer was &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL. VZV antibody response rate was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seronegative to VZW at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of VZV Antibodies at 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seronegative at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Adults and Adolescents: 6 weeks post Vaccination 2 (up to approximately 86 days), Children: 6 weeks post Vaccination 1 (up to approximately 43 days)</time_frame>
    <description>GMTs of VZV antibodies were measured post-vaccination using a gpELISA. GMT was calculated at each time point by taking the log of the titers, averaging over all participants values, and then back-transforming to the original scale. GMT was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seronegative to VZW at baseline.</description>

    <measure>VZV Antibody Seroconversion Rate at 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seronegative at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Adults and Adolescents: 6 weeks post Vaccination 2 (up to approximately 86 days), Children: 6 weeks post Vaccination 1 (up to approximately 43 days)</time_frame>
    <description>VZV antibody levels were measured using a gpELISA. The VZW antibody seroconversion rate was defined as the percentage of participants with VZV antibodies ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL in participants with a baseline VZV antibody titer &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL. VZW antibody seroconversion was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seronegative to VZW at baseline.</description>

    <measure>GMTs of VZV Antibodies at Day 1 and 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seropositive at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), 6 weeks post last vaccination (Day 43 for children and Day 84 for adults and adolescents)</time_frame>
    <description>GMTs of VZV antibodies were measured post-vaccination using a gpELISA. GMT was calculated at each time point by taking the log of the titers, averaging over all participants values, and then back-transforming to the original scale. GMT was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seropositive to VZW at baseline. Per protocol, confidence intervals (CIs) were only calculated when there were at least 5 participants who were seropositive in a treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) in VZV Antibody Titers From Day 1 to 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seropositive at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), 6 weeks post last vaccination (Day 43 for children and Day 84 for adults and adolescents)</time_frame>
    <description>GMTs were measured using a gpELISA. For participants who were seropositive at baseline (baseline VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL), the GMFR was calculated as the ratio of the VZV GMT at 6 weeks post last vaccination to the VZV GMT at Day 1 (baseline). The GMFR from Day 1 was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seropositive to VZW at baseline. Per protocol, CIs were only calculated when there were at least 5 participants who were seropositive in a treatment group.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥4-Fold Rise in Antibody Titers From Day 1 to 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination Among Participants Who Were Seropositive at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), 6 weeks post last vaccination (Day 43 for children and Day 84 for adults and adolescents)</time_frame>
    <description>GMTs were measured using a gpELISA. For participants who were seropositive at baseline (baseline VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL), the percentage of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in VZV antibody titer from Day 1 (baseline) to post-vaccination was assessed and reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents). Per protocol, CIs were only calculated when there were at least 5 participants who were seropositive in a treatment group.</description>

        <title>Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Antibody Response Rate at 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seronegative at Baseline</title>
        <description>VZV antibody titers were measured using a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The VZV antibody response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a post-vaccination VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL for participants whose baseline VZV antibody titer was &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL. VZV antibody response rate was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seronegative to VZW at baseline.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) in VZV Antibody Titers From Day 1 to 6 Weeks Post Last Vaccination in Participants Who Were Seropositive at Baseline</title>
        <description>GMTs were measured using a gpELISA. For participants who were seropositive at baseline (baseline VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL), the GMFR was calculated as the ratio of the VZV GMT at 6 weeks post last vaccination to the VZV GMT at Day 1 (baseline). The GMFR from Day 1 was reported for all study arms at 6 weeks post last vaccination (Vaccination 1 for children and Vaccination 2 for adults and adolescents) for participants who were seropositive to VZW at baseline. Per protocol, CIs were only calculated when there were at least 5 participants who were seropositive in a treatment group.</description>
