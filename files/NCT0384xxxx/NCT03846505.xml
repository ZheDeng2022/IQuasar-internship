  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Behavioral Couples Therapy (ABCT) is a manualized 12-session, weekly psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention that simultaneously reduces alcohol use disorder (AUD) severity and improves&#xD;
      relationship functioning. However, there remains room to improve ABCT outcomes. A growing&#xD;
      literature suggests that intranasal oxytocin is a medication that holds promise to achieve&#xD;
      that goal. Oxytocin has demonstrated the ability to increase prosocial behavior (e.g., trust,&#xD;
      safety, social cognition) and restore sensitivity to natural rewards such as interpersonal&#xD;
      relationships that are commonly eroded in the context of addiction. Oxytocin has also&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability to reduce substance use behaviors (e.g., craving,&#xD;
      self-administration, tolerance, withdrawal), and improves the neurobiological foundations of&#xD;
      AUD. The primary objective of this Stage II study is to test the efficacy of oxytocin versus&#xD;
      placebo in improving (1) AUD symptom severity, (2) relationship functioning, and (3)&#xD;
      corticolimbic connectivity among couples receiving ABCT therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity; aged 18-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual level sufficient to&#xD;
             allow accurate completion of the assessment instruments (&gt; 26 on the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
             Exam).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Married, cohabiting for ≥ 6 months, or in a committed relationship of at least 1-year&#xD;
             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ≥1 hazardous drinking episode in past 60 days by IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Identified Patients (IPs) must meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for current (i.e., past&#xD;
             6 months) alcohol use disorder (assessed via the MINI). Couples in which both partners&#xD;
             meet diagnostic criteria for current AUD are eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrent substance use disorders (e.g., marijuana) are acceptable provided that&#xD;
             alcohol is the IP's primary substance of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a&#xD;
             stable dose for at least four weeks before study initiation. This is because&#xD;
             initiation or change of psychotropic medications during the course of the trial may&#xD;
             interfere with interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar affective&#xD;
             disorders, or with current suicidal or homicidal ideation and intent. Those&#xD;
             individuals will be referred clinically for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who present a serious suicide risk or are likely to require&#xD;
             hospitalization during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of seizures and/or seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Acute alcohol withdrawal as indicated by CIWA-Ar scores &gt;8. They may be re-assessed&#xD;
             once they are no longer in withdrawal. Those individuals will be referred for&#xD;
             medically supervised detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any unstable or serious medical condition affecting the potential participants'&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Individuals with claustrophobia; tattoos above the shoulders; permanent eyeliner or&#xD;
             permanent artificial eyebrows; cardiac pacemaker; metal fragments in eye, skin, or&#xD;
             body, including shrapnel; heart valve replacement; brain clips; venous umbrella;&#xD;
             current or former sheet-metal worker or welder; lifetime history of aneurysm surgery;&#xD;
             lifetime history of seizures and/or epilepsy; intracranial bypass, renal, or aortic&#xD;
             clips; prosthetic devices such as middle ear, eye, joint, or penile implants; joint&#xD;
             replacements; non-removable hearing aid, neurostimulator, or insulin pump;&#xD;

             MRI contraindications as determined by the MRI technician at the time of scanning will&#xD;
             not be eligible to participate in the neuroimaging component of the study, however&#xD;
             individuals who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for the medication component of the&#xD;
             study but not the MRI portion will still be eligible to reenroll in and complete the&#xD;
             medication/treatment phase.&#xD;
