      Safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant nivolumab for locally advanced resectable oral cancer,&#xD;
      combined with [18F]BMS-986192 / [18F]-FDG PET imaging and immunomonitoring for response&#xD;
      prediction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive treatment regimens with surgical resection and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy of&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced oral cancer still result in only 50-60% cure rate, leaving a&#xD;
      substantial group of patients who will develop a local recurrence or distant metastases with&#xD;
      minimal curative salvage treatment options. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      (mAbs) has shown promise in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). This supports the hypothesis that including treatment with anti PD-1&#xD;
      mAb nivolumab could improve the outcome for patients with locally advanced oral cancer&#xD;
      resulting in a higher cure rate. Response rate with nivolumab was below 20% in unselected&#xD;
      patients with r/m HNSCC. Therefore, biomarkers for response are urgently needed. Tumor PD-L1&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was shown to be related to nivolumab response but cannot be&#xD;
      reliably used for patient selection. Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of tumor PD-L1&#xD;
      expression (within and between tumor lesions) might be responsible for its suboptimal&#xD;
      predictive value as biomarker of response. Therefore there is a need to further evaluate&#xD;
      tumor PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker, as well as exploring alternatives. Serial PET&#xD;
      imaging with [18F]BMS-986192 (anti-PD-L1 tracer) and [18F]-FDG has the potential to provide&#xD;
      whole body information of the patient over time, at baseline as well as on treatment and&#xD;
      represents a biomarker for toxicity and efficacy. In addition, we will investigate the&#xD;
      immunophenotype of the patient and tumor, as well as the presence of neoantigens and other&#xD;
      potential other biomarkers such as plasma vesicle miRNAs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced oral cancer (stage&#xD;
             III/IV) which is planned for treatment with curative intent including surgical&#xD;
             resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Must agree to provide tissue from fresh tumor biopsy pretreatment and from the&#xD;
             surgical resection material to determine the actual PD-L1 status and perform&#xD;
             immunomonitoring/DNA/RNA profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to allow up to two additional biopsies when baseline [18F]BMS-986192 PET&#xD;
             /[18F]-FDG PET scans show heterogeneous and/or discrepant uptake.&#xD;
