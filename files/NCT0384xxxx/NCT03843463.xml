      In this project, the investigators will investigate the effects of a selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram, on augmenting language therapy effectiveness, as&#xD;
      measured by naming untrained pictures and describing pictures, in individuals with aphasia in&#xD;
      the acute and subacute post stroke period (i.e., within three months post stroke). There has&#xD;
      been no previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of daily SSRI in&#xD;
      the first three months after stroke on improvement of language in people undergoing aphasia&#xD;
      treatment. It is plausible that SSRIs, which elevate synaptic serotonin, might enhance&#xD;
      recovery by augmenting synaptic plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram for augmenting language intervention in subacute&#xD;
      stroke. The investigators hypothesize that daily escitalopram for 90 days after stroke&#xD;
      results in greater improvement (compared to placebo) in naming untrained pictures, as well as&#xD;
      greater increase in content of picture description and greater improvement in morphosyntactic&#xD;
      production, when combined with speech and language treatment (SALT). A second aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate the mechanisms of language recovery in individuals who receive active medical&#xD;
      treatment and those who receive placebo, using resting state functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (rsfMRI) and genetic testing. The investigators hypothesize that greater improvement&#xD;
      in language is associated with increased connectivity within the left hemisphere language&#xD;
      network on rsfMRI in participants who receive escitalopram than in those who receive placebo,&#xD;
      independently of improvement in depression. The investigators also hypothesize that the&#xD;
      effects are greatest in individuals with val/val allele of brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) - (consistent with previous studies showing a greater response to treatment and&#xD;
      greater neuroplasticity in people with the val/val allele than those with one or more met&#xD;
      alleles.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of correctly named items of 30 total items on the computerized picture naming assessment. Scores ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores meaning better naming ability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Language production as assessed by lexical features of discourse in &quot;Cookie Theft&quot; picture description</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Lexical features, meaning carrying units of language (morphemes), will be counted for each Cookie Theft picture description. There is no maximum number of meaning carrying units, but norms are available to assist in the interpretation of this performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Language production as assessed by content units included in picture description of &quot;Cookie Theft&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Content units are based on a standard scoring template of commonly identified concepts (nouns and verbs) in the left and right regions of the &quot;Cookie Theft&quot; picture. Participants either include or fail to include 30 concepts on the left side of the picture and 23 concepts on the right side of the picture. A ratio of included left content units to included right content units then can be calculated and interpreted as a measure of hemispatial attention.</description>

    <measure>Language production as assessed by rate of syllables per content unit produced in &quot;Cookie Theft&quot; picture description</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Syllables included in the picture description are counted. Content units are based on a standard scoring template of commonly identified concepts (nouns and verbs) in the left and right regions of the &quot;Cookie Theft&quot; picture. Participants either include or fail to include 30 concepts on the left side of the picture and 23 concepts on the right side of the picture. The average rate of syllables per content unit produced can then be calculated and interpreted as a measure of efficiency in producing relevant information in the task.</description>

    <measure>Depression as assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>9 item scale scored 0-3 for each item. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression. PHQ-9 &gt;15 or suicidal ideation suggest depression sufficient for exclusion or removal from study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Language production as assessed by Morphosyntactic Generation (MorGen) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>60 item assessment of word morphology (e.g., plurals, possessives) and modifiers (e.g., number, size, color). Each item is scored based on produced accurate descriptors of an image relative to a second reference image (e.g., patients see two trees, one larger than the other, and the phrase &quot;little tree&quot; is elicited). Patients are scored for objects correctly named (nouns) out of 60, instances of correct use of plural marker out of 31, instances of correct use of numbers out of 8, instances of correct modifiers denoting size out of 16, instances of correct modifiers denoting color out of 19, instances of correct modifiers denoting possessive markers out of 17, and instances of correctly named possessing individuals (proper names provided on screen) out of 17. These scores can then be interpreted separately or averaged to interpret a broad morphosyntactic accuracy score.</description>

    <measure>Stroke severity as assessed by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment, 20 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patient's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items.</description>
