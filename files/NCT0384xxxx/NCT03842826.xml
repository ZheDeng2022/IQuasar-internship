      This study will investigate the reproducibility of clinical palpation, resistance and&#xD;
      stretching tests which are currently being used for the diagnosis of longstanding groin pain&#xD;
      in male athletes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Doha agreement meeting on terminology and definitions&quot; aimed to simplify the&#xD;
      heterogeneous taxonomy of groin injuries by creating a straightforward classification system&#xD;
      based on patient history and clinical examination. Following this classification system,&#xD;
      groin pain can be divided into four defined clinical entities (adductor-, inguinal-,&#xD;
      iliopsoas- and/or pubic-related groin pain), hip related groin pain, and/or other causes for&#xD;
      groin pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Doha classification, pain on palpation, resistance and/or stretching are the key&#xD;
      clinical findings for categorizing in the four clinical entities. However, this&#xD;
      classification does not describe how these clinical tests should be performed and if these&#xD;
      tests are reproducible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the inter-examiner reproducibility of clinical&#xD;
      palpation, resistance and stretch tests for longstanding groin pain in athletes. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to identify the proportion of positive clinical tests for each clinical&#xD;
      entity diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two blinded examiners (a physiotherapist and a general surgeon, both specialized in groin&#xD;
      injuries with &gt;10 years experience) will assess each athlete with longstanding groin pain&#xD;
      following a standardized examination protocol. Prior to clinical examination, participants&#xD;
      will be requested to complete a standardized form for patient/injury characteristics and&#xD;
      injury history, the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and the Oslo Sports Trauma&#xD;
      Research Center (OSTRC) overuse injury questionnaire. The HAGOS is a patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measure, which quantifies a patient's current subjective perception of their hip and groin&#xD;
      pain within the last week on six subscales, each with a score between 0 and 100.The OSTRC&#xD;
      overuse injury questionnaire has a focus on groin problems within the last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized clinical examination protocol consists of palpation, resistance and&#xD;
      stretch-tests and are used to categorize athletes into defined clinical entities. A score on&#xD;
      the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) will be asked to the patient for each test, where pain&#xD;
      during the test has to correspond to the injury pain. Each score from 1-10 will be considered&#xD;
      as positive for analysis. If the pain is just from palpation and not related to the injury,&#xD;
      the test will be considered negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-examiner reliability will be analysed using Cohen's Kappa statistic (κ), including 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for dichotomous variables. Linear weighted κ will be calculated for&#xD;
      ordinal variables. Additionally, the absolute positive agreement and negative agreement&#xD;
      between the two examiners and bias index will be calculated. The mean prevalence of each&#xD;
      positive clinical tests of both clinicians will be reported for each entity diagnosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, agreement analysis for the palpation tests of the four defined clinical entities&#xD;
      of groin pain will also be grouped: adductor-, iliopsoas-, inguinal- (with and without&#xD;
      invagination) and pubic palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 3 main defined clinical entities (adductor-, inguinal- and iliopsoas-related groin&#xD;
      pain), a prevalence is expected between 30-60% in our research population. Assuming that&#xD;
      approximately 4 out of every 5 tests (80%) targeting each entity will be positive, we expect&#xD;
      a prevalence of positive tests of approximately 24-48% in the whole sample. With an expected&#xD;
      Kappa of at least 0.8, with a 95% confidence interval lower limit of 0.4, using a 2-tailed&#xD;
      test and assuming no bias between examiners, at least 60 affected sides will be needed for&#xD;
      this study. A lower prevalence of positive tests for pubic-related groin pain and subsequent&#xD;
      less robust results for clinical tests of this entity will be accepted. No dropout is&#xD;
      expected due to the cross-sectional character of the study. We will continue inclusion until&#xD;
      we have 60 full data sets.&#xD;
