  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is the evaluation of a combined coaxial optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) system to image retina/choroid and to evaluate if post processing of the&#xD;
      data can give us insights into property of the tissue imaged.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histology studies have shown that many disorders of the retina and choroid such as&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration is associated with a build up abnormal deposits, in the&#xD;
      retina or subretinal space. Being able to detect subtle changes in retina and choroidal&#xD;
      structure is crucial for better understanding and monitoring of this potentially blinding&#xD;
      condition. This study aims to commercially available SpectralisÂ® OCT-system with a central&#xD;
      wavelength of 880nm explore the ability of a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO)&#xD;
      for OCT imaging utilising a modified by the addition of a longer wavelength OCT (1075nm , a&#xD;
      wavelength deployed on other commercially available OCT scanners). Other commercially&#xD;
      available OCT scanners used longer wavelengths to allow deeper penetration and enhanced&#xD;
      visualisation of subretinal tissue but less inner retinal detail. Combing both wavelengths&#xD;
      could have the advantage of allowing optimum viualisation of inner and subretinal structures.&#xD;
      The ability of the systems to acquire repeatable and good quality images of retinal and&#xD;
      choroidal structural detail at matching location and compare the results from the two&#xD;
      instruments will be evaluated. In addition processing of the images reflectivity with two&#xD;
      different wavelength should give us insight into the nature of any abnormal material.&#xD;
