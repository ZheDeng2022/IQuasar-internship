  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity worldwide, including in France, where it accounts for approximately 20% of maternal&#xD;
      mortality. Although numerous studies have examined immediate PPH, very few have explored&#xD;
      secondary (also called late) PPH. Moreover, there are no guidelines in France for the&#xD;
      management of secondary PPH. Its frequency appears to vary from 0.2% to 3.0% of deliveries.&#xD;
      It is, however, difficult to estimate because only severe secondary PPH will lead to&#xD;
      hospitalization and the rare publications concern single-center studies. The cause of these&#xD;
      secondary hemorrhages is often unknown, due to the lack of routine uterine aspiration.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, this aspiration is not always medically justified. The principal objective of&#xD;
      this study is thus to establish the incidence of severe late PPH in the general population.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Justification of the non-interventional nature of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe late PPH is a rare disorder that can be difficult to diagnose. It is a source of&#xD;
           severe maternal morbidity; its management is not well defined; and the lack of knowledge&#xD;
           of its risk factors means that groups of women at risk of this disorder cannot be&#xD;
           identified. Because of the lack of scientific data, it is impossible to set up&#xD;
           monitoring appropriate to each woman's risk or to provide women who have just given&#xD;
           birth with appropriate information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The practices studied will be those usually used in the healthcare facilities in&#xD;
           Auvergne that manage PPH. The data useful for this study will be those collected&#xD;
           routinely in medical files, but will be collected prospectively for women who are&#xD;
           hospitalized after a severe late PPH. Investigators conducted this type of data&#xD;
           collection for the Hera study (national PHRC), which covered immediate postpartum&#xD;
           hemorrhages, for which management is well codified through the national good clinical&#xD;
           practice guidelines, updated in 2014 .The section on the management of secondary&#xD;
           hemorrhages shows the sparseness of the relevant scientific data on this subject. The&#xD;
           guidelines are thus based mainly on expert opinion. Accordingly, the value of this study&#xD;
           is that it will begin to develop an evidence base for the management of this disorder.&#xD;
           The guidelines specify that &quot;the management of late PPH depends on their cause and their&#xD;
           severity [antibiotic therapy (Grade A) and uterotonic agents (professional consensus)].&#xD;
           This treatment must follow the hospital's own protocols (professional consensus). Most&#xD;
           often, women are admitted for this management (professional consensus). In the case of&#xD;
           persistence of the PPH and retention of placental fragments, aspiration-curettage under&#xD;
           ultrasound control or operative hysteroscopy is recommended (professional consensus). In&#xD;
           cases of vascular abnormalities, selective embolization is the treatment of choice&#xD;
           (professional consensus).&quot; This study will not direct professionals to use any specific&#xD;
           rules or practices for the management of these late hemorrhages, other than the national&#xD;
           guidelines cited above. Because of the great autonomy it offers for this management, it&#xD;
           probably results in substantial heterogeneity in care, which this study will observe and&#xD;
           examine. At the end of the study, investigator hope to have highlighted the most&#xD;
           relevant management practices by cause of these severe late PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure for early withdrawal from the study: the woman's refusal to participate in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods of recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Women with a severe late PPH will be recruited prospectively after verification of the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria by a gynecologist-obstetrician or the investigating midwives, who&#xD;
           will provide the patients information about the study and include them unless they&#xD;
           object.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Steps taken to reduce and avoid bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because the objective is to determine the incidence of severe late/secondary PPH,&#xD;
           investigator will have several investigators at each site to be able to optimize the&#xD;
           prospective identification of women meeting the inclusion criteria. Data entry will be&#xD;
           performed by a research midwife who will have access to all of the medical data sources&#xD;
           at each site (regional computerized pregnancy and delivery records, paper medical&#xD;
           records, local computerized file for surgical, laboratory, pathology and imaging&#xD;
           reports, hospital computerized discharge summary) to limit missing data. The aim is to&#xD;
           obtain an exhaustive list of severe late PPH in the general population, to be ensured by&#xD;
           the consultation of multiple data sources. Because these data sources are generated by&#xD;
           different institutions and agencies, the selection bias associated by collection from a&#xD;
           specific population (e.g., a single center) will be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collection of data for women with a severe late PPH Patient inclusion and data&#xD;
           collection will take place continuously. Every case of severe late PPH among women who&#xD;
           give birth in the region of Auvergne will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The women will be informed about the planned study and procedures by posters in the&#xD;
           maternity units (lounges and waiting rooms, the web site of the Auvergne perinatal&#xD;
           network) and by an information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the time the case is identified, several data items will be collected immediately by&#xD;
           one of the local investigators (data about the late PPH episode); the other data, as&#xD;
           well as those concerning antenatal care during pregnancy will be collected by the&#xD;
           research midwife from the regional computerized records and other portions of the&#xD;
           woman's file, in each institution (laboratory, pathology, and surgery reports).&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Passive data collection: It will be based on the spontaneous reporting of cases by the&#xD;
           correspondents in each maternity unit. These lists of cases, on a specific form, will be&#xD;
           reported to the principal investigator monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Active data collection: A research midwife will complete the files already underway.&#xD;
           The investigator will visit the site to consult the woman's paper or computerized&#xD;
           records and complete the information then missing from the study file. Auvergne has a&#xD;
           regional computerized perinatal database. These site visits will be planned by the&#xD;
           investigator, who will telephone the local correspondent to make an appointment and&#xD;
           request from him or her a list of files to be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The frequency of site visits will vary according to the number of patients reported by&#xD;
           each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The different modes of active data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data collection by telephone Will cover only the minimum data necessary to open the&#xD;
                file or the small quantities of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data collection by mail The physician serving as the study director will contact&#xD;
                the study correspondents, if necessary, once a quarter to review the number of&#xD;
                women with late PPH at each facility. Investigators will check the data for each&#xD;
                case and open new files when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection from discharge database summaries (PMSI) Each year, the physician&#xD;
                serving as the study director will ask the Medical Information Department of each&#xD;
                healthcare facility to furnish a list of all women who were rehospitalized in the&#xD;
                42 days after giving birth or who had a surgical, or medical or interventional&#xD;
                radiology procedure during their postpartum stay. All of these records will be&#xD;
                studied manually by the investigator to check for cases of severe late PPH that&#xD;
                were not previously reported (quality control for case ascertainment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedures to validate the cases of late PPH All reports of eligible women (that is, who&#xD;
           had a severe late PPH) will be checked at arrival by the investigator, who will verify&#xD;
           if this is the woman's first inclusion in the study. The investigator will verify the&#xD;
           woman's identity and date of birth during site visits, to avoid duplicate inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If it is a first inclusion, the investigator will validate the inclusion criteria before&#xD;
           submitting the file to one of the study directors, who will validate the etiological&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will verify the quality of the data collection and file completion: in&#xD;
           the case of missing data, he or she will take the steps required to have the data&#xD;
           completed at the reporting department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will code the administrative items and drugs by using specific&#xD;
           thesauruses. The investigator will also enter the data for each record after coding,&#xD;
           using RedCap® software, available at the Clermont-Ferrand UHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A local index for each center, including the file number, if a file was opened, or&#xD;
           information about its status if it was not opened, the woman's first and last name, and&#xD;
           the reporting source will be maintained and kept up-to-date by the local investigator&#xD;
           for each late PPH diagnosis included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data analysis methods The α risk (of a type I error) will be set at 5%. The statistical&#xD;
           tests will be bilateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A descriptive analysis of the entire dataset will be performed. The incidence of severe&#xD;
           late PPH will be calculated with its 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Cox model (with severe late PPH the variable to be explained) will be used to adjust&#xD;
           for the confounding factors or the clinically relevant prognostic factors for the onset&#xD;
           of severe late PPH. The point of origin will be the delivery. The model will make it&#xD;
           possible to calculate adjusted hazard ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient information Patients will receive complete and fair information, expressed in&#xD;
           understandable terms, about the study objectives, the nature of the information&#xD;
           collected, and their right to object to at any point to the use of their data. The&#xD;
           investigator must also inform the patients of the Ethics Committee decision. Women will&#xD;
           be asked whether or not they object to participating in the study before their data are&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this information will be included on an information sheet given to the woman to keep.&#xD;
      Her non-opposition will be collected and documented by the investigator.&#xD;
