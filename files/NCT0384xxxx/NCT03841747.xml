      paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab relative to paclitaxel alone, in patients with locally advanced&#xD;

      PELICAN is a randomised phase II trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab relative to paclitaxel alone, in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative, Luminal B breast cancer who have received no prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luminal B is defined as high Ki67 (≥20%) and /or histological grade 3 and / or Luminal B&#xD;
      according to PAM50 assay. This study will include patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression,&#xD;
      but patients will be stratified by centrally determined PD-L1 expression. The number of&#xD;
      patients with PD-L1 negative tumours (&lt;1% expression) will be capped at 50% of the total&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised (2:1) to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) plus Paclitaxel on Days 1,8, and 15 every 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel on Days 1,8, and 15 every 28 days Paclitaxel alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by the following two factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Centrally assessed PD-L1 expression (&lt;1% PD-L1 expression; ≥1%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence vs non-presence of visceral metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel treatment will be continued for at least 6 cycles unless there is evidence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests to stop the treatment.&#xD;
      If paclitaxel treatment is discontinued prior to disease progression, patients in the&#xD;
      combination arm should continue pembrolizumab single agent therapy until progression or&#xD;
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity up to a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If disease progression is documented (RECIST 1.1) while the patient is on study medication&#xD;
      (in the pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel arm) it would be standard practice for the patient to&#xD;
      be taken off study medication. However, in the absence of other discontinuation criteria,&#xD;
      patients treated with paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab may be continued on study medication if&#xD;
      in the opinion of the treating physician there is clinical benefit. In this case patients&#xD;
      must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values [e.g., new or&#xD;
           worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating clinically significant progression of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status that can be&#xD;
           attributed to disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of tumour progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal&#xD;
           disease) that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions (i.e., pain&#xD;
           secondary to disease or unmanageable ascites, etc.), as determined by the investigator&#xD;
           after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available), and&#xD;
           clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab treatment will not exceed 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were randomized to the paclitaxel alone must discontinue study treatment upon&#xD;
      determination of progressive disease. No crossover is allowed. On completion of study&#xD;
      treatment in both arms, patients will enter a survival follow-up period during which data on&#xD;
      cancer therapy, disease status and survival status will be collected. Endocrine maintenance&#xD;
      therapy is not permitted prior to disease progression.&#xD;
