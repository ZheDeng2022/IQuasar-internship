  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to determine which dialysis solution, low bicarbonate fluid (22&#xD;
      mmol/L) or high bicarbonate fluid (32 mmol/L), is better in subjects with acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (acute kidney failure) and metabolic acidosis that are admitted to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      and require continuous renal replacement therapy (also known as continuous dialysis).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial that will be conducted at Mayo Clinic in Rochester&#xD;
      Minnesota. It will be based on Good Clinical Practice Standards and performed under IRB&#xD;
      supervision. This will be a pragmatic clinical trial due to the nature of the intervention&#xD;
      and short interval for making a clinical decision. While dialysis in general is valid in&#xD;
      cases of severe AKI and metabolic acidosis, there remains uncertainty as to which replacement&#xD;
      fluid to use. In one retrospective study, using high bicarbonate replacement fluid was&#xD;
      associated with worse outcomes, even after accounting for several important confounders.&#xD;
      While this intervention is valid in cases of severe metabolic acidosis (pH&lt;7), there has not&#xD;
      been much data to support the use of either intervention in cases of any metabolic acidosis&#xD;
      in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both interventions are equally valid, to our knowledge, there is no randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial evaluating the difference of either intervention on outcomes. There is limited evidence&#xD;
      in the literature on benefit or harm associated with either of the interventions on the&#xD;
      outcomes thus generating a clinical equipoise. This pivotal study should help guide&#xD;
      nephrologists and intensivists on the appropriate prescription of CRRT.&#xD;
