  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at defining the role of immune cells derived from the intestine in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Sjogren's disease. This research might open new therapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      the treatment of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases are characterized by a loss of tolerance of the immune system for&#xD;
      self-antigens. One of the feature of autoimmune diseases is the infiltration of lymphoid&#xD;
      cells in the tissues damaged by the disease (i.e. kidney in systemic lupus erythematous or&#xD;
      brain in multiple sclerosis). However, the origins and properties of the immune cells&#xD;
      infiltrating these target tissues are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in mouse models have shown that the composition of the gut microbiota can modify the&#xD;
      susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. These studies demonstrated that the microbiota&#xD;
      composition can alter the pathogenic properties of T cells in the gut but also in the target&#xD;
      tissues. For instance, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, the&#xD;
      composition of the gut microbiota has been shown to modulate the susceptibility to the&#xD;
      disease and the properties of the pathogenic CD4 T cells in the gut but also in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. In human an alteration in the composition of the gut microbiota is observed&#xD;
      in numerous autoimmune diseases, including Sjogren's syndrome, suggesting that perturbation&#xD;
      of the gut microbiota might be linked to the pathogenicity of immune cells in the target&#xD;
      organs. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota impacts the pathogenicity of immune&#xD;
      cells in the target organs is unknown. It is proposed that gut immune cells directly exposed&#xD;
      to the microbiota compounds could migrate to the target organs and participate to the buildup&#xD;
      of tissue damages. This hypothesis is supported by studies in mouse models showing the&#xD;
      migration of gut CD4 T cells in the inflamed kidney (glomerulonephritis model) or in the&#xD;
      systemic lymphoid organs (rheumatoid arthritis model). The preliminary data support this&#xD;
      hypothesis as the investigators have shown that gut-derived CD4 T cells display pathogenic&#xD;
      properties in human autoimmune diseases. To determine whether and how the gut-derived immune&#xD;
      cells are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      study the origin and properties of immune cells infiltrated in target tissues in autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sjogren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease in which exocrine gland in particular&#xD;
      lacrimal and salivary glands are affected. One of the hallmark of the disease is the&#xD;
      infiltration of lymphoid cells in the exocrine glands of the patients. Indeed, the presence&#xD;
      of lymphoid infiltrate in the minor labial salivary gland of the patients is one of the most&#xD;
      important diagnostic tool for Sjogren's syndrome. The investigation of lymphoid infiltrates&#xD;
      requires to perform a biopsy of the labial salivary gland. The investigators propose here to&#xD;
      take advantage of this minimally invasive procedure to study the properties of the lymphoid&#xD;
      cells present in the minor salivary glands of Sjogren's patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 200 patients followed in Bordeaux University Hospital in which a&#xD;
      salivary gland biopsy is performed for a clinical suspicion of Sjogren's syndrome. Blood and&#xD;
      a biopsy of the minor salivary gland of the lip will be collected during a scheduled visit to&#xD;
      study the properties of infiltrated immune cells. Clinical and biological disease activity,&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes will be studied in correlation with the properties of infiltrated&#xD;
      immune cells. No extra visit will be needed and the biopsy of the minor salivary gland of the&#xD;
      lip and the blood samples will be collected at the same times as those collected for clinical&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
