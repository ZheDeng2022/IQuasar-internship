  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implanted cardiac devices are commonly used to treat a wide variety of heart diseases,&#xD;
      including arrhythmias, cardiac resynchronization in select heart failure patients, and life&#xD;
      threatening heart rhythms. Approximately 400,000 devices are implanted annually, and more&#xD;
      than 3 million patients currently have implanted devices1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implanted cardiac devices are made to 2 components, the can and the leads. The can contains&#xD;
      the electric circuits and the battery, which must be replaced every 5-10 years. The can is&#xD;
      connected to external leads which pass through the subclavian vein, and depending on the&#xD;
      device, into the vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and/or coronary sinus. Leads&#xD;
      typically last longer than the battery, and are simply reconnected to a new can at the time&#xD;
      of replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain clinical situations necessitate lead removal, including pocket infection, device&#xD;
      related endocarditis, venous stenosis or occlusion with the need for new access, and removal&#xD;
      of abandoned or malfunctioning leads. Removing the leads is technically difficult due to&#xD;
      fibrosis, and requires specialized equipment. Compared to lead implantation, extraction of&#xD;
      leads is relatively rare, with a life time risk of a device patient needing an extraction in&#xD;
      the 1-5% range. Given that this is a relatively rare procedure and is only done at a few&#xD;
      centers, documentation of our experiences with lead extraction can lead to ongoing&#xD;
      improvements in both procedural techniques and outcomes.&#xD;

      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective review of data on patient characteristics (such as age, gender,&#xD;
      co-morbidities), procedure specifications and indications, and outcomes of lead extraction&#xD;
      done at OHSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone either pacemaker or defibrillator lead extraction will have their&#xD;
      charts reviewed for the desired data, which will then be compiled into a database. All&#xD;
      procedures will be part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational registry study; there are no primary or secondary outcomes. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed to determine patient and procedural characteristics, procedure indications,&#xD;
      complications and outcomes&#xD;
