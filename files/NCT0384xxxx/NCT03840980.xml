    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical cohort study involving 100 mothers and their&#xD;
      very preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      gain a thorough understanding of the microbiome (the collection of microbes in a biological&#xD;
      site) establishment in very preterm infants. The study will also examine the perinatal&#xD;
      factors associated with the pattern of microbiome development, the metabolome and immune&#xD;
      development of this population in the first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be recruited from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Foothills&#xD;
      Medical Centre (FMC) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) occurs in about one in ten pregnancies&#xD;
      each year. Babies that are born after less than 32 weeks of pregnancy are considered to be&#xD;
      very premature babies. When babies are born very prematurely their gut is not as developed.&#xD;
      One important factor in gut health is the large community of microbes (tiny living things&#xD;
      such as bacteria) that live on the human body called the microbiome. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that premature babies are more likely to have changes in their gut microbiome that are&#xD;
      associated with health issues. However, sciences has not yet discovered what specific&#xD;
      microbiome features are involved in development of premature babies. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      examines the impact of very premature birth on the premature baby's microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kind of microbes that make up the microbiome in the gut in the first months of life have&#xD;
      a major impact on the microbiome that will form during childhood. There are many&#xD;
      environmental factors during pregnancy, birth and in first months of life that can impact the&#xD;
      microbiome development. These factors include diet, exposure to antibiotics, surgical&#xD;
      procedures, and birth mode. This study will investigate how these factors influence the types&#xD;
      of early microbes present in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that specific microbial patterns, trajectories and/or&#xD;
      metabolites will be significantly associated with single or a combination of perinatal&#xD;
      maternal and/or infant factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to learn more about the development of the microbiome&#xD;
      in very premature babies in the first months of their life. To do this, participating baby's&#xD;
      stool and urine samples will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of the study is to find out how environmental factors impact the&#xD;
      development of the microbiome and the health of preterm infants. In order to do this,&#xD;
      maternal microbiome samples will be studied and information regarding maternal health,&#xD;
      nutrition and environment during pregnancy will be collected. As well, information about the&#xD;
      birth and health of participating preterm neonates will be collected.&#xD;

        Due to the observational nature of this study and the need to understand early microbiome&#xD;
        assembly in all very preterm babies, regardless of the pregnancy complication that led to&#xD;
        their premature birth, this study aims to recruit most very preterm neonates that are&#xD;
        expected to survive more than one week. Neonates with congenital gastrointestinal anomalies&#xD;
        or that have a history of gastrointestinal surgery, will be excluded as these conditions&#xD;
        severely affect the microbiome; however the microbiome will not have contributed to the&#xD;
        development of these conditions. Participants must reside in the Calgary Metropolitan&#xD;
        Region in order to ensure that they can be followed for study participation if transferred&#xD;
        to a level II NICU or discharged to home. Only mothers able to legally consent to study&#xD;
        participation for themselves and their neonate are eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
