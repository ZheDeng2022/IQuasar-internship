  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child maltreatment is a leading cause of death and disability in children. More than 3&#xD;
      million reports to Child Protective Services are made every year in the US and almost 1,600&#xD;
      children die annually due to maltreatment. Children who are victims of maltreatment often&#xD;
      have significant lifelong adverse health, social, and economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate and timely recognition of the early signs of child maltreatment is critical to&#xD;
      decreasing morbidity and mortality. A significant proportion of children who suffer severe&#xD;
      morbidity and/or mortality from maltreatment had been previously evaluated by physician(s)&#xD;
      who did not recognize the abuse. The American Academy of Pediatrics has evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations for the testing which should be done as part of the medical evaluation of&#xD;
      children with suspected physical abuse. However, despite these evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations, physicians fail to consistently screen for and evaluate for abuse even in&#xD;
      high-risk situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed and evaluated what the investigators believe to be the&#xD;
      first, comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) based child abuse clinical decision&#xD;
      support (CA-CDS). This EHR-based CA-CDS system informs medical care at multiple points during&#xD;
      the care for a potentially maltreated child, beginning with identification of suspected abuse&#xD;
      to the handing off of information to CPS which has a mandate to protect children who are&#xD;
      victims of suspected maltreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are disseminating the following aspects of the Electronic Health Record&#xD;
      (EHR) based child abuse- clinical decision support (CA-CDS) system which they developed as&#xD;
      part of the investigator's initial PCORI grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a universal child abuse screen (CAS) - supports identification of maltreatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an embedded child abuse alert system - supports identification of maltreatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. alerts to physicians and advanced practice providers - supports identification of&#xD;
           maltreatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. physical abuse order set - supports proper evaluation of suspected physical abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. documentation assistance for making reports of suspected maltreatment to Child&#xD;
           Protective Services - supports mandated reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to disseminate and implement CA-CDS in two different EHRs in two&#xD;
      hospital systems - Northwell Health (NY) and University of Wisconsin (WI) - and to assess&#xD;
      whether the CA-CDS improves identification, evaluation and mandated reporting of child&#xD;
      maltreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1 is to compare the rates of identification of possible child abuse - defined as reports&#xD;
      to Child Protective Services - before and after integration of CA-CDS into the EHR among&#xD;
      children presenting to 5 Emergency Departments in two different health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2 is to compare the rate of physician compliance with American Academy of Pediatrics&#xD;
      guidelines for evaluation of suspected physical abuse before and after integration of CA-CDS&#xD;
      into the EHR in 5 Emergency Departments in two health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the D&amp;I is complete, the investigators will have demonstrated the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing the CA-CDS in the three EHRs which make up 85% of all the US EHRs. This is a&#xD;
      critical step towards the goal of having a CA-CDS as a standard EHR component.&#xD;

      guidelines for evaluation of suspected physical abuse before and after integration of CA-CDS&#xD;
      into the EHR in 5 Emergency Departments in two health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process metrics: Rapid cycle usability testing will be one of the earliest assessments of the&#xD;
      end-user acceptability of the CA-CDS and changes will be made to the CA-CDS based on these&#xD;
      data. Process metrics which will be measured throughout the live period, including proportion&#xD;
      of patients who receive a CAS, how often the CAS is positive, which question(s) of the CAS&#xD;
      are positive, how often any part of the CA-CDS triggers, how often order sets are used, and&#xD;
      how often providers dismiss the alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term outcomes: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographics of the&#xD;
      population. For Aim 1, the primary outcome is the report made to CPS. The proportion of&#xD;
      children who have a report made to CPS will be calculated for both the silent mode (before)&#xD;
      and live (after) groups, including race and insurance type. For Aim 2, the primary outcome is&#xD;
      compliance with the AAP guidelines for evaluation of suspected abuse in children &lt;2 yrs of&#xD;
      age. The proportion of providers who are compliant with the guidelines will be calculated for&#xD;
      both groups. Another short-term outcome will be the use of provider surveys to determine the&#xD;
      impact of the CA-CDS on clinical decision making and efficacy with identifying and evaluating&#xD;
      suspected child maltreatment. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of provider&#xD;
      training and patient racial, ethnic and socioeconomic status on these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term outcomes: A long-term outcome is whether the CA-CDS is integrated into clinical&#xD;
      practice after the end of the D&amp;I. Another long-term outcome is evaluation of the proportion&#xD;
      of cases of child maltreatment in which the child had been evaluated at least once previously&#xD;
      and the diagnosis of abuse was missed; a decrease in this proportion is a true measure of&#xD;
      improved outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the D&amp;I is complete, the investigators will have demonstrated the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing the CA-CDS in the three EHRs which make up 85% of all the US EHRs. This is a&#xD;
      critical step towards the goal of having a CA-CDS as a standard EHR component.&#xD;
