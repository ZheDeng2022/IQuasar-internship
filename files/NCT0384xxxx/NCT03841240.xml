    <textblock>
      In this prospective clinical study, the researchers investigate the incidence of&#xD;
      catheter-related thrombosis and catheter-related infection during indwelling central venous&#xD;
      catheterization in critically ill patients, and analyzed the risk factors for&#xD;
      catheter-related complications and the relationship between catheter-related thrombi and&#xD;
      catheter-related infections. The sample size is about 500.&#xD;

      A prospective clinical trial is conducted. Five hundred participants who need to place&#xD;
      central venous catheters admit to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Zhujiang&#xD;
      Hospital,Southern Medical University from February 2019. Ultrasound is used for screening&#xD;
      catheter-related thrombosis, and catheter-related infections are diagnosed according to the&#xD;
      Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis and catheter-related&#xD;
      infections. The primary exposure factors are age, gender, APACHE II, RBC, Hct, PLT, FIB,&#xD;
      D-dimer, PCT, blood glucose, anticoagulants, and vasoactive drugs, catheter type, tube&#xD;
      placement, indwelling time, etc. Descriptive analysis is used for the incidence of various&#xD;
      complications. T-test or non-parametric statistical test is used for single factor analysis&#xD;
      of risk factors, chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability test is used for counting&#xD;
      data. Multivariate analysis of risk factors and the relationship between complications are&#xD;
      analyzed by logistic regression. Statistical analysis is performed with SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      version 20.&#xD;
