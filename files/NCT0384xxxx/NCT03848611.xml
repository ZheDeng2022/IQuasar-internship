    <textblock>
      This study was a one-arm, single-center, phase II clinical study. Patients who meet the&#xD;
      enrollment criteria will receive CM082 tablets 150mg once daily (qd) orally (taken within&#xD;
      half an hour after daily breakfast) in combination with JS001 (3mg/kg, once every 2 weeks,&#xD;
      q2w), every 28 days a treatment cycle until the disease progresses, the toxicity is&#xD;
      intolerable, the investigator or subject decides to withdraw, loses to follow up, starts&#xD;
      using other anti-tumor treatments or dies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into the following five stages--screening period, treatment period, end&#xD;
      of treatment / withdrawal treatment, follow-up after treatment, survival follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period Subjects should be informed and signed an informed consent form prior to&#xD;
      screening assessment. Screening should be performed within 28 days prior to dosing. After the&#xD;
      investigator confirms compliance with the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the subject may be enrolled in the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period At this stage the subject will be treated with CM082 and JS001 until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxicity, the investigator or subject decides to quit, is lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, begins using other anti-tumor treatments or dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, subjects received a safety assessment every 4 weeks; tumor assessments were&#xD;
      performed 6 weeks after the first visit and every 8 weeks after the first tumor assessment.&#xD;
      Tumor progression will be evaluated simultaneously according to RECIST criteria and iRECIST&#xD;
      criteria. Subjects identified as confirmed progressive disease(iCPD) according to iRECIST&#xD;
      criteria should discontinue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of treatment / withdrawal treatment End of treatment(EOT)visit evaluation should be&#xD;
      performed as soon as possible after the subject has discontinued the test drug. Anyone who&#xD;
      discontinues treatment or withdraws from treatment for reasons other than progression of the&#xD;
      disease should perform a safety assessment as soon as possible, while continuing to perform a&#xD;
      tumor assessment at the same frequency as the treatment period until disease progression or&#xD;
      initiation of other anti-tumor treatments. However, subjects who have terminated treatment&#xD;
      due to disease progression need only undergo a safety assessment and no longer have a tumor&#xD;
      assessment. If the subject terminates treatment due to toxicity or other reasons at the last&#xD;
      visit and does not continue taking the test drug afterwards, the visit is considered to be&#xD;
      the end of treatment/exit treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after treatment For subjects who completed the trial or withdrew their informed&#xD;
      consent, all adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications must be recorded up to 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of the trial, and all new AEs were issued within 30 days of the last&#xD;
      trial dose. For subjects who started using other anti-tumor therapies, AEs that were not&#xD;
      severe and that the investigator considered unrelated to the test drug were no longer&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival follow-up Subjects with disease progression or other anti-tumor treatments will no&#xD;
      longer undergo safety and tumor assessment, but continue to collect data on overall survival&#xD;
      and follow-up treatment at telephone follow-up every 12 weeks until the patient dies or loses&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Patients who discontinue treatment due to disease progression (except for patients&#xD;
      withdrawing informed consent, loss of follow-up, death) should continue to follow the tumor&#xD;
      assessments according to the original frequency (no safety assessment). Once disease&#xD;
      progression has occurred or other anti-tumor drugs have been used, a telephone survival&#xD;
      follow-up is performed every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
