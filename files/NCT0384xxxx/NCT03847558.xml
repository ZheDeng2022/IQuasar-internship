    <textblock>
      Thalassemia refers to a group of inherited diseases characterized by decreased or absent&#xD;
      synthesis of normal globin chains . The direct consequence is an imbalance of the alpha and&#xD;
      beta globin chain synthesis that results in anemia from ineffective erythropoiesis and&#xD;
      hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term thalassemia major refers to the severe form that is often associated with life-long&#xD;
      transfusion dependent anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypogonadism is the most frequently reported endocrine complication, affecting 70-80% of&#xD;
      thalassemia major patients. Hypogonadism is likely to be caused by iron deposits in the&#xD;
      gonads, pituitary gland or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism resulting from iron deposition in the pituitary gonadotrope is&#xD;
      more commonly found than gonadal iron deposition in ovaries or testes occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deposition in the anterior pituitary gland can be demonstrated beginning in the first&#xD;
      decade of life, but clinical manifestations are usually not evident until the onset of&#xD;
      puberty. At the earlier stage, only a diminished gonadotropin reserve with intact&#xD;
      gonadotropin pulse was observed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct effect of iron, in particular that of NTBI(non-transferrin-bound iron) on the&#xD;
      ovaries and testes is currently unknown. The ovarian reserve is preserved in the majority of&#xD;
      female thalassemia patients, even in women with amenorrhea. In males, histological&#xD;
      examination of testicular tissues from autopsies demonstrated testicular interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis with small, heavily pigmented, undifferentiated seminiferous tubules and an absence&#xD;
      of Leydig cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main clinical presentations of the HPG(hypothalamic pituitary gonadal&#xD;
      axis)axis derangement in thalassemia major, including delayed puberty, arrested puberty and&#xD;
      hypogonadism. Delayed puberty is defined as the absence of any pubertal signs by 14 years in&#xD;
      boys and 13 years in girls . Arrested puberty is defined as the absence of further pubertal&#xD;
      progression for more than 1 year after puberty has started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chelation therapy with desferoxamine before the age of puberty has helped patients to attain&#xD;
      normal sexual maturation in some studies but not in others. In a study of 40 patients with&#xD;
      transfusion-dependent thalassemia major, 90% of 19 patients who began treatment with&#xD;
      desferoxamine before the age of 10 had normal sexual development compared with only 38% of&#xD;
      those treated after the age of 10. In contrast, another study reported no difference in the&#xD;
      frequency of pubertal maturation when iron chelation therapy was started at the age of 10 or&#xD;
      earlier. Serum ferritin levels were still higher than normal in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a period of 5-7 years, 50% of hypogonadal males achieved normal testosterone levels and&#xD;
      32% of amenorrheic women became pregnant, either spontaneously or using in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization . With modern medications, iron-induced hypogonadism may be reversible with&#xD;
      intensive iron chelation regimens.&#xD;
