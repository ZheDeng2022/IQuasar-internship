      This is a randomized, open-Label, multicenter, Phase III study assessing the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of HS-10296 versus gefitinib as first-line treatment in patients with epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm+), locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either HS-10296 (110mg&#xD;
      orally, once daily) or gefitinib (250mg orally, once daily) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

        Any patient who meets all of the following inclusion criteria will qualify for entry into&#xD;
        the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and&#xD;
             analyses.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (e.g. this may occur&#xD;
             systemic recurrence after prior surgery for early stage disease or patients may be&#xD;
             newly diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV disease). Patients must be treatment-na√Øve for&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Prior adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy is&#xD;
             permitted (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational agents) provided all other&#xD;
             entry criteria are satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The tumour harbours one of the 2 common EGFR mutations known to be associated with&#xD;
             EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R), either or in combination with other EGFR&#xD;
             mutations assessed by central testing using tumour tissue sample or blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A WHO performance status equal to 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks&#xD;
             and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.&#xD;

             axis ‚â• 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             whichever is suitable for accurately repeated measurements. If only one measurable&#xD;
             lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as it has not&#xD;
             been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at least&#xD;
             14days afar the screening biopsy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  treatments, and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not by tubal ligation.&#xD;
