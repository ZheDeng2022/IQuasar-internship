      This is a randomized, open-Label, multicenter, Phase III study assessing the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of HS-10296 versus gefitinib as first-line treatment in patients with epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm+), locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either HS-10296 (110mg&#xD;
      orally, once daily) or gefitinib (250mg orally, once daily) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient who meets all of the following inclusion criteria will qualify for entry into&#xD;
        the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and&#xD;
             analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, age at least 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (e.g. this may occur&#xD;
             systemic recurrence after prior surgery for early stage disease or patients may be&#xD;
             newly diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV disease). Patients must be treatment-naïve for&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Prior adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy is&#xD;
             permitted (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational agents) provided all other&#xD;
             entry criteria are satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The tumour harbours one of the 2 common EGFR mutations known to be associated with&#xD;
             EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R), either or in combination with other EGFR&#xD;
             mutations assessed by central testing using tumour tissue sample or blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A WHO performance status equal to 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks&#xD;
             and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.&#xD;

             axis ≥ 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             whichever is suitable for accurately repeated measurements. If only one measurable&#xD;
             lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as it has not&#xD;
             been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at least&#xD;
             14days afar the screening biopsy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures throughout the study; should&#xD;
             not be breastfeeding at the time of screening, during the study and until 3 months&#xD;

             of dosing if of childbearing potential or must have evidence of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential by fulfilling 1 of the following criteria at Screening:&#xD;

                  treatments, and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not by tubal ligation.&#xD;

                  investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Prior treatment with an EGFR TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension or active bleeding diatheses, which, in the Investigator's opinion, makes&#xD;
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial OR which would jeopardize&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol such as active infection. Screening for chronic&#xD;
             conditions is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to&#xD;

                  block, second-degree heart block, PR interval &gt; 250 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events, such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in&#xD;
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable&#xD;
