      The aim of the study was to assess the advantages of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      defecography to elucidate the underlying anatomic and pathophysiologic background in&#xD;
      obstructed defecation patients to guide physicians in patient management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a term used to describe the whole complex of&#xD;
      mechanical and functional disorders leading to difficult or inadequate rectal emptying.&#xD;
      obstructed defecation syndrome has prevalence rate 3.4 % in general population, In obstructed&#xD;
      defecation feces do reach the rectum, but rectal emptying is extremely difficult. These&#xD;
      patients have a feeling that defecation is blocked. Despite repetitive attempts, complete&#xD;
      evacuation of rectal contents is not possible. The patients may also complain of prolonged&#xD;
      and unsuccessful straining at stools, feelings of incomplete evacuation, digital removal of&#xD;
      feces, and laxative abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation caused by obstructed defecation is of two basic types: functional and&#xD;
      mechanical. The functional type includes anismus (pelvic floor dys-synergy), and descending&#xD;
      perineal syndrome, whereas the mechanical type includes rectocele, enterocele, internal&#xD;
      intussusception and overt rectal prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these conditions represent either a defect of pelvic support or abnormal function of&#xD;
      the pelvic floor musculature. The etiology of ODS is controversial. It is presumed that in&#xD;
      childbearing women damage to the innervation and soft tissues of the pelvis may occur as a&#xD;
      direct consequence of vaginal childbirth. Trauma to the pelvic soft tissues can result in&#xD;
      endopelvic fascial and pelvic support defects. Cumulative nerve damage from stretching of&#xD;
      pelvic floor due to childbirth and activities that cause chronic and repetitive increases in&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure such as obesity and chronic cough have been suggested to play a role&#xD;
      in the development of symptomatic defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients frequently complain of constipation, symptoms such as fruitless straining&#xD;
      and incomplete evacuation are rather subjective and unreliable. Nevertheless, an&#xD;
      international team of experts included these symptoms in the definition of constipation.This&#xD;
      Rome III guidelines, for a patient to be labeled as suffering from functional constipation,&#xD;
      which also includes obstructed defecation, following criteria should be present for at least&#xD;
      3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Must include two or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Straining during at least 25% of defecations,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sensation of ano-rectal obstruction/ blockage for at least 25% of defecations,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital&#xD;
                evacuation, support of the pelvic floor),&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Fewer than three defecations per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. The same criteria define&#xD;
           dys-synergic defecation as inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor or less than&#xD;
           20% relaxation of basal resting sphincter pressure with adequate propulsive forces&#xD;
           during attempted defecation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      On physical examination, the paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor can be assessed by&#xD;
      palpation of the puborectalis muscle while the patient is straining . Perineal descent &gt;3 cm,&#xD;
      mucous discharge or mucosal prolapse may also be seen when the patient is asked to strain for&#xD;
      stools . However, most clinicians do not rely on palpation and advocate the use of specific&#xD;
      tests to diagnose ODS . Electromyography (EMG) of the pelvic floor, the balloon expulsion&#xD;
      test (BET), and defecography are the most frequently used tests. Other radiologic methods for&#xD;
      the dynamic evaluation of the ODS include magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography,&#xD;
      each of which has its advantages and limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging sequences provides a new alternative to&#xD;
      study all pelvic visceral movements in a dynamic fashion. MR defecography has several&#xD;
      important advantages over conventional defecography. Its non-ionic nature, multiplanar&#xD;
      capacity, dynamic evaluation and good temporal resolution along with its high-resolution&#xD;
      soft-tissue contrast makes it an ideal modality in the assessment of ODS patients. Imaging in&#xD;
      the mid-sagittal plane allows evaluation of the anal canal, anorectal angle, levator muscle&#xD;
      and hiatus and the vaginal disposition as well as their relationship to a consistent&#xD;
      electronically designated pubo-coccygeal Line (PCL). Diagnostic parameters for pelvic&#xD;
      dys-synergy include an indented impression of the pubococcygeus muscle on the rectum with&#xD;
      excessive obtuse anorectal angulation accompanied by very prolonged rectal emptying on&#xD;
      T2-weighted MR images.&#xD;
