  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The accurate estimation of the time of death is a challenge in forensic medicine,&#xD;
      as the methods routinely used to assess the post-mortem interval (PMI) are far from being&#xD;
      precise. Recent developments in biochemical techniques may provide the opportunity to assist&#xD;
      in more precise estimation of the time of death. The focus has been placed on the study of&#xD;
      the biochemical profiles of closed compartment body fluids, as they are longer preserved than&#xD;
      blood after death and subject to confined post-mortem chemical changes. Cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) has been considered as a suitable fluid to investigate these changes, as it is easy to&#xD;
      sample and found in large amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its closeness to the central nervous system (CNS), CSF is used in clinical settings&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of various CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, whose diagnosis is&#xD;
      mainly based on the increase of the concentrations of Tau protein and its phosphorylated&#xD;
      isoform (p-Tau) in CSF. A post mortem leakage of Tau into the CSF has also been shown,&#xD;
      reflecting progressive neuronal death as in Alzheimer's disease. In this exploratory,&#xD;
      cross-sectional study, we investigated Tau in post mortem CSF as a potential biomarker of the&#xD;
      time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective was to assess the correlation between the concentration of Tau&#xD;
      in CSF and the PMI. The secondary objectives were (1) to determine the inter-individual&#xD;
      variability of the concentration of Tau for a same PMI; (2) to determine the kinetics of this&#xD;
      concentration over time in the same individual; (3) to determine the variability of this&#xD;
      concentration according to the site of collection (lumbar vs. sub-occipital).&#xD;

      concentration according to the site of collection (lumbar vs. sub-occipital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Montpellier. Post mortem CSF samples were collected from 80 adult&#xD;
      cadavers whose time of death was precisely known, at the mortuary of the University Hospital&#xD;
      of Montpellier. Individuals with neurological disorders and head trauma were excluded from&#xD;
      the study, as well as subjects with unknown past medical history or cause of death. CSF&#xD;
      samples were removed by cisternal and lumbar punctures at the time of arrival at the&#xD;
      mortuary, before refrigeration. A few mL of CSF were obtained at each tap in clean, sterile&#xD;
      polypropylene tubes, using a 18G lumbar puncture needle. The cadavers were divided into four&#xD;
      groups according to the PMI (n=25 in each group). The samples were taken 0-6 h (group A),&#xD;
      6-12 h (group B), 12-18 h (group C) and 18-24 h (group D) after death. Additionally, CSF&#xD;
      samples were collected every 3h from 10 cadavers during the first 15 h post mortem. All&#xD;
      cadavers were kept at room temperature (+20 ± 2°C) during sample collection. CSF samples were&#xD;
      transferred at +4°C to the laboratory where they were centrifuged for 10 min (+4°C, 1000 g).&#xD;
      The clear supernatant was divided into aliquots then stored at -80°C until analysis. The&#xD;
      rectal and tympanic temperatures were measured at the time of CSF collection using a probe&#xD;
      thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations of Tau and and its phosphorylated isoform (p-Tau) were measured by&#xD;
      conventional immunoassays, while total protein concentration was determined using a&#xD;
      bicinchoninic acid protein assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation coefficient between the concentration of Tau in CSF and the PMI was&#xD;
      calculated in each case. The inter-individual variability was assessed by measuring the&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD) of the mean concentration of Tau in each group. Linear regression&#xD;
      analysis (adjusted for confounders) was used in assessing whether Tau concentration was&#xD;
      dependent on the PMI. Paired Student's t-test was used to assess the variability of Tau&#xD;
      concentration depending on the site of CSF collection&#xD;
