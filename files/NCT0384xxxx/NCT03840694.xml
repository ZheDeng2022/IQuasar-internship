  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find out how smoking affects the way the brain responds to pleasure&#xD;
      and how this impacts smokers' behavior. Participants will complete three sessions. The first&#xD;
      session will be a screening and training visit to determine final eligibility. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will work with a researcher to develop brief scripts about times when they smoke&#xD;
      and do other activities. Next, participants will attend two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scans - one after abstaining from smoking for 24 hours and the other after smoking as usual.&#xD;
      After the second MRI, participants will answer questions on their phone every day for two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Anticipated and actual pleasure ratings acquired each day during EMA portion of study. Individual items are based on the 12-item Tripartite Pleasure Inventory (TPI). Participants rate their anticipated pleasure for activities they expect to engage in each day using a 0 (No pleasure) to 4 (Extreme pleasure) scale in the morning. They will then rate their actual experienced pleasure for activities they actually did engage in the evening using the same scale. Scores are summed across items for a theoretical range of 0-48.</description>

    <ipd_description>Detailed protocols, datasets and additional information will be available from the Principal Investigator and research team upon request. In order to maintain compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, as well as university data security policies, all data will be anonymized according to HIPAA guidelines prior to being shared. Individual participant scripts will not be made publicly available due to privacy concerns and because this could impact the nature of information participants were willing to provide for scripts. Data will be provided in widely accessible formats for both self-report and imaging data. We will work with the Office of Research Contracts to obtain guidance regarding any required Data Use Agreements as needed.</ipd_description>
