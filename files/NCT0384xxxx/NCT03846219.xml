  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group&#xD;
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 once-daily oral doses of IMU-838 (vidofludimus&#xD;
      calcium), a small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), 30 mg/day and&#xD;
      45 mg/day, in patients with RRMS and evidence of active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening period, a blinded 24-week main treatment period, and an&#xD;
      optional initially blinded, then open-label extended treatment period of up to 9.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 40 centers are planned to participate in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Poland;&#xD;
      potential additional centers in Hungary and Croatia. In total, 195 patients are planned to be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with 30 mg/day or 45 mg/day IMU-838, or placebo (65 patients&#xD;
      each) in the main treatment period. During the extended treatment period, patients will be&#xD;
      re-randomized such that patients previously on placebo will be re-randomized 1:1 to treatment&#xD;
      with 30 g/day or 45 mg/day IMU-838, all other patients will be re-randomized to the same&#xD;
      treatment they previously received.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference Between 45 mg/Day IMU-838 and Placebo in the Cumulative Number of Combined Unique Active (CUA) MRI Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>MRI scans were assessed centrally and adhered to a standardized MRI protocol. Estimates were adjusted for baseline volume of T2 lesions, MRI field strength (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla), and baseline number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions (0, ≥1) using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. Log transformation of time from first IMP dose to date of last MRI assessment was used as offset term. Mainly due to the differing number of patients with 3.0 Tesla MRI examinations in each treatment arm, the statistical adjustments (to ensure comparabiltiy) for each individual comparison differed and hence the adjusted mean cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions in each arm (e.g. placebo) differed depending on the comparison (45 mg IMU-838 vs placebo, 30 mg IMU-838 vs placebo, or 45 mg vs 30 mg IMU-838).</description>

The evaluation of RBC in urine was to be solely based on findings from microscopic examinations of urinary sediment and not from dipstick reading only. Therefore, all conspicuous dipstick readings were to be followed up by a microscopic examination of urinary sediment. All findings of RBC in urine per high-powered field (HPF) were to be listed as urinalysis abnormalities but not as an AE, if assessed by the investigator as not clinically significant. The investigator was also to assess any increased RBC in urine as not clinically significant, if there were more likely alternatives to explain this finding.</description>

          <title>Expanded Disability Status Scale</title>
          <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale composite rating system ranges from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5-unit increments. EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to a functional status of patients with MS with some limitations within at least one functional system, but still able to walk without any aid. EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to walk.</description>

        <title>Difference Between 45 mg/Day IMU-838 and Placebo in the Cumulative Number of Combined Unique Active (CUA) MRI Lesions</title>
        <description>MRI scans were assessed centrally and adhered to a standardized MRI protocol. Estimates were adjusted for baseline volume of T2 lesions, MRI field strength (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla), and baseline number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions (0, ≥1) using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. Log transformation of time from first IMP dose to date of last MRI assessment was used as offset term. Mainly due to the differing number of patients with 3.0 Tesla MRI examinations in each treatment arm, the statistical adjustments (to ensure comparabiltiy) for each individual comparison differed and hence the adjusted mean cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions in each arm (e.g. placebo) differed depending on the comparison (45 mg IMU-838 vs placebo, 30 mg IMU-838 vs placebo, or 45 mg vs 30 mg IMU-838).</description>

        <description>MRI scans were assessed centrally and adhered to a standardized MRI protocol. Estimates were adjusted for baseline volume of T2 lesions, MRI field strength (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla), and baseline number of Gd+ lesions (0, ≥1) using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. Log transformation of time from first IMP dose to date of last MRI assessment was used as offset term.</description>

        <description>MRI scans were assessed centrally and adhered to a standardized MRI protocol. Estimates were adjusted for MRI field strength (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla) and baseline number of Gd+ lesions (0, ≥1) using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. Log transformation of time from first IMP dose to date of last MRI assessment was used as offset term.</description>

        <title>Differences Between Individual Treatments and Between the Pooled 30 mg/Day and 45 mg/Day Groups and Placebo in the Relapse-related Clinical Endpoints: Mean Annualized Relapse Rate (During Main and Extended Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>The adjusted mean annualized relapse rate during the main treatment period was calculated. Estimates were adjusted for baseline number of Gd+ lesions (0, ≥1) using a Poisson model with a logarithmic link function. Log transformation of real exposure time of main treatment period was used as offset term.&#xD;
All of the following criteria had to be met for a clinical event to qualify as a relapse:&#xD;
Neurological deficit, either newly appearing or re-appearing, with abnormality specified by both neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding relapse AND neurological abnormality lasting for at least 24 hours&#xD;
Absence of fever or known infection (i.e. temperature [axillary, oral, or intra-auricular]&#xD;
≤37.5ºC)&#xD;
Neurological impairment, defined as either increase in at least one of the functional systems of the EDSS OR increase of the total EDSS score. In both cases, the increase in EDSS had to correlate with the patient's reported symptoms.</description>

          <title>Differences Between Treatments in Changes of Disease Activity as Measured by the Number of Patients With EDSS Progression During the Main and Extended Period (Every 12 Weeks Starting at Week 12, and Cumulatively)</title>
          <description>The EDSS is a widely used and validated instrument evaluating the functional systems of the CNS to describe disease progression and the efficacy of MS therapy. The composite rating system ranges from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5-unit increments. EDSS progression was defined as an increase of the EDSS score compared to Baseline of at least 1.0 point for patients with a baseline EDSS score of 1 to 4.0 or of at least 1.5 points for patients with a baseline EDSS score of 0.</description>

        <description>The number of patients diagnosed with red blood cell (RBC) urine positive of at least moderate intensity during the main treatment period were assessed.&#xD;
The evaluation of RBC in urine was to be solely based on findings from microscopic examinations of urinary sediment and not from dipstick reading only. Therefore, all conspicuous dipstick readings were to be followed up by a microscopic examination of urinary sediment. All findings of RBC in urine per high-powered field (HPF) were to be listed as urinalysis abnormalities but not as an AE, if assessed by the investigator as not clinically significant. The investigator was also to assess any increased RBC in urine as not clinically significant, if there were more likely alternatives to explain this finding.</description>

        <description>The 12-lead ECG was recorded in supine position after at least 5 minutes at rest using the local standard ECG machine. The ECG was analyzed qualitatively (normal or abnormal, if abnormal clinically significant [yes/no]). The heart rate, PQ-, QRS-, and QT intervals, as well as the heart rate-corrected QTc interval (according to Bazett's formula) were determined. All procedures were done according to local practice.</description>
