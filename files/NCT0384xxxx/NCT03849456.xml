  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerability of GWP42006 (cannabidivarin, CBDV) in children and&#xD;
      young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to examine the effect of GWP42006 on&#xD;
      communication, social interactions, sleep, behavior, and cognition profiles.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GWP42006.&#xD;
      Participants who satisfy all eligibility criteria will start GWP42006 at a dose of 2.5&#xD;
      milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and titrate to a target dose of 10 mg/kg/day or&#xD;
      800 mg/day, whichever is smaller, during the first 4 weeks of treatment. If there is&#xD;
      intolerance during titration, the participant may be maintained on a dose below 10 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
      The maximum dose participants aged 6 years or older can receive will be 20 mg/kg/day or 1600&#xD;
      mg/day, whichever is smaller. Following the final treatment dose, participants will taper&#xD;
      GWP42006 10% per day. The investigator will withdraw participants who fail to demonstrate any&#xD;
      perceived benefit and may withdraw participants for whom tolerability is poor.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced Severe Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 403</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) with an onset date on or after the first dose of GWP42006. If an AE had a partial onset date and it was unclear from the partial date (or the stop date) whether the AE started prior to or following the first dose of GWP42006, then the AE was considered a TEAE. The number of participants who experienced one or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through to the Safety Follow-up will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Children's Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or Early Termination (ET)</time_frame>
    <description>The CCC-2 is a caregiver-completed measure designed to assess the communication skills of children 4 to 16 years of age. An increase in score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS-2 assesses social impairment associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Total scores between 58 and 72 indicate a mild deficiency, between 73 and 97 indicate a moderate deficiency, and 98 or above indicate a severe deficiency. A decrease in total score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd Edition (Vineland-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland-3 measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. Score ranges are as follows: 70 to 80, borderline adaptive functioning; 51 to 70, mildly deficient adaptive functioning; 35 to 50, moderately deficient adaptive behavior; 20 to 35, severely deficient adaptive behavior; less than 20, markedly or profoundly deficient adaptive behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery has computerized instruments that measure several ability subdomains important for cognitive health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Repetitive Behavioral Scale - Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The RBS-R is used to measure the breadth of repetitive behavior in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD. Total scores range from 0 to 129. A decrease in total score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The CSHQ is used to examine sleep behavior in young children. Responses are given on a 5-point scale (1 = always; 5 = never). A higher score reflects more sleep problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC assesses the presence and severity of various problem behaviors commonly observed in individuals diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Total scores range from 0 to 174. A decrease in total score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-Improvement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 365) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-Improvement evaluates the change from the initiation of treatment in the severity of psychopathology using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Lower scores represent an improvement.</description>
