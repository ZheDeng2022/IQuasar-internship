  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal wall hernias are common, with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inguinal and femoral hernias are the most common affections faced by primary care physicians&#xD;
      that require surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common hernia in both sexes is the indirect inguinal hernia. The male-to-female&#xD;
      ratio is 9:1 for inguinal hernias and 1:3 for femoral hernias. Inguinal hernia repair is one&#xD;
      of the most common operations undertaken in routine surgical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the introduction of the Bassini method in 1887, more than 70 types of pure tissue&#xD;
      repair have been reported in the surgical literature. Throughout the years, attention was&#xD;
      paid to the recurrences that occur after the use of tissue approximation technique, in the&#xD;
      literature it has been reported that they occur in up to 34% of cases, being that the actual&#xD;
      incidence of recurrences it is underreported, therefore, the repair of the hernia with&#xD;
      approximation of tissue has practically been abandoned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of tension free repair for hernias was introduced by Lichtenstein who explain&#xD;
      that the prime etiologic factor behind most herniorrhaphy failures is the suturing together,&#xD;
      under tension, of structures that are not normally in apposition. The technique of the&#xD;
      hernioplasty with the use of mesh was not widely accepted at first, the expansion of the use&#xD;
      of mesh expanded for years. The use of mesh increased from 7 per cent of all operations in&#xD;
      1992 to 51 per cent in 1996. Currently, groin hernia treatment is not standardized but,&#xD;
      today, tension free mesh repair technique is regarded as gold standard. Based in the Stoppa&#xD;
      technique, the laparoscopic hernia repair was developed in 1991. The most common laparoscopic&#xD;
      techniques for inguinal hernia repair are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and&#xD;
      total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair. The use of the laparoscopic technique was progressively&#xD;
      increasing based on the advantages of minimal invasive procedures, but since the publication&#xD;
      of Neumayer in 2004, where he reports a recurrent incidence in laparoscopic hernia of 10.1 %&#xD;
      compared with 4% for open surgery, the use of laparoscopic repair declines considerably.&#xD;
      Surgeons remain divided on the best technique for inguinal hernia repair: while more than&#xD;
      half never perform laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, today the laparoscopic technique for&#xD;
      hernia repair is used in 28% of cases, of which 25% is used the TEP approach and is&#xD;
      considered the best approach for bilateral inguinal hernia repair (17). Advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of TEP are: faster return to usual activities, operation times are longer and&#xD;
      there appears to be a higher risk of serious complication rate in respect of visceral&#xD;
      (especially bladder) and vascular injuries (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1999, Gilbert published the use of bilayer patch device, known as prolene Â® hernia system&#xD;
      (Ethicon; Somerville, NJ, USA) (PHS) to repair inguinal hernia. The unique feature of this&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh device is that it has attached the component, its underlay patch provides&#xD;
      a pre-peritoneal repair, a connector that has the desirable attributes of a plug and an onlay&#xD;
      patch covers the back wall. In the literature, better results have been reported for PHS&#xD;
      repair than for Lichtenstein repair. The advantages of the anterior repair of inguinal&#xD;
      hernias are: low operative costs, short learning curve, reproducible results at all levels&#xD;
      and the possibility of the use of local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the results of laparoscopic totally&#xD;
      extra-peritoneal repair (LTEPR) with open prolene hernia system repair (OPHSR)&#xD;
      retrospectively.&#xD;

      In our environment, 10367 (10.41% of all surgeries) hernia repair are performed in one year,&#xD;
      of witch 5797 (51.92%) are inguinal hernia repair, of them 2870 (49.51%) are performed&#xD;
      laparoscopically and 2927 (50.49%) are performed using different open repair techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients that underwent LTEPR repair of inguinal hernia from 2003 to 2007 and&#xD;
      open OPHSR inguinal hernia repair from 2008 to 2015, were analyzed. A total of 577 patients&#xD;
      were included divided in two groups, the LTEPR group 293 patients and in the OPHSR group 284&#xD;
      patient. The selection of patients for LTEPR was bilateral inguinal hernia or recurrence&#xD;
      after open repair, for OPHSR was unilateral inguinal hernia or health condition with&#xD;
      preference to regional or local anesthesia. The follow up of all patients was between 18 to&#xD;
      60 months (mean 38.10 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The LTEPR group was operated by two surgeons with long experience in laparoscopic&#xD;
      hernia repair in a public hospital. The selected patients were those with bilateral inguinal&#xD;
      hernia or recurrent hernia after open surgery, patients with contraindication for general&#xD;
      anesthesia and patients with low midline scar or Pfannenstiel incision were excluded.&#xD;
      Patients of the OPHSR group were operated in a private hospital by medical specialists in&#xD;
      surgery with experience in repair using PHS; patients under local anesthesia were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative technique Pre-op antibiotic shot of 2rd generation cephalosporin was given to all&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For LTEPR, under general anesthesia and supine position the plane preperitoneal was developed&#xD;
      using a kidney-balloon trocar (Covidien-Medtronic, New Haven, CT, USA) using the 45 degrees&#xD;
      scope to evaluate the plane. After developing the preperitoneal space, a structural trocar&#xD;
      (Covidien-Medtronic, New Haven, CT, USA) was inserted and the space inflated with gas with&#xD;
      low pressure. One working 10-millimeter trocar was inserted in the midline high as possible,&#xD;
      if was necessary one more 5-millimeter trocar was inserted under the first one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An atraumatic dissection of the groin was performed, the regional vessels (Corona Mortis,&#xD;
      femoral and epigastric) were recognized, the cord was dissected and the peritoneal edge&#xD;
      separated and retracted proximally wherever possible. A broad dissection was performed&#xD;
      laterally including the Bogros space and superiorly releasing the peritoneum from the&#xD;
      anterior abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To repair the groin, we use a heavyweight poli-propilene mesh 15X15 centimeters, divides in a&#xD;
      piece of 15X5 centimeter inserted under the cord and fixed with helical tackers&#xD;
      (Covidien-Medtronic, New Haven, CT, USA) to the ramus pubis and laterally to the transverse&#xD;
      abdominal muscle. The second piece of mesh, 10X15 centimeter above the cord overlapping the&#xD;
      anterior piece and fixing it to the rectus abdomini and to first mesh inserted. The gas was&#xD;
      released and Bupivacaine Hydrochloride 0.5% was injected trough the trocar in the&#xD;
      preperitoneal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For OPHSR, under regional or general anesthesia, in supine position, the groin was incised&#xD;
      transversally, the planes were developed and after reduce de sac, the entry to the&#xD;
      pre-peritoneal space was gained through the internal ring in indirect hernias, or medial&#xD;
      defect in direct hernias. The preperitoneal space was the developed widely in atraumatic way.&#xD;
      The posterior patch of the PHS was introduced pre-peritoneally and the onlay patch was fixed&#xD;
      with continuous polypropylene sutures or separate stitches. Bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.5%&#xD;
      was injected into the tissue around the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the institution's ethics committee (Helsinki board). Statistical&#xD;
      analysis All of the measured variables and derived parameters were tabulated using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. For the categorical variables, the summary tables provided the sample&#xD;
      size, and absolute and relative frequencies. For the continuous variables, the summary tables&#xD;
      provided the sample size, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum&#xD;
      values, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the means of the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
      Differences between two groups were analyzed using the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      and t-test as adequate. Results were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
