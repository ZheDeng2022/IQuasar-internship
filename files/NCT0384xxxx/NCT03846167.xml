  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with known or suspected, in the opinion of an investigator, primary or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer may be eligible for this study. Up to 30 evaluable patients will undergo study&#xD;
      imaging in this protocol. The imaging procedure may include one or both of the following&#xD;
      imaging sessions; 1) a 45- 60 minute dynamic scan, starting at approximately the same time as&#xD;
      the injection and/or 2) a skull base to mid-thigh scan starting approximately 60 minutes post&#xD;
      injection of [18F]FTT. The planned scanning protocol will be selected by an investigator and&#xD;
      will be discussed with the subject prior to the imaging visit. The PET/CT scan will include&#xD;
      an injection of [18F]FTT. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of [18F]FTT in breast&#xD;
      cancer and compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue, when available. If patients are getting&#xD;
      neoadjuvant or other systemic therapy, a second optional scan may be performed 1 day to 3&#xD;
      weeks after therapy begins to evaluate whether response correlates with increase in PARP-1&#xD;
      activity.response correlates with increase in PARP-1 activity.&#xD;

      Patients who come to the clinical practices of the University of Pennsylvania for diagnosis&#xD;
      and/or treatment of a known or suspected breast cancer and who meet the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria may be approached by study staff for recruitment into this study. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be checked and study personnel will provide a copy of the approved consent form&#xD;
      to the potential subject. Patients will be approached initially in person, by phone or email&#xD;
      about study participation. The patient will be given an opportunity to go over the consent&#xD;
      form and have any questions answered by study staff or a study investigator. After discussion&#xD;
      of the study procedures, risks and benefits, if the subject agrees to participate in the&#xD;
      study, the [18F]FTT PET/CT will be ordered by a physician and scheduled. Subjects may cancel&#xD;
      the scan appointment at any time prior to the injection of [18F]FTT with no negative impact&#xD;
      to them or their medical care at UPenn. A written informed consent will be reviewed with the&#xD;
      subject and signed prior to any study procedures being performed. Subjects may withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.&#xD;
      If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort will be made to contact the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed within 1 day prior&#xD;
      to injection of [18F]FTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline [18F]FTT PET/CT will take place prior to surgical resection of a primary breast&#xD;
      cancer, or before starting therapy. Adverse event follow up after the PET/CT scan may occur&#xD;
      by telephone or in person, depending on the subject's schedule. Follow up will take place the&#xD;
      next available business day (i.e. not a weekend or a holiday). The adverse event monitoring&#xD;
      period is 24 hours following [18F]FTT injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional post-therapy [18F]FTT PET/CT may occur approximately 1 day to 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      start of new therapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to give consent to allow for collection of pathology tissue for use in&#xD;
      this research study. Archival tissue may be collected from an existing tissue sample.&#xD;
      Additional tissue may be collected during a clinical biopsy or surgical procedure, if a&#xD;
      procedure is scheduled as part of their clinical care or, it can be collected for research&#xD;
      purposes only, if the patient has consented for this additional collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked permission to access their medical records for follow up of their&#xD;
      clinical care and treatment as part of the consent for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term follow up will occur by medical record review for the duration of the subject's&#xD;
      cancer care until death or 15 years after enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>[18F]FTT is an investigational radioactive PET drug used to see PARP-1 activity in tumors. This radioactive imaging drug is injected into the body to see how it goes into places where there is active breast cancer. Using an imaging scan called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT), the radioactive drug can be seen in the body.</description>
