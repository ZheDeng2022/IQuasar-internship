  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in endoluminal devices are now allowing clinicians the ability to begin exploring&#xD;
      bariatric procedures performed via flexible endoscopy. Although these procedures may not be&#xD;
      as effective as their surgical counterparts, these less-invasive options may relieve patients&#xD;
      of the significant risks associated with surgery (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomina (Endo Tools Therapeutics, Gosselies, Belgium) is CE mark device that may be attached&#xD;
      to an endoscope inside the body and allows remote manipulation of the arms of the device&#xD;
      during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibilities of making transoral surgical full&#xD;
      thickness sutures and may allow performing endoscopic therapeutic interventions, via a&#xD;
      transoral route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first trial including 11 patients assessed feasibility and safety of the technique (2).&#xD;
      There were no complications and the short-term results were encouraging. Then a multicentric&#xD;
      efficacy study was conducted, including 51 patients (3). The results where EWL of 31% at one&#xD;
      year and TBWL of 9% without complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally a randomized controlled study was done including 73 patients in a 2/1 randomized&#xD;
      fashion with a crossover at 6 months. Treated group was with the endomina device and&#xD;
      controlled group was diet only. The follow-up was the same in each group. Primary endpoint&#xD;
      was to reach the ASGE guideline &quot;difference between a control group and a treatment group of&#xD;
      minimum 15%&quot; (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique and suture pattern have evolved since the first study. The aim of this prospective&#xD;
      evaluation is to compare different suture patterns and their mechanism of action.&#xD;
