  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single arm, open label, two-part study that will assess safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and clinical activity of GSK2857916 given in combination with a programmed cell&#xD;
      death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in subjects with RRMM. This study will enroll adult&#xD;
      subjects with RRMM, who have undergone stem cell transplant or who are considered transplant&#xD;
      ineligible. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      escalating doses of GSK2857916 in combination with 200 milligrams (mg) pembrolizumab to&#xD;
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The following dose levels of GSK2857916 are&#xD;
      planned to be studied: 2.5 milligrams per kilograms (mg/kg) (dose level [DL] 1) and 3.4 mg/kg&#xD;
      (DL2). Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. Once the RP2D has been identified, an expansion&#xD;
      cohort will open for enrolment to confirm the safety profile and to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      activity of the combination. Up to 40 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this two-part&#xD;
      study (up to 12 in Part 1, and 28 in Part 2).&#xD;
