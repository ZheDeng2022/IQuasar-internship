      Investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      immediate postpartum initiation of DMPA on breastfeeding and long-term contraceptive use.&#xD;
      Investigators will randomize approximately 429 adult women who have delivered a healthy,&#xD;
      full-term infant at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC), who intend to&#xD;
      breastfeed for ≥6 months, and who want to use DMPA (Depo-Provera; Pfizer Corp.) Note that&#xD;
      because of anticipated screening failures, investigators will enroll more than the number&#xD;
      randomized (i.e., up to 800 women). Investigators will randomize women to receive within 48&#xD;
      hours of delivery: 1) DMPA (&quot;intervention&quot; arm), 2) placebo injection (&quot;placebo&quot; arm) or 3)&#xD;
      no injection (&quot;open control&quot; arm). The first two arms will be blinded while the open control&#xD;
      arm will be unblinded. Note that postpartum patients at the study site do not receive DMPA&#xD;
      before discharge as standard care. At enrollment, women will receive condom counseling and&#xD;
      provision and referral for contraception at 12 weeks (intervention and placebo arms) or at 6&#xD;
      weeks postpartum (open control arm). Investigators will collect data on lactogenesis, infant&#xD;
      feeding and growth, and contraception use during 12 follow-up months. Investigators conducted&#xD;
      a pilot study (N=100) in the target population, which supports the feasibility of the current&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum women often are inadequately protected against rapid repeat pregnancy. Ensuring&#xD;
      adequate inter- birth intervals could prevent an estimated 9% of deaths worldwide among&#xD;
      children less than 5 years of age. Intramuscular injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate&#xD;
      (DMPA) is rapidly becoming the method of choice in some settings, including regions where&#xD;
      high maternal and child mortality make birth spacing critical. DMPA possesses many advantages&#xD;
      for postpartum contraception as compared to other methods. However, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) advises against use of progestin-only injectables during the first six&#xD;
      weeks postpartum among breastfeeding women. In contrast, the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) recommends that progestin-only injectables generally can be started&#xD;
      immediately postpartum on the grounds that their known advantages, as a whole, outweigh their&#xD;
      unknown risks. This inconsistency in guidance reflects the lack of high-quality data for&#xD;
      making evidence-based decisions. Studies conducted, to date, have important limitations:&#xD;
      short follow-up intervals, low power, lack of consistency in using sensitive and standardized&#xD;
      assessments, and lack of randomized trials evaluating DMPA administration specifically in the&#xD;
      immediate postpartum period. Investigators propose to evaluate the effects of immediate&#xD;
      postpartum initiation of DMPA on breastfeeding and on child development. We will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 429 adult women who have delivered a healthy, full-term&#xD;
      infant, intend to breastfeed for ≥6 months, and want to use DMPA. Women will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive within 48 hours of delivery: 1) DMPA (&quot;intervention&quot; arm), 2) placebo injection&#xD;
      (&quot;placebo&quot; arm) or 3) no injection (&quot;open control&quot; arm). The first two arms will be blinded&#xD;
      while the open control arm will be unblinded. Investigators will determine the effect of&#xD;
      immediate postpartum initiation of DMPA on breastfeeding (Aim 1) and on contraception use&#xD;
      (Aim 2). The proposed trial is innovative in use of 1) a randomized, partially-blinded design&#xD;
      with sufficient power and follow up; 2) standardized, validated measures on lactation as well&#xD;
      as breastfeeding and contraception behaviors; and 3) whole-body air displacement&#xD;
      plethysmography to identify differences between arms in infant body composition. The findings&#xD;
      of a pilot study in the target population support the feasibility of the proposed trial.&#xD;
      Investigators expect the trial findings will permit the harmonization of the WHO and CDC&#xD;
      guidance on the timing of DMPA initiation among breastfeeding women. This would have&#xD;
      important implications for shaping global policy and practice worldwide, especially in&#xD;
      settings where inadequate birth spacing contributes to high maternal and infant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
