      Open-Label Study designed to evaluate the HPA axis suppression potential of Clobetasol&#xD;
      Topical Oil and pharmacokinetic safety / systemic exposure to clobetasol when Clobetasol&#xD;
      Topical Oil is applied to pediatric subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD)&#xD;
      under maximal use conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for each subject will be up to 54 days (up to 38 days for Screening&#xD;
      assessments, followed by up to 16 days of treatment and follow-up). Additional time will be&#xD;
      required for subjects requiring additional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function&#xD;
      testing due to an abnormal result at End of Treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the HPA axis suppression&#xD;
      potential and systemic exposure to clobetasol, when administered as Clobetasol Topical Oil in&#xD;
      pediatric subjects, under conditions consistent with anticipated clinical use and under&#xD;
      conditions designed to maximize the potential for drug absorption in subjects with moderate&#xD;
      to severe AD. The study will consist of three successively younger pediatric cohorts, as&#xD;
      safety data allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: ≥12 to &lt;18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: ≥6 to &lt;12 years; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: ≥2 to &lt;6 years. Enrollment into each successively younger pediatric cohort&#xD;
           will proceed only after the preceding cohort has been completed and safety and&#xD;
           exploratory data (including adverse events [AEs], tolerability assessments, clinical&#xD;
           laboratory results, and the percentage of subjects with HPA axis suppression) have been&#xD;
           reviewed and agreed to be acceptable for progression to the next cohort. Enrollment into&#xD;
           Cohorts 2 and 3 will proceed only if the percentage of subjects with HPA axis&#xD;
           suppression in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, is ≤40%. HPA axis suppression is defined&#xD;
           as a cortisol concentration ≤18 µg/100 mL at approximately 30 minutes after stimulation&#xD;
           with cosyntropin.&#xD;

          <title>Clobetasol Propionate Topical Oil in Cohort 1</title>
          <description>Cohort 1: ≥12 to &lt;18 years;&#xD;
At the Baseline/Start of Treatment for Cohort 1, subjects underwent assessments of their AD, baseline (pretreatment) assessments of tolerability criteria, a review of eligibility criteria, a urine pregnancy test and baseline (pretreatment) assessments of AEs. For subjects who remained eligible for the study, the investigator designated the areas to be treated with study drug, and subjects and/or their caregivers applied the first dose of study drug at the site. AEs and tolerability were assessed.</description>

          <title>Clobetasol Propionate Topical Oil in Cohort 2</title>
          <description>Cohort 2: ≥6 to &lt;12 years;&#xD;
Enrollment from Cohort 1 into Cohort 2 will proceed only after cohort 1 had been completed and safety and exploratory data (including adverse events [AEs], tolerability assessments, clinical laboratory results, and the percentage of subjects with HPA axis suppression) had been reviewed and agreed to be acceptable, and only if the percentage of subjects with HPA axis suppression in Cohort 1 was ≤40%. HPA axis suppression was defined as a cortisol concentration ≤18 µg/100 mL at approximately 30 minutes after stimulation with cosyntropin.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was terminated early due to the COVID pandemic with very low subject enrollment. Due to the small number of subjects that completed when the study was prematurely terminated, pharmacokinetic, exploratory, sensitivity, as well as some safety analyses was not completed under the SAP.</limitations_and_caveats>
