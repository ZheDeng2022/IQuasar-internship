  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TXA is currently administered pre-hospital in Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and Israel .&#xD;
      These studies demonstrated that TXA use did not result in any detectable complications or&#xD;
      adverse events. It is considered an ideal pre-hospital treatment because: (a) patients with&#xD;
      severe hemorrhage die early more often than patients without hemorrhage; (b) it seems that&#xD;
      the earlier treatment is administered, the better; (c) it is stable and easily stored; and&#xD;
      (d) it is easily administered by paramedics. Herein, the study aimed to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of administration of second dose of Tranexamic acid infusion in the hospital setting in&#xD;
      comparison to not receiving the second dose on the outcomes of trauma patients with an&#xD;
      evidence of significant hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, HGH ambulance service has included pre-hospital administration of TXA in trauma&#xD;
      patients with significant hemorrhage. So, all eligible trauma patients will receive&#xD;
      pre-hospital TXA (first dose) slowly over 10 minutes by the critical care paramedics as&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: All adult trauma male and female patients (≥18 or &lt;90 years) with&#xD;
      evidence of significant hemorrhage (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or heart rate &gt;110 beats&#xD;
      per minutes, or both) or had Capillary Refill Time 3-4 seconds and received first dose of&#xD;
      prehospital TXA will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age &gt; 90 or &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inability to obtain intravenous access (intraosseous access not sufficient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Documented cervical cord injury with motor deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Known prisoner&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Known pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Traumatic arrest with &gt; 5 minutes CPR without return of vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Penetrating cranial injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Traumatic brain injury with brain matter exposed&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Isolated drowning or hanging victims&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Wearing an opt out bracelet. Patient data will include demographics, time since injury,&#xD;
           type of injury (blunt or penetrating), Glasgow Coma Score(GCS), Injury severity score&#xD;
           (ISS), systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, central capillary refill time,&#xD;
           estimated number of hours since injury, laboratory findings, blood transfusion, units of&#xD;
           transfused blood, management, complications and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be morbidity (thromboembolic events, sepsis, Acute respiratory distress syndrome and&#xD;
      organ failure), and number of blood transfusions (Massive transfusion protocol) and hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;

      Study design It is a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All severely injured male and female patients with evidence of significant&#xD;
      hemorrhage (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or heart rate &gt;110 beats per minutes, or both)&#xD;
      or had Capillary Refill Time 3-4 seconds will be administered TXA slowly over 10 minutes at&#xD;
      the prehospital settings by critical care paramedics as standard of care are eligible for&#xD;
      participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial is based on CRASH-2 study [2] in which the sample size was more&#xD;
      than 20,000 using the followings primary outcomes estimates such as all-cause-mortality 14.5%&#xD;
      (TXA) vs. 16% (Placebo) and bleeding: 4.9% (TXA) vs. 5.7% (Placebo). According to CRASH-2&#xD;
      study approximately 30% of all patients randomized presented with significant hypotension&#xD;
      (blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg) considered to have significant hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a unique study to assess the effect of second dose of tranexamic acid in the hospital&#xD;
      setting and there are no precise estimates available on the primary outcome particularly in&#xD;
      our population. According to CRASH-2 trial, approximately 30% of all randomized patients&#xD;
      presented with significant hypotension (BP &lt;90mmHg) indicated hemorrhagic shock. Therefore,&#xD;
      taking the prevalence of hemorrhage to be 30% with 5% confidence limit and 80% power; a total&#xD;
      of 335 trauma patients need to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three arms in this trial; Group-1 will include 110 patients with initial&#xD;
      pre-hospital TXA administered slowly over 10 minutes followed by in-hospital intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of 1 g TXA administer over 8 h; Group-2 will include 110 patients with initial&#xD;
      pre-hospital TXA administered slowly over 10 minutes but will receive placebo over 8 h in the&#xD;
      hospital and Group-3 will include 110 age and injury severity score (ISS) matched historical&#xD;
      controls without TXA administration identified from hospital database (January 1, 2016 till&#xD;
      December 31, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study package will be labelled with the study protocol number, unique randomization&#xD;
      code, and name of the principal investigator. All study treatment pack will contain two&#xD;
      ampules of either tranexamic acid 500 mg or placebo, one 100 ml bag of 0.9% saline, a syringe&#xD;
      and needle, stickers with the trial details and randomization number (for attaching to&#xD;
      infusion bags, data forms, and patient medical records), and instructions. Each box contained&#xD;
      information leaflets for patients and their representatives, consent forms, and data&#xD;
      collection forms. The stickers, instructions, leaflets, and forms will be available in&#xD;
      English and Arabic. A small number of details will be completed on the wristband and label&#xD;
      (Patient's initials, Date and time of randomization). The label will be placed in the&#xD;
      patient's hospital medical record. The wristband and label in the patient's medical record&#xD;
      will alert hospital staff to the patient's enrollment in the study. The principal&#xD;
      investigator or their designee is responsible for ensuring the drug or placebo is&#xD;
      administered according to the study protocol and they will be unaware of whether the patient&#xD;
      was assigned to the TXA or placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team including research coordinator will be notified by the treating physician&#xD;
      about the recruitment. Detailed interventions are mentioned in study procedures below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 ml blood specimen will be drawn for coagulation profile (INR, PT, PTT, Fibrinogen, and&#xD;
      D-Dimer); 5 ml before and 5 ml after starting TXA. The data will be collected prospectively&#xD;
      with the help of a predesigned data collection form. Patient data included sex, age,&#xD;
      nationality, time since injury, type of injury (blunt or penetrating), Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Score(GCS), Injury severity score (ISS), systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, central&#xD;
      capillary refill time, estimated number of hours since injury, laboratory findings, blood&#xD;
      transfusion, units of transfused blood, management, complications and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be morbidity (thromboembolic events, sepsis, Acute respiratory distress syndrome and&#xD;
      organ failure), and number of blood transfusions (Massive transfusion protocol) and hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Pre-hospital administration of TXA in trauma patients with evidence of&#xD;
      significant hemorrhage is being included in the HGH ambulance service. So, all eligible&#xD;
      trauma patients with risk of bleeding will receive pre-hospital TXA slowly over 10 minutes by&#xD;
      the critical care paramedics as standard of care. In the hospital, subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      by study trained treating physician and if they fulfill the inclusion criteria and have no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria they will be randomized to give second 8-hour infusion of TXA or placebo&#xD;
      by opening the next opaque envelope in the randomization series. The envelopes will contain a&#xD;
      wristband to be placed on the patient &amp; a label which designates the study number and&#xD;
      treatment allocation. A small number of details will be completed on the wristband and label&#xD;
      (patient's initials, date and time of randomization). The label will be placed in the&#xD;
      patient's hospital medical record. The wristband and label in the patient's medical record&#xD;
      will alert hospital staff to the patient's enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team including research coordinator will be notified by the treating physician&#xD;
      about the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information regarding patient's enrollment will be kept confidential and all study&#xD;
      related steps (explanation of study procedures and consenting) with the next of kin will be&#xD;
      done in isolated room in the emergency area to maintain complete privacy. No one outside the&#xD;
      research team and next of kin will be aware about the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will receive a specific study number. The research coordinator will&#xD;
      compile a study enrollment log which will link the study number to the patient's details.&#xD;
      Subsequent data will be identified by the study number. The enrollment log and study data&#xD;
      will be kept separately. All data collected for the assessment will be identified by the&#xD;
      study code. Study data will be entered into a password protected computer with study&#xD;
      documents will be kept in a locked office with principal investigator at HMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug Each 5 mL ampule contains 500 gm (×2) tranexamic acid and 10 mL water for&#xD;
      injection as the inactive ingredient. Tranexamic acid solution for injection is a sterile,&#xD;
      clear, colorless solution. The pH is 6.5 to 8.0. The placebo is identical in appearance and&#xD;
      packaging but contains sodium chloride 0.9% w/v in a 10 mL ampule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized double blind placebo controlled single center trial. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be screened and enrolled in the hospital by the treating physician. If they fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria they will be randomized into either of the&#xD;
      group (Group-1 or group-2) by opening the next opaque envelope in the randomization series&#xD;
      kept in the trauma room. The envelopes will contain a wristband to be placed on the patient &amp;&#xD;
      a label which designates the study number and treatment. A small number of details will be&#xD;
      completed on the wristband and label (Patient's initials, Date and time of randomization).&#xD;
      The label will be placed in the patient's hospital electronic medical record. The wristband&#xD;
      and label in the patient's medical record will alert hospital staff to the patient's&#xD;
      enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Blinding will be done through pharmacy department where both tranexamic acid and&#xD;
      normal saline will be placed in similar bags in IV admixture room, both are colorless. Total&#xD;
      of 220 bags will be numbered, the codes will be kept confidential and not broken unless&#xD;
      emergency case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergency physicians will be unable to determine whether a trial pack contains the active&#xD;
      study drug or placebo as they are both identical in appearance. The unique study ID number&#xD;
      printed on the trial pack and the contents within the pack is the only way to determine&#xD;
      whether a pack contains active drug or placebo. The coded list of study ID numbers is only&#xD;
      accessible to the independent study coordinator and will not be accessible to researchers&#xD;
      involved in the trial until after the trial is completed (individual cases may be unblinded&#xD;
      in exceptional circumstances as per emergency unblinding mentioned below). Both participants&#xD;
      and study staff (investigators and trial staff) will be masked to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency unblinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physician at emergency department will ask for unblinding for the sake of&#xD;
      patient care, if unblinding is needed based on the clinical progress of the patient following&#xD;
      steps will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for emergency unblinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In case of emergency, the treating physician will contact the trial coordinator to break&#xD;
           the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The trial coordinator will provide with the information as requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study code should only be broken when the treating physician believes that clinical&#xD;
           management depends importantly upon knowledge of whether the patient received&#xD;
           antifibrinolytic or placebo. In those few cases only, unblinding will be allowed to know&#xD;
           whether the patient received antifibrinolytic or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. On receipt of the treatment allocation details, treating physician deals with the&#xD;
           participant's medical emergency as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the treating physician is not the PI, the treating physician must inform the PI of&#xD;
           the code break and the reasons for the actions taken as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The PI documents the breaking of the code and the reasons for doing so on the data&#xD;
           collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The PI documents the breaking of the codes in a separate file. Discontinuation of&#xD;
           treatment Study medication will be ceased permanently for any occurrence of serious&#xD;
           adverse event such as seizure, cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis. Ultimately the treating&#xD;
           clinician will have the right to decide whether to discontinue treatment, ideally this&#xD;
           should be discussed with the principal investigator where feasible. All patients with&#xD;
           discontinued treatment of the study drug will be followed for outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance This trial aims to determine the overall benefits and harms of giving second&#xD;
      infusion of TXA for severely injured patients in the emergency room. Importantly, it aims to&#xD;
      determine whether TXA infusion as compared to single dose will affect the outcomes of the&#xD;
      trauma patients with significant bleeding. It is timely that it will objectively resolve&#xD;
      current uncertainty about whether the benefits of TXA infusion versus single dose will&#xD;
      outweigh any potential harm for severely injured patients in prehospital setting in our&#xD;
      region. The potential benefit of TXA to significantly improve mortality rates and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes for patients could result in significant savings in lifetime costs and improved&#xD;
      quality of life following severe injury. If this trial proves a beneficial effect of early&#xD;
      TXA infusion of second dose of TXA in hospital setting in terms of outcomes, than it will be&#xD;
      used for all trauma patients with significant bleeding. On the other hand, if single dose&#xD;
      shows similar benefit in terms of outcomes than it can mitigate the side effects that could&#xD;
      be raised with the second dose of TXA infusion and would recommend using only single dose of&#xD;
      TXA in the prehospital settings. Finally, this trial will demonstrate the ability of our&#xD;
      trauma services to appropriately select patients and administer a time-critical drug&#xD;
      treatment to minimize harmful consequences of hemorrhage in major trauma.&#xD;
