  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate associations between sleep/circadian&#xD;
      disturbances and psychiatric health among adolescents recruited from primary and specialty&#xD;
      health clinics.&#xD;

      This project will involve recruitment of 100 adolescents from primary and specialty health&#xD;
      clinics. Participants will participate in 3 phases: screening/intake visit, sleep study, and&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1-hour screening/intake visit will be conducted at the Duke ADHD clinic at 2608 Erwin&#xD;
      Road, Pavilion East, Suite 300, Durham, NC 27705. During the screening/intake visit,&#xD;
      participants and their parents will complete questionnaires regarding the adolescent's&#xD;
      psychiatric health. Participants' vitals (i.e., height, weight, resting heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure) will also be assessed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will enter the 7-day sleep study, during which they will be asked to&#xD;
      wear an actigraph watch 24 hours/day, apply a EEG sleep recorder each night, and complete a&#xD;
      daily sleep diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the final night of the sleep study, participants and parents will be asked to&#xD;
      return for a follow-up visit and will complete questionnaires about the participants' sleep&#xD;
      over the past week.&#xD;
