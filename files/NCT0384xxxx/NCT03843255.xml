  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Finding new ways to diagnose and treat Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) could improve the health&#xD;
      and well-being of patients with this condition. The main aim of this research study is to&#xD;
      help develop better ways of diagnosing and treating patients with DCM. The information that&#xD;
      is collected may help develop tailored treatments for patients with this disease in the&#xD;
      future. This research study will recruit patients with DCM from a number of centres across&#xD;
      England and follow their health over a period of years. Patients will give some blood samples&#xD;
      for a type of genetic test called whole genome sequencing (WGS) to look for genetic changes.&#xD;
      Patients will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of their heart to look for&#xD;
      any changes in the heart such as scarring, and check their heart function. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to discover if using WGS and MRI can improve the diagnosis of DCM. Another aim of&#xD;
      the study is to look at how genetic changes and scarring in the heart may affect the progress&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying patients with DCM may also help the investigators learn more about diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating other diseases of the heart. The second aim of this study is to see whether using&#xD;
      WGS and MRI scanning can also be useful in other types of heart diseases which might be&#xD;
      affected by genetic changes or scarring in the heart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients from a number of hospitals in England and study them over a&#xD;
      number of years. The study will be divided in 2 parts. Part 1 will recruit patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of DCM, Part 2 will recruit patients diagnosed with other heritable cardiovascular&#xD;
      disorders. Family members of patients may be invited to take part in the study. Children may&#xD;
      also be approached to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend for a baseline visit for a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scan,&#xD;
      completion of quality of life questionnaires, collection of blood samples for whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing and biomarker analysis, and collection of clinical data. Collection of health&#xD;
      information via national registries including Office of National Statistics (ONS) and&#xD;
      Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) will be continued over the patients's lifetime. This will&#xD;
      not require any direct contact with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place over a 3 year period, with annual completion of questionnaires at&#xD;
      patients scheduled hospital visits. If the patient is not scheduled to attend the hospital&#xD;
      for regular follow up, then patients may complete the questionnaires via an online system or&#xD;
      over the telephone. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires annually for 5 years.&#xD;
      Sub-sets of patients may be invited for additional tests including exercise testing, and&#xD;
      stress perfusion scans. These tests will not form part of the core tests for the study, and&#xD;
      patients may choose not to have them. Separate informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      participants for any additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are having clinical diagnostic tests that involve the removal of tissue, they may&#xD;
      be asked to donate any surplus tissue sample, or be asked to provide their consent to collect&#xD;
      an additional tissue sample. Separate informed consent will be obtained from participants for&#xD;
      donation of additional tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where patients are scheduled to have a CMR scan as part of their routine clinical care, an&#xD;
      additional CMR scan for research purposes may not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will not be asked to complete any annual questionnaires, health information will be&#xD;
      collected via ONS and HES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members of patients who take part in the study will only be asked to donate a blood or&#xD;
      saliva sample, and provide consent to collection of their health information via ONS and HES&#xD;
      records. They will not have any clinical tests such as CMR.&#xD;
