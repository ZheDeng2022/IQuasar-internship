    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies circulating cell-free tumor DNA testing to guide treatment with&#xD;
      regorafenib or TAS-102 in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other areas of&#xD;
      the body. Studying samples of blood from patients with colorectal cancer may help doctors&#xD;
      understand how well patients respond to treatment. Regorafenib and TAS-102 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet&#xD;
      known how well ctDNA testing works in guiding treatment with regorafenib and TAS-102 for&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the ability of early change in circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (ctDNA) (ctDNA-early dynamic changes [EDC] or A ctDNA) during systemic therapy in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) to predict radiographic progression (only standard of care [SOC]&#xD;
      arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate differences in clinically significant treatment-related adverse events&#xD;
      (TRAEs) of interest (grade 3/4 toxicity per National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, intolerable grade 2 toxicity or&#xD;
      any toxicity requiring dose reduction) between SOC and ctDNA arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate differences in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) between SOC and ctDNA arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) duration of complete&#xD;
      response (DCR) (partial response [PR] and stable disease [SD]) between SOC and ctDNA arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate differences in overall survival (OS) between SOC and ctDNA arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate differences between SOC and ctDNA arm with regards to emergency severity&#xD;
      indices (ESIs): Hospitalizations/emergency room visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate differences between SOC and ctDNA arm with regards to ESIs: Need for medical&#xD;
      interventions (blood transfusions and intravenous [IV] hydration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate cost-effectiveness associated with both strategies, i.e. SOC strategy and&#xD;
      ctDNA strategy in treatment of mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      performance status (PS) between SOC and ctDNA arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To compare time to deterioration of PROs between SOC and ctDNA arms. IX. To evaluate&#xD;
      differences in proportion of patients referred to clinical trial after completion of therapy&#xD;
      between SOC and ctDNA arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo ctDNA testing and depending on the results receive either regorafenib&#xD;
      orally (PO) on days 1-21, trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) PO twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12, or regorafenib PO on days 1-21 and TAS-102 PO BID on days 1-5 and&#xD;
      8-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive regorafenib or TAS-102 per standard of care. Treatment continues in&#xD;
      the event of disease stability or regression as per discretion of treating physician or&#xD;
      absence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then monthly for&#xD;
      up to 18 months.&#xD;

             patient must not be undergoing acute steroid therapy or taper [chronic steroid therapy&#xD;
             is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for one month prior to and following&#xD;
