  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled single-center trial, based on a non-inferiority&#xD;
      design, the outcome of the treatment of patients are analyzed, whereas in half of the cases&#xD;
      the wounds are left open and the other ones are primary wound closed after local debridement&#xD;
      after Fixator-Extern is removed. Although this topic embodies a daily business, there is no&#xD;
      standard to be found in literature regarding the treatment of pin sites with closure by&#xD;
      either primary or secondary intent.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the orthopedic department of the Kantonsspital Lucerne (LUKS) after removal of the&#xD;
      external fixator, the pin sites at the tibia and the back of the foot are routinely treated&#xD;
      with primary wound closure. An international survey carried out by the LUKS shows that in&#xD;
      comparison to our standard treatment the majority of surgeons left the pin sites open during&#xD;
      the healing process. In order to find a standardized method to treat pin sites we conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, in which half of the pin site wounds are left open and the other&#xD;
      half are treated by primary wound closure after local debridement (Treatment of the first&#xD;
      pin-side will be randomized, then alternated treatment of the consecutive pin-sides). All&#xD;
      patients of the study participants are treated within a fixed pre- and postoperative&#xD;
      protocol, which includes antibiotic prophylaxis with a single shot of Cefazolin 2g&#xD;
      intravenously 30 minutes prior to surgery. The postoperative pin care includes daily&#xD;
      inspection of the pin sites, cleaning the secondary healing wound with Ringerfundin © and&#xD;
      disinfection with Betadine ©. Primary wound closures are dressed with dry gaze bandage. The&#xD;
      following out-patient treatment is provided either by a Spitex support, the family doctor or&#xD;
      by the patient himself, depending on the patients compliance. Regular follow-up consultations&#xD;
      at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after surgery ensure an adequate surveillance of the healing&#xD;
      process, whereas the examining doctor at the second and last consultation was kept in dark&#xD;
      what therapy was chosen for pin sites of the patient. To objectify the clinical progress the&#xD;
      pin sites are photo documented at the consultations at week 2 and 52.&#xD;
