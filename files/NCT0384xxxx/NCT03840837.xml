  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site non-randomized open label pilot study. The investigators will use&#xD;
      accelerometer-based instrumented gait analysis and computerized cognitive testing to study&#xD;
      the interaction of motor and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), and&#xD;
      the effect of rivastigmine on motor and cognitive performance. All study participants will&#xD;
      tested for motor and cognitive performance at baseline (arm 1). A subgroup of study&#xD;
      participants will then be treated with rivastigmine for 12 weeks (arm 2), and the effect of&#xD;
      this treatment on gait measures and cognitive measures will be analyzed at the follow-up&#xD;
      visit 12 weeks after the baseline visit. Specifically, we will determine which components of&#xD;
      motor and cognitive impairment are associated with each other, and which components of the&#xD;
      two domains respond to rivastigmine-mediated stimulation of cholinergic neurotransmission.&#xD;

      This is a single-site non-randomized open label clinical trial in patients with Parkinson&#xD;
      disease (PD) and mild to moderate cognitive deficits, designed to 1) identify associations&#xD;
      between cognitive impairment and gait impairment, and 2) identify cognitive domains and gait&#xD;
      measures that improve after 12 weeks of treatment with rivastigmine. Aim 1 will be addressed&#xD;
      with a cross-sectional approach (arm 1, baseline only, all participants), and aim 2 will be&#xD;
      addressed with a longitudinal interventional approach (arm 2, 12 week-treatment with&#xD;
      rivastigmine, subgroup of participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and mild to moderate cognitive deficits&#xD;
      amounting to PD dementia (PDD) will be enrolled. At baseline (arm 1), all participants will&#xD;
      perform the timed-up-and-go test (TUG), wearing a light-weight sensor device strapped to the&#xD;
      lower back with a neoprene belt. Participants will also complete a computerized cognitive&#xD;
      test battery (NeuroTrax Mild Cognitive Impairment &amp; Early Dementia Battery by MindStreams). A&#xD;
      subgroup of participants (arm 2) will then be treated with transdermal rivastigmine for 12&#xD;
      weeks, with dose increases every 4 weeks and titration up to 13.3 mg/24h, if tolerated. The&#xD;
      same assessment (quantitative gait testing and NeuroTrax computerized cognitive test battery)&#xD;
      will be repeated after 12 weeks, with the participant on a stable dose of transdermal&#xD;
      rivastigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze correlation of iTUG measures and cognitive measures at&#xD;
      baseline (cross-sectional analysis). The investigators will also analyze change in iTUG&#xD;
      measures and cognitive measures between baseline and follow-up for the subgroup of&#xD;
      participants in arm 2 (in other words, before and after rivastigmine treatment; longitudinal&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
