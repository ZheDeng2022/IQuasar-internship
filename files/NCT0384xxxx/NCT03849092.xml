      The aim of this intervention is to test if the investigator, by offering a financial&#xD;
      incentive to smokers who abstinence from smoking, can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. recruit more smokers with low socioeconomic status to municipal smoking cessation&#xD;
           programs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. achieve higher abstinence rates at municipal smoking cessation programs among citizens&#xD;
           with low economic status - Rather than by use of campaigns (=usual strategy) informing&#xD;
           citizens about their options for support at municipal smoking cessation programs?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For decades the prevalence of smokers has been declining. However, during the last four years&#xD;
      the prevalence is stagnated. All municipalities are offering support to/ and during smoking&#xD;
      cessation. Nevertheless, a lot of the municipalities find it very difficult to recruit&#xD;
      smokers to their programs - in particular smokers with low socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is assumed that more smokers with low socioeconomic status, which are&#xD;
      otherwise very difficult to reach with smoking cessation offerings, will attend in municipal&#xD;
      smoking cessation programs if they are offered a financial incentive. It is also assumed that&#xD;
      smokers with low socioeconomic status, who have difficulty quitting smoking, will achieve&#xD;
      higher smoking cessation rates if they are offered a financial incentive of abstinence from&#xD;
      smoking. The target group of this study is therefore smokers with low socioeconomic status&#xD;
      (SES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 6 intervention municipalities (3 financial incentives municipalities and 3&#xD;
      campaign municipalities), and 6 control municipalities. The investigator conducts matched&#xD;
      randomization at municipality level, and matches the municipalities on number of smokers&#xD;
      recruited to smoking cessation programs in the previous year (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 6 intervention municipalities receive 102.000 DKK (16536,43 UDS) which must be used on&#xD;
      their intervention. Beside the intervention everything goes on as usual in each municipality.&#xD;
      Each municipality is its own control and the change will be analyzed after the intervention.&#xD;
      The prevalence of smokers in each municipality is registered as usual by means of the Health&#xD;
      Profiles, however not in this study!, which aim not is to measure the number of citizens&#xD;
      quitting smoking unaided, but solely aim to focus on the municipals smoking cessation&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention in the 3 financial incentives municipalities: the municipalities will make&#xD;
           simple invitations and advertisements, showing that smokers can achieve a financial&#xD;
           incentive of 1200 DKK if they abstinence from smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The period of a smoking cessation program is 7 weeks, and participants will receive a&#xD;
           financial incentive as a gift voucher the 4 last meeting days, if validated abstinent&#xD;
           from smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention in the 3 campaign municipalities: each municipality decides how the&#xD;
           campaigns/advertisement should look/be like. The campaign should try to target smokers&#xD;
           with low SES, recommending getting support during smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control municipalities: 6 &quot;clean&quot; control municipalities perform their smoking cessation&#xD;
           activities as usual and do not receive any financial resources. They do not know that&#xD;
           they are control group in a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators measure validated recruitment- and abstinence rates 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      last session.&#xD;
