  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is 16% amongst patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the observed dysregulation of pro and anti-inflammatory pathways in AERD are still not fully&#xD;
      understood. To address this and also to identify potential factors characterizing the disease&#xD;
      the investigators plan to prospectively collect blood samples, nasal secretions as well as&#xD;
      nasal biopsies from allergic, non-allergic and AERD patients suffering from CRSwNP.&#xD;
      Initially, polyps of aforementioned patients will be subjected to RNA sequencing analysis&#xD;
      using microarray technology. Once distinct factors are identified in nasal polyp tissue,&#xD;
      their presence will be assessed in nasal secretions and serum of the respective patients to&#xD;
      investigate their potential role as biomarkers. Furthermore presence of these parameters will&#xD;
      be confirmed in situ in biopsies by confocal microscopy. Knowledge about factors differently&#xD;
      upregulated in polyp tissue from AERD may contribute to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with (w) and without (s) nasal polyps (NP) in its different&#xD;
      shapes is currently affecting up to 16% of the total population of the United States and&#xD;
      around 11% of the population in Europe. However CRS may also be associated with&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to aspirin and other non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors. This syndrome&#xD;
      of combined CRSwNP, asthma and intolerance to inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme was&#xD;
      termed Samter's triad or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). AERD is thought to&#xD;
      affect around 16% of patients suffering from CRSwNP, around 7% of adult asthmatic patients&#xD;
      and 0.3-2.5% of the general population. One characteristic feature of this disease is the&#xD;
      presence of nasal polyps that frequently relapse after surgery rendering this disease&#xD;
      difficult to manage. Despite its relatively high prevalence, the pathophysiologic mechanisms&#xD;
      are yet not fully understood. In this respect, an overproduction of and overresponsiveness to&#xD;
      cysteinyl leukotrienes accompanied by and underproduction of and underresponsiveness to&#xD;
      prostaglandins was observed in AERD patients.This indicates a dysregulation of pro and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory pathways. However the mechanism and the cells involved in causing this&#xD;
      imbalance are still not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of gene-chip microarray technology allows for quantitatively and&#xD;
      simultaneously monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes and has greatly contributed&#xD;
      to the understanding of pathological mechanisms. In this context, analysis of nasal polyps&#xD;
      from allergic patients has shown that genes involved in deregulated cell growth similar to&#xD;
      neoplastic growth are upregulated in this tissue. Furthermore very recently, profiling of CRS&#xD;
      samples by single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a significant loss of epithelial ecological&#xD;
      diversity in nasal polyps. The authors suggest that basal cells form memories of chronic&#xD;
      exposure to an inflammatory environment and shift the cellular ecosystem towards propagating&#xD;
      the disease. However polyps from AERD patients which show a different clinical and most&#xD;
      likely also pathophysiological profile have not been included in this study. Given the&#xD;
      prevalence of 15% amongst CRSwNP patients and the impaired quality of life of AERD patients&#xD;
      it would be desirable to understand the difference between AERD and CRSwNP without AERD at a&#xD;
      molecular level and also to potentially find biomarkers that uniquely identify patients&#xD;
      suffering from AERD disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan to prospectively collect blood samples, nasal secretions as&#xD;
      well as nasal biopsies from allergic, non-allergic and AERD patients suffering from CRSwNP.&#xD;
      Initially, RNA sequencing will be performed using microarray technology in biopsies of those&#xD;
      patients. Once parameters are identified, the investigators will investigate if a similar&#xD;
      pattern can also be detected in nasal secretions and/or serum of the respective patients to&#xD;
      investigate their potential as biomarkers. Furthermore presence of these parameters will be&#xD;
      confirmed in situ in biopsies by confocal microscopy.&#xD;
