      This study is a non-randomized, open, multiple administration and dose escalation phase 1&#xD;
      clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      Characteristics of multiple oral administration of LPM3480226 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors., determine its dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose, and initially&#xD;
      observe its clinical effectiveness, and explore the metabolites in plasma after&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of LPM3480226&#xD;
      tablets after oral administration to patients with advanced solid tumors, and to determine&#xD;
      the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LPM3480226.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-randomized, open, multiple dose escalation design was used with a total of five dose&#xD;
      groups. The starting dose was 50 mg and the subsequent dose was increased according to the&#xD;
      protocol of 100 mg , 200 mg , 400 mg , 600mg. Starting from the low-dose group, each subject&#xD;
      received only one dose of the drug, and the next dose group study could only be performed if&#xD;
      the previous dose group was completed and safe tolerance was confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were given the corresponding doses in the order，bid，28 days as a cycle, to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of multiple doses. After confirming the safety and tolerance of&#xD;
      the dose group in the first administration cycle, the administration was continued for&#xD;
      another cycle according to the dose, and the subjects were evaluated for the efficacy after&#xD;
      the two-cycle administration, and the subjects who did not have disease progression and is&#xD;
      well tolerated and the investigator believes that continued treatment can benefit, the&#xD;
      patient may continue to receive the dose of the drug on a voluntary basis, with a maximum&#xD;
      dose of no more than one year.&#xD;
