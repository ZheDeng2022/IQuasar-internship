  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people use energy drinks (EDs) regularly, but the overall health concerns are still&#xD;
      unknown. There are many energy drink products that contain a mixture of caffeine and other&#xD;
      energy-boosting ingredients and supplements which can affect parameters related to the heart,&#xD;
      blood pressure and blood glucose. Several previous studies have shown that energy drinks may&#xD;
      affect heart rhythm and blood pressure significantly. As energy drinks are sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages, long-term use may also affect the body's metabolism, including cholesterol, blood&#xD;
      sugars, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn if drinking energy drinks everyday may affect a&#xD;
      person's cardiometabolic health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The popularity of energy drinks (EDs) have increased over the last few decades due to their&#xD;
      purported benefits as mental and physical performance enhancements. While caffeine is a major&#xD;
      ingredient in most EDs (ranging from 80 mg to 500 mg per drink), they may also contain&#xD;
      various supplements, such as guarana, taurine, ginseng, B vitamins, gluconolactone, yohimbe,&#xD;
      carnitine, and bitter orange, as well as high amount of sugar (ranging from 25-50 grams). The&#xD;
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cited that a daily intake of 400 mg&#xD;
      caffeine (approximately 4-5 cups of coffee) in adults is generally safe and not associated&#xD;
      with dangerous, negative effects. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services&#xD;
      Administration reported a doubling of emergency department visits involving EDs from 10,068&#xD;
      visits in 2007 to 20,783 visits in 2011. Commonly reported adverse reactions include&#xD;
      insomnia, nervousness, headache, tachycardia, and seizures. Currently, the health effects of&#xD;
      long-term ED use remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a proof-of-concept, prospective trial that aims to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      chronic ED consumption on cardiometabolic parameters in a healthy population. Subjects will&#xD;
      consume two cans (16 oz.) of an energy drink daily for 4 weeks. The study will assess any&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure (BP), electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, blood glucose,&#xD;
      cholesterol, weight, body mass index (BMI), and body fat composition before and after&#xD;
      consuming EDs for 4 weeks.&#xD;
