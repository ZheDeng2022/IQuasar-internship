  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a significant impact on women's health, but its&#xD;
      pathogenesis is not yet clear. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota may play a role in the&#xD;
      pathological change of PCOS. Most of the current researches are still limited to the use of&#xD;
      amplicon sequencing to compare the basic taxonomic differences of gut microbiota between PCOS&#xD;
      patients and normal controls. Overall analysis of microbiome species, genes, function,&#xD;
      metabolism, and immunity in PCOS is still lacked. In this research, we would perform&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing to find the characteristics of gut microbiota of PCOS and to explore&#xD;
      their correlations with metabolic, immune, and clinical symptoms. Finally, different&#xD;
      interventions (lifestyle interventions, lifestyle interventions + oral probiotic, lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions+ compound oral contraceptives) would be used to explore the change of gut&#xD;
      microbiome in PCOS patients. This research will not only help the understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PCOS, but also provide a reference for the selection of clinical treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Data quality assurance: ① all inspections and measurements will be performed by either&#xD;
           the hospital or the sequencing company personnel according to standard operating&#xD;
           procedures (SOPs), except for saliva and stool samples, which will be self-collected by&#xD;
           patients. For sample collection, we will provide text descriptions of the SOPs as well&#xD;
           as video instruction. Designated staff will be assigned for support and can be contacted&#xD;
           if participants have any queries concerning sample collection; ② a case report form&#xD;
           (CRF) will be prepared according to the current SOPs, and detailed instructions will be&#xD;
           provided to ensure consistency in data collection. At the same time, each CRF will be&#xD;
           properly stored at least 5 years for verification and backtracking; ③ all experimental&#xD;
           data will be logged into the database to ensure information accuracy based on the&#xD;
           existing data; ④ we will keep the contact information of each participant, remind them&#xD;
           of precautions during participation, and conduct regular follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size determination: The number of participants is based on comparable sample&#xD;
           sizes in the literature. In this trial, there will be 50 healthy individuals (control&#xD;
           group) and 150 PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) patients. The 150 PCOS patients will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to three intervention groups. This sample size accounts for a&#xD;
           plausible insufficiency of data caused by patient dropouts and withdrawals before the&#xD;
           study is completed. The participation cycle is of approximately four months, followed by&#xD;
           a 2-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Metagenomic sequencing technology Metagenomic sequencing is the main technique used in&#xD;
           this study. Metagenomics, also known as economics, was first proposed by Handelman and&#xD;
           studies the molecular composition of microbial populations, their interactions, and gene&#xD;
           functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In medicine, metagenomics compares the structural and functional changes of human&#xD;
           microbial communities under normal and disease states. It can analyze the diversity and&#xD;
           the functional differences of microbial communities from healthy individuals and from&#xD;
           patients with diseases, thus determine how diseases relate to changes in the microbial&#xD;
           communities and in their respective metabolic networks. Therefore, metagenomics provides&#xD;
           theoretical evidence for disease prevention, detection, and treatment. At present, the&#xD;
           internationally renowned Human Microbiome Project (HMP, http://www.hmpdacc.org/) and the&#xD;
           Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) are typical applications of&#xD;
           metagenomics in medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           [Metagenomic species, genes, and functional annotation]&#xD;
&#xD;
           ① Data quality control: the sequenced raw data will contain a certain amount of&#xD;
           low-quality data, so quality control must be performed. Only high-quality data can&#xD;
           correctly reflect the actual occurrence of microorganisms in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ② Metagenome assembly: based on Clean Data, individual samples will be assembled&#xD;
           separately at first, then reads that do not participate in the assembling above will be&#xD;
           combined and mixed for assembly. This will increase the sequencing depth of&#xD;
           low-abundance species in each sample and provide more sequencing information for each&#xD;
           species.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ③ Gene prediction: MetaGeneMark will be used for gene prediction based on single samples&#xD;
           and mixed-assembled scaftigs. The redundancy of all predicted genes will be reduced to&#xD;
           obtain a Uniq gene set. Then, the Clean Data of each sample will be compared to the gene&#xD;
           set and the abundance of the gene set will be determined for each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ④ Species annotation: Clean Data will be used for quality control. It will be compared&#xD;
           with an annotated according to reference genome databases of bacteria, archaea, viruses,&#xD;
           and fungi from NCBI. A species abundance table will be obtained for each sample at&#xD;
           different classification levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ⑤ Functional annotation: functional annotation and abundance statistics will be based on&#xD;
           the Uniq gene set and the KEGG database.&#xD;
