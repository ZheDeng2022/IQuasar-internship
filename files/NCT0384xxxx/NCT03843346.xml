    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of an additional tumour test called the 21 gene Recurrence&#xD;
      Score (OncotypeDx®), a commercially available test on a Medical Oncologist's decision to&#xD;
      recommend chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a breast cancer and any lymph glands have been surgically removed, further (adjuvant)&#xD;
      treatment is generally given to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. For patients with&#xD;
      estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, this treatment has traditionally been&#xD;
      chemotherapy and hormone therapy. However, it is increasingly recognised that tumours which&#xD;
      are ER positive and negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are&#xD;
      relatively resistant to chemotherapy. It is likely that many more people are exposed to the&#xD;
      risks for chemotherapy than ever benefit from it. In order to select patients who will get&#xD;
      more benefit from chemotherapy and to spare those who get very little benefit from side&#xD;
      effects, risk assessment tools are being developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 21 Gene Recurrence Score is a test that examines the tumour genes to estimate the risk of&#xD;
      the tumour relapsing and possible chemotherapy benefits. Currently, the 21 Gene Recurrence&#xD;
      Score (OncotypeDx®) is used In Ireland for patients with no cancer in their lymph nodes. For&#xD;
      these patients it can help in deciding who should get chemotherapy. Patients with low scores&#xD;
      can sometimes avoid chemotherapy. In some countries, this test is offered to almost all&#xD;
      patients with ER positive breast cancer, irrespective of whether the cancer has spread to&#xD;
      lymph nodes or not. However, in Ireland this test is not standardly available for patients&#xD;
      who have breast cancer involving lymph nodes.&#xD;
