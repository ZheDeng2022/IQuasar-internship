  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis persists to be the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Moreover, the&#xD;
      magnitude of health care resources utilized when managing septic patients is huge. All these&#xD;
      hard facts call for constant efforts to optimize therapy. At present, the definitive therapy&#xD;
      is adequate antibiotics and infectious source control. Fortunately, research has led to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, in which the activation of multiple&#xD;
      pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators plays a key role. This has led to the development of&#xD;
      treatment strategies aimed at restoring a balanced immune response by&#xD;
      eliminating/deactivating these inflammatory mediators. Whilst animal models of sepsis have&#xD;
      provided encouraging results with strategies aiming at immune response modulation, clinical&#xD;
      studies in patients using targeted pharmacological approaches have so far proved&#xD;
      disappointing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides of acute kidney injury (AKI), renal replacement therapy (RRT) is applied to remove&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators extracorporeally. Across the different modalities, the application of&#xD;
      adsorption may help deactivate and decrease the peak elevation of these mediators in earlier&#xD;
      course of sepsis, when levels of endotoxins and cytokines are extremely high. Recently,&#xD;
      attempts to improve the outcome of sepsis patients with such devices, ie CytoSorb cytokine&#xD;
      hemoadsorption and polymyxin B (Toraymyxin) endotoxin adsorption, have seen a certain&#xD;
      renaissance. However, the clinical evidence to date supporting hemoadsorption for removal of&#xD;
      endotoxins and/or proinflammatory mediators in sepsis remains incompetent and controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA330 (Jafron Biomedical Co , Ltd, Zhuhai, China) is a hemoadsorption device containing&#xD;
      hemocompatible, porous polymeric beads capable of removing cytokines and other mid-molecular&#xD;
      weight toxins from blood by size exclusion and surface adsorption. Compared with HA330,&#xD;
      improved resin synthesis technology makes CA330 a better performance in removing cytokines.&#xD;
      This trial is the first to evaluate CA330 efficacy of cytokine reduction using the change in&#xD;
      plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations over time as a primary outcome. Although the trial&#xD;
      was neither designed nor powered to evaluate outcome, we also evaluated organ function&#xD;
      parameters as well as 28-day all-cause mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are stratified by site and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either CA330&#xD;
      hemoperfusion plus conventional medical therapy group or conventional medical therapy group.&#xD;
      The randomization is performed by researchers on the central randomization system, provided&#xD;
      by the Department of Biostatistics, Southern Medical University. In this study, the center&#xD;
      coded random number table is produced by stratified and sectional randomization method.&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis System(SAS) 9.4 statistical software is used to generate random coding&#xD;
      tables with serial numbers (001-144) according to the number of cases allocated in each&#xD;
      center and the proportion of experimental group and control group (1:1). The length of&#xD;
      selected sections (block) and random seed number are sealed together as confidential data .&#xD;
      The random number table is provided by the statisticians of the Department of Biostatistics,&#xD;
      Southern Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group receive routine treatment of sepsis combined with cytokine adsorption&#xD;
      column (CA330) perfusion, and the control group receive routine treatment of sepsis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoperfusion treatments are performed using a perfusion machine via centrally inserted&#xD;
      standard dialysis catheters at a prescribed blood flow rate of 100-300ml/min. In the&#xD;
      beginning, lower flow rate is recommended, if there is no discomfort, then gradually&#xD;
      increases. Each patient received 2 hemoperfusion treatments within 24 hours with a target&#xD;
      duration for each treatment of 120-180 minutes (minimum of 120 minutes). The shorter the&#xD;
      interval between the two hemoperfusion is, the better. It is suggested that the second&#xD;
      hemoperfusion be performed within 0-5 hours after the first one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation was recommended with low-molecular-weight heparin in arterial line of the&#xD;
      circuit at the dose of 60-80 international units (IU)/kg. No additional dose is required. The&#xD;
      activity of anticoagulant factor α can be monitored at 60 minutes. It is suggested that the&#xD;
      activity of anticoagulant factor α should be maintained at 500-1000units/L in subjects&#xD;
      without bleeding tendency and 200-400units/L in subjects with bleeding tendency. If the&#xD;
      clinical condition is limited, it is not mandatory to monitor this parameter.&#xD;
