      &quot;Main objective: to demonstrate that the implementation of an extended panel solution for the&#xD;
      point of care analysis of biological parameters (point of care : POC) in an emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) reduces the length of stay (LOS) of patients Secondary objectives: to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an expanded panel of POC solutions in an ED and&#xD;
      the reduction of emergency overcrowding in the POC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the medico-economic impact of the extended implementation of POC solutions&#xD;
      (cost-efficiency and health-economic study), to collect the satisfaction of medical&#xD;
      (emergency physicians, medical biologists) and paramedical personnel as well as the&#xD;
      satisfaction of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any patient consulting in the emergency department during the study&#xD;
      period Non-inclusion criteria: Patients attending the emergency departments as part of&#xD;
      dressing or trauma follow-up consultations Main criteria of judgment: Time between&#xD;
      administrative registration and the patient's discharge or hospitalization decision, compared&#xD;
      between the control period and the intervention period (POC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, monocentric, controlled, cluster- randomized per week. Duration of&#xD;
      center preparation (technical preparation and training of laboratory staff): 4 weeks Duration&#xD;
      of inclusion period: 18 weeks Duration of patient participation: 1 day Total trial duration&#xD;
      time: 22 weeks&quot;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;SUPOC is a monocentric, prospective, open-label, controlled study, randomized into one-week&#xD;
      inclusion periods, with 2 types of period: period POC (biological analysis performed as POC&#xD;
      in a dedicated emergency room implemented with POC devices) and period control (analysis&#xD;
      performed sent and processed in the central laboratory). Randomisation will be carried out by&#xD;
      periods of one week (periods of a whole week 24h/24 from Monday 8am to Sunday 8 pm: control&#xD;
      period or POC period, with a wash-out period between Sunday 08 pm and Monday 8am before each&#xD;
      change of period (in order to limit the patients overlap on 2 periods). The entire medical&#xD;
      care including the clinical examination, the prescriptions for additional radiological or&#xD;
      biological examinations, requests for specialist advice, as well as the conclusion of the&#xD;
      medical file will be left to the sole discretion of the emergency physician in charge of the&#xD;
      patient and dictated solely by the reason for consultation and the patient evolution. The&#xD;
      comparability of the POC and control periods will be verified, quantitatively (number of&#xD;
      patients, average number of paramedical personnel present, the number of medical personnel&#xD;
      being fixed) and qualitatively (triage scale applied by the triage nurses into 5 classes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the randomization of the two periods, the study type is best described as&#xD;
      &quot;Observational&quot; because there is no specific intervention or health outcome at the subject&#xD;
      level at all. The fact that blood samples are sent in the central laboratory or in the POC&#xD;
      platform are both considered as routine medical care. No investigator assigns a specific&#xD;
      intervention to the study participants; it is the emergency department itself which changes&#xD;
      its internal organization (the destination of the biologic samples) every week. In&#xD;
      conclusion, the purpose of the study is to examine the effect of a health provider&#xD;
      intervention (POC vs central laboratory use) on a health provider outcome (mean length of&#xD;
      stay according to the study period), and there is no health outcomes at the patient level.&#xD;
      According to the ICMJE guidelines, this type of study should not be considered as an&#xD;
      interventional clinical trial&#xD;
      (http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For organizational reasons, 3 laboratory technicians will be recruited and trained&#xD;
      specifically for the study. They will be in charge of biological testing during POC periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary evaluation criteria: length of stay (LOS) of patients consulting the ED, defined by&#xD;
      the time between the administrative registration and the medical decision of discharge or&#xD;
      hospitalization of the patient. This LOS for each patient meeting the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be extracted by the hospital's informatic department from the emergency file database.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: - -the feasibility of an expanded POC menu in the ED will be assessed by&#xD;
      the &quot;&quot;converted&quot;&quot; analysis rate, i.e. the number of analyses sent to the central laboratory&#xD;
      in the POC period divided by the total number of analyses performed as POC during the period,&#xD;
      the rate of unavailability of each POC device for maintenance or breakdown, i.e. the&#xD;
      cumulative number of minutes of unavailability for all the POC equipment compared to the&#xD;
      total duration of the POC group's periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED's crowding will be evaluated by: the waiting time in each period (time in minutes between&#xD;
      emergency registration and first medical contact), the occupancy rate defined by - at time t-&#xD;
      the number of patients present / ED's capacity. The capacity of the service is estimated on&#xD;
      the basis of the total number of boxes and beds, including short-term hospitalisation units.&#xD;
      An overcrowding is set to an occupancy rate&gt; 150%. In practice,it will be extracted by the&#xD;
      informatic department from emergency database every day of the study at 12pm, 6pm, 12am and&#xD;
      8am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to results in each period and by biological parameter will be extracted from the&#xD;
      laboratory software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health-economic impact of the expanded implementation of POC will be assessed by the&#xD;
      average total cost of an ED's visit in each period. The costs and consequences of the&#xD;
      implementation of the POC will be estimated in a comparative way in the two periods, taking&#xD;
      into account on the one hand the point of view of the establishment and on the other hand&#xD;
      that of the healthcare system. The investigators will estimate an average cost per patient&#xD;
      and per emergency room visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The satisfaction of staff and patients will be evaluated by an anonymous questionnaire&#xD;
      including satisfaction scales on the overall quality of care in emergency department and on&#xD;
      the results of biological analyses, among patients (on a sample) and all staff (emergency&#xD;
      physicians and biologists, ED's nurses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: This is a one-week randomized cluster study. A preliminary study of&#xD;
      the first 6 months of 2016, using ED's software to extract data from emergency department&#xD;
      visits, estimated an average cluster size of 1100 patients, with a size variation coefficient&#xD;
      of 0.2, as well as a standard deviation of 2 hours and 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an average reduction of 20 minutes of the main judgement criterion, and an&#xD;
      intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, with a bilateral alpha equal to 5%, study will&#xD;
      have to include 9 clusters in each period to obtain a power of 80% - 18 weeks total duration&#xD;
      of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a monocentric study including all patients consulting in an adult emergency department&#xD;
      with a total of 60,000 visits per year, each month will allow the inclusion of at least 4,400&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
