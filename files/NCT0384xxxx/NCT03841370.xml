  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The color change of endodontically treated teeth is a common concern in clinical practice.&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to evaluate, in vivo, the color change (ΔE00) caused by&#xD;
      endodontic treatment. A observational retrospective study will be conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      ΔE00 of anterior (incisors and canines) and posterior (premolar) teeth treated at a private&#xD;
      clinic, regardless of technique, treatment time and sealer used. In this study the ΔE00 will&#xD;
      be evaluated using the measurements obtained in the homologous tooth (without endodontic&#xD;
      treatment) versus the measurement obtained from the tooth treated endodontically. The values&#xD;
      of ΔE00 obtained for each sealer, cut and time will be analyzed by multifactorial analysis to&#xD;
      verify associations of the outcomes with the ΔE00.&#xD;

      This cross-sectional clinical study will evaluate the color difference (∆E00), and CIELAB&#xD;
      coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) of endodontic treated teeth in the 3 conditions (baseline,&#xD;
      homologous tooth versus ≤ 1 month after tooth endodontic treatment); (baseline, homologous&#xD;
      tooth versus &gt; 1 to 12 months after tooth endodontic treatment); (baseline, homologous tooth&#xD;
      versus &gt; 12 up to 5 years after tooth endodontic treatment). The following pairs of variables&#xD;
      will be considered in the comparisons: filling material (AH Plus and Endofill/Fillcanal/MTA&#xD;
      Fillapex); cut at cervical level (dental cervix and 2mm in the apical direction); and&#xD;
      location tooth (anterior and posterior teeth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response variables will include the color difference (∆E00), estimated by the CIEDE2000&#xD;
      color difference metric (ΔE00) obtained from readings made on the homologous tooth of the&#xD;
      endodontic treated (baseline) and tooth endodontic treated (after) with a spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals who came to a private dental clinic between January 2010 and December 2018&#xD;
      and who received endodontic treatment will be considered for participation in this study. The&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria will be used to evaluate and enroll potential participants:&#xD;
      individuals at least 18 years old; who received anterior or posterior (pre-molar) endodontic&#xD;
      treatment and who present homologous tooth with pulp vitality and at least 1/3 of the&#xD;
      remaining coronary, without endodontic treatment, intraradicular retentor or crown making&#xD;
      dental color assessment impossible. Besides, will be excluded questionnaires filled&#xD;
      incorrectly or lack of data regarding, the day, month and year of endodontic treatment&#xD;
      finish, sealer used, the pulp condition at the time of the first consultation (irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis or pulpal necrosis) and periapical radiography, obtained with the use of&#xD;
      radiographic positioner, preserved and with a clear image. All individuals who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will sign a consent form based on the Declaration of Helsinki, after&#xD;
      receiving information about the study objectives, risks, and benefits associated with the&#xD;
      alternative treatment options and procedures. One examiner will be trained and calibrated&#xD;
      prior to data collection. Kappa statistics will be used to assess intra-examiner reliability.&#xD;
      Clinical, radiographic and color information will be collected.&#xD;
