    <measure>Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale 4-point Responder Rate at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments was reported by the subject via eDiary. The daily NRS results were summarized. The daily results were averaged to create weekly measures.&#xD;
The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable), higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A subject was a 4-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4).</description>

It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable), higher scores indicated greater itch intensity.

    <time_frame>At Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Itch Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a validated, self-reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the worst intensity of their itch on a 100-mm horizontal line ranging from 0 mm (no itch) to 100 mm (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. The VAS measurement were summarized in centimeters. WI-VAS assessments were reported by the subject via a paper form administered at study visits.</description>

    <time_frame>From screening until the Follow-up (F/U) visit which occurred 35 days (+ 7 days) after the Week 10 visit or the last dose of study drug for subjects who discontinued study drug early.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adult subjects with chronic pruritus of unknown origin. Adverse events (AEs) and SAEs were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. After informed consent was signed, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 41 sites in US from 22 January 2019 to 21 January 2020. All subjects who met the study entry criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the screening period (3 weeks), all subjects were evaluated for eligibility and assessed for conditions associated with chronic pruritus. Subjects were to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) at the Screening visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale 4-point Responder Rate at Week 10</title>
        <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments was reported by the subject via eDiary. The daily NRS results were summarized. The daily results were averaged to create weekly measures.&#xD;
The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable), higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A subject was a 4-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4).</description>

          <title>Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale 4-point Responder Rate at Week 10</title>
          <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments was reported by the subject via eDiary. The daily NRS results were summarized. The daily results were averaged to create weekly measures.&#xD;
The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable), higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A subject was a 4-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4).</description>

        <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments was reported by the subject via eDiary. The daily NRS results were summarized. The daily results were averaged to create weekly measures.&#xD;
The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable), higher scores indicated greater itch intensity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Worst-Itch Visual Analog Scale at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10</title>
        <description>The Itch Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a validated, self-reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It used a 24-hour recall period and asked subjects to rate the worst intensity of their itch on a 100-mm horizontal line ranging from 0 mm (no itch) to 100 mm (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. The VAS measurement were summarized in centimeters. WI-VAS assessments were reported by the subject via a paper form administered at study visits.</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adult subjects with chronic pruritus of unknown origin. Adverse events (AEs) and SAEs were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. After informed consent was signed, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</description>

Adverse events (AEs) and SAEs were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. After informed consent was signed, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</description>
