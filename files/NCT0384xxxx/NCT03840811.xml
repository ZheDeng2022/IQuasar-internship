    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, interventional, non-randomized, experimental infection model study with&#xD;
      healthy adult males adults (N=32) between the ages of 18-36 at study enrollment. The study is&#xD;
      designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for&#xD;
      gonococcal infection in the male urethra. The duration for all participants will be about 3&#xD;
      weeks. Study duration will be approximately about 18 months for implementation and&#xD;
      enrollment. The primary objectives of the present study are to: (1) compare infectivity of&#xD;
      different isogenic mutants with wild-type (WT) N. gonorrhoeae in noncompetitive infections&#xD;
      and to (2) assess relative fitness of the mutant in competitive infections initiated by&#xD;
      inocula containing equivalent numbers of both WT and mutant strains for mutants with WT&#xD;
      infectivity.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, interventional, non-randomized, experimental infection model study with&#xD;
      healthy adult males adults (N=32) between the ages of 18-36 at study enrollment. The study is&#xD;
      designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for&#xD;
      gonococcal infection in the male urethra. For each mutant to be investigated under this&#xD;
      protocol, groups of subjects will be enrolled first in noncompetitive infection studies:&#xD;
      Group 1 (n = up to 8) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the isogenic mutant&#xD;
      N. gonorrhoeae strain, and Group 2 (n = up to 8) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing&#xD;
      only the wild-type (WT) N. gonorrhoeae strain. If primary and secondary outcomes are not&#xD;
      different for the isogenic mutant and WT strains, a group of subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      competitive infection studies: Group 3 (up to 16) will receive a bacterial inoculum&#xD;
      containing a mixture of equivalent numbers the isogenic mutant and WT strain. All subjects&#xD;
      will be examined daily for symptoms of infection and receive antibiotic treatment at the end&#xD;
      of the inpatient portion of the trial. Within 7 days of antibiotic treatment, subjects will&#xD;
      return for a follow-up examination. A final follow-up phone interview will be conducted&#xD;
      within 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. The duration for all participants will be about 3&#xD;
      weeks. Study duration will be approximately about 18 months for implementation and&#xD;
      enrollment. The primary objectives of the present study are to: (1) compare infectivity of&#xD;
      different isogenic mutants with wild-type (WT) N. gonorrhoeae in noncompetitive infections&#xD;
      and to (2) assess relative fitness of the mutant in competitive infections initiated by&#xD;
      inocula containing equivalent numbers of both WT and mutant strains for mutants with WT&#xD;
      infectivity. Note, competitive infections will not be performed if non-competitive infections&#xD;
      are substantially different. If this is the case, there will be no analysis for this primary&#xD;
      objective. The study secondary objective is to compare the clinical course of infection with&#xD;
      mutant and WT N. gonorrhoeae in noncompetitive infections.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and the day of treatment, any day between Day 2 and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The competitive index (CI) is defined by the ratio of colony forming units (cfu) of the two strains recovered from urine cultures on the day of treatment (output) compared to the ratio of strains in the inoculum (input):&#xD;
CI = mutant cfu(output)/wild-type cfu(output) รท mutant cfu(input)/wild-type cfu(input).&#xD;
The CI is used to assess whether the fitness of a given mutant is different than that of wild-type, and CI as a ratio is compared to 1. If it's not significantly different than 1, then no significant difference in the fitness was observed. Mutant or wild-type cfu values of 0 were replaced by 1 in the calculation of competitive index.&#xD;
The assessment was performed in the MtrD trial mixed group.</description>

        <title>The Competitive Index of the Mutant Compared to Wild Type Proportion of Organisms With the Predicted Competitive Advantage Recovered From Urine and/or Urethral Swab Specimens From Infected Participants</title>
        <description>The competitive index (CI) is defined by the ratio of colony forming units (cfu) of the two strains recovered from urine cultures on the day of treatment (output) compared to the ratio of strains in the inoculum (input):&#xD;
CI = mutant cfu(output)/wild-type cfu(output) รท mutant cfu(input)/wild-type cfu(input).&#xD;
The CI is used to assess whether the fitness of a given mutant is different than that of wild-type, and CI as a ratio is compared to 1. If it's not significantly different than 1, then no significant difference in the fitness was observed. Mutant or wild-type cfu values of 0 were replaced by 1 in the calculation of competitive index.&#xD;
The assessment was performed in the MtrD trial mixed group.</description>
