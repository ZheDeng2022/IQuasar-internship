      This multicenter prospective non-randomized interventional study (clinical trial) that will&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of cryoballoon ablation treatment using the C2 Cryoballoon&#xD;
      device (Pentax Medical Corporation) as an alternative primary treatment modality for sporadic&#xD;
      and familial nonampullary nonpolypoid (flat) duodenal adenomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duodenal adenomas are precursors to adenocarcinoma. Treatment with endoscopic polypectomy is&#xD;
      technically challenging problematic and associated with a high rate of complication - overall&#xD;
      26%, with bleeding 22-40%, higher with larger polyps. Surgery to remove these benign polyps&#xD;
      would be a Whipple operation, which has a high morbidity and 1-4% mortality rate. Medical&#xD;
      therapies like celecoxib decrease the number of polyps but do not prevent cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter prospective cohort study will assess the safety and efficacy of cryoablation&#xD;
      treatment as an alternative primary treatment modality for sporadic and familial nonampullary&#xD;
      nonpolypoid (flat) duodenal adenomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nitrous oxide focal&#xD;
      cryoballoon ablation for complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus (including a clinical&#xD;
      trial published by the Principal Investigator), which is intestinal metaplasia, which is&#xD;
      histologically similar to normal duodenal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When inflated, the cryoballoon flattens the duodenal folds allowing improved visibility of&#xD;
      the duodenal lesions. The focal ablation allows precise targeting and avoidance of the&#xD;
      ampulla to minimize pancreatitis risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cases at Johns Hopkins Hospital have been treated successfully and safely using cryogen&#xD;
      dose of 10 seconds. The procedures were easy and short, with excellent views of the lesion&#xD;
      with balloon inflation and high definition endoscope. No major adverse events, pain requiring&#xD;
      treatment, or bleeding were noted. Minor adverse events included transient abdominal bloating&#xD;
      lasting for &lt; 3 days in 1 patient. In one patient with sporadic laterally spreading large&#xD;
      Paris 2A polyp who declined standard treatments, complete eradication was achieved with 2&#xD;
      ablation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who had 2 hospitalizations for&#xD;
      post-polypectomy bleeding after duodenal EMR, complete eradication was noted after 1&#xD;
      treatment of 3 Paris 2A and 2B adjacent polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of these two patients shows no recurrence &gt; 1 year and at the most recent follow-up&#xD;
      procedures. Clinical and endoscopic surveillance continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, another physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San&#xD;
      Antonio (UTHSCSA) reported another two patients with duodenal adenomas in her practice&#xD;
      treated successfully with cryoballoon ablation without complications. Two other collaborating&#xD;
      physicians at Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, and Geisinger Medical&#xD;
      Center in Pennsylvania have also reported favorable response of these challenging neoplasms&#xD;
      to endoscopic cryoballoon ablation. The group is currently preparing a case series report and&#xD;
      a separate Institutional Review Board application is being submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may impact on the management of patients with duodenal adenomas by demonstrating&#xD;
      the potential for safe and effective non-operative eradication using cryoballoon ablation.&#xD;
      The safety profile of endoscopic cryoballoon ablation is likely to be better than endoscopic&#xD;
      resection based on a large clinical and research experience in Barrett's esophagus patients&#xD;
      (&gt;250) and small clinical experience in duodenal adenoma patients, with &lt;=5% bleeding, no&#xD;
      perforation, and transient, mild post-treatment discomfort.&#xD;
