  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial is studying how well lenalidomide works in treating patients&#xD;
      with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to progression in patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL) treated with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical response (complete and partial response) in treatment-naïve&#xD;
      patients with high-risk CLL treated with single-agent lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the incidence of immune-mediated flare reaction. III. To determine the&#xD;
      toxicity profile of single-agent lenalidomide in previously untreated patients with high-risk&#xD;
      CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To conduct correlative studies in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or lymph nodes of&#xD;
      patients treated with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve complete response (by morphological criteria but have persistent minimal residual&#xD;
      disease by molecular criteria) or partial response may continue treatment beyond 8 courses.&#xD;
      Patients may undergo bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or lymph node sample collection at&#xD;
      baseline and periodically during study for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for a maximum of 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
