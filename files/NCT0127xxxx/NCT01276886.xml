  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were recruited over a four year period from 1996 to 1999. Those admitted in the&#xD;
      years 1996 and 1997 were retrospectively accrued from the clinical records, while patients&#xD;
      treated between 1998 and 1999 patients were entered on the database prospectively on&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All consecutive patients with left sided acute diverticulitis diagnosed&#xD;
      clinically by the presence of abdominal pain, associated with leukocytosis (&gt;11x109) and/or&#xD;
      fever &gt;38°C, confirmed by imaging (CT scan, ultrasonography, water soluble contrast enema)&#xD;
      either alone or in combination and/or by operative findings, entered the study. The CT&#xD;
      criteria for the diagnosis included a localized thickening (≥4 mm) of the colonic wall and&#xD;
      signs of inflammation of the pericolic fat, with abscess and/or extraluminal air and/or&#xD;
      extraluminal contrast. The criteria for ultrasound included at least two of the following&#xD;
      signs: bowel wall thickening (&gt;4 mm), diverticular inflammation, pericolic fat edema,&#xD;
      intramural or pericolic inflammatory mass, intramural fistula. The diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      water soluble contrast enema included segmental luminal narrowing and a tethered mucosa with&#xD;
      or without a mass effect or extravasation of contrast and/or the presence of extraluminal&#xD;
      air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer or diseases precluding adequate follow up, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Patients were treated conservatively (antibiotics, I.V. nutrition, CT/US guided&#xD;
      abscess drainage) or surgically according to the local policy of each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow up was carried out according to local policy. The following data were&#xD;
      collected: persistence or recurrence of chronic symptoms attributable to complicated&#xD;
      diverticular disease, new episodes of AD, new hospital admissions for AD, type of treatment&#xD;
      and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence was defined as a new episode of AD requiring hospitalization that occurred at&#xD;
      least 2 months after complete resolution of the index episode which resulted in inclusion in&#xD;
      the study. If surgery was performed, the timing, type of procedure, Hinchey stage and&#xD;
      complications were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection A standardized flow sheet was used to collect data on medical history,&#xD;
      diagnostic work up, type of treatment and follow up to create a dedicated database. Gender,&#xD;
      age, date of hospital admission and discharge, diagnosis on admission and discharge,&#xD;
      co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, liver or renal&#xD;
      failure), symptoms experienced before admission and their duration, history of&#xD;
      diverticulosis, previous episodes of AD, laboratory tests, and treatment performed were&#xD;
      recorded. Where surgery was performed, the date and type of procedure, the operative findings&#xD;
      including Hinchey's classification (16) and details of the operation (incision, extension of&#xD;
      resection, type of anastomosis, covering stoma, drains), pathology report, and postoperative&#xD;
      complications occurring within 30 days, were all recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points The primary endpoint was to assess the rate of recurrence of AD requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization during the follow-up period. Additional endpoints were to assess the risks of&#xD;
      emergency surgery, stoma and disease-related mortality during the follow up.&#xD;
