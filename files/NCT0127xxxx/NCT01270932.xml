      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution open label, pharmacokinetic validation study of the combination&#xD;
      of lenalidomide with dexamethasone for firstline induction therapy in transplant-eligible MM&#xD;
      ( Multiple Myeloma ) patients with various degrees of renal failure. There will be 4 patient&#xD;
      groups with various degrees of renal function (based on creatinine clearance calculated from&#xD;
      a 24 hour urine collection and requirement for dialysis). Each group will receive&#xD;
      lenalidomide dosing as per official recommended guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Normal {CrCl(creatinine clearance)&gt;60 mL/min}25 mg (full-dose)-Daily for 21 days of a&#xD;
      28 Day cycle1 Group 2 Moderate renal impairment {30 ≤ CrCl (creatinine clearance) &lt;60&#xD;
      mL/min}10 mg Daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle Group 3 Severe renal impairment {CrCl&#xD;
      (creatinine clearance)&lt;30 mL/min, not requiring dialysis}15 mg Every 48 hours for 21 days of&#xD;
      a 28 day cycle (11 PLANNED DOSES EACH 28 DAY CYCLE) Group 4 End-stage renal failure {CrCl&#xD;
      (creatinine clearance)&lt;30 mL/min, requiring dialysis}5 mg Once daily for 21 days of a 28 day&#xD;
      cycle On dialysis days the dose should be administered following dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies: We will be evaluating PK studies following single and multiple&#xD;
      doses of lenalidomide during Cycle 1.Patients will receive their first dose of lenalidomide&#xD;
      (Cycle 1, day 1) as per the above designated patient group. PK (pharmacokinetic)sampling for&#xD;
      1st dose only will be drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post-dose for group 1&#xD;
      and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours for all other groups. The 2nd dose of&#xD;
      lenalidomide will be administered on Day 4 for all patients (i.e. no doses on Days 2 and 3).&#xD;
      On Day 17 (after 14 doses of lenalidomide administered), repeat PK sampling will be performed&#xD;
      at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours for groups 1, 2 and 4 (before next hemodialysis&#xD;
      for those in group 4). Repeat PK sampling for group 3 will be performed at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 hours.&#xD;
