      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well lapatinib ditosylate and&#xD;
      trastuzumab work in treating older patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph&#xD;
      nodes (locally advanced) or to other parts of the body (metastatic). Lapatinib ditosylate may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or&#xD;
      tumor cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lapatinib ditosylate together with&#xD;
      trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of the combination of&#xD;
      trastuzumab and lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) in adults age 60 or older with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the full toxicity&#xD;
      profile including all grades; to estimate the rate of all grades of cardiac toxicity; to&#xD;
      estimate the rate of all grades of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. II. To describe the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of lapatinib in older adults. III. To estimate objective response&#xD;
      rate and clinical benefit rate as defined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria. IV. To estimate median progression-free and overall survival. V. To&#xD;
      explore factors other than chronological age that can affect toxicity rates as identified&#xD;
      using a cancer-specific geriatric assessment. VI. To estimate rates of adherence to lapatinib&#xD;
      in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and trastuzumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once weekly OR once every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of&#xD;
      study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
