    <textblock>
      Aims and priorities of the project The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. test the effect of frequency of meals (six vs. two meals daily with the same daily&#xD;
           caloric restriction of -500 kcal/day) on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and&#xD;
           hepatic fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. characterize some of the mechanisms of action of different frequencies of meals (amount&#xD;
           of visceral fat, hepatic fat content, serum concentrations of adipokines, gut hormones,&#xD;
           oxidation stress markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. test the ability of the participants to maintain hypocaloric diet on both regimens when&#xD;
           educated and left to prepare their meals alone in comparison with those for whom all&#xD;
           meals during the study will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a randomized, crossover study, where 50 individuals with type 2 diabetes will&#xD;
      change in a random order two regimens: six, and two meals a day. Each testing period will&#xD;
      take three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose and lipid metabolism and its regulation will be thoroughly tested at start, and after&#xD;
      each 3-months-period (meal test, hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamp, indirect calorimetry,&#xD;
      MRI scan of the liver, DXA scan, serum concentration determination of selected adipokines,&#xD;
      gut hormones, and oxidation stress markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that low plasma insulin levels (as achieved by&#xD;
      periods of fasting) will reduce insulin resistance and hepatic lipid content. In contrast,&#xD;
      frequent meals (and consequent higher plasma levels of insulin) will predispose to&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and insulin resistance. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that the participants will increase their caloric intake with increased meal&#xD;
      frequency (in spite of thorough education) when left to prepare their meals in comparison&#xD;
      with those for whom all meals will be provided.&#xD;

      Key words Insulin resistance, meal frequency, type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease, adipokines, gut hormones, oxidative stress Methodology Study design: the&#xD;
      investigators will use the design of a randomized, crossover study, where 50 individuals with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes will change in a random order the frequency of their meals: six, and two&#xD;
      meals a day. Caloric restriction will be the same (-500 kcal/day). Each testing period will&#xD;
      take three months. For one half of the participants all meals during the study will be&#xD;
      provided. The other half will be thoroughly educated how to maintain their daily caloric&#xD;
      intake during both regimens and they will prepare their meals alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group: 50 individuals with type 2 diabetes treated by diet only or oral hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents, diabetes duration at least 1 year, both men and women, age 30-65 years, BMI 27-50&#xD;
      kg/mÂ². The subjects will be explained aims, methods and risks of the study and they will sign&#xD;
      informed consent (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimens: On the six-meals-per-day-regimen, participants will be asked to divide their total&#xD;
      caloric intake into six meals and to eat every two or three hours. On the&#xD;
      two-meals-per-day-regimen, they will divide their total caloric intake into two meals: the&#xD;
      first meal will be eaten between 6 and 10 a.m., the second one between noon and 4 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: Participants will be asked not to change their exercise habits during the&#xD;
      study. Physical activity will be monitored using pedometers and standardized questionnaires:&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and Baecke questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning (week 0), and at the end of every 3 months (week 12, and 24), the following&#xD;
      procedures and measurements will be performed at each subject (three times in each subject):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Common anthropometric investigations (body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference),&#xD;
           blood samples will be taken for laboratory assessments (common laboratory tests,&#xD;
           parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism, chosen adipokines, oxidative stress markers,&#xD;
           gut hormones, fatty acid composition in serum phospholipids etc.- see analytic methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meal test for glucose tolerance assessment after standard breakfast /baguette Crocodille&#xD;
           Cheese Gourmet - 180g, energy 452,8 Kcal/1895,7 kJ, composition: carbohydrates 49,2 g&#xD;
           (44,55%), proteins 18,5 g (16,74%), lipids 18,8 g (38,7%), of which saturated 6,8 g,&#xD;
           monounsaturated 6,0 g, polyunsaturated 5,0 g/. Blood samples for the assessment of&#xD;
           glycemia, C- peptide, immunoreactive insulin (IRI) will be taken in 0, 30, 60, 120 and&#xD;
           180 minutes after breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hyperinsulinemic (1 mU/kg/min) isoglycemic clamp (HIC) 3 hours long with indirect&#xD;
           calorimetry. This method allows exact quantification of insulin resistance and energy&#xD;
           substrates utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the liver to measure the hepatic fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DXA (Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan to measure total body composition and fat&#xD;
           content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Insulin secretion and glucose control will be measured during a one-day-stay in the&#xD;
           hospital at the end of each regimen. Blood samples will be taken every three hours&#xD;
           during the whole day. Urine will be collected during the whole day to measure&#xD;
           microalbuminuria and C-peptide waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations of selected adipokines (resistin, adiponectin total, HMW- adiponectin,&#xD;
      TNFalfa and leptin) and other cytokines and proteins (FABP) will be measured enzymatically&#xD;
      using standard kits (ELISA, Linco, USA). Plasma levels of gut hormones will be measured&#xD;
      enzymatically usig standard kits (Milliplex, Millipore, USA). Parameters of lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation will be determined according to the levels of TBARS by the reaction with&#xD;
      thiobarbituric acid and according to the levels of conjugated dienes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of reduced and oxidised glutathione will be determined using HPLC method with&#xD;
      fluorescence detection. Ascorbic acid will be determined spectrophotometric reaction with&#xD;
      dinitrophenylhydrazine. Concentrations of a- and g-tocopherol in serum will be determined by&#xD;
      reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection&#xD;
      according to the modified method of Catignani and Biery. The activity of SOD will be analyzed&#xD;
      by the reaction of blocking nitrotethrazolium blue reduction and nitrophormasane formation.&#xD;
      Catalase activity measurement is based on the ability of H2O2 to produce with ammonium&#xD;
      molybdate the color complex detected spectrophotometrically. The activity of gluthathione&#xD;
      peroxidase will be monitored by oxidation velocity of gluthathione by Ellman reagent. Serum&#xD;
      glucose will be analysed using the glucose-oxidase method Beckman Analyzer (Beckman&#xD;
      Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA), IRI will be determined by radioimmunoassay using an&#xD;
      IMMUNOTECH Insulin IRMA kit (IMMUNOTECH as, Prague, Czech Republic), C-peptide using an&#xD;
      IMMUNOTECH C-Peptide IRMA kit (IMMUNOTECH as, Prague, Czech Republic) and glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      will be measured by a Bio-Rad Haemoglobin A1c Column Test (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatty acid pattern in serum phospholipids will be measured after lipids extraction according&#xD;
      to Folch and separation of lipid fractions by thin-layer chromatography. The methylesters of&#xD;
      fatty acids will be separated by gas chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventual effects of different meal frequency regimens will be evaluated due to chosen gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis: Will be done with the use of ANOVA tests, pair and unpair t- tests and&#xD;
      other statistic methods using standard statistic programs. Estimate of the number of subjects&#xD;
      to be recruited was done using power analysis of repeated measurements via statistic software&#xD;
      PASS 2005 (Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville, UT, USA). Factors included in this&#xD;
      model are interindividual factors (control vs. experimental group), intraindividual factors&#xD;
      (individual time stadium in the study) and interaction between factors (divergence degree&#xD;
      between time profiles in control and experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame: December 2010-February 2011 recruitment of the participants March 2011 start of&#xD;
      the study Group A: 12 weeks 6 meals/day followed by additional 12 weeks of 2 meal/day Group&#xD;
      B: 12 weeks 2 meals/day followed by additional 12 weeks of 6 meal/day September 2011 end of&#xD;
      the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be done at start, week 12 and week 24.&#xD;
