    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually affects young people and causes severe bowel and bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction. Recently, the concept of a surgically created somato-sensory reflex arch for&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction in SCI has been introduced. The concept is promising, not just for&#xD;
      bladder but also for bowel dysfunction. However, well designed studies need to be performed&#xD;
      before recommending the procedure to a large number of patients worldwide. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators perform multidisciplinary studies providing necessary information about the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of the somato-sensory reflex arch in adult SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Somato-sensory reflex arch increases colorectal transport between defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Somato-sensory reflex arch improves colorectal emptying at defecation&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injury has a profound impact on the lives of those affected. Quality of life is&#xD;
      restricted not only by immobility but also by severe neurogenic bladder and bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction. For example, 66% of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients have to empty their rectum&#xD;
      digitally, 75% suffer from faecal incontinence and 9% spend more than 60 minutes each time&#xD;
      they defecate. Neurological impairment due to SCI is permanent and the average age at injury&#xD;
      is only 28 years. The longevity of individuals with SCI is approaching that of the general&#xD;
      population and, accordingly, most patients have to live for several decades with severe&#xD;
      bladder and bowel symptoms. It is estimated that the number of individuals with SCI in&#xD;
      Denmark is 3.000 and each year 10.000 persons in the European Union sustain a SCI. Even&#xD;
      though clean intermittent catheterization has successfully reduced mortality due to urinary&#xD;
      tract infections or reflux and though several new treatment modalities for neurogenic bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction have been introduced, both bladder and bowel dysfunction still rank among the top&#xD;
      three causes of impairment of quality of life after SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somato-sensory reflex arch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept was pioneered by professor Xiao. Animal studies and basic clinical research were&#xD;
      performed in the United States and later human clinical studies have been done in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China. The surgical procedure principle can briefly be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All spinal nerves have an anterior efferent root and a posterior afferent root. For the&#xD;
      somato-sensory reflex arch (or &quot;Xiao procedure&quot;) the posterior (afferent or sensory) root of&#xD;
      the 5th lumbar nerve (L5) is kept while the anterior root is cut and anastomosed to the&#xD;
      anterior root of a lower segment, usually the third sacral segment (S3). Thereby, a new&#xD;
      reflex arch has been created from the skin of the leg through the sensory part of L5 to the&#xD;
      spinal cord and further through the anastomosis via S2 or S3 to the bladder and bowel. Strong&#xD;
      stimuli at the L5 dermatome, i.e. scratching or electrical stimulation, will then initiate&#xD;
      voiding (6,7). Effects of the somato-sensory reflex arch on neurogenic bowel dysfunction have&#xD;
      not been studied, but clinical experience indicates that bowel management is substantially&#xD;
      facilitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Xiao procedure introduces a completely new concept for management of spinal cord lesions&#xD;
      and it has been greeted with optimism worldwide. The number of patients operated in China&#xD;
      alone is now more than 3.000 and centres in the United States, Germany and Israel have&#xD;
      introduced or modified it. Furthermore, centres in Australia, Finland and Denmark plan to&#xD;
      introduce it within the present year. There are, however, serious concerns that need to be&#xD;
      addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical follow-up has only been done in very few patients and physiological studies&#xD;
           after the procedure are equally few and small.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In spite of the very large number of patients operated in China logistic or cultural&#xD;
           factors have prohibited effective follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A minor improvement in bladder and bowel function may be important to a Chinese patient&#xD;
           without access to other treatment but it is unknown whether the Xiao procedure will be&#xD;
           an advantage to patients in a western healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The mode of action of the somato-sensory reflex arch is very incompletely studied and&#xD;
           the mode of action on bowel function not studied at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the widespread use of somato-sensory reflex arch we find it of utmost importance that&#xD;
      well designed studies with validated or even objective endpoints are performed. Results of&#xD;
      such studies will have an international impact in either defining indications for a&#xD;
      completely new treatment principle or, otherwise, in preventing the widespread use of an&#xD;
      ineffective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2009 the core members of our multidisciplinary study team went on a study tour to&#xD;
      Wuhan, China. In Wuhan a staggering number of 600 patients had the somato-sensory reflex arch&#xD;
      procedure performed in 2008. Based on experience from our visit we pose the following&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Somato-sensory reflex arch increases colorectal transport between defecations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Somato-sensory reflex arch improves colorectal emptying at defecation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injured patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally, two indications for the somato-sensory reflex arch are emerging:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adult patients with bladder dysfunction due supraconal SCI (above the medullar conus)&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with bladder dysfunction due to spinal bifida. Most children with spinal bifida&#xD;
           have motor incomplete lesions and, accordingly, the surgical procedure carries a risk of&#xD;
           long-lasting or even permanent loss of motor function - typically loss of dorsiflexion&#xD;
           of the foot. Whether results from the procedure justify that risk remains to be&#xD;
           determined. In contrast, patients with motor complete supraconal SCI, and thereby&#xD;
           complete loss of voluntary muscle function below the level of injury, do not run that&#xD;
           risk. Therefore, it has been decided that patients in group a) above will be offered the&#xD;
           procedure at the Department of Neurosurgery. Initially, 20 patients will undergo the&#xD;
           procedure. As the method is new, surgery and follow-up will be performed under strict&#xD;
           monitoring with emphasis on neurophysiologic testing and potential complications.&#xD;
           Approval will be obtained from the Ethics Committee, patients will be very carefully&#xD;
           informed by the neurosurgeon and informed consent will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relatively minor surgical procedure has been described in previously. In summary: A&#xD;
      hemilaminectomy of L5-S1 is performed. By means of neurophysiology testing the 5th lumbar&#xD;
      root and 2nd or 3rd sacral roots are identified on one side. The perineurium is opened and&#xD;
      the motor roots are separated from the sensory. The motor roots are transsected and a&#xD;
      microanastomosis is created between L5 and S2 or S3. After surgery sprouting occurs and after&#xD;
      12-18 months the reflex arch is functional. Time till clinical effect is therefore also 12-18&#xD;
      months. The advantage of the procedure is that it is performed through a hemilaminectomy of&#xD;
      only two segments and the surgical stress in relatively small. The patients are expected to&#xD;
      be in their habitual condition within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post surgical monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if patients void during somato-autonomic reflex arch stimulation, they usually do not&#xD;
      defecate. In spite of this, it is the clinical experience in China that bowel function&#xD;
      improves significantly. This is possible because the left colon and rectum receive&#xD;
      stimulatory parasympathetic innervation from the same spinal cord segments (S2-S4) as the&#xD;
      bladder. It has been shown in several papers, including some from our own group, that colonic&#xD;
      transit times are significantly prolonged in SCI patients. Somato-autonomic reflex&#xD;
      stimulation may therefore improve bowel function by increasing colorectal transport during&#xD;
      stimulation even in the absence of defecation. As most patients stimulate several times each&#xD;
      day the cumulative effect on the colorectum may be considerable and facilitate colorectal&#xD;
      emptying when it is otherwise induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our centre has been leading internationally in developing scintigraphic techniques for&#xD;
      assessment of colorectal transport at defecation and previously we have found that patients&#xD;
      with low SCI have extremely reduced colorectal emptying at defecation. We find that our&#xD;
      scintigraphic technique is extremely well suited for the study of colorectal effects from the&#xD;
      Xiao procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scintigraphic procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total gastrointestinal and segmental colonic transit times of each individual is&#xD;
      determined. Based on this information two doses of 111Indium are taken on day-1 (2.6 MBq) and&#xD;
      on day-2 or-3 (3.3 MBq). On day-0 patients arrive at our Department of Nuclear medicine at 8&#xD;
      A.M. A double headed Picker Gamma camera is used to image the whole abdomen for ten minutes&#xD;
      with patients lying flat on their back (period 1). Then another ten minutes recording will be&#xD;
      performed while the relevant dermatome for the somato-autonomic reflex arch is stimulated&#xD;
      (period 2). Then subjects are allowed a standardized meal to stimulate the gastrocolonic&#xD;
      reflex. Within 30 minutes SCI subjects initiate defecation in their standard way (through&#xD;
      staining, digital stimulation, suppositories or micro enema) while sitting at the toilet.&#xD;
      Finally, another ten minutes recording is performed to determine colorectal contents after&#xD;
      defecation (period 3). The number of counts for each of the ten minutes periods is&#xD;
      approximately 80.000. Comparison of the number of counts in each of four segments (the&#xD;
      coecum/ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the rectosigmoid)&#xD;
      allows highly specific description of luminal colorectal transport during stimulation or at&#xD;
      defecation. All subjects will only be studied twice: Before surgery and after 18 months.&#xD;
      Based on this relatively simple experiment the following three sub-studies can be published:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1)Colorectal transport at defecation in patients with spinal cord lesions By comparing&#xD;
      results from scintigraphy before surgery in patients with supraconal SCI with our previous&#xD;
      results among healthy volunteers and patients with low SCI valuable information about&#xD;
      colorectal dysfunction in SCI will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2)Colorectal transport during somato-autonomic reflex stimulation By comparing the&#xD;
      localization of colorectal contents in periods 1 and 2 before both surgery and after 18&#xD;
      months very detailed information about colorectal transport during somato-autonomic reflex&#xD;
      stimulation will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B3)Colorectal emptying at defecation after somato-autonomic reflex stimulation Substraction&#xD;
      of counts in period 3 from those registered in period 2 differences between colorectal&#xD;
      emptying and segmental transport at defecation before and after creation of the reflex arch&#xD;
      will give detailed objective information about the effects of the Xiao procedure on&#xD;
      colorectal emptying.&#xD;
