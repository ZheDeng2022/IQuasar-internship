      To assess safety, tolerance and PK profile of different doses(50mg,100mg,200mg,300mg, 400mg,&#xD;
      500mg,QD)of Icaritin in advanced breast cancer Patients in China&#xD;

      ERa36 predominantly localizes on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm and mediates a&#xD;
      membrane-initiated &quot;nongenomic&quot; signaling pathway. Membrane-initiated estrogen signaling has&#xD;
      been linked to rapid responses to estrogen and generally activates signaling pathways like&#xD;
      MAPK/ERK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase C pathways. Preclinical study&#xD;
      demonstrated that ERa36 was expressed in tumor cells and might be the driving force of breast&#xD;
      cancer cell proliferation. 40% of breast cancer tumors which used to be considered as ER&#xD;
      negative also express ERa36. In the former study the investigators found that 40% of&#xD;
      ERa66-positive breast cancer patients express high levels of ERa36 in their tumors, and this&#xD;
      subset of patients are less likely to benefit from tamoxifen treatment compared with those&#xD;
      with ERa66-positive/ERa36-negative tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecular compound which is high selective ERa36&#xD;
      modulators and perhaps will be a very promising new drug to treat advanced breast cancer by&#xD;
      targeting this nongenomic pathway. It was showed that it can inhibit the growth of breast&#xD;
      cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The investigators have completed the preclinical&#xD;
      PK&amp;PD and toxicity studies in animals and now move on to test it in a FIM clinical trial.&#xD;
