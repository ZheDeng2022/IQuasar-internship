  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this project is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of azithromycin to determine whether treatment from infancy is safe and will&#xD;
      prevent the onset of bronchiectasis. One hundred and thirty infants will be recruited from CF&#xD;
      clinics in Australia and New Zealand and treated from 3 months to three years of age. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the proportion with radiologically-defined bronchiectasis at 3 years&#xD;
      of age. Safety and mechanistic evaluations will also be undertaken.&#xD;

      SYNOPSIS OF PROTOCOL&#xD;

&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Participants who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for&#xD;
      enrolment as study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children of either sex with a diagnosis of CF following detection via New Born Screening&#xD;
           (NBS) for cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to comply with the&#xD;
           protocol for its duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written informed consent signed and dated by parent/legal guardian according to local&#xD;
           regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Participants who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrolment&#xD;
      as trial participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Born &lt;30 weeks gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prolonged mechanical ventilation in the first 3 months of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participation in another randomized controlled trial within the 3 months preceding&#xD;
           inclusion in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A significant medical disease or condition other than CF that is likely to interfere&#xD;
           with the child's ability to complete the entire protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Previous major surgery except for meconium ileus&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Macrolide hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Description ZITHROMAXÂ® (azithromycin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures The study participants will be stratified by investigational site and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either azithromycin or placebo for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Participants will be randomized in blocks to the treatment group&#xD;
      or the placebo group using a one-to-one ratio. Randomization will be stratified by study&#xD;
      site. This will ensure an approximately equal allocation to each group within each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analyses Interim analyses will occur when the first 50% of children (n=33 per group&#xD;
      have completed the 12 month CT and when all subjects have completed the 12 month CT. Interim&#xD;
      analyses will determine safety or success (unethical to continue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules Study enrolment may be stopped if any of the following events occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death of a participant that is related to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial meets the definition of futility or success at either of the planned interim&#xD;
           analyses&#xD;
