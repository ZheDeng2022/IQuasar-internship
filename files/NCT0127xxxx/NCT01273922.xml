  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is a first-in-human Phase 1 study&#xD;
      using two dose levels of an investigational vaccine directed against S. aureus and Candida.&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine, NDV-3&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies in mice have established that several members of the Als family of&#xD;
      proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following&#xD;
      challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S. aureus. Als3 (the antigen in the&#xD;
      NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in&#xD;
      protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S. aureus. This Phase I study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two doses administered 6 months apart of NDV-3&#xD;
      vaccine at two dose levels. At least 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study in two groups&#xD;
      of approximately 20 subjects each. Each group will be randomized so that 15 will receive&#xD;
      NDV-3 vaccine and 5 will receive placebo. All injections will be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly. One group will receive a low dose of NDV-3 and the other a ten-fold higher&#xD;
      dose. Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the safety, tolerability and immune&#xD;
      responses at days 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 after the first vaccination to compare to baseline&#xD;
      levels and at days 7, 14 and 90 after the second vaccination.&#xD;

             and sign the informed consent document prior to screening. The informed consent&#xD;
             document will be written in English, therefore the subject must have the ability to&#xD;
             read and communicate in English.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. No clinically significant deviation from normal as judged by the investigator(s) in&#xD;
             the medical history, physical examination (including but may not be limited to an&#xD;
             evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous&#xD;
             systems), vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory&#xD;
