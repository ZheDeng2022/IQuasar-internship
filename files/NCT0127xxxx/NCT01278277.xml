  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general area of research in which this project has been designed is that of retinal&#xD;
      degeneration related to mutations in the ABCR gene, responsible of Stargardt disease/fundus&#xD;
      flavimaculatus retinal dystrophy (STD/FF). STG/FF is one of the major causes of vision&#xD;
      impairment in the young age. STG/FF originates typically from the dysfunction and loss of&#xD;
      cone and rod photoreceptors, developing through a photo-oxidative mechanism. The major&#xD;
      disease locus is the central retina, i.e. the macula, whose neurons have the highest density&#xD;
      and underlie critical functions such as visual acuity, color vision and contrast sensitivity.&#xD;
      There is currently no cure for STG/FF. Recent experimental findings indicate that Saffron,&#xD;
      derived from the pistils of Crocus Sativus, may have a role as a retinal neuro-protectant&#xD;
      against oxidative damage. The stigmata of Crocus sativus contain biologically high&#xD;
      concentrations of chemical compounds including crocin, crocetin, whose multiple C=C bonds&#xD;
      provide the antioxidant potential. In addition it is well known that this compound is safe&#xD;
      and free of adverse side effects. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of&#xD;
      short-term Saffron supplementation on retinal function in STG/FF patients carrying ABCR&#xD;
      mutations. The macular cone-mediated electroretinogram (ERG) in response to high-frequency&#xD;
      flicker (focal flicker ERG) will be employed as the main outcome variable. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      variable will be the psychophysical cone system recovery after bleaching.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research Plan Background Stargardt disease (STGD/FFM) is the most common hereditary recessive&#xD;
      macular dystrophy (Blacharski, 1988) characterized by juvenile to young adult onset, central&#xD;
      visual impairment, progressive bilateral atrophy of the macula and retinal pigment epithelium&#xD;
      (RPE), with a frequent appearance of orange/yellow flecks distributed around the macula&#xD;
      and/or the mid retinal periphery (Noble and Carr, 1971). A clinically similar retinal&#xD;
      disorder, fundus flavimaculatus (FFM), often displays later ages of onset and slower&#xD;
      progression. It has been suggested and demonstrated (Allikmets et al., 1997) that STGD and&#xD;
      FFM represent allelic disorders. Mutations in the gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)&#xD;
      transporter (ABCR), mapping to chromosome 1p13-p21, have been found to be responsible of STGD&#xD;
      (Allikmets et al., 1997). The ABCR gene is expressed exclusively and at high levels in the&#xD;
      retina, in both rod and cone photoreceptors (Molday et al., 2000). A recent study by Weng et&#xD;
      al. (1999) , investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in&#xD;
      ABCR knock-out mice, proposed that photoreceptors die as a consequence of 'poisoning' of the&#xD;
      RPE by lipofuscin accumulation and loss of the RPE support role. Accumulation within the RPE&#xD;
      cells of a compound, A2E, forming from condensation of phosphatydilethanlolamine and the&#xD;
      all-trans-retinal released from photoactivated rhodopsin (Sparrow et al., 2000), probably&#xD;
      leads in vivo to an increased absorption of blue lights and to phototoxic RPE cell damage.&#xD;
      The mutation-induced disease may affect both rod and cone photoreceptors, at relatively early&#xD;
      stages. In vitro studies (Sun and Nathans, 2001) also demonstrated that the ABCR itself is an&#xD;
      efficient target of all-trans-retinal-mediated photooxidative damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, many reports have documented an abnormal functioning of both macular and&#xD;
      peripheral cones, as well as rods, in STGD/FFM (Moloney et al., 1983; Lachapelle et al.,&#xD;
      1990). There is also evidence (Lois et al., 2001) that STGD/FFM may be associated with&#xD;
      different patterns of retinal dysfunction, with a selective involvement of macular function,&#xD;
      or more widespread dysfunction involving cone and/or rod function, showing intrafamilial&#xD;
      consistency. Characteristic abnormalities of dark adaptation (Aleman et al., 1999), involving&#xD;
      a delayed post-bleach recovery, to the baseline sensitivity, of the last branch of the&#xD;
      adaptation curve have been also described. Similar abnormalities in rod dark adaptation have&#xD;
      been recently found in a mice heterozygous for a null mutation in the ABCR gene (Mata et al.,&#xD;
      2001). Clinical evidence (Parisi et al., 2002) indicates that also the recovery of cone&#xD;
      sensitivity after bleaching is severely impaired in STG/FF, suggesting that profoundly&#xD;
      altered retinoid recycling, leading to photoxidative damage, specifically occurs in cone&#xD;
      photoreceptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experimental findings (Maccarone et al., 2008) indicate that Saffron, derived from the&#xD;
      pistils of Crocus Sativus, may have a role as a retinal neuro-protectant against oxidative&#xD;
      damage. Indeed, Saffron has been shown to be protective, for both morphology and function, in&#xD;
      a rat model of light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. In this model, cell death is thought&#xD;
      to result from oxidative stress induced by prolonged increase in oxygen tension and&#xD;
      photooxidation. Saffron is an attractive candidate to be tested because the stigmata of&#xD;
      Crocus sativus contain biologically high concentrations of interesting chemical compounds&#xD;
      including crocin, crocetin (Giaccio, 2004), whose multiple C=C bonds give the antioxidant&#xD;
      potential. Not to mention that its centuries-long use as spice, with no known ill effects&#xD;
      increases the confidence in secure applicability. In addition it has been recently reported&#xD;
      (Ochiai et al., 2007) that crocins are able to activate metabolic pathways to protect cells&#xD;
      from apoptosis and to reduce light induced death in isolated photoreceptors (Laabich et al.,&#xD;
      2006) , while crocetin (Giaccio, 2004) increases oxygen diffusivity through liquids, such as&#xD;
      plasma. Considering the high metabolic rate of photoreceptors, the availability of oxygen may&#xD;
      be a critical factor in protecting them from death. In addition, Kanakis et al. (Kanakis et&#xD;
      al, 2007) showed that metabolites of antioxidant flavonoids bind directly to DNA and induce&#xD;
      its partial conformation to beta-DNA, thereby protecting the cell from damage. Based on these&#xD;
      observation it comes clear that Saffron extract does not act as a simple antioxidant. The&#xD;
      peculiar characteristics of Saffron components support the hypothesis of an involvement of&#xD;
      very different ways of action going from antioxidant activity to direct control of gene&#xD;
      expression. These components may act in humans as protective agents against oxidative damage&#xD;
      for the ageing retina, and may repair early photoreceptor damage associated with STG/FF,&#xD;
      whose disease patho-physiology has been linked by experimental studies (Mata et al, 2001) to&#xD;
      light-induced oxidative damage to the outer retina. In STG/FF eyes, at early disease stages,&#xD;
      the normal number of cone photoreceptors is partially retained, although the cells might be&#xD;
      dysfunctional. As a result of the rescuing effects of Saffron, the pool of damaged but viable&#xD;
      photoreceptors could increase its response, resulting in improved retinal sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present project is to evaluate whether Saffron supplementation has a&#xD;
      beneficial neuro-protective effect for the damaged retinas as consequence of ABCR&#xD;
      mutation-STD/FF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Protocol Patients A group of 30 STG/FF patients (14 males, 16 females, age range:&#xD;
      15-68 years) will be included in this study. Patients will meet the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1. Macular and peripheral retinal degeneration with typical funduscopic lesions&#xD;
      (retinal flecks) and a cone-rod pattern of retinal dysfunction, as determined by standard&#xD;
      Ganzfeld electroretinography and dark-adapted fundus perimetry, and classic fundus&#xD;
      appearance, 2. Relatively preserved central retinal function (visual field by Goldmann V/4e &gt;&#xD;
      30°, corrected EDTRS visual acuity &gt; 20/80) and stable central fixation as determined by a&#xD;
      Visuskope, 3. Known genotype or genotype under study, 4. At least four follow-up clinical&#xD;
      examination over the past three years, 5. No or minimal ocular media opacities, 6. No&#xD;
      concomitant ocular (e.g. glaucoma, amblyopia) or systemic diseases. Informed consent for all&#xD;
      patients and controls will be obtained after the aims and procedures of the study will be&#xD;
      explained in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Testing Schedule The patients will be divided into two groups: 15 will treated&#xD;
      with oral supplementation of a daily dose of Saffron for 90 days, and 15 will undergo placebo&#xD;
      treatment during the same period. At the end of a 90 days period the patients will be&#xD;
      crossed-over and assigned respectively to placebo or Saffron supplementation. In all&#xD;
      patients, clinical examination, including visual acuity testing with a calibrated standard&#xD;
      Snellen chart and fundus examination by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, and FERG testing&#xD;
      will be performed at the study entry (baseline) and after 180 days of treatment or placebo.&#xD;
      In all cases, compliance will be judged by telephone interview and pill counts. Adverse side&#xD;
      effects will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiological Methods FERG testing will be performed according to a previously&#xD;
      published technique (Falsini et al., 2000). Briefly, ERGs will be elicited by the&#xD;
      LED-generated sinusoidal luminance modulation of a circular uniform field (18° in diameter,&#xD;
      80 cd/m2 mean luminance, dominant wavelength: 630 nm), presented at the frequency of 41 Hz on&#xD;
      the rear of a ganzfeld bowl, illuminated at the same mean luminance as the stimulus. A series&#xD;
      of FERG responses will be collected at different modulation depths [quantified by the&#xD;
      Michelson luminance contrast formula: 100%*(Lmax -Lmin)/(Lmax +Lmin), where Lmax and Lmin are&#xD;
      maximum and minimum luminance, respectively] between 16.5% and 93.8% in 0.1 to 0.3 log unit&#xD;
      steps. FERG signals will be acquired in sequence for six values of modulation depth between&#xD;
      16.5 to 93.5%, presented in an increasing order. For each patient FERG log amplitudes will be&#xD;
      plotted as a function of log modulation depth. The resulting function's slope will be&#xD;
      determined by a linear regression. From the same regression line, FERG threshold will be&#xD;
      estimated from the value of log modulation depth yielding a criterion amplitude,&#xD;
      corresponding to a S/N ratio of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysics An increment threshold technique will be used to evaluate the recovery of cone&#xD;
      system sensitivity after bleaching exposure. Psychophysical threshold will be determined at&#xD;
      the paracentral visual field locations with preserved visual sensitivity, by presenting a 0.5&#xD;
      sec flashing light on a light adapting background of 20 cd/sqm. Following baseline&#xD;
      assessment, the threshold intensity for the flashed light will be measured and plotted as a&#xD;
      function of time, following 30 sec exposure to an adapting light (delivered in Maxwellian&#xD;
      view by means of a calibrated indirect ophthalmoscope) whose intensity is estimated bleach&#xD;
      approx 30% of the cone photopigment. The resulting dynamic recovery function, fitted by an&#xD;
      exponential function, describes the sensitivity recovery of the photopic system following&#xD;
      bleaching, and reflects either the rate of free opsin inactivation or photopigment synthesis.&#xD;
      A computer-controlled system, employing a commercially available apparatus, has been&#xD;
      developed (Fadda et al., 2001) for measuring bleaching adaptation of the cone system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Sample size estimates of patients for this study will be based on&#xD;
      previous investigations (Parisi et al., 2001) where the between- and within-subjects&#xD;
      variability (expressed as data SD) of FERG parameters was determined in STG/FF patients.&#xD;
      Assuming between- and within-subjects SDs in FERG amplitude and phase of 0.1 logmicroV and 20&#xD;
      degrees, respectively, the sample sizes of patients assigned to both Saffron and placebo&#xD;
      provide a power of 80%, at an alpha = 0.05, for detecting in each group a test-retest&#xD;
      difference (i.e. 90 days minus baseline test) of 0.1 logmicroV (SD: 0.1) and 30 degrees (SD:&#xD;
      20) in amplitude and phase, respectively. Results will be analyzed by multivariate statistics&#xD;
      (multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures, MANOVA). In all the analyses a p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
