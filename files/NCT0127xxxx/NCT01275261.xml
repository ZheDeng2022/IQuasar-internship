  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bladder catheterization can be safely&#xD;
      avoided in patients admitted to the hospital with stroke using a nursing protocol, and&#xD;
      whether this decreases the incidence of urinary tract infections. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the protocol will be tolerated by nurses and patients, and that patients&#xD;
      without bladder catheters will have fewer urinary tract infections and better outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical complications, both minor and serious, play a large role in post-stroke management&#xD;
      and outcome. Infection, especially pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTI), is one of&#xD;
      the most common medical complications of stroke. In addition, immunosuppression secondary to&#xD;
      stroke may increase the risk of infection after stroke, and fever secondary to infection may&#xD;
      result in poor outcomes. UTIs occur in 3 to 16% of patients within the first week to month&#xD;
      after a cerebrovascular event. Compared with patients who do not develop post-stroke UTIs,&#xD;
      those who do have a UTI have poorer outcomes; such patients have an approximately 3-fold&#xD;
      increased odds of a higher mRS, and a 4.5-fold higher odds for the combined endpoint of death&#xD;
      or disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 15% and 25% of all hospitalized patients receive short-term indwelling urinary&#xD;
      catheters, often unnecessarily. In the general medical population, the risk of UTI ranges&#xD;
      from 3%-10% per day of catheterization, and approaches 100% after 30 continuous days.&#xD;
      Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is the second most commonly reported healthcare-associated&#xD;
      infection in acute care hospitals, accounting for approximately one-third of all infections&#xD;
      reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2006-2007, and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      secondary nosocomial bloodstream infections. CAUTIs have been estimated to cost $589 to $758&#xD;
      per infection, and between 17 and 69% may be preventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently released draft guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) for prevention of CAUTI suggest appropriate indications for indwelling urethral&#xD;
      catheter use, including acute urinary retention or obstruction, need for accurate&#xD;
      measurements of urinary output in critically ill patients, and prolonged immobilization, but&#xD;
      an estimated 20 to 50% of hospitalized patients have urinary catheters placed without clear&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pilot RCT to determine the tolerability and efficacy of a protocol to avoid&#xD;
      catheter placement in patients admitted to the UCSF neurovascular service with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. There are two study arms: a usual care control group will&#xD;
      have catheter placement on admission, and the intervention group will not have a catheter&#xD;
      placed on admission. The intervention arm will be treated using a protocol, developed with a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team, and instituted by nurses to avoid the need for catheter placement.&#xD;
      The sample will be followed during hospital admission, with the main outcome measures being&#xD;
      the tolerability of the protocol by the nursing staff, patient comfort and the incidence of&#xD;
      UTI during hospitalization. The subjects will be followed during their hospitalization and a&#xD;
      follow-up telephone call will be made to them at 90-days post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that limiting the use of Foley catheters to the medical indications noted in&#xD;
      the CDC guidelines, which is not current standard practice, will decrease the number of&#xD;
      catheters placed, and thereby reduce the number of UTIs in stroke patients. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      of this study is to improve clinical outcomes, decrease hospital length of stay, cost of&#xD;
      care, and time to rehabilitation among patients who suffer a stroke.&#xD;
