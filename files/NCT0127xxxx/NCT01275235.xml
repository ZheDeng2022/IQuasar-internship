  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are known to be at&#xD;
      greater risk for the disease, and studies have shown that how the body responds to insulin,&#xD;
      how the muscle creates energy, and the amount of fat stored inside skeletal muscle are often&#xD;
      different in these individuals at a young age compared to people without a family history of&#xD;
      the disease. The tendency to develop T2DM is influenced strongly by genetics; however,&#xD;
      exposure to the surrounding environment may also play a role. The exposure to a diabetic&#xD;
      environment while in the womb represents an altered nutritional exposure (high levels of&#xD;
      circulating sugar, or glucose) that may affect how tissues important in regulating energy&#xD;
      metabolism, such as the pancreas, liver, and skeletal muscle, develop. the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to measure sensitivity to insulin, energy expenditure, fat content of the abdomen&#xD;
      and skeletal muscle function in young adult sibling pairs who were raised together but who&#xD;
      are discordant for intrauterine exposure to diabetes (i.e., the mother did ot have diabetes&#xD;
      during pregnancy with the older sibling, but did have diabetes during pregnancy with the&#xD;
      younger sibling).&#xD;

      A one-time testing comprising of 2 days (32 consecutive hours). A medical history and&#xD;
      physical including questions about medications, health status and symptoms are acquired at&#xD;
      the fasting screening visit. Both siblings must meet all study eligibility requirements to be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. If enrolled for the 2 days, you will be in a metabolic chamber, dual&#xD;
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, biopsy, oral glucose tolerance test, and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic chamber is a room is a sophisticated system that allows your oxygen / carbon&#xD;
           dioxide exchange to be measured, thereby showing the number of calories you are burning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA is a scan that measure the amount of bone, muscle, and fat in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy is a procedure to sample muscle cells from underneath the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OGTT is Oral Glucose Tolerance Test from an IV line for blood samples once you drink a&#xD;
           sugar solution consisting of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan is to measure the amount of fat in your abdomen around the organs and&#xD;
           underneath the skin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You are one of a sibling pair with the same mother and father, and your mother had&#xD;
             diabetes (gestational or type 2) while she was pregnant with the younger sibling but&#xD;
             not the older sibling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Your sibling is willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You are between the ages of 20 and 34 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Your body mass index is between 20 and 29 Kg/m2 inclusive (this is a number calculated&#xD;
             for your height and weight and indicates that you are either normal weight or&#xD;
             overweight, but not obese).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You are healthy as assessed by medical history and standard physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You are weight stable (your body weight has not changed .6.5 lbs over the last 3&#xD;
             months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You do not smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You are willing to stay overnight one time at the Pennington Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  You have low physical activity (&lt; 100 min of exercise per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
