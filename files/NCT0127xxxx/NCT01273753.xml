    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of exercise during dialysis using&#xD;
      objective measures of fluid status determination, specifically bioimpedance analysis (BIA)&#xD;
      and blood volume monitoring (BVM). We hypothesize that exercise during dialysis will be&#xD;
      associated with more stable blood pressures and that this will be reflected in different&#xD;
      output from BIA and BVM monitoring.&#xD;

      Achieving dry weight (DW) is essential for the optimal health of dialysis patients. Despite&#xD;
      being one of the most basic and important factors in the management of hemodialysis patients,&#xD;
      there are many obstacles to achieving DW. One problem underlying optimal fluid status&#xD;
      management lies in the clinical assessment used to determine DW. The current standard is&#xD;
      clinical judgment which is often reactive (ie. setting a weight below which the patient&#xD;
      develops hypotension or cramping) instead of goal directed (ie. trying to achieve defined&#xD;
      target measures). Moreover, DW is a dynamic parameter that changes in patients over time, and&#xD;
      ongoing assessment remains reactive to changes in clinical status instead of proactively&#xD;
      based on monitoring of validated measures. A primary impediment to achieving DW is the&#xD;
      relatively short time during dialysis limiting vascular refilling and leading to&#xD;
      complications of hypotension and other adverse sequelae of relatively rapid volume removal.&#xD;
      The evaluation of interventions aimed at improving symptoms and preventing complications will&#xD;
      be scientifically strengthened by objective assessment of the patient's volume. Fortunately&#xD;
      two objective clinically validated tools to assess volume status have emerged: bioimpedance&#xD;
      (BIA) which allows assessment of the patient's hydration status and blood volume monitoring&#xD;
      (BVM) which allows direct measure of the rate of vascular refilling during dialysis. These&#xD;
      will be essential in understanding the impact of therapeutic interventions directed at&#xD;
      improving achievement of DW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next important consideration is selecting an intervention that shows promise in assisting&#xD;
      patients in achieving DW. While many interventions deserve careful analysis we select&#xD;
      exercise because of the additional cardiovascular benefits of exercise, and it fits into our&#xD;
      outpatient program as part of achieving our overall outpatient wellness objectives. To this&#xD;
      end we propose the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: Systematically evaluate the effects of exercise on hemodynamic stability and&#xD;
      achievement of dry weight by testing the following hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Exercise bike riding during dialysis improves vascular refilling as determined&#xD;
      by BVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Exercise bike riding during dialysis improves (leads to a reduction in) tissue&#xD;
      hydration status as determined by BIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Improved intra-dialytic blood pressure stability is directly related to&#xD;
      improved vascular refilling as assessed by BVM, which is in turn related to improved&#xD;
      (reduced) tissue hydration as assessed by BIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Intravascular refilling (assessed by BVM) is directly related to reduction in&#xD;
      tissue hydration (assess by BIA).&#xD;
