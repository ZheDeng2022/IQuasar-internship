  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug abatacept and see what&#xD;
      effects (good and bad) it has in patients with relapsing polychondritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, patients who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will receive open-label subcutaneous abatacept consisting of 125 mg weekly,&#xD;
      beginning 1 week thru Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, blood will be collected for clinical laboratory safety,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and biomarkers. Disease activity assessments will include laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation of acute phase reactants, pulmonary function testing, computed tomography of the&#xD;
      neck and chest, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, audiogram, physician assessment of&#xD;
      chondritis activity, swollen and tender joint counts, and patient- and physican-reported&#xD;
      outcomes. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
