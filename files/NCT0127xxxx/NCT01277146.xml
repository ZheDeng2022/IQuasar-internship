  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1 dose escalation study of OMP-59R5 in subjects with previously&#xD;
      treated solid tumors for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy and no therapy&#xD;
      with a demonstrated survival benefit. Up to 44 subjects will be enrolled at up to 2 centers.&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and&#xD;
      efficacy. No formal interim analyses will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to determine study eligibility. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment, subjects will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of OMP-59R5 at a assigned dosing&#xD;
      schedule for 56 days. After 56 days, subjects will be assessed for disease status. If there&#xD;
      is no evidence of disease progression or if the tumor is smaller, then subjects may continue&#xD;
      to receive IV infusions of OMP-59R5 every week until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). No dose&#xD;
      escalation or reduction will be allowed within a dose cohort. The first 2 subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in a cohort will not be treated on the same day. The dose may be administered at any time&#xD;
      during the day. Three subjects will be treated at each dose level if no dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) are observed. The first 2 subjects in each cohort will not be started on&#xD;
      OMP-59R5 on the same day. If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, that dose level will be&#xD;
      expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, no further subjects will be&#xD;
      dosed at that level and 3 additional subjects will be added to the preceding dose cohort&#xD;
      unless 6 subjects have already been treated at that dose level. Subjects will be assessed for&#xD;
      DLTs from the time of the first dose through 28 days. Dose escalation for newly enrolled&#xD;
      subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a cohort have completed their Day&#xD;
      28 DLT assessment. Subjects with stable disease or a response at Day 56 will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue to receive weekly doses of OMP-59R5 until disease progression. An additional 14&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at the highest dose level that result in &lt;2 of the 6 subjects&#xD;
      experiencing a DLT.&#xD;
