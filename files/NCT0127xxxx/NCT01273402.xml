    <textblock>
      This study is being done to select an appropriate TF2 bsMAb dose suitable for pretargeting&#xD;
      the 111In/90Y-labeled hapten-peptide (IMP-288). Eligible patients will receive a fixed dose&#xD;
      of 90Y-IMP-288 4 days after the TF2 antibody injection. Two different dose levels of TF2 will&#xD;
      be studied in the first part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an appropriate TF2 dose is selected based on information learned from the first 2 dose&#xD;
      levels, patients will be enrolled onto several different increasing dose levels of&#xD;
      90Y-IMP-288.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients, &gt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  documented histologic or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic (Stage IV) colorectal&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must have at least one confirmed and measurable tumor lesion (a confirmed tumor site&#xD;
             is one in which either biopsy-proven evidence of disease or progressive growth has&#xD;
             been radiographically observed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70% (or equivalent ECOG 0-1)&#xD;
             and an expected survival of ≥ 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who previously received a chimeric, CDR-grafted (humanized), or human IgG&#xD;
             will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate no significant&#xD;
             anti-antibody reactivity with TF2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematologic parameters: WBC counts must be ≥ 3000/mm3, granulocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1500/mm3, and platelets ≥ 100,000/m3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-hematologic parameters: Patients without liver metastases must have bilirubin ≤&#xD;
             1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), whereas bilirubin in patients with&#xD;
             known liver metastases must be &lt;2.5-times the IULN. AST/ALT must not be &gt;2.5 times&#xD;
             IULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed consent must&#xD;
             be obtained prior to baseline studies for enrollment purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men&#xD;
             will be informed as to the potential risk of procreation while participating in this&#xD;
             trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a&#xD;
             period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with plasma CEA &gt;1000 ng/mL or lesions exceeding 10 cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe anorexia or other gastrointestinal-related symptomatology (e.g.,&#xD;
             nausea, vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV or hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active second primary malignancy at the time of study entry, with the&#xD;
             exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known metastatic disease to the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of bone marrow metastases. Screening only required for patients&#xD;
             with suspicion of metastases. Patients with ≥ 25% bone marrow involvement are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Institutionalized subjects (e.g., prisons, psychiatric facilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of active coronary artery disease, unstable angina, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, or congestive heart failure present within 6 months or cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             requiring anti-arrhythmia therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known autoimmune disease or presence of autoimmune phenomena (except rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis requiring only low dose maintenance corticosteroids); or infection requiring&#xD;
             intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of active COPD, or other moderate-to-severe respiratory illness present&#xD;
             within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are diabetic and/or have high blood pressure are at a higher risk for&#xD;
             developing late-stage renal failure. While these patients will not be specifically&#xD;
             excluded, physician-investigators must carefully discuss the associated late risks to&#xD;
             these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond prior chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy to&#xD;
             an index lesion, or experimental therapy (i.e., drugs, biologicals, procedures) and&#xD;
             meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received a treatment containing a nitrosourea compound will not be&#xD;
             enrolled for at least 6 weeks after the end of that treatment.&#xD;
