      A prospective, three-center, phase I safety and tolerability dose escalation study,&#xD;
      evaluating 28 subjects in 4 discrete dose cohorts of acute intracoronary injected collagenase&#xD;
      ranging from 300 - 1200 µg prior to routine standard-of-care percutaneous revascularization&#xD;
      procedures in subjects with chronic total coronary artery occlusions (CTOs).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrolment is expected to occur over 24 months with total study duration of approximately 30&#xD;
      months. Five (5) subjects will be enrolled into each dose cohort. The dose cohorts will be&#xD;
      studied in a sequential fashion, starting with the lowest doses and escalating to the highest&#xD;
      doses. It is anticipated that each subject's involvement with the study will be 3.5 months.&#xD;
      In addition, eight (8) subjects will be included in the highest dose cohort to collect&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject enrollment and dosing within each dose cohort will be staged such that the next&#xD;
      subsequent subject will not be dosed until the previous subject has been successfully&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital after the angioplasty attempt. At a minimum there will be 3 days&#xD;
      in between each subject dosing to ensure product safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no advancement to the higher dose cohort until all 5 subjects have been&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital and a safety review is conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board (DSMB) on the cardiac safety measures and the treatment deemed safe to proceed to the&#xD;
      next dosing level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 28 male and / or female subjects suffering from CAD with a CTO will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study at three sites (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and St. Michael's Hospital,&#xD;
      Toronto, Ontario, and and Laval Hospital Research Centre, Quebec City, Quebec,Canada). All&#xD;
      subjects will have had one or more previous failed angioplasty attempt(s) of the occluded&#xD;
      artery. Subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF) and meeting all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and having none of the exclusion criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will be included in&#xD;
      the study. All potentially enrollable subjects at Sunnybrook will be reviewed by either of&#xD;
      two cardiologist not involved in the study to discuss the available options for the subject&#xD;
      and to approve enrollment decisions. Eligible subjects that agree to participate will be&#xD;
      treated in a two part procedure. On Day0 using standard angioplasty techniques to access the&#xD;
      specified occluded coronary artery, Collagenase (MZ-004) will be directly injected into the&#xD;
      occluded artery through a microcatheter that has been positioned immediately adjacent to or&#xD;
      into the proximal cap of the occlusion. The catheters and arterial sheath will then be&#xD;
      removed and the subject will be monitored overnight on the ward. The following day (Day1),&#xD;
      the subject will be brought back to the catheterization laboratory and undergo an angioplasty&#xD;
      using standard angioplasty techniques. Routine post-procedural management will then be&#xD;
      followed. The subject will be discharged on Day2 in the absence of any cardiac complications&#xD;
      (such as elevated cardiac enzymes or large pericardial effusion as judged by the Investigator&#xD;
      and determined by echocardiography). Prior to the angioplasty procedure on Day1 and again on&#xD;
      Day2 prior to discharge, the subject will undergo an echocardiogram to determine the presence&#xD;
      and severity of a pericardial effusion. A moderate or large pericardial effusion or any sign&#xD;
      of tamponade on Day1 will be a contraindication to performing the procedure, and the subject&#xD;
      will be terminated from the study. A telephone follow-up will be performed 30 days post Day1&#xD;
      in all subjects who have signed an ICF and been enrolled in the study. At 3 months, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo an outpatient coronary Computer Tomography (CT) angiogram to ensure there are no&#xD;
      delayed effects on the treated vessel (e.g. aneurysm formation), the myocardium or the&#xD;
      pericardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of acute intracoronary doses&#xD;
      of collagenase (MZ-004) in symptomatic subjects with coronary CTO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to obtain preliminary efficacy information of guidewire crossing&#xD;
      with increasing doses of intracoronary collagenase in subjects with previously failed at&#xD;
      least one previous attempt in coronary CTO.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to provide an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the study procedures and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is 35 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are non-reproductive, or reproductive women who are willing and able to&#xD;
             practice effective birth control methods. A urine pregnancy test should be done at the&#xD;
             screening/Day0 on all reproductive women of child bearing ability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with CTO (older than 6 weeks or unknown duration based on the investigator's&#xD;
             assessment of appropriateness for the study) with a clinical indication for&#xD;
             revascularization. In subjects with occlusions of unknown duration, there must be&#xD;
             absence of any identifiable ischemic event in the 6 weeks prior to enrolment in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 previously failed attempt to cross the CTO&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of pericardial effusion on 2D Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for this study who meet any of the following criteria at the time of the&#xD;
        screening visit are NOT eligible to be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Culprit vessel is a saphenous vein graft occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  True ostial LAD, LCX or RCA occlusions (since collagenase delivery will be unreliable)&#xD;

             the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major side branch (1.5 mm diameter) within 3 mm proximal to the occlusion. (This is to&#xD;
             prevent the infusate being diverted through a side branch and to prevent ischemia&#xD;
             during the prolonged period of time during the infusion)&#xD;

          -  Severe calcification (collagenase can not degrade calcium) based on consensus of 2&#xD;
             interventional cardiologists after review of coronary angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any medical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator and/or&#xD;
             designee makes the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a pregnant or lactating female (women of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative serum beta-HCG within 24 hours prior to the inclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is or has been partaking in another investigational product clinical study&#xD;
             within 30 days of Screening/Day0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with bleeding abnormalities (e.g. Factor VIII deficiency) and /or subjects&#xD;
             that have experienced any medically documented active site of bleeding within 30 days&#xD;
             of the screening visit, such as, but not limited to, the gastrointestinal or&#xD;
             genitourinary tract or intercerebral hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (&lt; 4 weeks). For those patients who&#xD;
             had ACS ≥ 4weeks ago, only the non-culprit vessel from the recent ACS can be&#xD;
             considered eligible for this study if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria have&#xD;
             been met.&#xD;
