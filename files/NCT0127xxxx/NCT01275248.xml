      This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of two doses of ondansetron (0.5 mg and 0.75&#xD;
      mg) relative to placebo when administered twice daily as adjunctive therapy for adult&#xD;
      patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) who have not adequately responded to&#xD;
      treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sufficient number of patients will be screened to obtain approximately 150 patients&#xD;
      randomized to the double-blind portion of the study. This study will consist of at least 6&#xD;
      weeks of retrospectively documented SRI treatment (prior to screening), 6 weeks of&#xD;
      prospective SRI treatment after screening (run-in) but prior to randomization, and 12 weeks&#xD;
      of double-blind treatment with study drug (ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day, ondansetron 0.75&#xD;
      mg twice a day or placebo twice a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have been maintained on a single SRI at the same dose throughout the&#xD;
      retrospective 6-week period and will continue the same SRI at the same dose throughout the&#xD;
      run-in and double-blind treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will be the&#xD;
      &quot;core period&quot; for purposes of efficacy and short-term safety assessment. Patients completing&#xD;
      all 12 weeks of the core period will be offered an opportunity to participate in an&#xD;
      &quot;extension period&quot; where they will continue to receive treatment for up to 30 months&#xD;
      following the core period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment in the extension period will be as follows: responders will continue on&#xD;
      the same double-blind treatment to which they were assigned in the core period (ondansetron&#xD;
      0.5 mg twice a day, ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day, or placebo twice a day); non-responders&#xD;
      will be reassigned to continuing treatment according to their prior treatment assignment in&#xD;
      the core period (those who received placebo will be assigned to ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a&#xD;
      day, those who received ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day will be assigned to ondansetron 0.75&#xD;
      mg twice a day, and those who received ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day will continue&#xD;
      receiving ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day). Patients will receive treatment under&#xD;
      double-blind conditions (double-blind phase of the extension study) until the core study is&#xD;
      completed and the safety and efficacy of an ondansetron dose has been confirmed&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after the core study data analysis, no treatment differences are found between ondansetron&#xD;
      and placebo in the primary efficacy variable, the extension study will be terminated. If the&#xD;
      core study results are positive for the primary efficacy endpoint and safety endpoints, then&#xD;
      patients participating in the double-blind phase of the extension study will be offered an&#xD;
      opportunity to continue treatment under open-label conditions with the dose deemed&#xD;
      efficacious and safe (open-label phase of the extension study). A Data Review Committee will&#xD;
      be responsible for reviewing the core study analysis results, providing a dose recommendation&#xD;
      for the open-label phase of the extension study, and for communicating the results and their&#xD;
      recommendation to the participating institutional review boards/ethics committees (IRBs/ECs)&#xD;
      and investigators. Patients may continue receiving treatment for up to 30 months or until the&#xD;
      sponsor provides an alternative.&#xD;

             reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may only be considered after consultation with the medical&#xD;
             monitor. Failure is defined as inadequate response, in the judgment of the treating&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Taking any antidepressant drugs (including St. John's Wort), at the time of screening&#xD;
