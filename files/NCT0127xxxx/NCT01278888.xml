      Is thoracoscopic surgery better than traditional open surgery for lung cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer (VATS) is presumed to be less traumatic&#xD;
      than traditional open surgery for lung cancer but this has never been documented in a&#xD;
      randomized trial. Some surgeons hesitate to use VATS because it is technically more&#xD;
      demanding, others question if the two methods are oncologically equal. Regardless, VATS has&#xD;
      been implemented as a routine method for lung cancer surgery several places around the world&#xD;
      including Odense University Hospital. The investigators have launched the first randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in the world comparing the two surgical methods to investigate any&#xD;
      differences in length of hospitalization, postoperative pain, life quality within the first&#xD;
      year, and health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators include patients with stage I and II lung cancer, and randomize between&#xD;
      VATS and open surgery in a design where both the patient and doctors doing general rounds in&#xD;
      the ward are blinded until discharge because the dressing on the surgical wound is identical,&#xD;
      regardless of the surgical method. The surgeon cannot influence clinical decisions including&#xD;
      time to discharge, which is decided by other specialist surgeons. Pain evaluation is&#xD;
      performed 6 times daily using the VAS-score, life quality is evaluated continuously during&#xD;
      the first 12 months using EQ5D and EORTC QLQC-30 questionnaires, and the consumption of&#xD;
      analgetics in both groups are monitored via the national prescription database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to this trial a similar clinical study, which is also the first of its kind in the&#xD;
      world, has been launched for patients with lung cancers not eligible for VATS. They are&#xD;
      randomized between the two traditional open surgical methods (anterolateral and&#xD;
      posterolateral thoracotomy) - this is also blinded to both patient and doctors doing rounds&#xD;
      until discharge from hospital, and endpoint are similar in the two studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      206 patients have been randomized in the first substudy (VATS vs. open) and 88 in the second&#xD;
      substudy (posterolateral vs. anterolateral).&#xD;

      Is minimally invasive surgery for non small cell lung cancer better than traditional open&#xD;
      surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection remains the best treatment for non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC),but&#xD;
      unfortunately many patients suffer major postoperative morbidity - pain being the most&#xD;
      frequent. It is assumed that newer minimally invasive surgical techniques (Video Assisted&#xD;
      Thoracoscopic Surgery - VATS) reduces postoperative morbidity but there is no level 1&#xD;
      evidence available in the literature. This prompted us to perform the present ongoing study,&#xD;
      which is the first of its kind in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compare VATS with traditional open surgery for early stage lung cancer in a&#xD;
      clinical randomized double blinded trial. Our aims are to evaluate differences in&#xD;
      postoperative pain, life quality, and health economical aspects. The results of this trial&#xD;
      could influence future surgical decisionmaking internationally on the surgical treatment for&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, in patients with larger tumours of the lung, which are not suitable for minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery, different techniques are available. The most widely used techniques are the&#xD;
      posterolateral thoracotomy and the anterolateral thoracotomy. So far no randomized controlled&#xD;
      trail has shown which of these techniques to be superior. This has led us to also randomize&#xD;
      between anterolateral and the posterolateral thoracotomy (muscle sparing). The same endpoints&#xD;
      are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain following lung surgery has been a much discussed topic for a long time in the field of&#xD;
      thoracic surgery. Depending on the reference, up to 50% of patients develop chronic pain&#xD;
      after open lung surgery. Therefore, different surgical approaches have been developed&#xD;
      including anterior, lateral or posterior thoracotomy with or without sparing the chest wall&#xD;
      muscles. The intercostal nerve is also of concern because of trauma from the rib retractor&#xD;
      which is believed to be a cause of both acute and chronic pain. Other concerns are the amount&#xD;
      of divided tissue, extend of rib displacement by the rib retractor, type of analgesics,&#xD;
      administration form of analgesics, and administration time of the analgesics and it is&#xD;
      generally accepted that pain in lung cancer patients is multifactorial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VATS was introduced in an attempt to reduce the surgical trauma with less tissue damage,&#xD;
      avoidance of the rib retraction and the consequently intercostal nerve injury, but never the&#xD;
      less several patients develop chronic pain after lung surgery by VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on quality of life and health economical aspects following surgery for lung&#xD;
      cancer are scarce. No randomized controlled trial has been published. Very little is known if&#xD;
      lung cancer patients regain their workability and if so to what extent following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, it is not known if VATS is more costly than open procedures, as the opponents say,&#xD;
      or if increased expenses during hospitalization are saved by earlier return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postoperative pain evaluated using the VAS-score and the need for prescription&#xD;
           analgetics 2, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health related life quality and workability and -efficiency in the same period, using&#xD;
           three different questionnaires: two concerning life quality (EORTC-QLQC-30 and EQ5D) and&#xD;
           one concerning workability (WPAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health economical aspect such as application for pension, visits to general&#xD;
           practitioner, readmitted to hospital, number of days away from work due to postoperative&#xD;
           morbidity, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All gathered from different databases managed by &quot;Danmarks Statistik&quot; here among the&#xD;
      &quot;Landspatientregistret(LPR)&quot;, &quot;Sygesikringsstatistikregistret&quot; ,and&#xD;
      &quot;Lægemiddelstatistik-registret&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      206 patients admitted to the department of cardiothoracic surgery, Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital, for elective surgery for lung cancer will be included in each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project has three sub studies: Two randomized controlled and double blinded&#xD;
      clinical trials, and one registry study. One clinical trial randomizes patients with small&#xD;
      peripheral lung cancer between VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) and standard open&#xD;
      anterolateral thoracotomy. The second clinical trial randomizes between anterolateral and&#xD;
      posterolateral open thoracotomy in patients not eligible for VATS. The registry sub study&#xD;
      monitors patients use of analgetics during the first 12 months&#xD;
      (lægemiddelstatestik-registret), their use of other health services, and return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be operated in general anaesthesia with a double lumen tracheal tube and an&#xD;
      epidural catheter. The epidural catheter will be removed when all chest tubes has been&#xD;
      removed, but no later than postoperative day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a standard all patients will be given paracetamol and NSAID in standard doses, and if&#xD;
      needed opioids (oxycontin/oxynorm) can be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical techniques will be performed as routine operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different surgical techniques will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The VATS approach: one camera port and three assistance ports one of which is enlarged&#xD;
           to 5 cm. and rib retractors are never used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anterolateral thoracotomy: The incision is made from the posterior axillary fold&#xD;
           following the linea inframammary to a point below the papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Posterolateral thoracotomy. The incision is made from the anterior axillary fold&#xD;
           backwards towards the inferior angle of the scapula, without dividing the dorsal&#xD;
           latissimus muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both clinical trials postoperative pain is evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS). Pain&#xD;
      is measured during rest and during coughing. Measurements are done preoperatively and 6 times&#xD;
      daily during their hospital stay. After discharge measurements are recorded after 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 26, and 52 weeks by mail questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and the staff doing general rounds postoperatively will be blinded. In the&#xD;
      operating room a dressing will be placed so that it covers the entire hemithorax whereby the&#xD;
      incision is hidden. This is done identically regardless of surgical technique. This dressing&#xD;
      is left in place until discharge. If changing of the dressing is needed, either the&#xD;
      project-nurse or a nurse for another team will assist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical note is kept in a sealed envelope, which is always placed in the patients chart&#xD;
      and can be opened in case of emergency. The chart will only include information about which&#xD;
      lobe was resected, no details on the surgical access, but this information is added when the&#xD;
      patient is discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon who has performed the operation will be allowed to check up on their own&#xD;
      patients, and to be consulted by the other doctors doing rounds, but they are not allowed to&#xD;
      influence on decision-making regarding pain relief or discharge, during the postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a combination of a ph.d-study and a residency/fellowship in cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgery because this allows for a longer inclusion period. The timeline is divided into three&#xD;
      research periods and three clinical periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project has already been accepted as a ph.d.-project at the University of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark, and approved by the local ethical board.&#xD;
