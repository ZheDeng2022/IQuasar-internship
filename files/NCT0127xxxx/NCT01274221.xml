      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of SPD489 compared to placebo&#xD;
      in adolescent subjects (13-17 years of age inclusive) with ADHD in the analog classroom&#xD;
      setting based on the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) total score assessed&#xD;
      across 2, 4, 9, 13, 14, and 15 hours post-dose on the last day of each double-blind crossover&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The parent/LAR must be available at approximately 7:00 AM (±2 hours) to dispense the&#xD;
             dose of investigational product for the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject, who is a female, must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (HCG) pregnancy test and a negative urine pregnancy test and agree to comply with any&#xD;
             applicable contraceptive requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth&#xD;
             Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD based on a&#xD;
             detailed psychiatric evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Fourth Edition&#xD;
             (ADHD-RS-IV) total score ≥28.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is functioning at an age-appropriate level intellectually.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is able to swallow a capsule.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a current, controlled (with medications prohibited in this study) or&#xD;
             uncontrolled, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis with significant symptoms such as any&#xD;
             significant comorbid Axis II disorder or significant Axis I disorder (such as post&#xD;
             traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, bipolar illness, pervasive developmental&#xD;
             disorder, severe obsessive compulsive disorder, depressive or anxiety disorder) or&#xD;
             other symptomatic manifestations that, in the opinion of the examining clinician, will&#xD;
             contraindicate treatment with SPD489 or confound efficacy or safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a documented history of aggressive behavior serious enough to preclude&#xD;
             participation in regular classroom activities, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
             Oppositional defiant disorder is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is currently considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the Investigator, has&#xD;
             previously made a suicide attempt, or has a prior history of, or is currently,&#xD;
             demonstrating active suicidal ideation. Subjects with intermittent passive suicidal&#xD;
             ideation are not necessarily excluded based on the assessment of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is underweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is significantly overweight.&#xD;

             an infectious process requiring antibiotics), disability, or other condition that&#xD;
             might confound the results of safety assessments conducted in the study or that might&#xD;
             increase risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a history of seizures (other than infantile febrile seizures), a chronic&#xD;
             or current tic disorder, a current diagnosis, and/or a known family history of&#xD;
             Tourette's Disorder. Subject has a history of tics that are judged by the Investigator&#xD;
             to be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced&#xD;
             arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm&#xD;
             abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may&#xD;
             place him/her at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;

             significant laboratory abnormality.&#xD;

             to any excipients in the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has failed to respond to 1 or more adequate courses (dose and duration) of&#xD;
             amphetamine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has a history of suspected substance abuse or dependence disorder (excluding&#xD;
             nicotine) in accordance with DSM-IV-TR criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has a positive urine drug result (with the exception of subject's current&#xD;
             stimulant therapy, if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has taken another investigational product or has taken part in a clinical&#xD;
             study within 30 days prior to the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has previously been screened for this study or has participated in any other&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Subject is taking other medications that have central nervous system (CNS) effects or&#xD;
             affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant sympathomimetics,&#xD;

             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject is female and is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
