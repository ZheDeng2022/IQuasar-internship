    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of cilengitide when given&#xD;
      together with paclitaxel weekly in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread&#xD;
      nearby or to other areas of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Cilengitide may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to the stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cilengitide together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly&#xD;
      dose schedule. (Cohort I) II. To describe the toxicities associated with cilengitide and&#xD;
      paclitaxel. III. To describe any antitumor activity of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly&#xD;
      dose schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of cilengitide and paclitaxel with the proposed&#xD;
      schedule and correlate PK parameters to clinical outcome. (Cohort I) V. To examine the effect&#xD;
      of cilengitide and paclitaxel on circulating cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (Cyr61)&#xD;
      using a novel &quot;sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&quot; and to correlate this&#xD;
      effect with clinical response. (Cohort II) VI. To evaluate the information obtained through&#xD;
      use of items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in Phase I studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine if tumor tissue expression of alpha v beta 3 (αvβ3) and CYR61 correlate&#xD;
      with therapeutic response to cilengitide with paclitaxel. (Cohort II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cilengitide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cilengitide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days* 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Some patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;
