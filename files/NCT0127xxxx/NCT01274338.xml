    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies ipilimumab to see how well it works compared to&#xD;
      high-dose interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with high-risk stage III-IV melanoma that&#xD;
      has been removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether ipilimumab is more effective than interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients randomized to receive&#xD;
      post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (high dose ipilimumab; HIP) or 3&#xD;
      mg/kg (low dose ipilimumab: LIP) versus those randomized to receive high-dose interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b (HDI) utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus&#xD;
      HDI second (if the first comparison is significant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients randomized to receive post-operative&#xD;
      adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP) versus those randomized&#xD;
      to receive HDI utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus&#xD;
      HDI second (if the first comparison is significant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab therapy given at&#xD;
      either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Among patients enrolled by Clinical Community Oncology programs (CCOPs), to compare the&#xD;
      global quality of life (QOL) between the ipilimumab arms versus HDI using Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General (G) form and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      treatment-related side effects that may have an impact on the health-related domains of QOL&#xD;
      using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-diarrhea (D) and&#xD;
      FACT-biological response modifiers (BRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients age &gt;= 18 are randomized to Arms A, B, or C. Additional cohort of up to 45&#xD;
      patients aged 12-17 are randomized to Arms D, E, or F after adult accrual has completed on&#xD;

             criteria; for stage IV patients LDH within the institutional ULN must be documented&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to randomization (M1c is not eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: all subjects should be classified as IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b including&#xD;
                  subjects with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original&#xD;
                  primary melanoma; that is the treating team/physician investigator should review&#xD;
                  an overall TNM status (that includes primary tumor presentation and disease&#xD;
                  recurrence status) and provide a designation of IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or limb perfusion) after the&#xD;
             resection(s) that make(s) them eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: previous radiation therapy, including after the surgical resection, is&#xD;
                  allowed as long as 21 days have elapsed between the radiation and initiation of&#xD;
                  this adjuvant systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric conditions or require any&#xD;
             medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with&#xD;
             compliance, make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent&#xD;
             diarrhea; patients with a baseline of frequent diarrhea (e.g. irritable bowel&#xD;
             syndrome) are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an established diagnosis of depression that, in the assessment of the&#xD;
             investigator may make the administration of interferon (IFN)-alfa or ipilimumab&#xD;
             hazardous, should not be enrolled on this protocol; the risks and benefits of being&#xD;
             treated with standard adjuvant IFN-alfa should be weighed very carefully in&#xD;
             consultation with behavioral health or psychiatry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and&#xD;
             Crohn's disease) or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed)&#xD;

             steroid creams or ointments or ophthalmologic steroids; a history of occasional (but&#xD;
             not continuous) use of steroid inhalers is allowed; replacement doses of steroids for&#xD;
             patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed; patients who discontinue use of these&#xD;
             classes of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization are eligible if, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the treating physician investigator, the patient is not likely to&#xD;
             require resumption of treatment with these classes of drugs during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exclusion from this study also includes patients with a history of symptomatic&#xD;
                  autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis&#xD;
                  [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, autoimmune&#xD;
                  vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of&#xD;

Lung and liver: Positive cytology or biopsy in the presence of a single new lesion or the appearance of multiple lesions consistent with metastatic disease.&#xD;
Central Nervous System: A positive brain CT or MRI scan or CSF cytology. Cutaneous, Subcutaneous and Lymph Node Recurrence: Positive cytology or biopsy in the presence of a single new lesion or the appearance of multiple lesions consistent with metastatic disease.&#xD;
Bone and Other Organs: Positive cytology or biopsy in the presence of a single new lesion or the appearance of multiple lesions consistent with metastatic disease identified on two different radiologic studies: i.e., positive nuclear bone scan or PET scan and contrast GI series or ultrasound, X-ray or CT of abdomen for abdominal disease.</description>
