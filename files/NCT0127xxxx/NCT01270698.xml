  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to study the safety of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed of a drug&#xD;
      attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a common&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the&#xD;
      immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to the&#xD;
      body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal&#xD;
      cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the&#xD;
      laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts&#xD;
      for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Safety will be measured routinely during the 6 months of administration and afterwards during follow-up for up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measured will be safety of IMMU-130 administered at different dose levels. Safety will be assessed by reviewing the number of adverse events and overall toxicity.</description>

    <time_frame>Efficacy will be measured every 8-12 weeks during treatment and every 6 months during the 2nd year and then annually up to 5 years thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objectives are to assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and to obtain preliminary information on efficacy with this dosing schedule. Efficacy will be assessed using CT scan imaging.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Stage IV (metastatic) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failed at least one prior standard treatment regimen for colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate performance status (ECOG 0 or 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected survival &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CEA plasma levels &gt; 5 ng/mL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks beyond major surgery and recovered from all acute toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL, ANC &gt;&#xD;
