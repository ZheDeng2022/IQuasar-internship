  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a regular walking program (which&#xD;
      inevitably involves human interaction) compared to a usual care condition and to a human&#xD;
      interaction condition (without the extra walking program) in individuals residing in&#xD;
      Long-Term Care (LTC). Outcomes of interest include: balance, strength, mobility, endurance,&#xD;
      walking distance; rate and severity of falls; activities of daily living; mood and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants taking part in the walking program will demonstrate&#xD;
      maximal benefits compared to the no treatment control group (usual care) and the participants&#xD;
      who will only receive social interaction. It is expected that benefits of the walking program&#xD;
      will include decreased fall rates, and improved balance, endurance, strength, mood,&#xD;
      behaviour, activities of daily living and quality of life indices. Given research findings&#xD;
      that the addition of pleasant activities improves resident mood (Teri et al, 1997; 2003), it&#xD;
      is expected that participants in the social interaction only group will demonstrate&#xD;
      improvements in mood and other indices of quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residents in LTC facilities in the Saskatoon Health Region and Regina Qu'Appelle Region will&#xD;
      be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Male or female residents who are able to follow simple instructions, who&#xD;
      can ambulate with or without a walking aid for at least 10 meters, and who are willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study procedures will be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Residents who have experienced a recent cardiovascular event (within past&#xD;
      6 months) or have severe arthritis, cardiac instability, a vestibular disorder, uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension, uncontrolled epilepsy, a recent fracture (past 4 months), who have had a recent&#xD;
      admission into an acute care facility (past 4 months), who are scheduled for surgery or&#xD;
      hospitalization in next 6 months or who are participating in another regular exercise program&#xD;
      (three or more times per week) aimed at improving balance or strength will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the sample size calculations, a sample size of 129 participants will provide ample&#xD;
      power for the repeated measures analyses. Data will be collected from an additional 50&#xD;
      participants in order to deal with the possibility of attrition. Thus, total sample size is&#xD;
      179 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will meet with the LTC facilities' administrators and staff to inform them&#xD;
      of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study procedures and interventions. They will&#xD;
      be provided with copies of a one page information form which includes a space for residents&#xD;
      (or substitute medical decision-maker, if appropriate) to indicate their signed consent to be&#xD;
      approached by research staff with more detailed information (Appendix). Staff will provide&#xD;
      this form to potential/eligible subjects, and will collect these forms when completed.&#xD;
      Subjects who have consented to be contacted by research staff will be provided with more&#xD;
      detailed information about the study by the research coordinator. If the resident is in&#xD;
      agreement, he or she will then give written consent and will be entered into the study. The&#xD;
      consent will include written permission for researchers to consult with the subject's family&#xD;
      physician about the subject's health, and to ensure optimization of vitamin D intake prior to&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some subjects may have cognitive problems, the majority of subjects will be clearly&#xD;
      competent to provide their own consent. However, some subjects may have more advanced&#xD;
      cognitive problems than others and may therefore not fully appreciate the consequences of&#xD;
      participation. In this situation the person who normally provides consent for medical&#xD;
      treatment will provide appropriate consent. When capacity to provide full, informed consent&#xD;
      is not clear, both the subject and the substitute decision-maker will be asked to sign the&#xD;
      consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Baseline assessment. All participants regardless of group will undergo the following&#xD;
      assessments. The assessment of the outcome measures will be conducted by trained study&#xD;
      personnel who will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Senior Fitness Test (SFT). The SFT, a six-item battery that includes measures of&#xD;
           dynamic upper and lower extremity strength and flexibility, aerobic endurance, and&#xD;
           dynamic balance and agility will be completed ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS, a tool currently being used in the RRMC, is a&#xD;
           14-item battery intended to objectively assess a person's ability to safely perform&#xD;
           several common daily living tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grip Strength. Grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant hand-held dynamometer will&#xD;
           be measured. Strength will be tested 3 times with each hand and the maximum score will&#xD;
           be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gait speed (6 metre walk test). Participants will be asked to walk a distance of 6&#xD;
           metres over a portable, computerized walkway (the GAITRiteÂ® system. An additional two&#xD;
           metres of walking will be added at the beginning and end of the walkway to accommodate&#xD;
           for acceleration and deceleration. Subjects will be asked to walk along the walkway.&#xD;
           Gait parameters, including gait speed, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. OARS Physical Activities of Daily Living (PADL) Sub-Scale. The OARS-PADL is a brief,&#xD;
           valid, and reliable instrument that is used as a clinical assessment of functional&#xD;
           status. The OARS-PADL will be completed by the research assistant with information&#xD;
           provided by subjects' care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Mood will be assessed using the CSDD, a&#xD;
           well- validated, scale (based on caregiver reports) designed for the assessment of&#xD;
           depression in individuals with dementia and individuals residing in long-term care. The&#xD;
           CSDD will be completed by the research assistant with information provided by subjects'&#xD;
           care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) short form will be also used to assess&#xD;
           self-identified depressive symptoms during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC). Behavioral problems will be&#xD;
           assessed with the use of the RMBPC, a 24-item report that measures observable behavioral&#xD;
           and memory problems. The RMBPC will be completed by the research assistant with&#xD;
           information provided by subjects' care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Coloured Analogue Pain Scale is being used to assess pain via patient self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Height, weight and other body measurements. We will measure height, knee-floor height,&#xD;
           weight and waist, upper arm and calf circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Vital signs including blood pressure. We will measure lying and standing blood pressure&#xD;
           as well as heart rate and respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's family physician will be asked to optimize vitamin D level of participants&#xD;
      at baseline according to Canadian guidelines, as this can impact fall risk. This will involve&#xD;
      measuring the Vitamin D level at baseline, and ordering Vitamin D 1,000 units daily if the&#xD;
      participant is not already taking this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Randomization into one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will receive care as usual (Usual Care Group; UCG) that is provided by&#xD;
           their long-term care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will receive stationary 1:1 interaction time with the same research&#xD;
           personnel who conduct the third group walking session at each individual care facility&#xD;
           in order to control for the interpersonal interaction likely to be involved in the&#xD;
           walking program (Interpersonal Interaction Group; IIG). This group will receive the&#xD;
           equivalent interpersonal interaction time with research personnel as those participating&#xD;
           in the WPG group. This interaction time will occur with the participant stationary,&#xD;
           rather than walking with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will participate in the Walking Program Group (WPG), in which a daily&#xD;
           supervised walking program will be provided by study personnel. After randomization to&#xD;
           the walking group, a licensed physiotherapist will first review test results and overall&#xD;
           functioning, then develop a safe plan for a therapeutic walking program. This plan will&#xD;
           include a protocol for termination and resumption of walking in case of physical&#xD;
           symptoms such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness or chest pain. In situations of&#xD;
           unexpected medical symptoms, the supervising staff nurse of the nursing unit will be&#xD;
           consulted, who may suggest termination of the walking, or interim modification of the&#xD;
           walking plan until reviewed by medical and physiotherapy staff. Subjects will in general&#xD;
           gradually increase their daily supervised walking time as tolerated to a maximum of 30&#xD;
           minutes once per day, Monday to Friday. The distance and number of minutes walked each&#xD;
           time will be recorded. Interpersonal interaction will occur during the walking sessions,&#xD;
           and will be similar in quality and quantity to that during the Interpersonal Interaction&#xD;
           Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a gait belt during all and with walking (if in the walking program&#xD;
      group) and will be closely monitored by the research assistant who will be trained in safety&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Subjects will participate in a four month intervention, as outlined in Step 2 above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: After 2 months of the intervention (outlined in Step 2 above), all subjects will be&#xD;
      re-tested as per baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor&#xD;
      height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: After 4 months of intervention (outlined in Step 2 above), all subjects will be&#xD;
      re-tested as per baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor&#xD;
      height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 6: At 2 months and 4 months post-intervention, all subjects will be re-tested as per&#xD;
      baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. In order to control for confounding variables and to characterize the sample, the&#xD;
      following data will be extracted from the chart, including the chart copy of admission, date&#xD;
      of admission, personal health number and most recent quarterly Minimum Data Set (MDS), by&#xD;
      research personnel. The MDS is a computerized long-term care assessment system designed to&#xD;
      improve the care given to long-term care residents, and has been utilized province-wide since&#xD;
      2001. Personal identifying information will only be extracted for the purpose of accurate&#xD;
      linking to other study information, and will be removed prior to data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected: date of birth, race/ethnicity, gender, highest level of education,&#xD;
      diagnoses on admittance, medications, health conditions (CHESS Scale: health instability);&#xD;
      Cognitive Performance Scale; Depression Rating Scale; Index of Social Engagement; ADL&#xD;
      Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale; Pain; Continence; Oral/Nutritional status; Communication;&#xD;
      Mood and Behaviour Patterns; Physical Functioning and Structural problems; Activity Pursuit&#xD;
      Patterns; Special Treatments and Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Record of Falls: The incidence and nature of falls will be prospectively collected from&#xD;
      the standard Saskatoon Health Region falls documentation for the period of the intervention&#xD;
      (4 months) and for 4 months following intervention. Copies of falls documentation will be&#xD;
      made from the clinical chart every week by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participants' health concerns (identified by the participant and/or nursing staff) will&#xD;
      be reviewed by the research coordinator and discussed with the Medical Safety Committee as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Time Period (indicate the dates when the research project is expected to begin and to be&#xD;
      completed. A final status report must be filed with the Ethics Office once data collection&#xD;
      from the last subject is complete. The Ethics Office should be notified once the study site&#xD;
      is closed.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated start date is December 2010. We anticipate the study will take about 2 years to&#xD;
      complete. Expected completion date is December 31, 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Data Storage (In accordance with recommended guidelines provide a statement outlining the&#xD;
      procedures you will use to store securely the research data. State how long and where the&#xD;
      data will be stored and identify the person who will be assuming responsibility for data&#xD;
      storage):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participant information will be stored according to HIPA guidelines. All documents and&#xD;
      data collection forms will be stored in the School of Physical Therapy, in a locked filing&#xD;
      cabinet in the office of Vanina Dal Bello-Haas (P.I.) for the required 10-year period. Signed&#xD;
      consent forms will be stored separately from the study data in locked files. Study subjects&#xD;
      will be identified by research study number only. Only study numbers and aggregate&#xD;
      information will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
