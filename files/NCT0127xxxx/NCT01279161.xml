      The project aims at assessment of the effect of the FTO gene polymorphism and the type of&#xD;
      treatment on the development of overweight/obesity and features of metabolic syndrome in&#xD;
      children with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene polymorphism including some genetic variants may predispose to the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and their complications. The A allele of the FTO gene predisposing to&#xD;
      obesity occurs in approximately 40% of the European population and each copy of this allele&#xD;
      can increase BMI by 0.1 Z-score i.e. by 0.4 kg/m2. Insulin therapy in diabetic patients may&#xD;
      result in excess body weight gain. Therefore we need studies involving large groups of&#xD;
      children and assessing cardiovascular risk factors in type 1 diabetes along with their&#xD;
      genetic associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: The study will include 1500 children with type 1 diabetes, aged 6-18 years.&#xD;
      Reference group will be made of 1500 children in whom type 1 diabetes was excluded. The&#xD;
      following variables will be assessed in the treatment group: 1) Anthropometric data and&#xD;
      questionnaire data: age, sex, body height and weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences, arm and thigh circumferences, family history of overweight/obesity, type 1 or&#xD;
      2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, 2) Primary disease characteristics: age of the disease&#xD;
      onset, treatment regimen, mean daily insulin consumption per kg body weight, brands of&#xD;
      insulin products, glycated haemoglobin, BMI from the first 3-6 months following diabetes&#xD;
      onset, diet, conversion of these data into actual and ideal calorie intake 3) Laboratory data&#xD;
      - lipid profile and blood pressure (average of three measurements). Methodology: Gene&#xD;
      polymorphism analysis in the extracted DNA will be made with the real-time PCR method using&#xD;
      TaqMan 7900 HT by Applied Biosystems. Correlations between the FTO gene polymorphism and&#xD;
      clinical variables such as BMI (including BMI increase since the disease onset), body weight&#xD;
      and height, waist and hip circumferences, arm and thigh circumferences, and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be assessed by a professional statistician with a specially dedicated software. Moreover&#xD;
      parameters such as diet and metabolic control will be assessed. As regards insulin therapy&#xD;
      the following variables will be analysed: insulin injection device, therapy regimen&#xD;
      (intensive versus functional; brands and types of insulin products: human insulin versus&#xD;
      insulin analogue), consumption of insulin. All of the above listed variables will be&#xD;
      correlated with the genotypes found in the gene polymorphism analysis. The study has been&#xD;
      approved by Bioethics Committee of the Medical University in Bia≈Çystok.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The authors of the project expect that the effect of the FTO gene polymorphism on&#xD;
      overweight/obesity and features of metabolic syndrome in children with type 1 diabetes will&#xD;
      be shown. Moreover the project will enable assessment of the effect of the therapeutic&#xD;
      regimen, including the type of insulin product, on body weight increase in the course of type&#xD;
      1 diabetes treatment in the context of the FTO gene polymorphism. Confirmation of the above&#xD;
      associations and identification of a group at risk of excess body weight increase in the&#xD;
      course of insulin therapy may help physicians, parents and patients to avoid this&#xD;
      complication. Therefore clinical benefit of this project will include identification - based&#xD;
      on the genetic assays results - of a group of type 1 diabetic children particularly likely to&#xD;
      develop overweight, obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims at assessment of the effect of the FTO gene polymorphism and the type of&#xD;
      treatment on the development of overweight/obesity and features of metabolic syndrome in&#xD;
      children with type 1 diabetes. Particular objective of the project is providing an answer to&#xD;
      the question: Are type 1 diabetic children who are carriers of the AA genotype of the FTO&#xD;
      gene polymorphism (rs9939609) at risk of more weight gain in the course of insulin therapy&#xD;
      when compared to carriers of the TA and TT genotypes of this polymorphism ? Background: Gene&#xD;
      polymorphism including some genetic variants may predispose to the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and their complications. A great advance in studies on genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility to obesity was the discovery of the gene called FTO - fat mass and obesity&#xD;
      associated gene. The A allele of the FTO gene predisposing to obesity occurs in approximately&#xD;
      40% of the European population and each copy of this allele can increase BMI by 0.1 Z-score&#xD;
      i.e. by 0.4 kg/m2. However, there are very few data on the impact of human genome on body&#xD;
      weight change following particular intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important problem to be dealt with by physicians and type 1 diabetic patients is&#xD;
      overweight and obesity. This problem is inevitably associated with insulin therapy and excess&#xD;
      energy intake. Insulin therapy in diabetic patients may result in excess body weight gain.&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not known. Obesity in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with diabetes can be an additional risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Central obesity,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension are all the elements of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome - a disease that predisposes to the development of cardiovascular disorders.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular complications are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in adult patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. However recently repeated attempts have been made to assess these factors also&#xD;
      in children and adolescents. Overweight and obesity in type 1 diabetes depend among others on&#xD;
      patients' sex, age and type of treatment. Although the role of gene polymorphism in the&#xD;
      development of obesity in adults and children is the subject of extensive investigations,&#xD;
      currently there are no reports that would assess genetic aspects of obesity in treatment of&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. Therefore we need studies involving large groups of children and assessing&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in type 1 diabetes along with their genetic associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: The study will include 1500 children with type 1 diabetes, aged 6-18 years.&#xD;
      Reference group will be made of 1500 children in whom type 1 diabetes was excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be assessed in the treatment group: 1) Anthropometric data and&#xD;
      questionnaire data: age, sex, body height and weight, body mass index (BMI) (including&#xD;
      SDS-BMI), waist and hip circumferences, arm and thigh circumferences, family history of&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, type 1 or 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, 2) Primary disease&#xD;
      characteristics: age of the disease onset, treatment regimen (intensive insulin therapy&#xD;
      versus functional insulin therapy with a personal insulin pump), mean daily insulin&#xD;
      consumption per kg body weight, brands of insulin products, glycated haemoglobin (the last&#xD;
      available measurement and the mean value from the last year), BMI from the first 3-6 months&#xD;
      following diabetes onset, diet - consumption of carbohydrate and protein-fat exchanges (only&#xD;
      in patients using a personal insulin pump), conversion of these data into actual and ideal&#xD;
      calorie intake 3) Laboratory data: lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides) and blood pressure (average of three measurements). In the&#xD;
      control group anthropometric variables and questionnaire data will be assessed along with&#xD;
      additional questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Gene polymorphism analysis in the extracted DNA will be made with the real-time&#xD;
      PCR method using TaqMan 7900 HT by Applied Biosystems. Correlations between the FTO gene&#xD;
      polymorphism and clinical variables such as BMI (including BMI increase since the disease&#xD;
      onset), body weight and height, waist and hip circumferences, arm and thigh circumferences,&#xD;
      and blood pressure will be assessed by a professional statistician with a specially dedicated&#xD;
      software (R-project). Moreover parameters such as diet and metabolic control will be&#xD;
      assessed. As regards insulin therapy the following variables will be analysed: insulin&#xD;
      injection device, therapy regimen (intensive versus functional; brands and types of insulin&#xD;
      products: human insulin versus insulin analogue), consumption of insulin. Out of laboratory&#xD;
      data, lipid metabolism parameters will be assessed. All of the above listed variables will be&#xD;
      correlated with the genotypes found in the gene polymorphism analysis. The study has been&#xD;
      approved by Bioethics Committee of the Medical University in Bia≈Çystok.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The authors of the project expect that the effect of the FTO gene polymorphism on&#xD;
      overweight/obesity and features of metabolic syndrome in children with type 1 diabetes will&#xD;
      be shown. Moreover the project will enable assessment of the effect of the therapeutic&#xD;
      regimen, including the type of insulin product, on body weight increase in the course of type&#xD;
      1 diabetes treatment in the context of the FTO gene polymorphism. Confirmation of the above&#xD;
      associations and identification of a group at risk of excess body weight increase in the&#xD;
      course of insulin therapy may help physicians, parents and patients to avoid this&#xD;
      complication. Therefore clinical benefit of this project will include identification - based&#xD;
      on the genetic assays results - of a group of type 1 diabetic children particularly likely to&#xD;
