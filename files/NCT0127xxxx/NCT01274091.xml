      Interactions between genes and environment, i.e. our inherited responses to environmental&#xD;
      changes, may be crucial in the development of the common diseases. The investigators were the&#xD;
      first to identify PPARG gene as risk gene for type 2 diabetes. The role of the Pro12Ala&#xD;
      polymorphism in diabetes risk has also been verified in meta-analysis. However, this effect&#xD;
      on seems to depend on intervention and age. In this study the effects of diets high with&#xD;
      saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are compared in subjects&#xD;
      carrying either Pro12Pro or Ala12Ala genotype of the PPARG gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if subjects with Pro12Pro and Ala12Ala genotypes respond differentially to a diet&#xD;
      supplemented with high saturated (SAFA) or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific: Subjects with the Ala12Ala genotype will be more sensitive to dietary&#xD;
           modification, and therefore respond more favorably to PUFA diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. More general: Dietary instructions individually tailored according to the genotype would&#xD;
           allow better treatment of obesity and diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing in all western countries, including Finland.&#xD;
      Recent genome wide analyses have found &gt; 30 genes that contribute to either condition..&#xD;
      However, none of these genes explain &gt;5% of the disease risk and altogether they explain &lt;&#xD;
      10% of the total disease risk in cross-sectional studies. Therefore, diet and physical&#xD;
      activity are still the major determinants of the risk, as demonstrated by our earlier&#xD;
      intervention studies in order to find out the effect of different dietary modifications on&#xD;
      glucose and lipid metabolism. More importantly, interactions between genes and environment,&#xD;
      i.e. our inherited responses to environmental changes, may be crucial in the development of&#xD;
      the common diseases. Unfortunately, gene-environment interaction can only be effectively&#xD;
      investigated in intervention studies that are more expensive than cross-sectional population&#xD;
      screenings. This leads to a lower sample size and reduced power to detect effects of minor&#xD;
      alleles. Despite these limitations the investigators have been able to demonstrate&#xD;
      gene-intervention interactions for several genes, including PPARG, in the Finnish Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention study. There is an urgent need for studies investigating effects of tailored diets&#xD;
      in individuals selected based on their genotype. This will be the next essential step leading&#xD;
      to improved dietary treatments guided by genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were the first to identify PPARG gene as risk gene for type 2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      role of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in diabetes risk has also been verified in meta-analysis.&#xD;
      However, this effect on seems to depend on intervention and age. Based on these findings the&#xD;
      investigators created in collaboration with Johan Auwerx an Pro12Ala animal model that&#xD;
      demonstrated a differential effect of dietary fat composition depending on the genotype.&#xD;
      However, an important conclusive proof that subjects selected based on their Pro12Ala&#xD;
      genotype would respond differently to specifically tailored diet modification is still&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the effects of diets high with saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (PUFA) are compared in subjects carrying either Pro12Pro or Ala12Ala genotype of&#xD;
      the PPARG gene. As a primary endpoint the investigators expect insulin sensitivity to alter&#xD;
      differently depending on the genotype. Additionally, a detailed characterization of energy,&#xD;
      glucose and lipid metabolism will be performed. Because PPARG gene plays a central role in&#xD;
      adipogenesis one of the aims of this study is to find new pathways, genes and gene clusters&#xD;
      that are regulated by PPARG in humans.&#xD;
