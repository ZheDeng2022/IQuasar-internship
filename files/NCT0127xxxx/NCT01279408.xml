    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess current practice within PROP &amp; lung teams, for treating&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients with centrally located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to&#xD;
      observe outcomes for those patients receiving immediate or deferred RT. This is a prospective&#xD;
      cohort trial. Patients will be managed by immediate radiotherapy (RT) or a deferred approach&#xD;
      according to physicians' individual current clinical practice. Baseline and follow-up data&#xD;
      collection will be structured to focus on patient-reported measures to describe clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in the two management groups. Indications for prescribing RT and dose fractionation&#xD;
      schedules will also be collected. A new intervention will not be introduced during this&#xD;
      trial. Instead, a follow-up regimen will be offered to both groups of patients, so that RT&#xD;
      can be offered to the deferred group of patients if/when symptoms develop, and we can monitor&#xD;
      symptoms/toxicities and QoL in both groups of patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central disease, as defined by tumour (either primary or nodal disease) arising or&#xD;
             extending within a 2cm circumferential expansion from the centre of the trachea or&#xD;
             within the zone of the proximal bronchial tree&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease is visible on thoracic CT (diagnostic or simulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asymptomatic from intra-thoracic tumour (may have background chest symptoms related to&#xD;
             underlying COAD etc, but these symptoms must not have worsened due to tumour)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (due to age or co-morbidities) or tumour (due to locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic disease) is not suitable for radical treatment (defined as surgery or RT&#xD;
             dose &gt;50Gy in 20 fractions or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous chemotherapy, thoracic RT or surgery is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RT to other metastases (e.g. brain, bone etc) is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
             •≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intra-thoracic disease is peripheral only, not extending within 2cm of&#xD;
             trachea/proximal bronchial tree&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic from intra-thoracic NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, or malignant mediastinal&#xD;
             lymphadenopathy from another malignancy (not NSCLC)&#xD;
