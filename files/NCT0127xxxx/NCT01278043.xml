  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study have recently had or are scheduled for a percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) as part of their normal, routine medical care. This procedure should&#xD;
      restore the blood flow in the vessels of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One complication that can occur after a PCI procedure is blood clotting and narrowing of the&#xD;
      artery in the area that was treated. This can result in a decrease in the blood flow to the&#xD;
      heart. To avoid this complication, patients are given antiplatelet or &quot;blood-thinning&quot; drugs&#xD;
      such as aspirin and clopidogrel as part of their routine care after this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this research study, the investigators would like to take blood samples from subjects at&#xD;
      3 different time points while they are taking these antiplatelet drugs. The investigators&#xD;
      will study the subjects' blood and medical history to help us further our understanding of&#xD;
      how these drugs respond in individuals and in certain patient populations. Everyone responds&#xD;
      a little differently to medications due to many reasons including our genetic make-up. Genes&#xD;
      are passed down from our parents and determine our physical appearance such as the color of&#xD;
      our hair and eyes. Differences in our genes may also help explain why some drugs work in some&#xD;
      people, but not in others. By studying subjects' blood, medical history, genetic make-up and&#xD;
      by recording how the subjects' blood responds over the course of their treatment, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to learn more about how our bodies respond when taking these drugs.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators hope to find better ways to predict who will respond more&#xD;
      effectively to these drugs and better ways to monitor how these drugs are working in&#xD;
      patients' bodies over time after PCI procedures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent for study participation will be obtained following&#xD;
             performance of clinically-indicated PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years old and up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received an oral load of clopidogrel (600 mg total) and aspirin&#xD;
             (325 mg if aspirin naïve or minimum 81 mg if on therapy for ≥ 5 days) over the 24&#xD;
             hours preceding enrollment in order to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent or an&#xD;
             accurate medical history,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients unwilling to participate in follow-up,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  incarcerated or pregnant patients and patients under 18 years of age will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additionally patients within 24 hours of discontinuation of eptifibatide or tirofiban&#xD;
             infusion or within 2 weeks of abciximab infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients on antiplatelet monotherapy and patients currently on cilostazol or&#xD;
             dipyridomole will be excluded as will those likely to discontinue dual antiplatelet&#xD;
             therapy during the 6-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active bleeding or recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA, &quot;stroke&quot;) (≤1&#xD;
             month) at the time of PCI will be excluded, however patients with a history of CVA,&#xD;
             bleeding, anemia or thrombocytopenia are eligible providing the clinically-determined&#xD;
             careplan includes long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).&#xD;
