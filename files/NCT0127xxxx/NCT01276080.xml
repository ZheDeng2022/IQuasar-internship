      This open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose&#xD;
      crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of equal doses of the&#xD;
      test and reference products under non-fasted conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (31&#xD;
      completing) healthy adults in accordance with Protocol No. 10940308 (Revision 0). In each&#xD;
      study period, a single 10 mg tablet of donepezil hydrochloride was administered to all&#xD;
      subjects following a standardized high fat, high calorie breakfast, preceded by an overnight&#xD;
      fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg tablet (OHM&#xD;
      Laboratories, Inc., USA a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA) and the reference&#xD;
      formulation was ARICEPT® (donepezil hydrochloride) 10 mg Tablets (Eisai Inc.). The subjects&#xD;
      received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period;&#xD;
      the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. Subjects were&#xD;
      confined at the clinical facility from at least 10.5 hours prior to dosing until after the 24&#xD;
      hour blood collection. Subjects returned to the clinical facility for the 36, 48, and 72 hour&#xD;
      blood sample collection. There was a 28-day interval between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 72 hours after dosing in each&#xD;
      period. The plasma samples from all subjects were shipped to Warnex Bioanalytical Services&#xD;
      for determination of donepezil concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited to compare the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of the test formulation to the reference product. Bioequivalence was&#xD;
      determined based on the confidence intervals for the major pharmacokinetic parameters,&#xD;
      AUC0-72 and Cmax, for donepezil.&#xD;
