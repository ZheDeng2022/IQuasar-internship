      This observational study seeks to establish evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. that physiologic changes, unrelated to effect on the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH)&#xD;
           enzyme, occur in Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients who are treated with sapropterin&#xD;
           (Kuvan®) therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. that these changes may be caused by enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain or&#xD;
           an upregulation of gene expression (increasing the ability of genes to produce&#xD;
           functional enzymes),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. and that beneficial changes in behavior and cognition, especially executive functioning&#xD;
           skills may result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to correlate any change in behavior and executive function&#xD;
      skills of PKU patients who are non-responsive to sapropterin effect on the PAH enzyme, as&#xD;
      defined by lowered blood PHE levels, with urine neurotransmitter levels and broad gene&#xD;
      expression prior to and after sapropterin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes would include evidence of sapropterin effects on upregulation of enzymes&#xD;
      other than PAH that control neurotransmitter synthesis, and any resulting correlation with&#xD;
      behavioral and cognitive changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope this study will inform further detailed investigations into the&#xD;
      biochemical and molecular actions of sapropterin (Kuvan®) that lead to increased&#xD;
      understanding of possible treatment effects beyond a lowered blood PHE response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anticipated study participant population was approximately 30 established PKU patients&#xD;
      receiving care from Hayward Genetics Center, who were found previously to exhibit no decrease&#xD;
      in blood phenylalanine (PHE) levels (nonresponders) with administration of sapropterin.&#xD;
      Subjects acted as their own controls. An additional number of patients naive to sapropterin&#xD;
      were subsequently added to the study, and the age exclusion of over 21 years of age was&#xD;
      omitted per IRB approval. Primary endpoints were designed to be measurement of behavioral and&#xD;
      cognitive function, neurotransmitter levels, and gene expression of enzyme activity after 4&#xD;
      weeks on treatment compared to baseline levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study baseline each patient attended an approximately 1 hour clinic visit at their usual&#xD;
      genetics clinic location. Study purpose, design, and requirements were discussed, and&#xD;
      consents/assents reviewed and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating inventories of executive function performance and behavior (BASC-2 and BRIEF tools)&#xD;
      were administered to patients and parents by the Principal Investigator (PI) and/or the Study&#xD;
      Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples were collected non-invasively for measurement of neurotransmitter levels. Blood&#xD;
      as collected by venipuncture (3-5 ml) for microarray expression analysis and analysis of&#xD;
      plasma amino acids. 3-day food records previously provided to participants for completion&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were provided with a 4 week supply of Kuvan® and instructions on how to take the&#xD;
      medication during the study period. The importance of maintaining usual dietary intake (food&#xD;
      choices and metabolic formula) to minimize any research effect not attributable to&#xD;
      sapropterin administration was emphasized. Sapropterin was discontinued at the end of the 4&#xD;
      week study period. The exception to this was for the naive patients who were found to be&#xD;
      responsive to sapropterin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these measures were repeated at the same sites with study participants at the end of&#xD;
      week 4 of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the ends of weeks 1 and 2 additional blood samples were sent to Hayward Genetics Center&#xD;
      for measurement of PHE and tyrosine (TYR) levels to ascertain no significant changes have&#xD;
      occurred in a patient's usual dietary intake. These samples were drawn at each patient's&#xD;
      local state health unit, as is done for usual monitoring. Nutrient analysis of the 3-day food&#xD;
      diaries was conducted at Hayward Genetics Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Behavior and executive function were assessed using published validated inventories,&#xD;
           completed as patient self-reports and as parent (or guardian) reports when appropriate.&#xD;
           Instruments used were the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) parental&#xD;
           Rating Scale and Self-Reporting Personality Rating Scale, and the Behavioral Rating&#xD;
           Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Parent Form Instruments of Executive Function.&#xD;
           Completed inventories were scored using electronic evaluation instruments by the Study&#xD;
           Coordinator and PI, with consultation from Harvard Medical Center experts as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urine samples were non-invasively collected and sent for analysis of catechols and&#xD;
           neurotransmitters to an NIH laboratory specializing in this technique. Samples were&#xD;
           blinded to this laboratory to prevent bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microarray analysis of blood samples was conducted at Hayward Genetics Molecular&#xD;
           Laboratory to determine any effect on gene expression, and thus enzyme activity, as a&#xD;
           result of sapropterin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Plasma amino acids were analyzed at Hayward Genetics Biochemical Laboratory to document&#xD;
           that patients are &quot;nonresponsive&quot; to sapropterin (no resultant lowering of blood PHE);&#xD;
           and to monitor any changes in plasma amino acids that could indicate a patient's failure&#xD;
           to maintain usual dietary restrictions. Patients naive to Kuvan who responded were noted&#xD;
           and function as comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 3-day food diaries completed by patients (or parent/guardians) at home documented any&#xD;
           substantive changes in usual dietary intake during the study period. These were analyzed&#xD;
           at Hayward Genetics Center using the MetabolicPro web-based analysis program.&#xD;

        sapropterin (FDA approved drug available for treatment) as part of their clinical care and&#xD;
        been found to be non-responsive. Subsequently, with IRB approval, some patients diagnosed&#xD;
        with PKU from our clinic population who were naive to sapropterin were added to the study.&#xD;
