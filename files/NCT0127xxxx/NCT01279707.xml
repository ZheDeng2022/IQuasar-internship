  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has progressed considerably&#xD;
      in the past 3 decades, particularly due to intensification of chemotherapies, improved&#xD;
      supportive care and the incorporation of stem cell transplantation. However, the maximum&#xD;
      tolerability of standard chemotherapeutics has been reached in ALL. Using conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy, 80-85% of adults with ALL will achieve a complete remission (CR). Unfortunately&#xD;
      treatment at relapse is generally unsuccessful and rarely results, in long-term survival (7%&#xD;
      survival at 5 years). Therefore, the investigators are exploring novel treatment strategies&#xD;
      through the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed at surface antigens on leukaemic&#xD;
      blasts. Using MoAbs directed against surface proteins on B cells has had excellent results in&#xD;
      other B-cell diseases such as low and high grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas, without additional&#xD;
      toxicity. There has also been limited evidence from small studies and case reports of the&#xD;
      efficacy of MoAbs in ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of&#xD;
      veltuzumab and epratuzumab with intensive chemotherapy in patients with relapsed B-cell ALL.&#xD;
      A maximum of 51 patients will be treated with a combination of UKALL XII induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy and the monoclonal antibodies veltuzumab and epratuzumab. Veltuzumab and&#xD;
      epratuzumab are humanised monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 and CD22 surface proteins,&#xD;
      respectively. Both of these proteins are expressed on ALL tumour B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group of patients will receive modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + veltuzumab; a second,&#xD;
      modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + epratuzumab and if limited toxicity is found in these first&#xD;
      2 groups, a third group will receive, modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + both veltuzumab and&#xD;
      epratuzumab. Patients will be assessed for safety, tolerability and disease response. Safety&#xD;
      and tolerability will be measured by the number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in each&#xD;
      group. Disease response will be measured by the microscopic appearance of patient bone marrow&#xD;
      samples at day 29, and by molecular tests for tumour cells in bone marrow.&#xD;
