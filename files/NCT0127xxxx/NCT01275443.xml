  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TMC278 (also called rilpivirine) is a new drug being developed to treat HIV. Usually TMC278&#xD;
      is taken as a tablet, by mouth, once a day, but a 'long acting' formulation has been&#xD;
      developed so the drug stays in the bloodstream for a longer time - this allows the drug to be&#xD;
      given by injection and less often. It is hoped that this injectable version of the drug may&#xD;
      be used to help prevent HIV transmission in the future by giving it to people who are at risk&#xD;
      of HIV. This is similar to the way travellers to areas with malaria may take antibiotics to&#xD;
      prevent infection. The investigators aim to investigate the feasibility of using TMC278 as a&#xD;
      preventative medication by performing this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of drug which can be measured in the&#xD;
      blood, as well as the tissues and fluids of the rectum (the lowest part of the bowels just&#xD;
      before the opening of the anus) as well as the safety of the drug and how well tolerated it&#xD;
      is when given as a single dose. In this study, the investigators will not be investigating&#xD;
      whether the drug prevents HIV so the investigators will recruit people who are HIV negative,&#xD;
      and whose lifestyle does not put them at risk of becoming infected before or during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study shows the drug is well tolerated and produces appropriate levels of the drug (in&#xD;
      the bloodstream and the rectal compartment) to suggest that it could be effective, it will&#xD;
      help design future studies looking at preventing HIV.&#xD;

      The trial will examine the pharmacokinetics of doses of 300mg and 600mg, as well as either&#xD;
      150mg or 1200mg, of TMC278LA, given as a single intramuscular dose to HIV-negative&#xD;
      participants. Investigation of drug pharmacokinetics in plasma, female genital secretions and&#xD;
      tissue samples, and male rectal fluid and tissue samples (at the 600mg dose) will be also&#xD;
      carried out in order to provide data on relative drug exposure following drug administration.&#xD;
      Additionally, ex-vivo assays to assess viral inhibition in fluid from genital secretions and&#xD;
      rectal compartments will provide partial information on pharmacodynamic characteristics of&#xD;
      TMC278; this may usefully inform future selection decisions on the appropriate target&#xD;
      concentrations required for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target concentration for a prophylactic use of TMC278 in plasma, genital or rectal&#xD;
      tissues and fluids is unknown. It is possible that a target lower than that required for&#xD;
      treatment of established infection would be suitable. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data to usefully inform what this target concentration might be. In the&#xD;
      absence of population PK data in an efficacy trial of TMC278 as a prophylactic agent, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to obtain useful indirect data from ex-vivo viral inhibition assays to at&#xD;
      least guide future decisions on dose selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 evaluable female participants will be enrolled, with more than 40% being of African&#xD;
      ancestry. Six male participants will also be enrolled. This will provide data on plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and the relative distribution kinetics in the female genital tract and male&#xD;
      rectal compartment in order to support expanded safety studies and a phase III global&#xD;
      efficacy trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. History of severe drug allergy that in the opinion of the Investigator may increase&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Use of any drug, including over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations,&#xD;
             within two weeks prior to first dose of trial drug (unless approved or prescribed by&#xD;
