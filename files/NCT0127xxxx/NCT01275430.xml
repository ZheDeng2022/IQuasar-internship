      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the location of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tip upon&#xD;
           observation of maximum p-wave amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the precision of PICC placement in the Sherlock 3CG group versus the standard&#xD;
           PICC placement&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility phase of this study (Phase I) is a prospective, single arm, single-center&#xD;
      feasibility study to determine the distance of the PICC tip to the upper Caval Atrial&#xD;
      junction upon observation of maximum p-wave after PICC tip placement using the Sherlock 3CG&#xD;
      system. Subjects judged by site personnel to require PICC placement will be screened against&#xD;
      the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those subjects meeting the study criteria will be&#xD;
      offered enrollment into the study. Informed consent will be obtained prior to subject&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICC nurses who have been fully trained in the correct use of the Sherlock 3CG Tip&#xD;
      Positioning System will perform the PICC placement procedures in the fluoroscopy suite.&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected, but collection of non-serious AEs will be&#xD;
      limited to those adverse events (AEs) considered to be study procedure and/or device-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject follow up will be complete 30 days following the date of the study PICC procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the feasibility phase will be used to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the distance, if any, that is required to move the PICC tip upon observation of the&#xD;
           maximum p-wave amplitude in the pivotal phase of the study (See Section 3.5.3), in order&#xD;
           to have the PICC tip at the upper cavoatrial junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the movement of the cardiovascular anatomy, if any, when the arm is adducted from above&#xD;
           the head to the side of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the movement of the PICC tip when the arm is moved from the 90° angle to the side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Pivotal) will not begin until the Phase I (feasibility) is complete. The Phase II&#xD;
      study is a prospective, single-center, controlled, blinded, randomized study to compare the&#xD;
      Sherlock 3CG as a tool in guiding PICC placement to the standard &quot;blind&quot; technique (control).&#xD;
      Subjects judged by site personnel to require PICC placement will be screened against the&#xD;
      study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those subjects meeting the study criteria will be offered&#xD;
      participation into the study. Informed consent will be obtained prior to subject enrollment.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the Sherlock 3CG group or the control group in a&#xD;
      1:1 fashion. Due to the different placement techniques being utilized, the PICC nurses and&#xD;
      study coordinator will not be blinded to the study device. PICC nurses who have been fully&#xD;
      trained in the correct use of the Sherlock 3CG will perform the PICC placement procedures in&#xD;
      the fluoroscopy suite. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected, but collection of&#xD;
      non-serious AEs will be limited to those AEs considered to be study procedure and/or&#xD;
      device-related. Subject follow up will be complete 30 days following the date of the study&#xD;
      PICC procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization did not occur due to early termination. All participants were assigned to&#xD;
      Sherlock 3CG in phase I. Randomization would have occurred at the start of Phase II, but&#xD;
      Phase II was not initiated due to early termination. Phase II was cancelled.&#xD;
