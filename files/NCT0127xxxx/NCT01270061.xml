      Project Wellness is a new intervention that combines the use of culturally-sensitive,&#xD;
      video-based education, a general health screening approach, and a community pharmacy setting&#xD;
      into one program to improve black African immigrant participation in voluntary HIV testing.&#xD;
      The study is divided into three phases: qualitative research; video production; and a&#xD;
      feasibility trial. In Phase 1, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews and focus&#xD;
      group discussions with black African participants to obtain insights on overlapping and&#xD;
      resonating themes that will help increase participation in HIV testing among black Africans&#xD;
      in the Bronx. In Phase 2, data obtained through qualitative work will guide the development&#xD;
      of four health education videos. A culturally-tailored educational video on diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, and HIV will be developed and produced for each gender and in both English and&#xD;
      French. In phase 3, the investigators will test the feasibility of a pharmacy-based,&#xD;
      culturally-tailored, general health screen that includes rapid HIV testing. The trial will&#xD;
      help determine the feasibility of using a computer-based model; recruitment of black Africans&#xD;
      in the pharmacies; acceptance of testing; and linking individuals diagnosed with health&#xD;
      problems into medical care. A secondary analysis will also determine predictors of refusing&#xD;
      to be tested.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Black African immigrants living in the United States have exceptionally high rates of HIV and&#xD;
      AIDS. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter of the global HIV epidemic, accounting for&#xD;
      22.5 of the 33.3 million people living with HIV worldwide. Political, economic, and social&#xD;
      instability in many African countries has resulted in an escalating number of Africans&#xD;
      migrating to the United States. The number of black African immigrants in the U.S. is&#xD;
      growing, having increased 166% between 1990 and 2000. The 1.4 million documented African-born&#xD;
      immigrants in the U.S. in 2007 does not account for the many undocumented Africans living in&#xD;
      the U.S. Immigrant-related stressors, particularly for undocumented migrants, present&#xD;
      challenges to both black Africans and healthcare providers seeking to engage this community&#xD;
      in HIV testing and treatment. Characteristically long delays in accessing health services and&#xD;
      accepting HIV testing have resulted in a greater proportion of black Africans presenting with&#xD;
      an AIDS diagnosis (45%), compared to both U.S.-born non-blacks (25%) and U.S.-born blacks&#xD;
      (35%). As the U.S. community of black Africans continues to grow, efforts are needed to&#xD;
      reduce the impact of HIV within such marginalized communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of culturally sensitive voluntary HIV testing programs has discouraged early&#xD;
      diagnoses and treatment for African-born immigrants in the United States. The investigators&#xD;
      are developing a new theory-driven HIV testing program that builds on the successful history&#xD;
      of developing HIV testing models in the emergency department (ED), but relies on partners&#xD;
      from the black African immigrant community to address specific cultural, social, and&#xD;
      practical barriers to HIV testing faced by their communities. Traditional methods of HIV&#xD;
      testing have not been successful in testing high percentages of black Africans in the U.S.&#xD;
      for several reasons including (1) their reluctance to access health care for prevention; (2)&#xD;
      their unwillingness to disclose information to their social networks, thus rendering&#xD;
      ineffective the CDC-recommended social networking strategies for reaching disaffected&#xD;
      populations; (3) the stigma of HIV; and (4) cultural and migrant-specific factors that pose&#xD;
      barriers to accessing health care. The investigators propose to partner with black African&#xD;
      immigrant community members to identify the cultural and migrant-specific factors that&#xD;
      interfere with HIV testing, identify those that characterize the African migrant experience&#xD;
      regardless of country of origin, and develop videos that can be used to increase willingness&#xD;
      to be tested at community testing sites. The investigators plan to develop and pilot Project&#xD;
      Consensus, which will use a trusted community setting - the pharmacy - to establish a&#xD;
      permanent site for HIV testing that will engage large numbers of black Africans; increase HIV&#xD;
      awareness and eliminate the need to rely on social networks; and reduce stigma by placing HIV&#xD;
      testing in the context of a general health screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is based on eight years of research and experience developing and testing&#xD;
      BRIEF, a Bronx-based rapid HIV testing program in the ED that utilizes theory-based risk&#xD;
      reduction videos and a user-friendly interactive touch screen computer program. The&#xD;
      investigators have tested over 53,000 Bronx residents, with high acceptance rates (95%) for&#xD;
      adult HIV testing and a high rate (85%) of linking HIV+ patients into specialized medical&#xD;
      care. Project Consensus was developed out of recognition that BRIEF does not eliminate&#xD;
      important barriers to HIV testing for black African immigrants, a community that suffers&#xD;
      disproportionately from the health and social consequences of HIV. Given an increasing&#xD;
      emphasis within the U.S. on efficient preventive care, this intervention has the potential to&#xD;
      provide an exemplary method for engaging members of immigrant communities in earlier stages&#xD;
      of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three phases: Phase 1 consists of interviews and focus groups to obtain&#xD;
      community input on social and cultural barriers to testing. This input will frame the content&#xD;
      of a health education video, as well as the creation of an effective HIV testing program.&#xD;
      Phase 2 will develop the HIV testing intervention. Phase 3 is a feasibility trial to prepare&#xD;
      for a future randomized controlled trial. An advisory board composed of a diverse group of&#xD;
      African community leaders will inform and guide all three phases. There are three specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use individual interviews and focus groups to identify specific barriers to HIV testing&#xD;
           and assess appropriate methods to increase participation in voluntary HIV testing among&#xD;
           black African immigrants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a theory-based HIV video to educate and encourage black African immigrants to&#xD;
           get tested;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the feasibility of the intervention in a community pharmacy that places HIV&#xD;
           testing in a general health context, as determined by: standard deviation for the&#xD;
           primary outcome of HIV testing rates, use of a computer-based model; recruitment of&#xD;
           black Africans in the pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine the percentage of individuals diagnosed with one of three chronic&#xD;
                illnesses linked to care and determine predictors of those that refuse testing.&#xD;
