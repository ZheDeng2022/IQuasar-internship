  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of KHK2866 as&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, and in combination with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      subjects platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase 1a, groups of eligible patients with advanced solid tumors will receive KHK2866&#xD;
      as monotherapy in escalating doses. The Phase 1b portion will enroll patients with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who will receive KHK2866 in combination with one of three chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      (Arms): gemcitabine+carboplatin (platinum-sensitive, weekly paclitaxel (platinum-resistant),&#xD;
      or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (platinum-resistant). Escalating doses of the combination&#xD;
      of KHK2866 and the chemotherapy regimen will given to two groups of subjects per Arm. The&#xD;
      goal of the study is to learn about the side effects of KHK2866 alone or given in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. All subjects will receive study therapy for up to 6 cycles (up to 12&#xD;
      cycles for subjects assigned to PLD [Arm 3 of Phase 1b]), or until disease progression, the&#xD;
      development of severe side effects, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or&#xD;
      other removal criteria whichever comes first.&#xD;
