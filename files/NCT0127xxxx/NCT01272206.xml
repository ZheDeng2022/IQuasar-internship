      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (the rate at which the body eliminates the trial drug) of NNC 0128-0000-2011&#xD;
      compared to NNC 0128-0000-2021 when given for the first time to healthy human subjects.&#xD;
