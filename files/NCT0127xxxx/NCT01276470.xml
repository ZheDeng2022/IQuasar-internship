      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Like other complex diseases, autoimmune diseases are the result of numerous causes,&#xD;
           including genetic and environmental factors. Some researchers believe that people who&#xD;
           are susceptible to autoimmune disorders develop them when the body reacts to&#xD;
           environmental or other factors by creating white blood cells that attack the body s own&#xD;
           tissues, which then progresses to autoimmune diseases. These immune-triggered disorders&#xD;
           can overlap with one another to some extent, but most autoimmune diseases have certain&#xD;
           distinct triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The autoimmune disorder myositis weakens the muscles and may cause other health&#xD;
           problems. Environmental exposures associated with myositis include ultraviolet&#xD;
           radiation, stressful life events and muscle overexertion, collagen implants, infections&#xD;
           such as retroviruses and streptococci bacteria, and certain drugs and chemicals. Some&#xD;
           individuals with myositis also produce proteins in the blood called autoantibodies that&#xD;
           react with certain parts of the person s own cells, called synthetases, which are&#xD;
           involved in making new proteins. A syndrome called the anti-synthetase syndrome, which&#xD;
           includes myositis and lung disease, is associated with having the anti-synthetase&#xD;
           autoantibodies. Researchers are interested in studying differences in environmental&#xD;
           exposures in individuals with myositis. This study is being conducted to determine if&#xD;
           persons with the anti-synthetase syndrome have had different environmental exposures&#xD;
           before disease onset compared with other patients with myositis who do not have this&#xD;
           syndrome and also compared with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether selected infectious and noninfectious environmental exposures are more&#xD;
      common in individuals who have myositis with the anti-synthetase syndrome, compared with&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have been diagnosed with myositis (with or without anti-synthetase&#xD;
      autoantibodies), and healthy volunteers without autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, and&#xD;
           will provide blood, urine and house dust samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their medical history and the types of&#xD;
           exposures they have had at work, at home, and elsewhere. Participants who have myositis&#xD;
           will also be asked about certain infections, heavy exercise or physical exertion, sun&#xD;
           exposure, tobacco and alcohol use, and stressful events prior to being diagnosed with&#xD;
           the disease. Healthy volunteers will be asked about the same exposures before the date&#xD;
           of diagnosis of disease of the myositis subject to which they have been matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a kit that contains instructions and a filter to be put onto&#xD;
           their vacuum cleaner to collect house dust in the bedroom. This dust will be kept for&#xD;
           possible future analyses of infectious or toxic agents based on the other results from&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with myositis will have other tests as clinically indicated, including lung&#xD;
           function tests and imaging studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most autoimmune diseases are thought to develop as a result of chronic immune activation and&#xD;
      dysregulation after selected environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals.&#xD;
      Based on prior studies suggesting roles for noninfectious and infectious agents in the&#xD;
      development of myositis, as well as the known clinical, epidemiologic and genetic differences&#xD;
      among phenotypes, we hypothesize that different myositis phenotypes are triggered by&#xD;
      different environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. One phenotype that&#xD;
      is particularly well-defined clinically and genetically, and for which environmental triggers&#xD;
      are likely, is myositis associated with anti-synthetase autoantibodies (defined as the&#xD;
      anti-synthetase syndrome). These patients have an acute myositis onset in the spring of the&#xD;
      year and also tend to develop fevers, elevated white blood cell counts, arthritis and&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease. Although these features are consistent with an environmental&#xD;
      trigger for the anti-synthetase syndrome, and although case reports and animal models suggest&#xD;
      infectious or noninfectious agents may play a role, no study has systematically assessed&#xD;
      environmental agents in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with multiple centers, we plan to test the hypothesis that certain&#xD;
      environmental exposures are associated with the anti-synthetase syndrome and differ from&#xD;
      those seen in matched controls and in myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome.&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine whether selected noninfectious&#xD;
      environmental exposures are more common preceding disease onset in 150 recent-onset (defined&#xD;
      as within 24 months of meeting criteria for possible, probable or definite myositis) myositis&#xD;
      patients with the anti-synthetase syndrome, compared with 150 control subjects without&#xD;
      autoimmune disease (1:1 matched with the patients), and compared with 150 recent-onset&#xD;
      myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome; and 2) determine whether selected&#xD;
      infectious agents can be detected more frequently in blood samples of recent-onset&#xD;
      anti-synthetase syndrome patients compared with matched controls, and in blood or biopsy&#xD;
      samples from recent-onset anti-synthetase myositis patients compared with recent-onset&#xD;
      myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical histories, concurrent conditions and environmental questionnaire information will be&#xD;
      collected from all participants. Subjects will undergo a clinical, laboratory and immunologic&#xD;
      assessment to document current diagnoses, disease manifestations and severity. A chest x-ray,&#xD;
      high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage, and muscle and lung biopsies will be performed as clinically&#xD;
      indicated. Blood DNA and RNA sera, biopsy and house dust repositories will be created for&#xD;
      current and future investigations.&#xD;
