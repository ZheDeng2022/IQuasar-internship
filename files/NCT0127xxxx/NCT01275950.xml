  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Project aims at enlisting the outlets selling tobacco in any form and enlisting the&#xD;
      tobacco based advertisements (Direct and Surrogate) directed towards the community, within&#xD;
      100 yards of the selected educational institutes and studying their impact on the students of&#xD;
      that institute. This will further be followed by an intervention program directed at the&#xD;
      outlet owners which entails creating awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco and the&#xD;
      existing bill and thereby assessing any change in Knowledge, Attitude and Practice. The&#xD;
      results thus obtained will facilitate implementation of the existing Bill.&#xD;

      I. Preparatory Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of Four Educational Institutions for Intervention by Randomized Stratified&#xD;
           Sampling Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mumbai is divided into four zones as being South Mumbai, North Mumbai, East Mumbai and&#xD;
           West Mumbai. We shall enumerate all the institutions in these areas and by randomized&#xD;
           stratified sampling we shall select one institution from every area resulting in&#xD;
           selection of four educational institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment and Training of Staff This involves the recruitment of project personnel and&#xD;
           their training. Training would involve the theoretical and practical teaching about&#xD;
           health hazards and legal aspects of tobacco use, collecting information by introducing&#xD;
           questionnaire, conducting survey, method of area mapping of 100 yards around the&#xD;
           educational institution. They would also be trained in identifying establishments&#xD;
           selling tobacco based products, identifying direct and indirect tobacco based&#xD;
           advertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preparation of Resource Materials and Questionnaire Formats Resource materials to&#xD;
           educate the shop owners would be prepared. Questionnaires would be designed to asses the&#xD;
           pre and post intervention knowledge of shop owners regarding harmful effects of tobacco&#xD;
           and the anti-tobacco bill. A questionnaire to assess the impact of tobacco based&#xD;
           advertisements on them would also be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sector wise mapping Mapping of 100 yards of area around the selected education&#xD;
           institutions will be conducted by social workers and health care workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Activity Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enlisting of Tobacco/Tobacco Products Selling Establishments within 100 Yards of an&#xD;
           Educational Institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enlisting of Advertisements (direct or indirect) Within 100 yards of an Educational&#xD;
           Institution The above two activities will be conducted by social workers and healthcare&#xD;
           workers. They would survey 100 yards around the selected institution for area mapping&#xD;
           and enlisting the hoardings or any other form of advertisements of tobacco or tobacco&#xD;
           based products and shops where these products are sold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pre-Intervention Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observation of compliance with the law. This would involve observation of compliance&#xD;
           with the law with respect to presence of signage at the shops as per the current&#xD;
           regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Awareness Assessment. Assess awareness of shopkeepers (selling tobacco or tobacco based&#xD;
           products) about the harmful effects of tobacco and anti-tobacco law regarding sale of&#xD;
           tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here a questionnaire would be administered to the shopkeepers to assess their KAP regarding&#xD;
      harmful effects of tobacco and tobacco based products and the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Intervention Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementing the intervention programme designed for creating awareness about harmful&#xD;
           effect of tobacco (smoked and smokeless forms) and the current regulation to the&#xD;
           shop-owners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administering the questionnaire to objectively asses the impact of direct/ surrogate&#xD;
           tobacco advertisements influencing student behavior and perception about tobacco and&#xD;
           tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementing the intervention programme designed for creating awareness about harmful&#xD;
           effect of tobacco (smoked and smokeless forms) and the current regulation to the&#xD;
           students through interactive sessions with students in their respective educational&#xD;
           institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Post-Intervention Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Administering the questionnaire to objectively asses the impact of intervention programme&#xD;
      on the shop owners of tobacco and tobacco products selling outlets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluation Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of direct to surrogate advertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compliance of the educational institute with the Tobacco Bill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The proportion of surrogate advertisements which could be recalled with the original&#xD;
           tobacco brand, by the students of the selected educational institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
