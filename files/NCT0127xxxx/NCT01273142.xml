  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the difference in frequency and level of liver&#xD;
      function disturbance between patients on efavirenz based ART, and patients on nevirapine&#xD;
      based ART in HBV and HCV co-infected patients, (and/or with patients with abnormal liver&#xD;
      function prior to ART), in China. Liver function tests will be measured at baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a significant&#xD;
      reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. However, the frequent occurrence of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis progressing toward cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma has been recognized as&#xD;
      an increasing contributor to death of HIV-infected patients since early in the HAART era In&#xD;
      China among the estimated 700,000 people living with HIV in China as of 20061, the percentage&#xD;
      of HIV/HCV co-infected patients is high at 56.9%2. For these reasons, during HAART scrupulous&#xD;
      attention should paid to the patients' liver function. At present, for price consideration,&#xD;
      the NNRTI HIV drug used for antiretroviral therapy in China is nevirapine, which may lead to&#xD;
      higher potential risk of liver function disturbance in clinical practice than&#xD;
      efavirenz4-5.Roberto Manfredi and his colleagues3found that in a NVP treated group, patients&#xD;
      showed at least a 2-fold increase of transaminases versus baseline as hepotoxicity index,&#xD;
      while in EFV group, the number of patients with hepotoxicity showed a reduction, Also in the&#xD;
      same study, time to reach transaminase peak value was shorter in the NVP group, which also&#xD;
      demonstrate the liver toxicity side effect in NVP group. Recently some data has also shown an&#xD;
      unusually high incidence of liver function disturbance in patients on HIV antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy in China6. Therefore to evaluate frequency and risk of patient hepatotoxicity caused&#xD;
      by different HAART regimens in HBV-/HCV- co-infected HIV patients is necessary to provide&#xD;
      evidence therapy for what HAART treatment should be used in China.&#xD;
