  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dual mobility design concept for acetabular liners, as is used in the Restoration ADM&#xD;
      Acetabular System, has been applied in various implants since its introduction by Gilles&#xD;
      Bousquet in France in 1976. Dual mobility cups have shown good clinical results and have been&#xD;
      particularly lauded for low incidence of dislocations. However, the wear performance of this&#xD;
      design concept has not been proven to date. As wear particles are a possible contributing&#xD;
      factor in aseptic loosening, the assessment of wear and fixation is an important step in&#xD;
      proving this implant design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will combine RSA and peri-prosthetic bone mineral density as well as&#xD;
      outcome questionnaires to provide a complete in vivo evaluation of prosthesis fixation,&#xD;
      polyethylene wear, and objective and subjective outcomes for the Restoration ADM Acetabular&#xD;
      System.&#xD;

      Question 1: a) Do the implant components of the Restoration ADM Acetabular System achieve&#xD;
      adequate fixation to the underlying bone? Null Hypothesis: There is no significant increase&#xD;
      in micromotion of the implant components after 1 year indicating adequate long-term fixation&#xD;
      at the implant - bone interface. Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant increase in&#xD;
      micromotion of of the implant components after 1 year indicating inadequate fixation at the&#xD;
      implant - bone interface. b) What are the migration patterns (translations and rotations) of&#xD;
      the Restoration ADM Acetabular System components during the first three years&#xD;
      postoperatively? c) For what proportion of implants does migration continue to increase&#xD;
      during the three year follow-up? d) Are inducible displacements, measured during&#xD;
      weight-bearing follow-up exams, consistent over time and do they indicate that adequate&#xD;
      fixation has been achieved? e) Are there significant differences in migration patterns&#xD;
      (translations and rotations) between the Restoration ADM Acetabular System components and&#xD;
      other implants previously studied with RSA and reported in the literature? Question 2: a) How&#xD;
      much does the femoral head wear into the polyethylene liner?b)How much backside wear occurs&#xD;
      on the polyethylene liner? c)How does the total wear compare to that with other implants&#xD;
      previously reported in the literature? Question 3: Does the polyethylene liner demonstrate&#xD;
      mobile bearing properties? Question 4: a) Are there changes over time in bone mineral density&#xD;
      of peri-prosthetic bone with the Restoration ADM Acetabular System components? b) Where do&#xD;
      changes in bone mineral density occur? Question 5: Does total hip arthroplasty using the&#xD;
      Restoration ADM Acetabular System result in significant improvement in health status and&#xD;
      functional outcome?&#xD;
