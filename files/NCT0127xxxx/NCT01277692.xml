    <textblock>
      This study is a three Part, Phase 1, randomized, dose-escalation, fusion, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind study to determine the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      GSK2336805 in healthy subjects and the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral profile of&#xD;
      GSK2336805 in subjects chronically infected with HCV: i. Single doses in healthy subjects and&#xD;
      the effect of food on GSK2336805 PK (Part 1). ii. Repeat doses in healthy subjects (Part 2)&#xD;
      iii. Single doses in chronically infected HCV positive subjects (Part 3).&#xD;

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational entities within 12 months prior to the&#xD;
             first dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components&#xD;
             or drugs of their class, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if&#xD;
             heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin&#xD;
             or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Holter monitoring shows one or more of the following: Any symptomatic arrhythmia&#xD;
             (except isolated extra systoles); Sustained cardiac arrhythmias (such as atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation or flutter, sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) (&gt;10 consecutive&#xD;
             beats)); Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (defined as &gt;3 consecutive&#xD;
             ventricular ectopic beats); Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to&#xD;
             left or right complete bundle branch block, atrioventricular (AV) block [2nd degree or&#xD;
             higher in an awake subject], Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) syndrome, other&#xD;
             pre-excitation syndromes); Symptomatic sinus pause or sinus pause &gt;3 seconds - unless&#xD;
             patient is straining, vomiting, or having some other type of hypervagal response; 300&#xD;
             or more supraventricular ectopic beats in 24 hours; 250 or more ventricular ectopic&#xD;
             beats in 24 hours; Ischemia, diagnosed by a sequence of EKG changes that include flat&#xD;
             or down sloping ST-segment depression &gt;0.1 mV, with a gradual onset and offset that&#xD;
             lasts for a minimum period of 1 minute. Each episode of ischemia must be separated by&#xD;
             a minimum duration of at least 1 minute, during which the ST segment returns back to&#xD;
             baseline (1x1x1 rule)&#xD;
