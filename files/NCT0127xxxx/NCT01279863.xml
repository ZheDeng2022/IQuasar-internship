      The VRI technology provides a radiation free dynamic image of the lung, by using a&#xD;
      combination of well-known technologies, i.e. acoustic sensors, and a proprietary algorithm.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine if the VRI examination may contribute to the diagnosis&#xD;
      and follow up of pneumonia in children, and therefore reduce the number of chest radiographs&#xD;
      and the exposure to ionizing radiation. Children referred by ED for chest x-ray,for the&#xD;
      evaluation of pneumonia, will undergo VRI as well. The two modalities will be read&#xD;
      independently and then the findings will be compared, in order to asses the potential role of&#xD;
      the VRI to the management of pneumonia in children.&#xD;

      Background Several widely used imaging modalities are available today for the human lung.&#xD;
      Conventional radiology, CT, and to a lesser extent MRI, as well as nuclear medicine in some&#xD;
      indications are well established and most commonly used. Methods using acoustic signals, most&#xD;
      notably ultrasound, have not been successfully developed. This is primarily due to the fact&#xD;
      that the acoustic damping of the lung parenchyma is prohibitively high at high frequencies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of alterations in the structure and function of thoracic organs that occur in&#xD;
      disease often gives rise to measurable changes in lung sound production and transmission.&#xD;
      Acoustic assessment with a stethoscope is a commonly used method to assess these structural&#xD;
      and functional changes. However, auscultation with a stethoscope has many limitations. It is&#xD;
      a subjective process that depends on the individual's own hearing, experience and ability to&#xD;
      differentiate between different sound patterns. In addition, quantitative measurements and&#xD;
      documentation are not easy to be produced. Moreover, the stethoscope has a frequency response&#xD;
      that attenuates frequency components of the lung sound signal above 120Hz, and the human ear&#xD;
      is not very sensitive to the lower frequency band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of acoustic sounds by computer is more likely to be successful in clinical&#xD;
      applications when it is based on mathematical models of the underlying physical mechanisms of&#xD;
      respiratory sound production. Such models allow for the interaction of mechanical forces,&#xD;
      airflow and sound transmission within the respiratory tract to be understood and related to&#xD;
      the different disease processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI technology, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to provide a&#xD;
      radiation free dynamic image of the lung, by using a combination of well-known technologies,&#xD;
      i.e. acoustic sensors, and a proprietary algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the acoustic response of a body depends on its structural properties, complex&#xD;
      structures can exhibit acoustic responses, which may vary in space, time and frequency.&#xD;
      Moreover, any structural alteration, such as a bronchial obstruction or space occupying&#xD;
      infiltration, is reflected by a corresponding modification of the acoustic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI takes advantage of this physical principle, by means of an imaging system. By&#xD;
      attaching a two dimensional matrix of acoustic transducers to the back of the patient, a&#xD;
      dynamic image that integrates the acoustic characteristics of the underlying structure is&#xD;
      generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI device may provide a complementary diagnostic tool for lung examination and aid the&#xD;
      physician in determining whether a chest x-ray should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Device The VRI system is a computerized-based, radiation free device intended for&#xD;
      non-invasive recording, audio reproduction, and dynamic image display of vibration response&#xD;
      to the airflow during respiration. (The VRI system incorporates a flow volume sensor in which&#xD;
      the patient may/may not breathe through it). The VRI system incorporates pressure sensors&#xD;
      (electronic stethoscopes) that have been specially adapted to capture and record the energy&#xD;
      created by the airflow in the lungs during the respiration process. Sensors are mounted in&#xD;
      two sensor matrices, which are attached to the patient's back by a low vacuum and/or&#xD;
      biocompatible medical stickers method. The signals are transmitted through wires from the&#xD;
      sensor matrix to the hardware board. The analog signals are then processed online on a&#xD;
      multi-channels hardware board by amplifying, sampling and A/D conversion. The digital data is&#xD;
      transmitted to the PC platform. Once on the PC platform, Deep Breeze proprietary algorithms&#xD;
      generate the dynamic lung image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Analysis Unlike X-Ray based methodologies, which expose the subject to ionization&#xD;
      radiation, the VRI is radiation free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI elements that come into contact with the subject's skin are biocompatible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI has been approved by an independent authorized laboratory to be electrically safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, so far, no adverse events, risks of illness, injuries, or discomforts have been&#xD;
      associated with the use of the VRI in previous studies. Therefore, it is reasonable to&#xD;
      conclude that the VRI does not pose any risk to the subjects and/or operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale Various reports and studies have suggested that a reduction of up to 50% of X&#xD;
      rays could be achieved without detriment to the care and treatment of patients. A&#xD;
      considerable number of the X-ray procedures carried out today produce no meaningful or useful&#xD;
      diagnostic information and it is the elimination of these examinations that would bring about&#xD;
      this reduction, as stated by the Irish Institute of Radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study investigated the use of the chest X-ray (CXR) in a typical urban practice with&#xD;
      reference to the Royal College of Radiology (RCR) guidelines. A total of 569 CXRs were&#xD;
      performed in 482 patients. Thirty per cent of the CXRs were assessed as being &quot;not indicated&quot;&#xD;
      and a significant percentage of requests did not come within the RCR guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) Working Party at least 20% of the&#xD;
      radiological examinations carried out in NHS hospitals are clinically unhelpful. This&#xD;
      translates over the whole country to an annual total of 7 million unnecessary X-ray&#xD;
      examinations costing about Â£60 million, with the highest numbers of unnecessary X-ray&#xD;
      examinations being those of chest and the greatest financial costs arising from examinations&#xD;
      of the chest and from barium investigations. , , Unnecessary radiation exposure during&#xD;
      medical procedures should be avoided. This is particularly important when the patient is a&#xD;
      child, since children exposed to radiation are at a relatively greater risk than adults. The&#xD;
      American College of Radiology has noted, &quot;Because they have more rapidly dividing cells than&#xD;
      adults and have longer life expectancy, the odds that children will develop cancers from&#xD;
      x-ray radiation may be significantly higher than adults.&quot; It has been estimated by the&#xD;
      National Research Council's Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation that&#xD;
      children less than 10 years of age are several times more sensitive to radiation than&#xD;
      middle-aged adults .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI device may provide a complementary diagnostic tool for lung examination and aid the&#xD;
      physician in determining whether a chest x-ray (CXR) is necessary and thereby reduce the&#xD;
      number of negative CXR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Clinical Experience The device has already been used for investigational purposes&#xD;
      in a number of medical centers (Israel, USA, Europe and Japan). All clinical studies were&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the ICH-GCP guidelines as well as the local laws and regulations&#xD;
      relevant to the use of new diagnostic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data was collected and analyzed for more than 3000 adult subjects during a period of&#xD;
      more than three years. No related adverse events were reported during the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The principal objective of the pilot study is to acquire database of pneumonia cases in&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objective is to correlate the clinical and CXR data with the VRI results.&#xD;
