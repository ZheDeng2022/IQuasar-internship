      This study will examine the hypothesis that iloprost maintains and improves ventilation&#xD;
      perfusion matching in patients with pulmonary hypertension and ARDS/ALI as reflected by 1) an&#xD;
      improved PaO2/FIO2 ratio as calculated from the measured arterial blood gases obtained before&#xD;
      and after iloprost administration, 2) an improvement in lung compliance, and 3) an&#xD;
      improvement in the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and CO2 measured by expired gas&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      Purpose/hypothesis This study will examine the hypothesis that iloprost maintains and&#xD;
      improves ventilation perfusion matching in patients with pulmonary hypertension and ARDS/ALI&#xD;
      as reflected by 1) an improved PaO2/FIO2 ratio as calculated from the measured arterial blood&#xD;
      gases obtained before and after iloprost administration, 2) an improvement in lung&#xD;
      compliance, and 3) an improvement in the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and CO2 measured&#xD;
      by expired gas analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design Twenty patients with pulmonary hypertension and ARDS/ALI will be&#xD;
      enrolled. This will be 2-3 hour study conducted on a single day in which each patient's&#xD;
      baseline measurements obtained prior to iloprost administration are compared to measurements&#xD;
      obtained 30 minutes and 2 hours after Iloprost inhalation. While critically ill by virtue of&#xD;
      their underlying illness, patients will be clinically stable over the preceding 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to entry into the study as evidenced by airway pressures and arterial O2 saturation that vary&#xD;
      less than 10% on the same ventilator settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed procedure After baseline measurements are obtained, 10 mcg iloprost will be&#xD;
      administered via nebulizer on the inspiratory line of the ventilator. Vital signs including&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial saturation by pulse oximetry&#xD;
      will be monitored at baseline and q 5 minutes after the inhalation of iloprost. Thirty (30)&#xD;
      minutes after the administration of iloprost the gas exchange, pulmonary function and&#xD;
      arterial blood gas measurements will be repeated as described above. Patients who remain&#xD;
      clinically stable as evidenced by a fall in arterial PO2 &lt;5 mm Hg, fall in systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure of &lt;10% and increase in heart rate of &lt;10 beats/min as well as the absence of&#xD;
      symptoms 30 minutes after the inhalation of 20 mcg of iloprost will receive a second dose of&#xD;
      20 mcg. Vital signs will continue to be monitored continuously and 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      second dose of iloprost, all pulmonary measurements will be repeated. All patients will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously for at least 2 hours after the final dose of iloprost and pulmonary&#xD;
      testing will be repeated for a final time 2 hours after the last administration of iloprost.&#xD;
      Patients will be deemed to have completed the study after 2 hours provided their vital signs&#xD;
      have returned to within 10% of baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of knowledge reasonably expected to result from the research A positive result in&#xD;
      this pilot study will provide a strong rationale leading to a larger long-term study&#xD;
      examining the effect of continuous iloprost therapy over several days on pulmonary&#xD;
      hemodynamics, gas exchange, and outcome in patients with ARDS/ALI. Markers of inflammation&#xD;
      (IL-6 and IL-8), coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimer) and collagen&#xD;
      formation (TGF* and procollagen peptide III) in lung BAL fluid would be monitored to&#xD;
      demonstrate iloprost's potential beneficial effects on lung remodeling in this devastating&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the research involves more than minimal risk, describe the research plan for monitoring&#xD;
      the data collected to ensure the safety of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data safety monitoring board will meet after the first six patients and determine whether to&#xD;
      continue.&#xD;
