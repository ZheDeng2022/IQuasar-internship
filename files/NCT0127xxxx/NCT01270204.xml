    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of taste on swallowing efficiency, to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of temperature on swallowing efficiency, and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      viscosity on swallowing efficiency.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Swallowing problems (dysphagia) are encountered frequently in primary practice and in the&#xD;
      hospital setting. The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and neurological&#xD;
      disease to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery. Many patients have a&#xD;
      reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat (pharynx) and&#xD;
      this leads to an inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct manner. This can&#xD;
      produce a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and fluids, regurgitation,&#xD;
      aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of dysphagia is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education&#xD;
      about safe swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid from entering the&#xD;
      airway. One of the most widely accepted treatments of dysphagia is to alter the texture of&#xD;
      food. Most patients with dysphagia will have more difficulty swallowing thin liquids. By&#xD;
      adding a thickener to the liquid, a food bolus becomes more cohesive, and is less likely to&#xD;
      become aspirated. Various types of thickening products are available over-the-counter without&#xD;
      a prescription. These thickening products are bland and currently have no flavor. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that alterations in food taste (sweet, salty, etcâ€¦), viscosity, and temperature,&#xD;
      will improve swallowing efficiency. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of food taste, texture, and temperature on swallowing efficiency. The goal is to&#xD;
      develop safer, better tasting food products and improve the quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      disabling swallowing disorders.&#xD;

    <description>Digital accelerometry is a non-invasive method of measuring swallowing efficiency. A surface sensor is taped to the skin over the region of the thyroid prominence. When the patient swallows, the sensors measures upward acceleration of the thyroid cartilage and a measurement of swallowing amplitude, a surrogate measure for swallowing efficiency, is obtained.</description>
