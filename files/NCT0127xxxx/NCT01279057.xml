  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the safety and efficacy of a generic fluticasone furoate (Lek&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals) nasal spray to the reference listed drug in the treatment of seasonal&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis. Additionally both the test and the reference formulations were tested for&#xD;
      superiority against a placebo nasal spray.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      multi-site to compare the clinical equivalence of the test formulation of fluticasone&#xD;
      furoate, 27.5 mcg/actuation nasal spray (Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d.) with the reference&#xD;
      formulation Veramyst® nasal spray (GlaxoSmithKline) in the relief of the signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria entered&#xD;
      a 7-day placebo lead-in period. Following this placebo lead-in period, on Day 1 participants&#xD;
      who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      three treatment groups (Test Product:Reference Product:Placebo) for 14 days of treatment. In&#xD;
      all treatment groups, participants were instructed to administer the study drug once daily at&#xD;
      approximately the same time each day. A single dose of 110 mcg was 4 actuations, each&#xD;
      containing 27.5 mcg per actuation. Patients were instructed to administer the 4 actuations&#xD;
      alternating between right and left nostril, such that 2 actuations were not administered back&#xD;
      to back to the same nostril.&#xD;

    <measure>PRIMARY: Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) (Equivalence: Per-Protocol Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

        <title>PRIMARY: Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) (Equivalence: Per-Protocol Population)</title>
        <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

        <title>PRIMARY: Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) (Superiority: Intent-to-Treat Population)</title>
        <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS) (Superiority: Intent-to-Treat Population)</title>
        <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTOSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of ocular symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 3 ocular symptoms (eye redness, itching/burning eyes, and tearing/watering eyes) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 3 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTOSS, which ranged from 0 to 9 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTOSS was calculated by summing the means of the 3 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTOSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTOSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline is considered a favorable outcome.</description>
