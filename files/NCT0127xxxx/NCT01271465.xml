  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if substances measured in a small piece of the donor&#xD;
      organ predicts how well the organ will function in the recipient after transplant. We will be&#xD;
      testing blood, urine, and biopsy tissue samples in this study. The research team will be&#xD;
      looking at different risk factors in the donor organ that predict how well the kidney will do&#xD;
      in the recipient.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early post-transplant kidney function can be attributed to inherent donor characteristics,&#xD;
      damage from storage, and perioperative events and recipients factors. The incidence of severe&#xD;
      injury to the transplant kidneys is 10-25% in the early post-transplant period. In addition,&#xD;
      milder forms of early transplant kidney injury can impact on long term allograft function.&#xD;
      Severe transplant kidney injury in the immediate post-transplant period has been hypothesized&#xD;
      to be associated with higher rates of rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current investigation, we would like to test the hypotheses that 1) mRNA and microRNA&#xD;
      expression of proinflammatory genes in donor tissues is a risk factor for development of&#xD;
      early kidney transplant dysfunction and 2) early inflammatory mRNA and microRNA expression in&#xD;
      the allograft is associated with subsequent activation of cell mediated immunity as evidenced&#xD;
      by increased incidence of acute rejection episodes and increased expression of cell mediated&#xD;
      immunity genes during the first year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the association between proinflammatory mRNA and microRNA expression in donor&#xD;
      samples and subsequent development of early organ dysfunction in the immediate period&#xD;
      following transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the association of mRNA and microRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators in&#xD;
      the transplanted organ in the immediate pre and post-reperfusion period with subsequent&#xD;
      incidence of acute rejection and expression of genes involved in cell mediated immunity.&#xD;

        Renal allograft recipients are generally in good health and many return to work by three&#xD;
        months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        However, they are maintained on immunosuppressive medications to maintain the function of&#xD;
        the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
