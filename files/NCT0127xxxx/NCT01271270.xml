      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in&#xD;
           the back of the eye, and leak blood and other fluids that damage the eye, produce&#xD;
           scarring, and lead to blindness. People diagnosed with wet AMD have increased production&#xD;
           of a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is important&#xD;
           in the formation of blood vessels in the body, and decreasing the production of VEGF is&#xD;
           believed to help wet AMD patients by preventing or slowing the growth of the abnormal&#xD;
           blood vessels. Anti-VEGF drugs have been used to decrease the production of VEGF, but&#xD;
           some people do not respond completely to these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A protein in the body called mTOR also plays a critical role in regulating how cells&#xD;
           divide and grow and obtain their blood supply. The experimental chemical Palomid 529&#xD;
           inhibits the production of mTOR. Researchers are interested in determining whether&#xD;
           Palomid 529 is safe and can help individuals with wet AMD who have not completely&#xD;
           responded to anti-VEGF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Palomid 529 as a treatment for wet age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration in individuals who have not responded to standard anti-VEGF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals with wet age-related macular degeneration in at least one eye that has not&#xD;
      responded to standard anti-VEGF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the first visit, participants should have been seen at the National Eye&#xD;
           Institute clinic under a screening or teaching protocol, or NIH protocol 08-EI-0103,&#xD;
           High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings in Induction Regimen of Intravitreal&#xD;
           Ranibizumab Injection for Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration. One eye will be&#xD;
           designated as the study eye to receive the Palomid 529 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a full physical examination and medical history, a full eye&#xD;
           examination to evaluate eye health and vision, angiography to examine the blood vessels&#xD;
           in the eyes, and blood and urine tests during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive an injection of Palomid 529 into the study eye every 4 weeks&#xD;
           during the study, for a total of three injections. Participants may also receive&#xD;
           anti-VEGF injections such as ranibizumab (Lucentis ) or bevacizumab (Avastin ) in the&#xD;
           study eye 12 days before and 12 days after the Palomid 529 injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have standard-of-care treatments for the non-study eye if it has wet&#xD;
           AMD as well, but may not receive experimental treatments in the non-study eye while they&#xD;
           are in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for long-term follow-up examinations as directed by the study&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paloma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a non-steroidal, wholly synthetic, small molecule&#xD;
      drug for application to diseases of aberrant neovasculature, known as Palomid 529.1 Palomid&#xD;
      529 exerts broad activity as an anti-angiogenic agent by inhibiting the mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (Akt/mTor) signal transduction pathway via dissociation of both target of rapamycin&#xD;
      complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) in the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palomid 529 when&#xD;
      administered as subconjunctival injections in participants with choroidal neovascularization&#xD;
      (CNV) secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll participants with neovascular AMD who have not responded to&#xD;
      conventional anti-VEGF treatments. Five participants will be initially accrued; however, up&#xD;
      to seven participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12-week, unmasked, non-randomized study of three serial 1.9 mg subconjunctival&#xD;
      doses of Palomid 529 in neovascular AMD participants who have not responded to conventional&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to determine the safety of subconjunctival Palomid 529 for neovascular&#xD;
      AMD. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of ocular and systemic adverse events.&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy outcomes include changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), changes&#xD;
      in fluid status, central retinal thickness and retinal volume as measured by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT), changes in leakage patterns as observed on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography (FA), changes in CNV patterns as observed on indocyanine green angiography (ICG),&#xD;
      changes in autofluorescence patterns as observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging,&#xD;
      and changes in fundus appearance as observed on color fundus photography. Additionally,&#xD;
      Complement Factor H polymorphisms will be compared with treatment response and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.&#xD;

             or intraretinal fluid is present)in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received an anti-VEGF injection in the study eye within 12 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received or has been receiving intraocular steroids in the study eye&#xD;
