  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle cramp is defined as a paroxysmal, involuntary, and painful contraction of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle. Cirrhotic patients can encounter with muscle cramp frequently, which might be&#xD;
      associated with poor quality of life. Gabapentin can be prescribed for muscle cramp. However,&#xD;
      patients with liver cirrhosis have limited access to gabapentin which is metabolized&#xD;
      primarily in liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin with a similar mechanism of action to gabapentin undergoes negligible metabolism&#xD;
      owing to its improved pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, pregabalin might be a promising&#xD;
      therapeutic option for patients with liver cirrhosis who are suffering from muscle cramp and&#xD;
      susceptible to drug-induced hepatotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that pregabalin could effectively reduce painful&#xD;
      symptoms derived from muscle cramp. In the current study, the investigators are going to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin by comparing outcomes between two groups&#xD;
      (treatment group vs. placebo group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to recruit patients with liver cirrhosis and muscle cramp, and&#xD;
      collect the baseline clinical and laboratory data during the 4-week run-in period for each&#xD;
      subject. After a run-in period, there will be the second step of patient selection to achieve&#xD;
      a more homogenous study population. Then, patients will be randomly allocated into the&#xD;
      treatment (pregabalin) and placebo (dummy) arms, by a web-based randomization program. After&#xD;
      a treatment period (75 mg twice daily during the first 1 week as titration, 150 mg twice&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks as standard dose), the investigators will gather further study information&#xD;
      of a standard dose period (150mg twice daily for 4 weeks) from the target population and the&#xD;
      study subjects will enter the 1-week tapering period (75mg twice a day) to discontinuation.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference in the frequency of muscle cramps between the&#xD;
      run-in and treatment phases. The investigators also intend to assess the response rate,&#xD;
      defined as the proportion (%) of patients showing ≥50% reduction in the number of muscle&#xD;
      cramps, mean change in the average pain intensity, mean change in the score of the Short Form&#xD;
      36 (SF-36, QualityMetric) health survey questionnaire, mean change in the frequency of muscle&#xD;
      cramps during sleep, and mean change in the average cramp threshold frequency by the&#xD;
      neurophysiologic study (nerve excitability test) and analyze the reasons for drop-out cases.&#xD;
