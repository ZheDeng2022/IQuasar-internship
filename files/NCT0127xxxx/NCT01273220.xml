      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Alcohol use disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders in the United States and are&#xD;
      a factor in more than 10 percent of all deaths, including heart disease, stroke, and certain&#xD;
      types of cancer and chronic illness. Research into better treatment methods for alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders and their associated disabilities requires a broad amount of information on the&#xD;
      genetic and environmental factors that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism. To&#xD;
      improve the quality of available information for research, the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      is conducting a nationwide survey on alcohol use disorders and related physical and mental&#xD;
      disabilities, and will collect genetic information through saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect interview data and saliva samples from the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized&#xD;
      population, 18 years and older, in order to study the extent of and contributing factors to&#xD;
      alcohol use and abuse in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who do not live in institutions (i.e., prisons,&#xD;
      inpatient mental hospitals) and who are willing to be interviewed in English, Spanish, and&#xD;
      the four most commonly spoken Asian languages in the United States (e.g., Chinese, Korean).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve three main components: an automated computer-assisted interview,&#xD;
           an automated questionnaire, and the collection of a saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited through community through publically available U.S.&#xD;
           Census Bureau files.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interview and questionnaire will ask standardized questions related to personal&#xD;
           history; alcohol use and possible disorders; symptoms scales of mood, anxiety, and&#xD;
           eating conditions that frequently co-occur with alcohol and drug use disorders; tobacco,&#xD;
           medicine and drug use and disorders; selected personality traits, including behavior;&#xD;
           alcohol, drug, and mental health treatment utilization; and medical conditions related&#xD;
           to alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a saliva sample for genetic study.&#xD;

      The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III) is&#xD;
      planned to be fielded in 2012 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&#xD;
      (NIAAA) in conjunction with Westat, through a contract under data collection authority Title&#xD;
      42 U.S.C. 285 n (Attachment 23.a). The target population of the NESARC-III is the civilian&#xD;
      noninstitutionalized population, 18 years and older, residing in the contiguous United States&#xD;
      (U.S.) and Alaska and Hawaii. The sample (N=46,500) will include households and selected&#xD;
      noninstitutionalized group quarters (e.g., agricultural, vocational training and other&#xD;
      dormitories, halfway houses, hostels, YMCAs, shelters, campgrounds, carnivals). The&#xD;
      NESARC-III will collect information on alcohol use disorders and related physical and mental&#xD;
      disabilities in addition to DNA to be obtained through saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This request for IRB approval also includes a pilot test of approximately 50 respondents that&#xD;
      will serve the sole purpose of testing the data collection procedures, operations and system&#xD;
      architecture of the NESARC-III survey. There will also be two small methodological&#xD;
      subcomponents of the NESARC-III proper that will serve the purposes of providing ongoing&#xD;
      validation and assessment of the utility of outcome measures appearing on the major data&#xD;
      collection questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview&#xD;
      Schedule-V (AUDADIS-V: Grant et al., 2008). In the first methodological subcomponent, 1000&#xD;
      respondents participating in the NESARC-III proper will be re-interviewed with a shorter&#xD;
      version of the original AUDADIS-V. In the second methodological subcomponent, 700 different&#xD;
      respondents participating in the NESARC-III proper will be re-interviewed using a different&#xD;
      assessment instrument, the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (PRISM: Hasin et al., 2008), covering information on major outcome variables very similar to&#xD;
      those appearing in the AUDADIS-V. NIAAA has conducted such validation/utility tests that have&#xD;
      received OMB approval (OMB No. 0930-0151, OMB No. 0925-0455: Grant et al., 2003a; Ruan et&#xD;
      al., 2008) in the past. The design and procedures associated with each of these&#xD;
      methodological subcomponents will be explicated and discussed within the body of this IRB&#xD;
      submission as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NESARC-III will be the fourth national survey conducted by NIAAA. The objectives and&#xD;
      content areas of the NESARC-III are extremely similar to those of the prior three NIAAA&#xD;
      surveys, with the exception of the NESARC-III s provision for collecting saliva samples.&#xD;
      Prior NIAAA national surveys included the 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol&#xD;
      Epidemiologic Survey (OMB No. 0930-0151: Grant et al., 1994), the 2001-2002 Wave 1 NESARC&#xD;
      (OMB No. 0925-0484: Grant et al., 2003b), and the 2004-2005 Wave 2 NESARC (OMB No. 0925-0484:&#xD;
      Grant et al., 2006).&#xD;
