    <textblock>
      This clinical validation study is aimed at testing the efficacy of a new environmental&#xD;
      challenge chamber (ECC) to induce symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients allergic to house&#xD;
      dust mite. The symptoms will be recorded on a validated symptom score as Total Nasal Symptom&#xD;
      Score (TNSS), allowing for determine whether the challenge is dose dependent and&#xD;
      reproducible.&#xD;

      At Fraunhofer ITEM, a novel technique to create an atmosphere loaded with allergenic&#xD;
      particles was recently developed. In brief, particles are produced in a combined process of&#xD;
      nebulization and drying of a solution containing soluble allergenic extracts and lactose. The&#xD;
      particle size distribution is regulated by the droplet size distribution and the lactose&#xD;
      concentration in the solution, while the allergen content can be chosen independently. Thus,&#xD;
      the Fraunhofer scientists have created a universal tool which provides them with the&#xD;
      possibility to create atmospheres containing allergenic particles of arbitrary sizes&#xD;
      containing a variety of different allergens. By choosing particle sizes preferentially&#xD;
      depositing in the nose (above 10 µm) or the lungs (5 to 10 µm), and selecting allergen&#xD;
      concentrations commonly found in the environment, it is possible to build up challenge&#xD;
      atmospheres for a large variety of indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first clinical application of this new method will be to create an atmosphere simulating&#xD;
      the natural exposure to house dust mite allergens. The challenge aerosol will be composed of&#xD;
      lactose as carrier material and the two major allergens Der p1 and Der p2 of house dust mites&#xD;
      originating from a licenced allergen extract for inhaled challenge.&#xD;
