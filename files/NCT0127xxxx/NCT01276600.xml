      Describe the dose-proportionality and intra-individual variability of tenofovir diphosphate&#xD;
      (TFV-DP) and emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP) at steady-state in healthy human&#xD;
      participants taking TruvadaÂ® (FTC 200mg/TDF 300 mg) under direct observation.&#xD;

      This PK study is designed to establish the dose-proportionality of TFV and FTC (serum and&#xD;
      intracellular forms) with daily to weekly dosing. This information is essential to (1) employ&#xD;
      drug concentration as an adherence measure in future PrEP studies, and (2) to estimate the&#xD;
      anticipated concentration of parent and active moieties of TFV and FTC in intermittent PrEP&#xD;
      regimens associated with full adherence to a prescribed regimen. In addition,&#xD;
      intra-individual variability will be assessed to improve sample size estimates in future PrEP&#xD;
      studies that use drug concentration as an adherence measure or where PK-PD correlations are&#xD;
      planned. The dose-proportionality of intra-cellular phosphates of the two components of the&#xD;
      study product has not previously been established. Given the complexity of movement of these&#xD;
      drugs between body compartments (central compartment, vaginal mucosal tissue, vaginal lumen,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal mucosal tissue, gastrointestinal lumen), into cells within these&#xD;
      compartments, and intra-cellular phosphorylation, it is possible that non-dose proportional&#xD;
      kinetics, such as mixed or zero-order saturable processes may be operating.&#xD;
