  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose that the addition of rituximab will lower the risk&#xD;
      of systemic and local relapses in patients with localized PBL. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      6 cycles of RCHOP-14 or RCHOP-21. The administration of radiotherapy following chemotherapy&#xD;
      is strongly recommended, based on the findings of the retrospective IELSG study, but will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the treating center.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Stage IE or IIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have at least one objective measurable or evaluable disease. Baseline&#xD;
             measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration to the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;

             studies ( within 2 weeks prior to registration):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and AST &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal. If documented&#xD;

                  documented bone marrow involvement with lymphoma, absolute neutrophil count &gt;&#xD;
                  500/mm3 and platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  historical or radiographic evidence of CNS metastasis including previously treated,&#xD;
             resected or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptomeningeal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant or breast feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential and sexually&#xD;
