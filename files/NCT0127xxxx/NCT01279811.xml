      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure the pressure in the spinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord to find out how&#xD;
           well the spinal cord is being supplied with blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine how drugs called &quot;vasopressors&quot;, which are used to control blood pressure&#xD;
           following SCI (spinal cord injury), influence spinal fluid pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize the severity of an SCI using the levels of specific proteins found within&#xD;
           the spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Predict how much neurologic recovery may be regained using the levels of specific&#xD;
           proteins within your spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify proteins within the spinal fluid that will help us learn more about what is&#xD;
           happening after SCI and assist us in developing new treatments for SCI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research project consists of two complementary yet distinct initiatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, we will prospectively evaluate spinal cord perfusion pressure(SCPP)in patients&#xD;
           with acute spinal cord injuries, to provide scientifically-based guidelines on the&#xD;
           management of blood pressure during the acute injury phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second, we will evaluate cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) samples from these patients with the&#xD;
           goal of prospectively validating a series of biochemical markers that correlate with&#xD;
           injury severity and predict neurologic outcome. Ultimately, our goals are to enhance the&#xD;
           neurologic outcome of individuals with spinal cord injuries by improving upon their&#xD;
           acute clinical care, and to establish biological surrogates of injury severity that may&#xD;
           be used to facilitate clinical trials of novel therapeutic interventions for acute&#xD;
           spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter study will enroll patients with acute traumatic cervical and thoracic SCI&#xD;
      within 48 hours of their injury. A lumbar intrathecal catheter will be inserted&#xD;
      pre-operatively for the measurement of intrathecal pressure (ITP) and the collection of CSF&#xD;
      samples. Spinal cord perfusion pressure will be calculated as the difference between mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) and the ITP. The objectives of this aspect of the study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the changes in SCPP over the first 5-7 days post-injury (with an intrathecal&#xD;
           catheter that is in place for 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of different vasopressor agents on SCPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, CSF samples will be obtained from the intrathecal catheter at 8-hour intervals&#xD;
      to analyse the expression of the following biochemical markers: including interleukin (IL)-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP)-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),&#xD;
      S100beta, and tau. The objectives of this aspect of the study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the accuracy of these inflammatory and neuronal markers at classifying the&#xD;
           initial severity of paralysis and at predicting the extent of neurologic recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the temporal pattern of expression of these proteins to provide a more&#xD;
           complete description of the human pathophysiology of SCI.&#xD;

    <measure>International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (aka ASIA Examination)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For the purposes of ensuring that neurologic deterioration is not occurring while the lumbar intrathecal catheter is in place, an ASIA assessment will be performed daily while the intrathecal catheter is inserted. For the purpose of documenting neurologic recovery over time, the ASIA examination will also be performed at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury.</description>

    <measure>DN4 and other pain questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is currently believed that the development of neuropathic pain is closely related to neuroinflammation after SCI. In an effort to determine if we could establish etiologic cytokines, we will administer the DN4 and other pain questionnaires to characterize and quantify neuropathic pain. These questionnaires will be administered at screening, days 1-5 post-insertion of the lumbar intrathecal catheter, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-injury.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effect of different vasopressor agents on SCPP, a &quot;crossover&quot; intervention will be conducted on patients requiring either NORepinephrine or DOPamine post-operatively, once daily for 5 days while the catheter is in place. A subject on NORepinephrine will be switched over to DOPamine for 1 hr, and then switched back to NORepinephrine. Likewise, a subject on DOPamine will be switched over to NORepinephrine for 1 hr, and then switched back to DOPamine. Subjects on both vasopressors will have DOPamine stopped for 1 hr and NORepinephrine titrated up to maintain the same MAP for 1 hr, and then brought back to the original levels of both vasopressors. On the following day, the reverse will be carried out, with a stoppage of the NORepinephrine and maintenance solely on DOPamine.</description>
