      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on blood sugar&#xD;
      control and underlying mechanisms that contribute to type 2 diabetes in men and women with a&#xD;
      BMI between 27 and 42. Sixty subjects will be randomized to either undergo the roux-en-y&#xD;
      gastric bypass operation or intensive medical, dietary and exercise management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two of the greatest public health problems of&#xD;
      the 21st century. Lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, which are mainstay treatments for&#xD;
      T2DM have had limited success. More intensive lifestyle weight management such as in the Look&#xD;
      AHEAD trial reported an 8.6% weight loss after 1 year, while the Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      reported a 7% weight loss after 2 years, and a 58% decrease in the risk of developing T2DM.&#xD;
      In contrast,we have observed a 31% weight loss together with 83% remission of T2DM in&#xD;
      severely obese patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. However, direct&#xD;
      evidence of the glycemic benefits of bariatric surgery from randomized control trials is&#xD;
      lacking; there is no clear consensus that RYGB surgery is a good treatment option for&#xD;
      moderately obese T2DM patients; and the mechanisms responsible for reversing T2DM after&#xD;
      surgery remain unclear but may involve pancreatic insulin secretion and skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      hepatic insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this application is to evaluate the effects of RYGB surgery on glycemic&#xD;
      control and underlying mechanisms that contribute to T2DM in obese subjects (BMI: 30-40&#xD;
      kg/m2). Our central hypothesis is that RYGB surgery will reduce hyperglycemia via reversal of&#xD;
      beta-cell dysfunction and decrease hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. The approach&#xD;
      requires a 12-month randomized controlled trial. The rationale is based on data showing that&#xD;
      RYGB lowers fasting and postprandial glucose, and increases the GLP-1 response to a meal.&#xD;
      However, the therapeutic efficacy of RYGB surgery in obesity-related T2DM needs to be&#xD;
      demonstrated in a randomized trial.&#xD;

    <description>The working hypothesis for this aim is that significantly more obese T2DM patients who undergo RYGB surgery will achieve glycemic control based on a primary endpoint of an HbA1c â‰¤ 6.5% at 12 months, than patients managed by intensive medical therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The working hypothesis for this aim is that a primary physiological link between obesity and T2DM is specific to beta-cell dysfunction; RYGB will reverse beta-cell dysfunction by increasing postprandial incretin secretion.</description>
