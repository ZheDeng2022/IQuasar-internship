  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy and&#xD;
      bevacizumab with or without RO4929097 works in treating patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and&#xD;
      fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can&#xD;
      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
      RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab is more&#xD;
      effective with RO4929097 in treating patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy, as determined by progression-free survival, of FOLFOX6 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab with versus without gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the clinical benefit of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, as measured by objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RO4929097 in&#xD;
      combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate PD response of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, as assessed by direct measurement of gamma-secretase enzyme activity, in tumor&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. (Exploratory) To investigate the Notch signaling pathway genes targeted by RO4929097 in&#xD;
      combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. (Exploratory) To investigate the Ras signaling pathway genes targeted by RO4929097 in&#xD;
      combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. (Exploratory) To investigate putative colorectal cancer stem cells targeted by RO4929097&#xD;
      in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating&#xD;
      center, prior therapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant vs none), and number of organs* involved by&#xD;
      metastases (1 vs &gt; 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Lesions all in the liver would be considered as 1 organ involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen comprising oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2&#xD;
      hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1-2. Patients also receive oral gamma-secretase&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097 on days 1-3 and 8-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      (RO4929097 is given for up to 12 courses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen and bevacizumab as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;
