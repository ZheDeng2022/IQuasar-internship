  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiculopathy generally presents with pain, numbness, or weakness in a dermatomal&#xD;
      distribution. Cervical radiculopathy results from impingement on a nerve root by either&#xD;
      spondylotic narrowing of the neural foramen or a lateral intervertebral disc herniation.&#xD;
      Specifically, it should be the goal of the treating physician to relieve pain, improve&#xD;
      function, and prevent recurrence. Various studies have shown that nonoperative management of&#xD;
      cervical radiculopathy leaves a substantial minority of patients with persistently&#xD;
      troublesome symptoms. Pharmacologic agents treat the underlying condition and provide&#xD;
      symptomatic relief. The various classes of medications used to treat radiculopathy include&#xD;
      steroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, narcotics, and&#xD;
      antidepressants. Herbal medicines have been used for centuries in China. In China, many&#xD;
      patients with cervical disc disease are increasingly turning to herbal medicines to alleviate&#xD;
      their symptoms and reduce the side effects of medications. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and efficacy of an herbal medicine, Qishe Pill, to treat cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radiculopathy is a distinct consideration in the evaluation of any patients who have&#xD;
      neck pain and may be defined simply as an abnormality of a nerve root, which originates in&#xD;
      the cervical spine. The initial approach to the management of cervical spondylopathy&#xD;
      radiculopathy is nearly the same that the nonspecific neck or back pain can be found in most&#xD;
      of patients. Conservative treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      narcotics, muscle relaxants, physical therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS). The main objectives of conservative treatments are to relieve pain, improve function&#xD;
      and improve health-related quality of life.However, these treatments for cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy are limited by their modest effectiveness. Surgical treatment for cervical disc&#xD;
      disease is indicated when symptoms are refractory to conservative treatments and neurological&#xD;
      symptoms are progressive. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there generally is no randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial available comparing the standard nonsurgical treatments. Therefore,&#xD;
      care plans should be designed principally based on accumulated experience, the services&#xD;
      available locally, and the respective preferences of patients. Treatment plans are developed&#xD;
      to alleviate pain, improve function, and prevent recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), herbal medicines have the potential to&#xD;
      avoid the adverse effects of medications and surgery.In the basic theory of traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine (TCM), the obstruction of Qi flow and blood circulation in the neck area&#xD;
      caused by some pathogenic factors, such as &quot;Feng&quot;(wind), &quot;Han&quot;(cold), &quot;Shi&quot;(dampness),&#xD;
      invading the neck, induces cervical degenerative disc diseases which are the cause of&#xD;
      cervical radiculopathy. According to the four traditional methods of diagnosis - observation,&#xD;
      listening, interrogation, and pulse-taking, on patients, TCM doctors can analyze the certain&#xD;
      pathogenic factors which cause neck pain. And then they will prescribe herbal formulae based&#xD;
      on the effect and the main indications of Chinese medicine. Natural substances, including&#xD;
      herbal medicines, have being used to promote healing and alleviate neck pain in western&#xD;
      countries. Previous studies have demonstrated that some active substances in herbal medicine&#xD;
      can promote Qi flow and blood circulation to alleviate pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies on the effects of the Chinese herbal medicine on cervical radiculopathy&#xD;
      have been proposed, but useful empirical research is insufficiency. For chronic neck pain&#xD;
      with or without radicular symptoms, there is low quality evidence that herbal is more&#xD;
      effective than placebo for pain relief, which is measured at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
      However, the size of the studies was small and the effect was measured in the short-term.&#xD;
      Further research is very likely to change both the effect size and our confidence in the&#xD;
      results. There is a need for trials with adequate numbers of participants that address&#xD;
      long-term efficacy or effectiveness of herbal medicine compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qishe Pill is composed of processed Radix Astragali, Muscone, Szechuan Lovage Rhizome, Radix&#xD;
      Stephaniae Tetrandrae, Ovientvine, Calculus Bovis Artifactus. Using a well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trial, we will survey the effectiveness of concurrent use of this remedy in relieving neck&#xD;
      pain. Therefore, the present study is to examine effectiveness and safety of Qishe Pill, a&#xD;
      compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on neck pain in cervical spondylotic&#xD;
      radiculopathy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Results of this study&#xD;
      will provide evidence regarding the value of the Qishe Pill as an intervention to alleviate&#xD;
      neck pain caused by cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;
