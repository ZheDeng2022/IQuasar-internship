      The purpose of this study is to determine if the presence of fetal fibronectin in the&#xD;
      cervicovaginal secretions of pregnant patients with minor maternal trauma predicts impending&#xD;
      preterm delivery due to abruptio placenta.&#xD;

      Optimal care of the pregnant trauma patient requires prompt and efficient care by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team to evaluate both maternal and fetal status. Approximately 7% of&#xD;
      pregnancies are complicated by trauma and traumatic injury remains the leading cause of&#xD;
      non-obstetric maternal death.1-3 In the case of major or life-threatening trauma in&#xD;
      pregnancy, assessment and stabilization of maternal cardiovascular and respiratory status is&#xD;
      paramount and management is generally dictated by standard adult advanced cardiovascular&#xD;
      support algorithms. In contrast, the evaluation and management of minor trauma in pregnancy&#xD;
      is variable and often provider dependent.4-7 Regardless of the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation performed, the universal goal is to prevent maternal injury or death and optimize&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal trauma has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome, including preterm labor,&#xD;
      abruptio placenta, uterine rupture and fetal death.8, 9 Traditional trauma scoring systems&#xD;
      correlate well with the severity of maternal injury and are useful in triaging the mother;&#xD;
      however, these scoring systems have not been predictive of adverse pregnancy outcome.10,11&#xD;
      Major or life-threatening maternal trauma, which includes maternal shock, head injury&#xD;
      resulting in coma, and emergency laparotomy for maternal indications is associated with a&#xD;
      40-50% fetal loss rate as compared to 1-5% in pregnant women after minor trauma. The risk of&#xD;
      preterm labor after maternal trauma is increased 2-fold and the prevalence of abruptio&#xD;
      placenta after minor blunt abdominal trauma is reported at 8%. 3,6-9,12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon initial evaluation in the obstetrical triage setting, the examination of maternal trauma&#xD;
      patients is focused on detection of impending labor or abruptio placenta. This evaluation&#xD;
      includes detailed history of the accident, physical examination, abdominal and transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound to evaluate placental location and/or evidence of placental abruption and cervical&#xD;
      length, external uterine contraction monitoring, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring and&#xD;
      blood tests such as CBC, blood type, coagulation profile and Kleihauer-Betke staining.&#xD;
      Although much has been written on the subject of trauma during pregnancy, there is little&#xD;
      concrete data on objective measures which can be used to dictate triage and management&#xD;
      decisions. A recent study by Cahill et al.13 has advocated for review of the extensive&#xD;
      evaluations often performed after maternal trauma, specifically minor trauma, because they&#xD;
      determined that none of the commonly used clinical and laboratory measures are predictive of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes. Identification of laboratory measures predictive of impending delivery due&#xD;
      to placental abruption will potentially enable physicians to individualize triage and&#xD;
      evaluation of the maternal trauma patient, as well as direct treatment and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein that is normally found in the fetal&#xD;
      membranes and decidua.14 It is essentially an adhesive glycoprotein or &quot;glue&quot; at the&#xD;
      maternal-fetal interface. In a normal pregnancy, fFN is undetectable in vaginal secretions&#xD;
      from weeks 22 to 35. Disruption of the maternal-fetal interface causes the release of fFN&#xD;
      into cervical and vaginal secretions. Detection of fFN before the normal onset of labor is an&#xD;
      indicator of preterm birth risk, allowing opportunity to provide appropriate intervention.&#xD;
      According to previous studies, the clinical utility of fFN lies in its negative predictive&#xD;
      value. In non-trauma patients, the sensitivity of fFN in predicting impending delivery&#xD;
      (within 7 days) is greater than 90%. A negative fFN result can be used to rule out impending&#xD;
      deliver with greater than 99% certainty.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because abruptio placenta secondary to maternal trauma is the result of shearing forces&#xD;
      separating the placenta from the uterine decidua, this outcome could potentially be predicted&#xD;
      by a positive fFN result. This study is therefore undertaken to determine if the presence of&#xD;
      fFN in cervicovaginal secretions is predictive of impending delivery or placental abruption&#xD;
      in patients with maternal trauma. With better knowledge of the probable outcomes following&#xD;
      maternal trauma and using the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, optimal care&#xD;
      following minor maternal trauma for the pregnant patient and fetus can be provided.&#xD;
