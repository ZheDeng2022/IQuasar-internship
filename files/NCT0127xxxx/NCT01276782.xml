      The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of new research documenting the deleterious&#xD;
      impact that thyroid disease has on pregnancy and the postpartum period, in relation to&#xD;
      miscarriage preterm delivery intelligence quotient of the unborn child and health of the&#xD;
      mother postpartum. Both subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid antibody positivity in&#xD;
      euthyroid women have been associated with miscarriage and preterm delivery. Approximately 5%&#xD;
      of all pregnant women have a thyroid disorder. both spontaneous miscarriage and preterm&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology, has also been&#xD;
      documented to negatively impact pregnancy. Women with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)have&#xD;
      increased rates of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Women with Systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE) also have increased rates of hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD,&#xD;
      defined as the presence of thyroid antibodies with or without thyroid dysfunction). Preterm&#xD;
      delivery (PTD), defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the leading cause of&#xD;
      neonatal mortality and morbidity in the United States. Although risk factors for preterm&#xD;
      delivery exist, the majority of women have no known risk factors. Recently, both&#xD;
      hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease have also been linked to preterm delivery.&#xD;
      Given the increased prevalence of negative outcomes documented in pregnant women with thyroid&#xD;
      disease, and the increased rates of hypothyroidism and Autoimmune thyroid disease in women&#xD;
      with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the investigators determined that Autoimmune thyroid&#xD;
      disease was associated with both preterm delivery and miscarriage. This has led to this&#xD;
      application to begin a pilot randomized clinical trial of thyroxine in autoimmune thyroid&#xD;
      disease in systemic lupus erythematosus pregnancy.&#xD;

      Objectives: The investigators hypothesize that levothyroxine decreases miscarriages and&#xD;
      preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare levothyroxine versus placebo to determine the effects on&#xD;
      pregnant women with Autoimmune thyroid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of new research documenting the&#xD;
      deleterious impact that thyroid disease has on pregnancy and the postpartum period, in&#xD;
      relation to miscarriage, preterm delivery , Intelligence quotient (IQ) of the unborn child&#xD;
      and health of the mother postpartum . Both subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid antibody&#xD;
      positivity in euthyroid women have been associated with miscarriage and preterm delivery.&#xD;
      .Even minor perturbations of thyroid function have been linked to decreased Intelligence&#xD;
      Quotients and impaired neurological development of the unborn child. Approximately 5% of all&#xD;
      pregnant women have a thyroid disorder (either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism or&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism). Intervention in pregnancy with levothyroxine in euthyroid thyroid antibody&#xD;
      positive women has been shown in a prospective study, performed in an area of mild iodine&#xD;
      deficiency, to significantly decrease the rate of both spontaneous miscarriage and preterm&#xD;
      delivery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLE has also been documented to negatively impact pregnancy. Women with systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE) have increased rates of miscarriage and preterm delivery, especially in&#xD;
      the setting of active Systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibodies . The&#xD;
      offspring of women with Systemic lupus erythematosus are at increased risk for heart block&#xD;
      and require neonatal intensive care unit care more frequently . Furthermore, pregnant women&#xD;
      with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have increased mortality rates. Women with Systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) also have increased rates of hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid&#xD;
      disease (AITD, defined as the presence of thyroid antibodies with or without thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction). In a recent case-control study performed by questionnaire, Yuen et al&#xD;
      documented a 21% prevalence of thyroid disease in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) women&#xD;
      versus 10% in controls (p=0.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm delivery (PTD), defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the leading cause of&#xD;
      neonatal mortality and morbidity in the United States. Despite a public health effort to&#xD;
      decrease the prevalence of Preterm Delivery (PTD) , the prevalence has increased from 11% in&#xD;
      1996 to 12.7% in 2007, with an annual societal cost of over 26 billion dollars. In an attempt&#xD;
      to affect the societal impact of preterm delivery, the Surgeon General made decreasing the&#xD;
      prevalence of Preterm Delivery to 7.6% a goal of Healthy People 2010. Although risk factors&#xD;
      for Preterm Delivery exist, the majority of women have no known risk factors. Recently, both&#xD;
      hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease have also been linked to preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increased prevalence of negative outcomes documented in pregnant women with thyroid&#xD;
      disease, and the increased rates of hypothyroidism and Autoimmune thyroid disease in women&#xD;
      with systemic lupus erythematosus, the investigators previously evaluated the prevalence of&#xD;
      thyroid disease during pregnancy and postpartum in women with systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      as well as pregnancy outcome. The investigators determined that autoimmune thyroid disease&#xD;
      was associated with both preterm delivery and miscarriage in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort . This&#xD;
      has led to this application to begin a pilot randomized clinical trial of levothyroxine in&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid disease in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of thyroid antibody positivity was 31.5%. Preterm birth was strongly&#xD;
      associated with Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (p=0.002). The&#xD;
      investigators found: 1) a high percentage of women (13%) were on thyroid hormone replacement&#xD;
      prior to becoming pregnant, 2) a high percentage of women (10.9%) presented with previously&#xD;
      undiagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy, 3) 14% of women developed postpartum&#xD;
      thyroiditis, 4) antibody positivity during pregnancy was not predictive of the occurrence of&#xD;
      postpartum thyroiditis, and 5) women with thyroid disease had a dramatic increase in the&#xD;
      prevalence of preterm delivery as compared to women who had no thyroid disease. Overall, the&#xD;
      percentage of women with systemic lupus erythematosus who either had levothyroxine treated&#xD;
      thyroid disease prior to pregnancy, who were diagnosed with thyroid disease during pregnancy,&#xD;
      or who developed postpartum thyroiditis, was 37.9%. None of the demographic, laboratory,&#xD;
      medication usage, or disease activity index data affected the association of autoimmune&#xD;
      thyroid disease with adverse pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm delivery was markedly increased in the group of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus women&#xD;
      who had thyroid disease diagnosed either prior to, during, or in the postpartum period, as&#xD;
      compared to the group of women who were thyroid disease free, in our previous study. Our&#xD;
      results were not affected by the dosage of prednisone administered or the cardiolipin&#xD;
      antibody titer. Furthermore, the increased rate of preterm delivery in the Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus women with thyroid disease was not secondary to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus&#xD;
      activity, as the Physician Global Assessment score and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index were similar in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus women with or without thyroid&#xD;
      disease. These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence linking thyroid&#xD;
      disorders, both hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid antibodies in euthyroid women, to&#xD;
      Preterm delivery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus have a high prevalence of primary&#xD;
      hypothyroidism,undiagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism, and postpartum thyroiditis. In sum, a&#xD;
      minimum of one in every three pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus falls into one&#xD;
      of these categories. Autoimmune thyroid disease is highly associated with adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our current application will begin a pilot trial of levothyroxine versus placebo at the&#xD;
      United States sites with a long track record of interest in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will be defined by the American College&#xD;
      of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria or by the Systemic Lupus International&#xD;
      Collaborative Clinics revised American College of Rheumatology criteria. Systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE) patients already on levothyroxine and those discovered to be hypothyroid&#xD;
      needing levothyroxine, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with autoimmune thyroid antibodies who give&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomized to levothyroxine (50mcg) versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will follow those used in the Predictors of Pregnancy Outcome: Biomarkers in&#xD;
      Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) (PROMISSE)&#xD;
      study. The outcome will be adverse pregnancy outcome (preterm birth, miscarriage, or&#xD;
      stillbirth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint is adverse pregnancy outcome as defined by the Promisse study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composite endpoint defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Otherwise unexplained fetal death occurring after 12 weeks gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neonatal death prior to hospital discharge and due to complications of prematurity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indicated preterm delivery prior to 36 weeks' gestation because of gestational&#xD;
           hypertension, preeclampsia-eclampsia, or placental insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Enrollment will be at Johns Hopkins Hospital,&#xD;
           Hospital for Joint Diseases (Jill Buyon M.D.) Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (Joan&#xD;
           Merrill M.D.), University of Chicago (Tammy Utset M.D., M.P.H.) Duke University Medical&#xD;
           Center (Megan Clowse M.D., M.P.H) and Stanford University (Eliza F. Chakravarty, M.D.).&#xD;
           Dr D. Ware Branch at the University of Utah will be the gynecologic consultant to&#xD;
           adjudicate the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TSH testing will be performed using the Ultrasensitive hTSH II method on an AbbottAxsym.&#xD;
      (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois.) This is a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay&#xD;
      (MEIA) method. The analytical sensitivity of the Axsym Ultrasensitive hTSH II is 0.03 uIU/mL.&#xD;
      The intraassay coefficient of variation (CV) is 4.35% and the interassay coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (CV) is 5.73%. A TSH greater than 2.5 μU/ml in the first trimester, or greater than&#xD;
      3.0 μU/ml in the second or third trimester was considered abnormal. Glinoer et al has&#xD;
      demonstrated that 18% of women without thyroid disease have a suppressed Thyroid Stimulating&#xD;
      Hormone (TSH) . Therefore, in our previous study TSH values below 0.3 μU/ml were not&#xD;
      considered abnormal during pregnancy unless it occurred after the 20th week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum thyroglobulin antibody (Tg-Ab) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) , also research&#xD;
      test, will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KRONUS KalibreTM Thyroglobulin&#xD;
      Antibody and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody ELISA kits will be kindly provided by KRONUS Corp,&#xD;
      Boise, ID). Serum anti-Tg levels above 3 U/mL were considered positive and anti-TPO levels&#xD;
      above 2 U/mL will be considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is upto 36 weeks of pregnancy after screening. The patient will be seen&#xD;
      monthly using the accepted clinical guidelines devised for the PROMISSE (Predictors of&#xD;
      Pregnancy Outcome: Biomarkers in Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) and Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus (SLE)) study, an National Institute of Health funded prospective study of the&#xD;
      role of the antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnancy. At each pregnancy visit, the Stemic&#xD;
      Lupus Erythematosus Pregnancy Disease Activity Index (SLEPDAI), physician global assessment,&#xD;
      blood pressure, urine protein to creatinine ratio,Complement 3 (C3) ,Complement 4 (C4) and&#xD;
      anti-double stranded DNA will be recorded. Anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant will be&#xD;
      recorded as part of standard of care. All women will be followed by both their rheumatologist&#xD;
      and their obstetrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. The Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee will review all adverse events monthly. All serious adverse events will be reported&#xD;
      per Federal and JHM-IRB regulations Definition of treatment failure or participant removal&#xD;
      criteria. Treatment failure does not apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients who experience an allergic reaction to&#xD;
           Levolevothyroxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who fail to adhere to study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who develop medium to severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A patient with clinical hypothyroidism, elevated Thyroid Stimulating Hormone or clinical&#xD;
           hyperthyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria All Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)&#xD;
