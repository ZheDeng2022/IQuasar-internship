    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if TasignaÂ® (nilotinib) can cause tumor&#xD;
      cells to shrink and/or die in patients with GIST who are scheduled for surgery or may be&#xD;
      eligible for surgery. The safety of this drug will be studied. Researchers also want to use&#xD;
      imaging scans to study the changes in tumor size that may be caused by using nilotinib.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GIST is a rare cancer known as a soft-tissue sarcoma that forms in the gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract and may spread to other parts of the body. However, sometimes GIST stays in the GI&#xD;
      tract where it may possibly be removed by surgery. While some chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate, are effective in shrinking or controlling GIST, some types of GIST tumors&#xD;
      do not respond to imatinib. Researchers want to find out if nilotinib (a drug similar to&#xD;
      imatinib) causes GIST cells to die, so that the tumors shrink enough to be removed by&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib is designed to prevent cells from multiplying by causing tumor cells to shrink&#xD;
      and/or die. This may prevent the cancer from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, a surgeon from M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      will check your imaging scans to decide if the tumor can be surgically removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this research study will be assigned to either Arm 1 or Arm 2, based on&#xD;
      whether the tumor is able to be removed by surgery at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the surgeon thinks the tumor is able to be removed during surgery, you will be assigned to&#xD;
      Arm 1. You will receive nilotinib pills by mouth 2 times a day for 7 days. You will receive a&#xD;
      pill diary and will be shown how to record the date and time for each dose received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the week of nilotinib therapy, you will be scheduled to have the GIST removed during&#xD;
      surgery. Tumor tissue that is removed during surgery will be used for research testing. Some&#xD;
      of these tests will help researchers learn how effectively nilotinib kills tumor cells. Your&#xD;
      DNA and RNA (the genetic material in your cells) will also be collected from these tissue&#xD;
      samples and used to help researchers understand how these tumor cells survive, divide, and&#xD;
      die as a result of nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4-6 weeks of recovery time after surgery, you will receive standard of care treatment&#xD;
      off-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assigned research nurse will see you at each clinic visit and will serve as the first&#xD;
      contact for any questions or concerns. During the course of this study, you will be asked to&#xD;
      report any serious problems or concerns at each study visit. If you have concerns or&#xD;
      questions between each study visits, you may contact your study nurse through the Sarcoma&#xD;
      Center at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm 1 will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -7, you will begin taking nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a dynamic CT scan within 36 hours before surgery to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will have surgery to remove the GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 56:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects&#xD;
           you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects&#xD;
           you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the surgeon thinks the tumor is not able to be surgically removed at this time, or that&#xD;
      the tumor needs to shrink before it can be removed during surgery, you will be assigned to&#xD;
      Arm 2. You will receive nilotinib pills by mouth 2 times a day for 7 days. You will receive a&#xD;
      pill diary and will be shown how to record the date and time for each dose received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the week of nilotinib therapy, you will be scheduled to have a biopsy on what is&#xD;
      counted as Day 0 on your pill diary. After 7 days of recovery from the biopsy, you will&#xD;
      continue receiving nilotinib on the same schedule (2 times a day by mouth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks of nilotinib therapy, you will have more scans performed to measure the size of&#xD;
      the tumor. These scans will include a CT scan of your abdomen or pelvis. You may have a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan instead, if you have chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the scans show that the tumor has gotten smaller, you will meet with the surgeon to&#xD;
      discuss surgery to remove the tumor. If you are scheduled to have surgery, you will stop&#xD;
      taking nilotinib 1 day before your surgery date. If the tumor has gotten bigger, you will be&#xD;
      taken off study treatment, and other treatment options will be discussed with you. If the&#xD;
      scan shows that the tumor is unchanged, you will continue to receive nilotinib until the&#xD;
      tumor either shrinks (and you are able to have surgery) or gets bigger (and you are taken off&#xD;
      study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue that is removed during your scheduled biopsy or during surgery will also be used&#xD;
      for biological and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have surgery, you will receive standard of care treatment off-study, depending on&#xD;
      the results of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your doctor may recommend that you begin taking imatinib mesylate after surgery (or if the&#xD;
      disease has gotten worse and you are not able to have surgery). In many cases, imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate is given on a daily basis for 1-2 years to lower the risk of the disease coming&#xD;
      back. During the time after the surgery, information will be collected about your overall&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse while you are on study, and you agree, you will be asked to have a&#xD;
      tumor biopsy of an easily accessible area. If this happens, this procedure will be described&#xD;
      to you in more detail, and you will sign a separate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assigned research nurse will see you at each clinic visit and will serve as the first&#xD;
      contact for any questions or concerns. During the course of this study, you will be asked to&#xD;
      report any serious problems or concerns at each study visit. If you have concerns or&#xD;
      questions between each study visits, you may contact your study nurse through the Sarcoma&#xD;
      Center at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm 2 will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -7, you will begin taking nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a a dynamic CT scan within 36 hours before your biopsy to check the status&#xD;
           of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will have a tumor tissue biopsy performed. To collect a tumor tissue biopsy, the skin&#xD;
      above and around the tumor area is numbed with anesthetic, and a sample of tumor tissue is&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 56:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects&#xD;
           you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the results of the tests at Day 56 you will either have surgery, continue&#xD;
      nilotinib, or be taken off study and switched to another therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects&#xD;
           you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Testing for Both Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These PK&#xD;
      samples will be drawn after the first 6 days of nilotinib (Day -1) and either at the&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit or at any point that the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When/if your treatment is interrupted for any reason and/or your dose is changed in any way,&#xD;
      you will also have ECGs performed. You will have an additional ECG 7 days after this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects&#xD;
           you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for 1 week (Arm 1) before you have surgery. You may&#xD;
      continue taking the study drug for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best interest,&#xD;
      or until you are able to have surgery (Arm 2). You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return to the clinic every 3 months for standard follow-up testing,&#xD;
      including routine blood tests and CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nilotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of certain types of chronic myeloid leukemia. Its use in patients with GIST is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
