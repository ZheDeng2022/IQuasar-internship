      The goal of the study is to determine whether repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for&#xD;
      brief periods (termed intermittent hypoxia) will improve limb function after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. This idea stems from animal studies on respiration, in which investigators have shown&#xD;
      that mild intermittent hypoxia improves breathing in spinally injured rats. These studies&#xD;
      have shown that intermittent hypoxia induces spinal plasticity, strengthening neural&#xD;
      connections and motor neuron function within the spinal cord. Exposure to mild intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia triggers a cascade of events, including increased production of key proteins and&#xD;
      increased sensitivity of spinal cord circuitry necessary for improved breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this research is to assess the potential of mild intermittent hypoxia as&#xD;
      a therapeutic approach to stimulate recovery of limb function in human patients.&#xD;

      : The goal of the study is to determine whether repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for&#xD;
      brief periods (termed intermittent hypoxia) will improve limb function after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. This idea stems from animal studies on respiration, in which investigators have shown&#xD;
      that mild intermittent hypoxia improves breathing in spinally injured rats. These studies&#xD;
      have shown that intermittent hypoxia induces spinal plasticity, strengthening neural&#xD;
      connections and motor neuron function within the spinal cord. Exposure to mild intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia triggers a cascade of events, including increased production of key proteins and&#xD;
      increased sensitivity of spinal cord circuitry necessary for improved breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators initially hypothesize that daily exposure to intermittent hypoxia for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days will improve limb function in rats and in humans with chronic spinal&#xD;
      injuries. First, the investigators will compare limb function in spinally-injured rats which&#xD;
      receive mild intermittent hypoxia treatment with rats that did not. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure grip strength and locomotor abilities in both groups before treatment and for several&#xD;
      months after treatment. The investigators will also examine the spinal cords of these rats to&#xD;
      look for the key proteins, which are indicators of spinal plasticity. The investigators will&#xD;
      use this information to guide the treatment protocols when the investigators compare limb&#xD;
      function in spinal-injured persons with and without intermittent hypoxia treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second hypothesis is that combining intermittent hypoxia with locomotor training will&#xD;
      further improve limb function after spinal injury. To test this idea, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare limb function in spinally-injured rats which have received combined intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia and treadmill training with rats which only received intermittent hypoxia or&#xD;
      locomotor training alone. The investigators will examine key proteins in the spinal cords of&#xD;
      these rats to determine whether the combination of hypoxia and training further alters these&#xD;
      indicators of plasticity. The investigators will also compare limb function in&#xD;
      spinally-injured humans who receive both intermittent hypoxia and locomotor treadmill&#xD;
      training with those who receive either treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this research is to assess the potential of mild intermittent hypoxia as&#xD;
      a therapeutic approach to stimulate recovery of limb function in human patients.&#xD;
