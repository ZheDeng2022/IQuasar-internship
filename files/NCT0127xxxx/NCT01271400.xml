      The aim of this study is to track the outcome from the patients who had embryo&#xD;
      cryopreservation as part of their Advanced Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment at West&#xD;
      Coast Fertility Centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past several decades, considerable effort has been expended toward the successful&#xD;
      cryopreservation of various human cells. While attempts at cryopreservation have been&#xD;
      directed at different tissue types, one of the most vigorously pursued targets has been&#xD;
      reproductive tissue. Historically, cryopreservation of human sperm has existed for several&#xD;
      decades. The earliest reports of pregnancies (Trounson et al., 1983) and births (Zeilmaker et&#xD;
      al., 1984) from the cryopreservation of human embryos occurred in the early 1980s. Presently,&#xD;
      the freezing and storage of human embryos following in vitro fertilization (IVF) is standard&#xD;
      practice at most fertility clinics. In 2003, the CDC Assisted Reproductive Technology success&#xD;
      rates report stated that 4,246 live births occurred out of 17,517 non-donor frozen embryo&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo cryopreservation has been a routine component of clinical IVF programs for more than 2&#xD;
      decades but has a relatively poor outcome in terms of post-thaw survival and pregnancy rates&#xD;
      in a majority of IVF programs. Efficient embryo cryopreservation has several advantages. It&#xD;
      helps to reduce costs and increases cumulative pregnancy rates. It can also help in cases of&#xD;
      IVF cycles where embryos are not transferred due to ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome. It is&#xD;
      also useful when technical difficulties are encountered at the time of an embryo transfer&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major concerns in IVF is high-order multiple pregnancies, which result from the&#xD;
      transfer of multiple embryos in a given cycle. In the last 5 years, improved stimulation&#xD;
      protocols, advances in culture and laboratory systems, and better identification of viable&#xD;
      embryos have enhanced the success rates of IVF. During the same period, some clinics have&#xD;
      started the practice of transferring two embryos to reduce multiple pregnancy rates without&#xD;
      compromising overall pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in recent years some European countries, particularly the Scandinavian&#xD;
      countries, have taken a lead in performing elective single-embryo transfers and have achieved&#xD;
      acceptable pregnancy rates. This trend is spreading to other countries. This can result in&#xD;
      surplus embryos being available for freezing. With the application of ICSI, even patients&#xD;
      aged 40 years or older may have embryos to freeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the current literature reveals modest post-thaw embryo survival, implantation, and&#xD;
      pregnancy rates. Post-thaw survival rates vary from 50% to 80% for different embryo stages.&#xD;
      Implantation and pregnancy rates have varied from 3% to 15% and 15% to 25% respectively,&#xD;
      which is approximately half of the rates achieved for fresh embryo transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the outcome of frozen ET cycles, we modified various steps of our standard&#xD;
      cryopreservation protocol. In a pilot study on arrested and fragmented embryos (grades 3 and&#xD;
      4), we achieved post-thaw survival rates of 92%, having all blastomeres intact. Encouraged by&#xD;
      the post-thaw survival of these embryos; we propose using this modified protocol in our&#xD;
      frozen embryo transfer program.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  To be eligible for inclusion into this study, each subject must satisfy the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Infertile women whose physician has recommended IVF and who agree to cryopreserve&#xD;
