  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, open-label, single dose, mass balance study in a cohort of 6 healthy&#xD;
      adult male subjects. The study will consist of: Screening evaluations, a treatment phase, and&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations. In the treatment phase, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours,&#xD;
      each subject will receive a single oral suspension dose of GSK2248761 200mg containing [14C]&#xD;
      - GSK2248761. Following dosing, serial whole blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected. Subjects will be required to remain in the unit until the radiocarbon excreted&#xD;
      falls to less than or equal to 1% of the administered dose for two consecutive 24-hour&#xD;
      collections in both urine and feces, whichever occurs first. Safety will be assessed by vital&#xD;
      signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, AE monitoring, and&#xD;
      physical examinations as indicated.&#xD;

             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;

             first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;

             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.&#xD;

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of&#xD;
             45-100 bpm. A single repeat is allowed to determine eligibility.&#xD;
