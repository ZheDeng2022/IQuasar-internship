  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands approximately 2300 new patients are diagnosed with rectal cancer each&#xD;
      year. Standard treatment for patients with a T2 or T3 rectal cancer consists of preoperative&#xD;
      short course of radiotherapy followed by surgery. In advanced cases long course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is used instead of a short cause. In some of these&#xD;
      advanced cases a complete remission is observed after a long course of radio-/chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients who respond well to neo-adjuvant treatment carry a better prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this research is to evaluate whether neo-adjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy in small&#xD;
      non-advanced rectal cancers can be used to obtain a complete or near complete remission. In&#xD;
      these patients could a complete resection of the rectum as an organ be avoided by treating&#xD;
      them with a local excision with the TEM-technique (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery) of the&#xD;
      scar. The advantage for these patients is, that they do not need major abdominal surgery and&#xD;
      in a substantial number of these patients the rectum can be preserved with a better function&#xD;
      of continence.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>TEM surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients undergo a MRI of the pelvis and a rectoscopy and endorectal ultrasound 6 weeks after chemo radiation.Patients with a significant downsizing of the tumour (T0-T2) will be operated on by TEM surgery 8 -10 weeks after the last chemo radiation treatment.&#xD;
After TEM surgery, pathological assessment will dictate further treatment. Conservative treatment with careful follow-up will be performed in patients with a complete resection of a ypT0-1 rectal tumour. Patients with lymphangio invasion, an incomplete resected ypT1 (&lt;2 mm margin), an ypT2 or ypT3 tumour after TEM will subsequently undergo TME surgery to remove the rectum within 4 weeks.</description>
