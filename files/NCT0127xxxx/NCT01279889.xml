    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify women at risk of low blood pressure (hypotension) after the usual&#xD;
      cesarean anesthetic - a spinal anesthetic. Hypotension may be caused by dehydration. We&#xD;
      believe we can predict who will get hypotension by using two anesthesia monitors together&#xD;
      with a passive leg raise (PLR) (legs elevated after a period spent reclining). The PLR will&#xD;
      cause a shift of blood from the legs to the heart, and the monitors will detect the heart's&#xD;
      response to tell if a subject is dehydrated. We want to see if these dehydration tests can&#xD;
      also predict hypotension after a spinal anesthetic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We aim to predict the development of spinal anesthesia related hypotension in subjects&#xD;
      already receiving a prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine (PE) who are having a cesarean&#xD;
      delivery (CD). Hypotension arising in this fashion may signify that a subject is actually&#xD;
      relatively fluid-deplete, and might benefit from intravenous (IV) fluid replacement. We will&#xD;
      observe the association between hypotension and results of pre-anesthesia tests with two&#xD;
      non-invasive monitors used in conjunction with a dynamic cardiovascular fluid challenge (by&#xD;
      using a passive leg raise (PLR) maneuver). The use of any therapeutic intervention such as a&#xD;
      fluid infusion would be the object of a subsequent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that a minority of parturients present for elective CD being relatively fluid&#xD;
      deplete. It is our hypothesis that the characteristics of passive leg raise (PLR) induced&#xD;
      changes in the plethysmography variability index (PVI generated by the Masimo Radical 7™) and&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO as derived from the Non Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM) produced&#xD;
      by Cheetah Medical™) will identify these subjects and that without large volume fluid&#xD;
      administration they are likely to develop hypotension despite the use of a prophylactic PE&#xD;
      infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Hypotension is the most common cause of spinal anesthesia related morbidity in&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. Hypotension is very common and without treatment can affect over 80% of&#xD;
      women. The mechanism is usually twofold: Firstly preload to the right ventricle (RV) is&#xD;
      reduced as a result of venodilation from spinal sympathetic blockade. Unfortunately&#xD;
      attempting to improve preload by infusion of IV fluid alone doesn't make much difference to&#xD;
      the rates of hypotension (only 16% reduction in one large study). The second mechanism&#xD;
      results from afterload reduction through arterial vasodilation which directly causes a&#xD;
      reduction in blood pressure (BP). The treatment for this is most commonly a PE infusion, and&#xD;
      when used this makes a significant difference reducing rates by over 50%. Unfortunately again&#xD;
      there are a few who don't seem to respond (the residual of hypotension remains about 30%).&#xD;
      Increasing the doses of PE only increases the rate of side effects, without affecting&#xD;
      hypotension rates. However, giving both fluid and a PE infusion does seem to prevent&#xD;
      hypotension in almost all subjects, suggesting that those who were resistant to PE alone&#xD;
      actually did need some fluid. These subjects however are the exception not the rule, and&#xD;
      giving fluid to these relatively &quot;fluid deplete&quot; as well as the rest may result in an&#xD;
      increase in fluid related side effects. We believe that fluid therapy could be tailored&#xD;
      better if we could identify which subjects are actually fluid deplete in the first instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing to predict fluid responsiveness has been studied in the intensive care unit (ICU) but&#xD;
      not in obstetric subjects. Using a PLR increases the return of blood to the right ventricle&#xD;
      (RV). In a fluid deplete individual this significantly improves venous return such that CO&#xD;
      changes dramatically. In a well hydrated individual venous return is already adequate so the&#xD;
      change in CO is less. The NICOM will directly detect the CO change induced by a PLR. The&#xD;
      Masimo detects variations in the pulse oximetry plethysmograph trace that result from subtle&#xD;
      variations in the cardiac output caused by changes in the intrathoracic pressure from&#xD;
      breathing. Intrathoracic pressure increases during expiration in a spontaneously breathing&#xD;
      subject and causes a reduction in venous return to the RV which causes a subsequent fall in&#xD;
      CO. The variation in the plethysmography signal with respiration is displayed as a percentage&#xD;
      index of the baseline signal strength which correlates with how much venous return to the RV&#xD;
      is affected by respiration. If a subject's preload is low the plethysmography variability&#xD;
      index (PVI) will be high from the dramatic fluctuation in CO with changes in intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure. Unfortunately with spontaneously breathing subjects this value is not consistent&#xD;
      enough between individuals for PVI itself to give an accurate indication of fluid volume&#xD;
      state. However changes induced in the PVI within an individual subject from a challenge such&#xD;
      as fluid infusion or a PLR appear to be better at indicating fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use both the NICOM and the Masimo in conjunction with a PLR to assess fluid state&#xD;
      (deplete or otherwise) preoperatively. We will then observe whether or not the pre-anesthesia&#xD;
      testing correlates with development of PE infusion resistant hypotension during the routine&#xD;
      spinal anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to correlate the results of pre-anesthesia testing&#xD;
      with actual development of PE infusion resistant hypotension. Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      discussed in statistical analysis below.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Height less than 150cm or greater than 180cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 40kg/m2: obesity makes accurate non-invasive blood&#xD;
             pressure (BP) measurement difficult. It may also affect speed of onset and height of&#xD;
             subarachnoid block due to increased epidural venous plexus engorgement and thecal sac&#xD;
             compression resulting in more marked hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy induced hypertension (BP after 20wk greater than 140/90 with proteinuria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk of hemorrhage - where fluid volume expansion is planned prior to delivery&#xD;
             (e.g. placenta previa, placenta accreta)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Starting BP is less than 100 systolic: as the lower limit for intervention defined in&#xD;
             this study is 90sys which will likely be within the error of the BP measurement device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is a prolonged (more than 2 hour) wait between testing and spinal insertion: as&#xD;
             patients may become more dehydrated affecting hypotension rates&#xD;
