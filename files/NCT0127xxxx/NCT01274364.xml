      Quality diabetes care requires a team approach and informed decisions of patients and care&#xD;
      providers. Several lines of evidence suggests that a protocol-driven care model delivered by&#xD;
      trained staff with focus on periodic assessments, reinforcement of patient compliance and&#xD;
      attainment of multiple treatment targets reduces risk of cardio-renal complications and early&#xD;
      death in type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of state of the art information technology to&#xD;
      record, manage and analyze the large amount of clinical information generated during various&#xD;
      consultation visits will improve the effectiveness and efficiency in implementing these care&#xD;
      protocols through decision support and regular feedback to both patients and care team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is now a pandemic disease affecting 5-10% of global population. More than 60% of&#xD;
      affected people will come from Asia with the number expected to increase from 85 million in&#xD;
      2005 to 132 million in 2010 in Asia alone. On average, diabetes reduces life expectancy by&#xD;
      10-12 years. While stroke, heart disease and kidney failure account for more than 50% of&#xD;
      global deaths, 30-50% of patients with these conditions have diabetes as a major contributing&#xD;
      factor. In contrast to the West, the main increase in diabetes prevalence in Asia will occur&#xD;
      in the young to middle aged population. On average, 17 million people die from stroke and&#xD;
      heart disease on a yearly basis. Of these, 11 million occur in Asia, affecting many young&#xD;
      parents and economically active people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their devastating nature, many diabetic complications can be prevented and managed&#xD;
      effectively to preserve health, reduce disabilities and improve quality of life. However,&#xD;
      there are multiple barriers in the implementation of quality diabetes care. These include&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge base of health care professionals, fragmented nature of health care&#xD;
      systems, lack of reimbursement for outpatient procedures including therapeutic patient&#xD;
      education, poor compliance to treatment in part due to the silent nature of diabetes and&#xD;
      associated complications as well as the complex nature of care protocols. The latter include&#xD;
      periodic evaluation of clinical and laboratory parameters and the need for people with&#xD;
      diabetes to adhere to long term medications and self care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While optimal management of risk factors and treatment to targets can substantially reduce&#xD;
      the risk of diabetes associated complications, the challenge lies in the effective&#xD;
      translation of this evidence to clinical practice. Since mid 1990s, inspired by the benefits&#xD;
      of structured care, made possible during the conduct of clinical trials, the CUHK Diabetes&#xD;
      Care &amp; Research Group has developed prototypes of structured care protocols including an&#xD;
      annual comprehensive assessment using a doctor-nurse-physician assistant team. Consistent&#xD;
      with international data, these prototypes substantially improve rates of treatment compliance&#xD;
      and attainment of multiple treatment targets resulting in reduced death and cardio-renal&#xD;
      complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program is a web-based disease management program&#xD;
      conceptualized, developed and tested by the Asia Diabetes Foundation (ADF) since 2007,&#xD;
      supported by a MSD educational grant. The objectives of the JADE Program include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to promote collective learning and sharing of best practices in diabetes based on&#xD;
           regionally relevant evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to increase regional awareness about the magnitude of diabetes and its preventable&#xD;
           nature through education, ongoing data collection and implementation of evidence-based&#xD;
           guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to establish a regional diabetes registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to collect the evidence base to inform relevant stakeholders including public, people&#xD;
           with diabetes, health care professionals, policy makers and payors to change policies&#xD;
           and practices in order to make quality diabetes care accessible, sustainable and&#xD;
           affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using state of the art information technology, the JADE and DIAMOND electronic portal&#xD;
      provides a virtual platform to enable care professionals to record, manage and analyse the&#xD;
      large amount of information collected during various consultation visits. The Programs also&#xD;
      incorporate risk equations developed and validated by the CUHK Diabetes Care &amp; Research Group&#xD;
      to help doctors assess their patients' future event rates. This information, displayed in&#xD;
      charts and trend lines, can be communicated to patients and doctors to motivate behavioral&#xD;
      changes and encourage dialogues to set treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from providing templates for documentation of risk factors and complications using&#xD;
      standardized protocols, the JADE Program also incorporates different evidence-based care&#xD;
      protocols with recommendations on follow up schedules and care processes in accordance to the&#xD;
      patient's risk profile. Decision support in terms of prompts, charts, trend lines and&#xD;
      practice tips are used to help doctors and patients to make informed decisions and to&#xD;
      optimize care. The JADE Program also possesses matrixes which enable care providers to track&#xD;
      clinical progress and risk factor control for benchmarking and quality improvement purposes.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the DIAMOND Program provides the first step to entry of a quality&#xD;
      assurance program by establishing a diabetes registry at a clinic level. The ongoing&#xD;
      collection of these data provides an invaluable platform for collaborative epidemiological&#xD;
      and interventional studies pertinent to Asian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicentre study, we shall use a trio team consisting of a trained doctor, nurse and&#xD;
      physician assistant (PA) to deliver protocol-driven diabetes care using a web-based disease&#xD;
      management program, the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program. To fully realize the&#xD;
      functionality of the JADE Program requires changes in the practice environment and deployment&#xD;
      of additional manpower (e.g. a nurse and a PA) to enter data and provide reminders to&#xD;
      patients and doctors to improve adherence to protocols. In settings where these changes may&#xD;
      not be immediately possible, periodic comprehensive assessment using the structured template&#xD;
      in the JADE Program allows recognition of risk factors and complications for early&#xD;
      intervention. The latter will allow data collected in a systematic manner which forms the&#xD;
      basis of a DIAbetes MONitoring Database (DIAMOND) as a first step towards quality assurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explanation by trained doctors and nurses and with written informed consent, patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the JADE or DIAMOND Program. The former encompasses all&#xD;
      components of the structured care delivered by a trio-team of doctor, nurse and PA while the&#xD;
      DIAMOND Program only consists of comprehensive assessments at baseline and 12-month with&#xD;
      patients managed in the usual manner thereafter. At the end of 12 months, all patients will&#xD;
      undergo repeat comprehensive assessments for comparison of rates of attainment of treatment&#xD;
      targets, behavioral changes, quality of life and default rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the reach, adoption and acceptability of the JD Program by patients and&#xD;
           health care team;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effectiveness of the JADE (structured care) versus DIAMOND (usual care)&#xD;
           Programs in attainment of treatment targets, improvement of quality of life and changes&#xD;
           in behaviors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To document the pattern of complications, risk factors, use of medications and quality&#xD;
           of life in type 2 diabetic patients&#xD;
