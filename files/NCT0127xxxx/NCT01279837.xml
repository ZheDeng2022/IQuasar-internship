      In this study supported by an American Cancer Society grant, the investigators are evaluating&#xD;
      two levels of swallowing exercise intensity on the maintenance of swallowing muscles and&#xD;
      their function in Head/Neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Patients in this study&#xD;
      are randomly placed into different exercise groups and provided with exercises to perform&#xD;
      daily during their radiation treatment. Their progress, diet management and swallowing&#xD;
      ability are monitored throughout the treatment period and followed up until 3 months after&#xD;
      radiation treatment. In addition to the daily treatment details, the patients perception of&#xD;
      their swallowing ability and concerns about their health and treatment are also measured.&#xD;
      This clinical trial will help to refine a previously investigated simple exercise package and&#xD;
      provide a program of intervention that can help prevent medically related complications of&#xD;
      swallowing difficulty (e.g. pneumonia, dehydration, prolonged tube feeding), and improve the&#xD;
      ability to eat for patients with head / neck cancer. Ultimately it is hoped that this form of&#xD;
      exercise therapy will help reduce the costs (personal and financial) to the patient,&#xD;
      caregivers and community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an earlier pilot study, a regime of simple swallowing exercises was identified as useful&#xD;
      in maintaining oropharyngeal muscle characteristics as measured by T2 weighted Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and produced a trend toward improved function for swallowing in&#xD;
      patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The purpose of this current study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the dose response of two levels of swallowing exercise intensity on the&#xD;
      maintenance of muscle composition and function for swallowing in Head/Neck cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: A program of intensive swallowing exercise (Pharyngocise) will maintain muscle&#xD;
      function in the oral cavity and pharynx during radiotherapy, preserving or supporting&#xD;
      swallowing function in Head/Neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: 130 patients with Head/Neck cancer, confirmed by clinical history and exam,&#xD;
      will be recruited over a 4 year period. All subjects will undergo an initial baseline work&#xD;
      up, including a standardized clinical and instrumental swallowing evaluation, psychosocial&#xD;
      scales, nutritional exam, and T2 weighted MRI prior to the first radiation therapy. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Usual care (control) group - patients will receive swallowing and prescribed dietary&#xD;
      intervention during the radiotherapy period prescribed by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: High intensity pharyngocise treatment group - patients will receive twice daily&#xD;
      swallowing intervention by a speech language pathologist, consisting of the battery of&#xD;
      isometric/isotonic exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Low intensity pharyngocise treatment group - patients will receive a single&#xD;
      instructional exercise session on the isometric/isotonic exercises from a Speech Language&#xD;
      Pathologist and a practice tape to support home practice of the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated for approximately 6 weeks and followed for 3 months post&#xD;
      treatment. Baseline assessments will be repeated. In addition, daily treatment details,&#xD;
      patients perception of current swallowing ability and progress in therapy will be recorded by&#xD;
      the Speech Pathologist. Participants will be independently monitored throughout the treatment&#xD;
      period by researcher blind to the treatment group assigned, via weekly phone interview&#xD;
      sessions. Compliance with the treatment techniques, and the occurrence of any negative&#xD;
      endpoints such as occurrence of aspiration pneumonia will be recorded.&#xD;
