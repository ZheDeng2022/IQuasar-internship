      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some types of cancer cells that have hormone receptors on their surfaces need the&#xD;
           hormone estrogen to grow. The drug tamoxifen blocks estrogen from binding to the tumor&#xD;
           cells, which helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer. Tamoxifen has been approved for&#xD;
           treatment of certain types of estrogen-linked cancers, such as breast and ovarian&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experimental drug Z-Endoxifen HCl (endoxifen) is related to tamoxifen, and has been&#xD;
           shown to work against similar estrogen-linked cancers. In many cancer patients,&#xD;
           tamoxifen is turned into endoxifen by enzymes in the liver; however, not all people have&#xD;
           the liver enzymes that can turn tamoxifen into endoxifen, which means that the drug&#xD;
           cannot work properly. Taking certain other drugs at the same time as tamoxifen can also&#xD;
           keep it from turning into endoxifen. Researchers are interested in determining whether&#xD;
           endoxifen tablets are effective in slowing or stopping tumor growth in individuals whose&#xD;
           hormone-linked tumors have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of daily endoxifen in individuals with hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      solid tumors (breast or other tumors), desmoid tumors, or gynecologic tumors that have not&#xD;
      responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with breast cancer must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and one&#xD;
      prior hormonal regimen for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history (including prior hormone use)&#xD;
           and physical examination, as well as blood and urine tests, tumor imaging studies, and&#xD;
           an eye examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take endoxifen tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment, and will&#xD;
           be asked to keep a medication diary to record any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular clinic visits with blood and urine samples and imaging&#xD;
           studies to evaluate the cancer's response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to take endoxifen for as long as the cancer responds to the&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and concomitant medications alter tamoxifen metabolism,&#xD;
           limiting exposure to the active metabolite endoxifen. These factors are associated with&#xD;
           a higher rate of recurrence and shorter disease-free survival in breast cancer patients&#xD;
           receiving tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of endoxifen directly to patients is anticipated to bypass the effects of&#xD;
           CYP2D6 polymorphisms and concomitant medications and provide adequate active drug levels&#xD;
           in all treated patients, resulting in clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  16 alpha-[(18)F]-fluoro-17 beta estradiol (FES) is an investigational radiolabeled&#xD;
           imaging agent used with positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate tumor estrogen&#xD;
           receptor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety and tolerability of oral endoxifen (Z-Endoxifen HCl) administered&#xD;
           on a daily schedule to patients with refractory hormone receptor positive solid tumors&#xD;
           (breast or other tumors), desmoid tumors, or gynecologic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral Z-endoxifen HCl administered on a&#xD;
           daily schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the pharmacokinetics of oral Z-endoxifen (HCl form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the change in [(18)F]FES uptake using PET/CT in hormone receptor-positive tumors&#xD;
      before and after treatment with oral Z-endoxifen-HCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with histologically documented hormone receptor positive solid tumors (breast or&#xD;
           other tumors), desmoid tumors, or gynecologic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with breast cancer must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and&#xD;
           one prior hormonal regimen for metastatic disease. All other patients must have disease&#xD;
           that has progressed following at least one line of standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation, hormonal, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
           enrollment, and recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in the 6-patient expansion cohort at the MTD will be asked to undergo optional&#xD;
           tumor biopsies for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Z-endoxifen will be administered orally once a day in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD is established or targeted maximum dose (DL8)&#xD;
           reached. Six additional patients will then be entered in an expansion cohort to assess&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When imaging agent is available, optional FES PET/CT scans will be performed at baseline&#xD;
           and 1-3 hours after Z-endoxifen treatment once during week 1 of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a relative bioavailability study, 6 patients in the expansion cohort will be given a&#xD;
           single dose of the free base form of Z-endoxifen on day 1 and will then continue on&#xD;
           study taking Z-endoxifen HCl; blood and urine will be collected for PK at baseline, on&#xD;
           cycle 1 days 1 and 2, and on cycle 2 day 1. Please note: As of Febuary 2017, we will no&#xD;
           longer evaluate the free base form of Z-endoxifen in the expansion cohort due to drug&#xD;
           supply issues.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with the following types of histologically documented solid tumors:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER +/PR+, ER+/PR-, or ER-/PR+ breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gynecologic tumors (endometrial, ovarian, uterine, fallopian tube, peritoneal, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Desmoid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors that are ER+ or PR+ by immunohistochemistry (including low-level expression)&#xD;
             such as non-small cell lung, colorectal, and prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with breast cancer must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
        metastatic disease. Additionally, patients with breast cancer must have received prior&#xD;
        tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy (if postmenopausal) with at least one hormonal&#xD;
        regimen in the metastatic setting. Patients with HER2+ breast cancer must have progressed&#xD;
        after at least one prior HER2-directed regimen (trastuzumab, lapatinib) for metastatic&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All other patients must have disease that has progressed following at least one line of&#xD;
        standard therapy. Prior therapy with tamoxifen is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients enrolled based on tumor ER/PR status must have ER/PR status confirmed by the&#xD;
        Laboratory of Pathology, NIH. ER/PR status will be determined on a metastatic site, if&#xD;
        possible; otherwise, the original site or available tissue will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels following any display of&#xD;
        adverse events and/or toxicity due to prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not&#xD;
        have had hormonal therapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
        entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, or UCN-01). Patients must be&#xD;
        greater than or equal 2 weeks since any prior administration of study drug in a Phase 0&#xD;
        study (also referred to as an &quot;early Phase I study&quot; or &quot;pre-Phase I study&quot; where a&#xD;
        sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI's discretion. Patients must be&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 4 weeks since any prior radiation or major surgery. However,&#xD;
        patients receiving bisphosphonates or therapeutic anticoagulation are eligible for this&#xD;
        trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/micorL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        Creatinine &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with&#xD;
        creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of Z-endoxifen on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
        women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate nonhormonal&#xD;
        contraception (barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the&#xD;
        duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order to be&#xD;
        eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in&#xD;
        this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an&#xD;
        unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of&#xD;
        the mother with Z-endoxifen, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
        with Z-endoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the&#xD;
        exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 3 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without steroids or&#xD;
        anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in the&#xD;
        study, including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes,&#xD;
        uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
        myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
        stroke/cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
        situations that in the investigator s opinion would make it undesirable for the patient to&#xD;
        participate in the trial, or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with untreated spinal cord metastases or metastases close to vital organs (as&#xD;
        determined by the principal investigator) are excluded because of the risk of hormonal&#xD;
        flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis must be on anti-coagulation therapy prior&#xD;
        to enrollment. Patients requiring prophylactic anti-coagulation are eligible.&#xD;
