  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with malignant obstructive jaundice (cancer of head of pancreas and&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma) generally have a very poor prognosis with less than 20% patients having&#xD;
      resectable disease at presentation. These patients also have a very poor quality of life with&#xD;
      a life expectancy of 6-8 months. Jaundice associated with pruritus, poor appetite,&#xD;
      malabsorption and loss of weight and cholangitis is the most common and troublesome problem.&#xD;
      Placement of metallic stents has been the standard of care for patients with unresectable&#xD;
      disease. However, about 50% of these stents get blocked in 6-8 months. Use of endoscopic&#xD;
      Radio-frequency Ablation (RFA) prior to placement of metal stents may increase the patency of&#xD;
      these stents&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We assume that application of endobiliary RFA to the malignant stricture which results in&#xD;
      considerable charring of the tumor would result in prolongation of Self-expandable metal&#xD;
      Stent (SEMS) patency by decreasing tumor in-growth and overgrowth. It is further speculated&#xD;
      that prolonged stent patency will improve the quality of life of these patients, prevent&#xD;
      cholangitis and optimize chemotherapy. A further outcome may be an improvement in the&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions which we intend to answer through this trial would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does application of prior endo-biliary radiofrequency affect patency of SEMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the complications associated with the use of endo-biliary RFA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does endo-biliary RFA with immediate placement of SEMS improve patient survival?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there any improvement in the quality of life of the patient with the combined use of&#xD;
           endo-biliary RFA and SEMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a double blind, sham operated, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients: Clinical data and investigations suggestive of unresectable malignant bile&#xD;
           duct obstruction. All patients will be discussed at the hepato-biliary multidisciplinary&#xD;
           meeting which should come to a unanimous decision on tumor unresectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age more than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Histologically/ Cytologically confirmed malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Informed consent: The patient should voluntarily agree to participation and&#xD;
           randomization. Oral and written information about the nature of the trial will be given&#xD;
           to all patients considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent not obtained or withdrawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Extremely poor general condition not amenable for conscious sedation used for Endoscopic&#xD;
           retrograde Cholangiography (ERC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Candidate suitable for surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Klatskin type 4 tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Previous biliary intervention such as plastic stent insertion for more than 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any other contra-indication to ERC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed consent and satisfying the inclusion criteria, the patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the following two arms using computer generated randomization blocks.&#xD;
      The operator and the patient will be blinded to use of RFA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental arm: Insertion and activation of the endo-biliary RF catheter at the site&#xD;
           of the stricture before insertion of a SEMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control arm: Insertion and sham activation of the endo-biliary RF catheter at the site&#xD;
           of the stricture before insertion of a SEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will get the same SEMS with variable lengths (depending on the stricture size)&#xD;
      to maintain uniformity. Endoscopic sphincterotomy will be performed in all patients prior to&#xD;
      endo-biliary RF application and SEMS insertion. Opacification of the cystic duct and whether&#xD;
      the endo-biliary RFA catheter was placed at the cystic duct opening will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected by an advanced endoscopy fellow and will include age, gender,&#xD;
      WHO performance score, presence of gall bladder or gall stones, primary tumor type and stage,&#xD;
      baseline liver function test, adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, the patients will be followed up in the clinic at 1 week,&#xD;
      1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. At each visit, a detailed clinical&#xD;
      history, examination, adverse events, adjuvant therapy and liver function tests will be&#xD;
      carried out. Patients will be assessed according to the World Health Organization performance&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 - Asymptomatic (Fully active, able to carry on all predisease activities without&#xD;
           restriction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 - Symptomatic but completely ambulatory (Restricted in physically strenuous activity&#xD;
           but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. For example,&#xD;
           light housework, office work)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 - Symptomatic, &lt;50% in bed during the day (Ambulatory and capable of all self care but&#xD;
           unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 - Symptomatic, &gt;50% in bed, but not bedbound (Capable of only limited self-care,&#xD;
           confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 - Bedbound (Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to&#xD;
           bed or chair)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 - Death All patients will be referred for an oncological opinion for palliative&#xD;
           chemotherapy. The patients and their care-givers will be told about symptoms of&#xD;
           cholangitis and stent obstruction and will be asked to contact the hospital immediately&#xD;
           in such cases. In the event of a confirmed SEMS occlusion, either a new SEMS or a&#xD;
           plastic stent will be placed depending on the patient's prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stent occlusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cholangitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. or serum bilirubin &gt; 3mg/dL with a previously normal bilirubin or above the&#xD;
                baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Any clinical jaundice should be confirmed as being caused by stent occlusion by&#xD;
                imaging or ERC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Uneventful follow-up for 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim will be to compare the two groups for duration of stent patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study any complications attributable to endo-biliary RFA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study if there is any improvement in patient survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study if there is any improvement in patient's quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that the metal stent patency will improve from 50% to 80% at 6-8 months. With a 80%&#xD;
      power and alpha error of 5%, we will need 43 patients in each arm. The Fisher exact test will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate any differences in the patient distribution. The Student unpaired t test&#xD;
      will be used to compare the laboratory tests, age and sex. Cumulative stent patency and&#xD;
      patient survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;

    <description>Endobiliary radiofrequency catheter is 8Fr in diameter and can easily be passed over a 0.035 guide wire through the biopsy channel of a duodenoscope at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). Its use in the biliary system was heralded by animal experiments following which power settings of 7-10 Watts for 2 minutes were found to provide adequate ablation. The ablation results in charring of the tumor and this is expected to enhance the patency of SEMS</description>
