      Phase I/II trial of Carfilzomib plus melphalan and prednisone in elderly untreated patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma. Nine: University Hospital of Nantes, University Hospital of Nancy,&#xD;
      University Hospital of Lille, University Hospital of Tours, department Hospital of La Roche&#xD;
      Sur Yon, University Hospital of Reims, University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, University&#xD;
      Hospital of Toulouse, University Hospital of Dijon Newly diagnosed symptomatic Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma &gt; 65 years. Treatment comprises an initial phase consisting of nine 6-week cycles of&#xD;
      Carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 22, 23, 29, 30 (carfilzomib is administered at 20 mg/m2 on&#xD;
      Days 1 and 2 of the first cycle and 20, 27, 36 or 45 mg/m2 thereafter) followed by a 12 day&#xD;
      rest period (42-day cycle), in combination with oral Melphalan 9 mg/m² and oral prednisone&#xD;
      60mg/m², both on days 1 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib will be administered at a dose of 20mg/m² for all doses to the first cohort of 6&#xD;
      patients. If dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in fewer than 2 of these patients, the&#xD;
      next cohort of 6 patients (cohort 2) will receive a dose of 20/27 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m²&#xD;
      dose is administered on Day 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then 27 mg/m² for all subsequent&#xD;
      doses. If DLTs occurred in fewer than 2 of the patients in cohort 2, the third cohort of 6&#xD;
      patients will receive a dose of 20/36 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m² dose is administered on Day 1&#xD;
      and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then 36 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. If DLTs occurred in fewer&#xD;
      than 3 of the patients in cohort 3 the fourth cohort of 6 patients will receive a dose of&#xD;
      20/45 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m² dose is administered on Day 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then&#xD;
      45 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. If at any time during cycle 1 of a dose cohort, ≥ 2&#xD;
      subjects experience a drug-related DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded, additional&#xD;
      enrollment within the cohort will cease, and dose escalation will stop. The MTD will be&#xD;
      defined as the dose level below which DLT is observed in ≥ 33% (i.e. ≥ 2 of 6) subjects in a&#xD;
      cohort. The following are defined as DLTs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any hematologic toxicity of grade 4 intensity or preventing administration of 2 or more&#xD;
           of the 8 carfilzomib doses of the first treatment cycle except a) grade 4&#xD;
           thrombocytopenia without bleeding lasting ≤ 7 days or b) grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≤ 7&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicities (except for grade ≥ 3 nausea/ vomiting if the&#xD;
           patient had not received adequate antiemetic prophylaxis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity considered related to CMP by the principal&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy persisting for more than 3 weeks after discontinuation&#xD;
           of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 4.0). MTD determination will be based on&#xD;
      occurrence of DLTs during the first induction treatment cycle only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Expanded Cohort. After identification of the MTD, it is planned for the dose cohort&#xD;
      to be expanded to include up to a total of 20 patients treated at the MTD for the phase II&#xD;
      part of the study. A full treatment course is the same as for phase I: nine 6-week cycles of&#xD;
      CMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT Phase I: MTD of combination Phase II: Overall response rate [(ORR),&#xD;
      consisting of complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response&#xD;
      (PR) SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Safety and tolerability of CMP Clinical benefit response [(CBR = ORR&#xD;
      + minimal response (MR)], Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration of response Overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects receiving at least one&#xD;
      dose of study treatment. Analyses will consist of data summaries for reported AEs. The number&#xD;
      and percentage of subjects experiencing one or more AEs will be summarized by dose,&#xD;
      relationship to study drugs, and severity. AEs will be coded using MedDRA terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease Response Analyses: Overall response rate (ORR = CR + VGPR + PR) to treatment will be&#xD;
      measured using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Clinical benefit&#xD;
      response (CBR = ORR + MR) will be determined using minimal response (at least 6 weeks&#xD;
      duration) as defined by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT). The&#xD;
      distribution of subjects by response category will be made overall and by dose cohort.&#xD;
      Time-to-event endpoints will be evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and plots&#xD;
      will be provided. Analysis of time-to-event outcomes will be performed for the overall&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this phase I/II study are to identify the most appropriate dose of&#xD;
      Carfilzomib in combination with a standard MP treatment regimen (phase I) and to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Carfilzomib plus MP (CMP) in terms of overall response rate [(ORR), consisting of&#xD;
      complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) (phase&#xD;
      II)]. Phase I/II single arm open label&#xD;
