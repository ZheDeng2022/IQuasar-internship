  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Magnetic navigation in complex lesions/vessels may result in reduced contrast and&#xD;
      irradiation for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to compare the use of the 2 techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the use of contrast and irradiation used in magnetically navigated PCI&#xD;
      (MPCI) with conventional guidewire PCI (CPCI) in patients with complex anatomy (as defined by&#xD;
      a clinical prediction rule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective randomised controlled, single-blind trial Study population: Healthy&#xD;
      human volunteers aged 18 to 80 years of age Intervention (if applicable): One group has the&#xD;
      placement of the angioplasty wire with magnetic navigation and the other has the angioplasty&#xD;
      wire placed by conventional technique. All other interventions will be performed as per&#xD;
      routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the amount of contrast used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Contrast needed to cross a lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. procedural time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. radiation exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical complications at 1 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. procedural success&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index procedure is performed as per normal routine and includes history and examination.&#xD;
      A blood test will be taken once vascular access has been obtained. After the procedure a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled in. The patient will have a blood test 2 to 3 days after the&#xD;
      procedure, telephone follow-up will occur at 1 and 6 months and a further outpatient visit&#xD;
      with ECG will be planned for a year after the index procedure. No additional significant&#xD;
      physical or psychological discomfort is expected with participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Stereotaxis Niobe® magnetic navigation system received regulatory approval for human&#xD;
      clinical use for interventional cardiology in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic navigation gives 3 dimensional (3D) directional control over the guide-wire tip&#xD;
      during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic navigation has been shown to be feasible and effective (1-3), case reports suggest&#xD;
      that it enables the performance of procedures that could not be successfully finished&#xD;
      conventionally (4-6), and that the use of the system may lead to reductions in contrast use&#xD;
      and procedure time (7-11) that can be expected to result in better patient outcomes, and an&#xD;
      economical advantage (less consumables per procedure, more procedures per session). There are&#xD;
      only a few centers that perform magnetic navigation for percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      The OLVG has performed the most procedures of any of these centers and has included all the&#xD;
      patients in a registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry at the OLVG suggests that different subgroups derive different benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal lesions (10) defined as lesions more distal than the first 2 coronary segments from&#xD;
      the aorta (thus RCA segment, mid LAD or distal Cx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success did not differ significantly between magnetic and conventional PCI (88.5 vs&#xD;
      96.2%; p=0.14). Significantly shorter procedural and fluoroscopy time were observed for&#xD;
      magnetic compared to conventional PCI (29.9±17.1 vs 42.9±21.1 min, p&lt;0.001; 8.2±7.7 vs&#xD;
      16.7±22.4 min, p=0.01 respectively). More contrast was used in de conventional PCI group (54&#xD;
      ml/patient; P=0.02). These advantages resulted in a mean saving of 1652 euro per patient&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary PCI (11) The technical success rate was high in both the MPCI and CPCI groups (95.4%&#xD;
      vs 98%; P = NS). There was significantly less contrast usage in the MPCI compared to the CPCI&#xD;
      group (167±80/patient vs 220±87/patient; P&lt;0.001). Procedural times were not significantly&#xD;
      different for MPCI compared to CPCI (30.8±16.5 min vs 33.6±15.8 min, p=0.2) while fluoroscopy&#xD;
      times were significantly better (8.1±5.0 min vs 14.6±26.5 min, p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple lesions (8) as defined by the elective treatment of a single discrete stenosis that&#xD;
      would require a maximum of two stents and excluding multiple lesions in the target vessel,&#xD;
      multi-vessel PCI, bifurcation lesions, acute and chronic total occlusions, or a previous&#xD;
      failed conventional attempt for the same target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural and fluoroscopy times were not significantly different for MPCI compared to CPCI&#xD;
      (21.0±14.5 min vs 24.7±14.0 min; 4.9±4.8 min vs 7.3±10.3 min, p=NS). There was a significant&#xD;
      reduction in median contrast use (60 ml/patient [41-100] vs 100 ml/patient [64-130];&#xD;
      P=0.006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Benefit appears to increase depending on the complexity of the vessel/lesion with&#xD;
      distal lesions showing a significant benefit in terms of contrast use, procedure time and&#xD;
      fluoroscopy time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple lesions show that procedures are not negatively influenced in terms of time, or&#xD;
      irradiation and there may be benefit in terms of contrast use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute procedures where time is at a premium (primary PCI for a heart attack) are not slowed&#xD;
      by the use of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators have published a clinical prediction rule for selection of&#xD;
      patients that will most benefit from this technology. (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this system may have a number of benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in the procedure time, irradiation and contrast use in the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Better procedures with wire passage that maintains the tip coaxial in the vessel to&#xD;
           avoid inadvertent sidebranch cannulation or more accurate bend/sidebranch entry to&#xD;
           produce less complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that MPCI is better than CPCI should be investigated by a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (Magnetic navigation wire placement vs conventional wire placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to randomize patients into magnetic and conventional groups.&#xD;

      Endpoints:&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Secondary:&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age&gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elective presentation for PCI, This implies that the coronary anatomy is known and can&#xD;
             be analysed according to the clinical prediction rule.(13)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The included patients must have a calculated formula with a result equal or greater&#xD;
             than 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pct=1*Vb+1*(Vl=1)+2*(Vl=2)+2*Vc+1*Lbb)+1*(Ll=1)+2*(Ll=2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pct - Predicted crossing time (prolonged if integer ≥ 6). Vb - Number of bends before the&#xD;
        lesion. Each bend causes deformation of the wire resulting in friction. A greater number of&#xD;
        bends leads to increased friction resulting in more difficultly in manipulating the wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vl - End-to-end length from the ostium to the lesion. The more distal the lesion is from&#xD;
        the ostium, then the greater the chance of encountering problematic bends that impair&#xD;
        manipulation, and also the longer the time required to physically pass the wire. This is&#xD;
        divided into shorter than 50 mm (=0), between 50 and 100 mm (=1) and greater then 100 mm&#xD;
        (=2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vc - Vessel calcification. Calcium may increase friction as the vessel becomes more rigid&#xD;
        and less deformable and does not conform to the wire. The frictive effect of a specific&#xD;
        angle will be accentuated if deformation cannot occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lbb - Side-branches within 10 mm. Side-branches within 10 mm of the lesion increase&#xD;
        difficultly because, on the approach to a lesion finer control is necessary, the fixed&#xD;
        wire-tip angle needed for bends now may have more of a predisposition for side-branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ll - Lesion length. Longer lesions produce more friction on the wire. The detailed analysis&#xD;
        of 3D reconstruction by the Paeion system has been described earlier.(12) This rule was&#xD;
        tested on a validation group taken from a second cohort of 415 lesions. The c-statistic&#xD;
        derived from this group was 0.82 showing good discrimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can be admitted from the lounge, the ward or the CCU&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic coronary angiography films suitable for 3D reconstruction Informed consent&#xD;
             obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resuscitation / intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebrovascular accident within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major bleeding within 30 days according to the TIMI definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hypertension (&gt;180/110) after medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant trauma or surgery within 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active peptic ulcer within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemorrhagic retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytopenia (&lt;150)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal dysfunction (Creatinine &gt;140)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or desired use of GpIIb/IIIa blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or women who are breast-feeding. Inability to follow the&#xD;
