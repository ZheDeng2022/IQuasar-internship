  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study have been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and their doctors have&#xD;
      referred them for an exercise test as part of their normal, routine care. The exercise test&#xD;
      will either be a treadmill test or a 6 minute walk test. During a treadmill test, a patient&#xD;
      typically walks on a treadmill while their heart is monitored using an electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      which records the electrical activity of the heart through 10 small electrode patches&#xD;
      attached to the skin of the chest, arms and legs. Additionally, heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      are monitored throughout the test. A 6-Minute Walk test requires patients to walk for up to 6&#xD;
      minutes to determine how far they can go in order to measure the heart function related to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure internal heart pressures using a device called&#xD;
      Noninvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring (NICOM) during an exercise test. Normally heart&#xD;
      pressures are measured during invasive (meaning that doctors have to go inside the body using&#xD;
      a needle or surgery) heart procedures. The NICOM device is non-invasive which means the&#xD;
      investigators do not have to go inside the body to obtain the heart pressure measurements. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will evaluate the non-invasive measurements provided by the&#xD;
      NICOM device during the exercise test and see how it relates to information from some of&#xD;
      subjects' past heart procedures. This research is being done to devise better, less invasive&#xD;
      ways to assess disease severity, track disease progression and evaluate response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICOM device is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to measure heart&#xD;
      pressures. This device is usually used when a patient can't undergo a right heart&#xD;
      catheterization. In this study, the investigators are using the device to gather heart&#xD;
      pressure measurements for research during the exercise test that is scheduled as part of the&#xD;
      subjects' normal, routine care. The research data is being used to devise better, less&#xD;
      invasive ways to assess disease severity, track disease progression and evaluate response to&#xD;
      therapy. The NICOM device is made by Cheetah Medical.&#xD;
