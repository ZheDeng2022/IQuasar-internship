    <textblock>
      Influenza A (H1N1) v2009 infection was responsible throughout the world of viral pneumonia&#xD;
      and severe pulmonary edema requiring rescue therapeutics such as extracorporeal oxygenation.&#xD;
      To date, no data exist on the outcome of patients having developed acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A (H1N1) v2009, and in particular in patients with very&#xD;
      severe lung injury requiring extracorporeal oxygenation. Although data exist on long-term&#xD;
      outcome of survivors of ARDS, the patients included in the observational studies were&#xD;
      heterogeneous with various underlying disease. Moreover, no study compared the outcome of&#xD;
      survivors of ARDS according to the need or not of extracorporeal oxygenation. We therefore&#xD;
      conducted this prospective case-control study to compare the long term pulmonary and extra&#xD;
      pulmonary function in 2 groups of patients, one with severe ARDS due to H1N1 requiring&#xD;
      extracorporeal oxygenation (case), and the second with ARDS due to H1N1 but without need for&#xD;
      extracorporeal oxygenation (control). Eighteen case patients with inclusion and without&#xD;
      non-inclusion criteria were selected from our national registry, and 32 controls (with&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria) were matched on age, sex, and body mass index. All 48&#xD;
      patients will be contacted and asked to participate. Patients will be evaluate at least 9&#xD;
      months after ICU discharge, looking for health-related quality of life, measured by the&#xD;
      Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36), post traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder, assessed by the Impact of Event Scale Anxiety, and depression, assessed by&#xD;
      the Hospital and Depression Score. Pulmonary function testing, including VO2 max test on a&#xD;
      static bike will be performed. Muscle weakness will be clinically evaluated by the medical&#xD;
      council research (MRC) test, with an additional electromyography if the result of the test&#xD;
      was &lt;48/60. A CT-scan will be performed, looking for lung abnormalities (fibrosis...).&#xD;
      Albumin and prealbumin will be measured to evaluate the nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measurement is carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that patients with extracorporeal oxygenation will have a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity&#xD;
      lower than patients without extracorporeal oxygenation (15% difference between groups).&#xD;
      Inclusion of 13 patients in the case group and 26 patients in the control group will allow&#xD;
      testing this hypothesis with a statistical power of 80% (standard deviation 15%). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be the quality of life, the presence or not of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorders, of anxiety and/or depression, the results of pulmonary function testing, of the&#xD;
      CT-scan, and of muscle testing. All results will be compared in patients with and without&#xD;
      extracorporeal oxygenation.&#xD;

        Two groups of survivors of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A&#xD;
        H1N1 infection will be recruited; the first required extracorporeal oxygenation at the time&#xD;
        of viral infection, and the second did not require extracorporeal oxygenation at the time&#xD;
        of viral infection. Patients will be recruited at least 9 months after ICU discharge.&#xD;
        Eighteen case patients matching inclusion and non-inclusion criteria were selected from our&#xD;
        national registry, and 32 controls (with inclusion and exclusion criteria) were matched on&#xD;
