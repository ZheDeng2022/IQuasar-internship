      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that in subjects with type 1 diabetes with a subcutaneous continuous insulin&#xD;
      infusion, adjustment of the recommended basal insulin flow rate in the event of physical&#xD;
      activity allows the subjects to practice sports without any increase in incidence of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia during physical activity or the ensuing hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (NB: hypoglycaemia is defined as blood glucose less than 3 mmol/l or 0,54 g/l in accordance&#xD;
      with the EMEA definition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed algorithms consist of a temporary reduction in basal flow of 50 percent or 80&#xD;
      percent (temporary basal flow TBR50 or TBR80) depending on the intensity of physical activity&#xD;
      (50 percent of VO2max or 75 percent of VO2max). Switching off the pump will also be studied&#xD;
      as an option to adjust insulin dosage in the event of unprogrammed physical activity&#xD;
      (temporary reduction of basal flow by 100 percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterisation of hypoglycaemia during and after physical activity based on CGMS data:&#xD;
           symptomatic or non-symptomatic nature of hypoglycaemia, time to onset of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
           in relation to the start of physical activity, degree and severity of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of overall variations in blood glucose in the event of physical activity&#xD;
           using CGMS data (area under the curve).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of glucose restoration methods used in the event of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of subgroups of patients with and without hypoglycaemia.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged over 18 years, presenting type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on basal-prandial regimen treated with functional insulin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a subcutaneous insulin pump for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with HbA1c less than 9 percent less than 3 months before&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stable basal flow for at least 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients able to pedal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients covered by social security&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients consenting to take part in the study and having signed a written informed&#xD;
           consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a history of severe hypoglycaemia in the 6 months prior to entry into the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable to detect their hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with perforating foot ulcer or a known history of heart disease or obliterative&#xD;
           arteriopathy of the lower limbs, or a history of cerebrovascular accident, or ongoing&#xD;
           proliferative retinopathy or renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women either pregnant or likely to become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients deprived of liberty by judicial or administrative decision, patients placed&#xD;
           under legal guardianship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of episodes of symptomatic or non-symptomatic hypoglycaemia detected by CGMS&#xD;
      throughout the duration of physical activity and subsequent hours until the next morning&#xD;
      (threshold: 3 mmol/l or 0,54 g/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of hypoglycaemia (min), total time in hypoglycaemia (min, percent), time to onset of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia after the start of physical activity, degree (blood glucose level) and severity&#xD;
      of hypoglycaemia, area under the algebraic curve during physical activity and in the&#xD;
      following hours, nadir of the intervening glucose curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting this study, patients will undergo effort testing and measurement of their&#xD;
      VO2max in order to precisely define the different thresholds of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and proposed insulin adjustment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Tests: Basal period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo 5 consecutive tests over a 6-month period. The tests will be&#xD;
      performed 3 hours after the start of the midday meal in order to define a period during which&#xD;
      blood glucose is solely dependent on basal flow. The 5 tests will comprise 4 physical tests&#xD;
      and 1 resting test, to be performed in random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 4 physical tests will comprise 2 different levels of intensity (50 percent VO2max,&#xD;
           75 percent VO2max). At each of these levels, patients will test 2 insulin dose&#xD;
           adjustment algorithms concerning only the basal flow rate of the insulin pump:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 percent VO2max, TBR reduced by 50 percent (50 percent VO2maxTBR50),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 percent VO2max, TBR reduced by 80 percent (50 eprcent VO2max TBR80)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75 percent VO2max, TBR reduced by 80 percent (75 percent VO2max TBR80)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75 percent VO2max, pump switched off (75 percent VO2maxTBR100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A resting test will be used as a comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each physical test will comprise testing on a bicycle ergometer for 40 minutes with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 5-minute period during which the intensity of physical activity will be raised&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 30-minute plateau at the desired intensity and power&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 5-minute recovery period. &quot;Prandial&quot; period In the second phase, two further tests at&#xD;
           50 percent VO2max will be performed 90 minutes after the start of the meal in order to&#xD;
           evaluate the effect of reducing the rapid-acting insulin bolus at the onset of&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, during the 2 periods (&quot;basal&quot; and &quot;prandial&quot;), patients will be asked to&#xD;
      score the intensity of their physical activity on the Borg RPE rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adjustment of insulin dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bolus for the meal preceding physical activity (lunch) will be given as usual, with&#xD;
           no deliberate reduction for the ensuing sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Basal&quot; period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjustments in basal flow proposed at the time of physical activity will take into&#xD;
      account the intensity of the ensuing physical activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate physical activity (50 percent VO2max)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intense physical activity (75 percent VO2max) with 2 possible options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of basal flow by 50 percent or by 80 percent in the first case&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of basal flow by 80 percent or switching off the pump in the second case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of reduced basal flow, this will be maintained throughout the duration of&#xD;
      physical activity and for the 2 hours following the end of physical activity. If the pump is&#xD;
      switched off, it will remain switched off throughout the entire duration of physical&#xD;
      activity, but it will not be removed in order to maintain the study blind. It will be&#xD;
      switched on again routinely at the end of the physical activity period, at the same flow rate&#xD;
      as that set prior to physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Continuous Monitoring Glucose System (CMGS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CMGS to record intervening blood glucose levels will be fitted before lunch and worn until&#xD;
      the next morning. Data recorded by the CMGS will not be visible to patients in order to&#xD;
      prevent them from attempting to modify their insulin doses based on these values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have dinner at 8 o'clock in the evening in their own home in order to allow&#xD;
      superimposition of the blood glucose curves and facilitate their interpretation. The CMGS&#xD;
      will be removed the next morning after breakfast.&#xD;
