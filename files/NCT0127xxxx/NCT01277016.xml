    <textblock>
      In this multi-center phase III trial, untreated patients diagnosed with AL who are not&#xD;
      candidates for stem cell transplant with melphalan 200 mg/m2 are the target population. Stage&#xD;
      I and II patients will be eligible. Stage III patients will be enrolled in an ancillary phase&#xD;
      II study. Eligible patients will be stratified as cardiac stage I or stage II and then&#xD;
      randomized to receive MDex or BMDex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to compare hematologic(clonal) response i.e. the rate of complete&#xD;
      response (CR) + partial response (PR) defined according to the criteria of the International&#xD;
      Society for Amyloidosis consensus.&#xD;

      Design In this multi-center phase III trial, untreated patients diagnosed with AL who are not&#xD;
      candidates for stem cell transplant with melphalan 200 mg/m2 are the target population.&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for SCT with melphalan 200 mg/m2 but who decline to undergo&#xD;
      transplantation will be enrolled in the study as a subgroup with stratified randomization.&#xD;
      Because many newly diagnosed AL patients present with limited organ reserve, the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria take into consideration the impact of cardiac involvement on overall survival using&#xD;
      cardiac biomarker staging. Stage I and II patients will be eligible. Stage III patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in an ancillary phase II study. Eligible patients will be stratified as cardiac&#xD;
      stage I or stage II and then randomized to receive MDex or BMDex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Untreated patients with AL amyloidosis will be offered treatment on this study.&#xD;
      After being screened and found eligible, patients will be stratified based on cardiac stage&#xD;
      as stage I or stage II. Thresholds for cTnT, cTnI, and NT-proBNP are &lt;0.035 microg/L, &lt;0.1&#xD;
      microg/L, and &lt;332 ng/L respectively. For stage I patients both cTnT or cTnI and NT-proBNP&#xD;
      are below the threshold. For stage II patients either troponin or NT-proBNP are above the&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for SCT with melphalan 200 mg/m2 who decline transplant will be considered&#xD;
      an additional stratum and randomized separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there will be the following strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.patients eligible for SCT with melphalan 200 mg/m2 who decline transplant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cardiac stage I,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cardiac stage II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stratification, patients will then be randomized to receive either A: MDex:oral&#xD;
      melphalan at 0.22 mg/kg and dexamethasone at 40 mg daily for 4 consecutive days every 28 days&#xD;
      (MDex) or B: BMDex:cycles 1 and 2 = MDex with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 4, 8&#xD;
      and 11 of a 28 day cycle,cycles 3 - 8 = MDex with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15 and 22 of a 35 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will start within 2 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is continued until&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  completion of MDex cycle 9 or BMDex cycle 8 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  achievement of a complete hematologic response after cycle 6 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  achievement of a partial hematologic response and an organ response after cycle 6 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  less than a partial hematologic response after cycle 3 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  progression of clonal plasma cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of each new treatment cycle and before each bortezomib dose, the patient&#xD;
      will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the previous dose(s).&#xD;
      Toxicities are to be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose modifications or delays will be&#xD;
      made based on the toxicity experienced during the previous cycle of therapy or newly&#xD;
      encountered on Day 1 of a cycle. Dose reduction steps are presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start of a new cycle can be delayed on a weekly basis (for a maximum of 3 weeks)until&#xD;
      recovery from toxicity to a level allowing continuation of therapy. Delay of a new cycle for&#xD;
      more than 3 weeks can only occur if a clear clinical benefit has been observed. Otherwise, if&#xD;
      there is a delay in the start of a new cycle of more than 3 weeks due to insufficient&#xD;
      recovery from toxicity, subjects will discontinue study drug and have procedures performed as&#xD;
      outlined for the End of Treatment Visit in the Schedule of Events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, prophylactic medications will include acyclovir 400 mg twice daily with&#xD;
      dose adjusted for renal function, ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice a day on days 1-7 of each cycle,&#xD;
      and a proton-pump inhibitor. Supportive measures will be used. Patients will be seen in&#xD;
      clinic by their physicians prior to beginning each cycle of therapy.&#xD;
