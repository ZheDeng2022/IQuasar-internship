      Prospective, non-randomized, single-center cohort study treating internal carotid artery&#xD;
      stenosis using the Xact Carotid Artery Stent and emboshield distal protection system in&#xD;
      conjunction with bivalirudin as the procedural anticoagulation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the XACT stent and emboshield&#xD;
      with Angiomax as the procedural anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of Major Adverse Events, defined as death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (Q or non Q wave), and from target revascularization at one year&#xD;
