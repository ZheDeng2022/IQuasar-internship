      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Medically intractable epilepsy is the term used to describe epilepsy that cannot be&#xD;
      controlled by medication. Many people whose seizures do not respond to medication will&#xD;
      respond to surgical treatment, relieving seizures completely or almost completely in one-half&#xD;
      to two-thirds of patients who qualify for surgery. The tests and surgery performed as part of&#xD;
      this treatment are not experimental, but researchers are interested in training more&#xD;
      neurologists and neurosurgeons in epilepsy surgery and care in order to better understand&#xD;
      epilepsy and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use surgery as a treatment for medically intractable epilepsy in children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adults at least 8 years of age who have simple or complex partial seizures&#xD;
      (seizures that come from one area of the brain) that have not responded to medication, and&#xD;
      who are willing to have brain surgery to treat their medically intractable epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
           neurological examination. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and&#xD;
           computer-assisted tomography (CT), may also be conducted as part of the screening.&#xD;
           Participants who do not need surgery or whose epilepsy cannot be treated surgically will&#xD;
           follow up with a primary care physician or neurologist and will not need to return to&#xD;
           the National Institutes of Health for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the surgery, participants will have the following procedures to provide&#xD;
           information on the correct surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video electroencephalography monitoring to measure brain activity during normal&#xD;
           activities within a 24-hour period. Three to four 15-minute breaks are allowed within&#xD;
           this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wada test to evaluate speech, comprehension, and memory centers of the brain, using a&#xD;
           contrast dye to study the blood vessels of the brain and a short-term anesthetic&#xD;
           administration procedure to test the effects on areas of speech and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depth electrodes and/or brain surface electrodes to measure brain activities and&#xD;
           determine the part of the brain that is responsible for the seizures (seizure focus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a surgical procedure at the site of their seizure focus. Brain&#xD;
           lesions, abnormal blood vessels, tumors, infections, or other areas of brain abnormality&#xD;
           will be either removed or treated in a way that will stop or help prevent the spread of&#xD;
           seizures without affecting irreplaceable brain functions, such as the ability to speak,&#xD;
           understand, move, feel, or see.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for outpatient visits and brain imaging studies 2 months, 1&#xD;
           year, and 2 years after surgery.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is being performed collect prospective data on patients who receive standard&#xD;
      care therapy for drug resistant epilepsy and to follow the therapeutic course of patients&#xD;
      from pre-operative evaluation, through surgery, and post-operatively, and to collect&#xD;
      prospective data on seizure outcomes following surgery to add to the body of knowledge in&#xD;
      this field. Primary outcome measures will be used to assess efficacy of&#xD;
&#xD;
      surgery for clinical care purposes. Any treatment under this protocol will be based on the&#xD;
      current standard of care for epilepsy surgery. The secondary goals of this protocol will be&#xD;
      to investigate neurophysiological correlates of human cognitive function and to provide&#xD;
      invasive monitoring for patients with tumor related epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 8 years and older whose seizures are uncontrollable with medication may participate&#xD;
      in this study as well as patients with tumor related epilepsy in whom invasive monitoring is&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened by study neurologists to confirm their diagnosis of drug resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy. Patients that do not have a confirmed diagnosis of drug resistant epilepsy will be&#xD;
      offered further evaluation in protocol 18-N-0066, Investigating Epilepsy:&#xD;
      Screening,Evaluation and Treatment. Patients confirmed to have drug resistant epilepsy will&#xD;
      be offered standard invasive and non-invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures. Diagnostic&#xD;
      invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes for further localization of their seizure&#xD;
      focus may be required. The ultimate goal is to surgically remove or modify the epileptic&#xD;
      focus. Standard procedures to be performed are 1) anterior temporal lobectomy or 2)&#xD;
      amygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy, 3) focal cortical resection for epilepsy&#xD;
      that arises outside the temporal lobe, 4) removal of brain lesions causing epilepsy, and 5)&#xD;
      multiple subpial transection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients in whom invasive monitoring is medically necessary, neurophysiologic activity&#xD;
      during cognitive tasks will be captured from intracranial surface and depth electrodes.&#xD;
      Analysis will focus on the role of neuronal firing and aggregate neural activity 1) during&#xD;
      cognitive function, 2) in other states such as wakefulness and sleep, and 3) during periods&#xD;
      of time surrounding seizure activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Resistant Epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with drug resistant epilepsy will be followed for two years after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure and will receive standard neurological examinations and MRI evaluation of the&#xD;
      brain. Patients who do not have surgical resection of epileptogenic tissue will complete&#xD;
      participation after the three-month post-op visit. Participants in this protocol will be&#xD;
      evaluated for potential eligibility for other NINDS clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Related epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumor related epilepsy will be enrolled in this protocol because of clinical&#xD;
      indications arising from participation in a seperate protocol, 16-N-0041 Tumor Related&#xD;
      Epilepsy. Patients will complete participation after the three-month post-op visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this protocol is to collect prospective data on patients who receive&#xD;
      standard care therapy for drug resistant epilepsy, and to determine the efficacy of surgery&#xD;
      for treatment while collecting physiology, tissue, and behavioral data for research.The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure for patients with drug resistant epilepsy is the change in seizure&#xD;
      frequency, as measured by the Engel scale before and 1 year after treatment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures include 1) percentage of patients who are able to be completely withdrawn&#xD;
      from anti-epileptic medication; 2) percentage of patients who are seizure-free (Engel Class&#xD;
      I); 3) mean Engel Class one year after surgery stratified by the type of surgical procedure;&#xD;
      4) percentage of patients with permanent neurological side-effects from surgical treatment;&#xD;
      and 5) neurophysiological correlates of cognitive function. Outcomes for patients with tumor&#xD;
      related epilepsy will be assessed under a seperate protocol, 16-N-0041, Tumor Related&#xD;
      Epilepsy.&#xD;
