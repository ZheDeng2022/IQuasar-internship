      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether Maraviroc is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), when it does not remit with standard antiretroviral drug&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have greatly decreased the incidence&#xD;
      of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) in resource rich settings, KS continues to be the most prevalent&#xD;
      AIDS-defining malignancy in the world and carries with it significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Indeed, in a recent epidemiological study examining cancers in Kampala, Uganda, KS&#xD;
      was found to be second only to prostate cancer in terms of incidence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may be involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of KS. Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes Virus (KSHV), an agent found as&#xD;
      necessary for KS pathogenesis, encodes viral macrophage inflammatory proteins or vMIP. vMIP-I&#xD;
      and vMIP-II have been found to be ligands for chemokine receptors, and in particular the CCR5&#xD;
      receptor [5, 6], suggesting a potential role in the inflammatory process needed for KS&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Further, vMIP-I induces Ca(2+) mobilization in monocytes expressing CCR5,&#xD;
      suggesting an agonistic relationship between vMIP-I and the CCR5 receptor. In addition, vMIP&#xD;
      has been found to be proangiogenic when expressed in endothelial cells, a key feature of KS&#xD;
      tumor survival. As well, CCR5 has been found to be significantly increased in T cells&#xD;
      populations of KS patients (from a preliminary study), and in 2 double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in which a total of 1049 patients received the randomly&#xD;
      assigned drug MVC, there was a trend revealing a lower incidence of KS in MVC arms vs placebo&#xD;
      (0.36% vs 1.43%). This agonistic binding relationship between protein vMIP and CCR5, the&#xD;
      proangiogenic activity associated with vMIP, the increased expression of CCR5 in KS, and&#xD;
      trend towards lower incidence of KS when patients are taking MVC, suggest CCR5 may play an&#xD;
      important role in KS pathogenesis. This involvement of CCR5 in KS pathogenesis implies that&#xD;
      MVC may function as a potential therapeutic for KS. To date, there have been no studies&#xD;
      examining the effect of MVC on KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for therapeutic development for KS. Standard of care for KS involves&#xD;
      initiation or optimization of antiretroviral therapy. A significant proportion of KS cases do&#xD;
      not respond to ART alone, with non-response rates ranging from 25-55%, with response times&#xD;
      averaging 9 or more months depending on which patient series is identified. In severe or in&#xD;
      cases of KS unresponsive to ART, standard of care involves systemic chemotherapy with&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin, which is not without adverse reactions. Adverse reactions to liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin include cardiac toxicity, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      and patients may require pre-regime tests of varying costs, along with resources and time&#xD;
      needed for intravenous infusion. Nonresponse rates for liposomal doxorubicin hover around&#xD;
      20%. Focal cases may be more amenable to radiation therapy or intralesional velban. However,&#xD;
      radiation and intralesional therapies are limited to focal sites, require monitored visits&#xD;
      and specialized care, can be given only in limited amounts, and carry various adverse&#xD;
      effects. With these nonresponse rates, potential adverse reactions, and resources and time&#xD;
      needed for therapeutic delivery, there are clear benefits proffered by an effective oral&#xD;
      therapy requiring minimal monitoring, as is the case with MVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maraviroc (MVC) is a member of a new class of antiretroviral compounds known as small&#xD;
      molecule CCR5 antagonists that block R5 HIV entry into cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)&#xD;
      cells. Maraviroc has demonstrated selective and reversible binding to CCR5, as well as potent&#xD;
      antiviral activity in vitro against a wide range of laboratory adapted strains of R5 HIV from&#xD;
      Clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, J and O. Maraviroc also retains in vitro antiviral activity&#xD;
      against clinical isolates resistant to the existing drug classes, but has no activity against&#xD;
      viruses that enter CD4+ cells using CXCR4. In vitro studies with approved antiretroviral&#xD;
      medications indicate that there is no evidence of antagonism with any members of the other&#xD;
      four classes of antiretroviral medications; nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors (NRTIs), non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease&#xD;
      inhibitors (PIs) or fusion inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is growing evidence that CCR5, a potential therapeutic target, is involved in&#xD;
      KS pathogenesis, to date there are no studies examining the effects of a CCR5 inhibitor such&#xD;
      as Maraviroc (MVC) on KS. As such, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      Maraviroc, a CCR5 inhibitor, on KS.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Edema Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The presence and extent of lower extremity edema was assessed and graded on a scale from 0 to 2 in patients with a higher grade indicating a greater level of edema using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS Adverse Events (AE) Grading Table), Version 1.0. Edema grade was recorded at baseline was compared with edema grades recorded at week 96, or at last assessment if participant withdrew from study prior to week 96 and an change in grade was calculated to examine whether or not a decrease in overall grade was observed.

      <desc>No grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported during study. Participants dosage of Maraviroc varied throughout the study depending on their non-interventional anti-viral regimen per FDA recommended dosing guidelines. Dosing was not held or limited based on low-grade adverse events therefore adverse event data was aggregated across all dosages.</desc>

          <title>Treatment Arm (Maraviroc)</title>
          <description>The subjects in this arm will receive Maraviroc as treatment, while continuing their current antiretroviral medication regimen.&#xD;
Maraviroc: FDA Recommended dosing will be used in this study. Subjects on an efavirenz or etravirine-based regimen will be dosed at 600 mg orally, twice per day, for 96 weeks.&#xD;
Subjects on a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor based regimen (except for tipranavir/ritonavir) will be dosed at 150 mg orally, twice per day, for 96 weeks.&#xD;
Subjects that are on regimens that do not include etravirine, efavirenz, or ritonavir will be dosed at 300mg orally, twice per day, for 96 weeks. These doses are based on the recommendations from the company based on drug-drug interactions.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Only 5 participants had greater than 80% cell viability in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimens required for flow cytometry at baseline and final follow-up. In the remaining eight patients, either the baseline or final follow-up or both specimens had lower than 80% cell viability and were therefore excluded from immunophenotyping analyses. The small sample sizes reduced the statistical power of the reported results.</limitations_and_caveats>
