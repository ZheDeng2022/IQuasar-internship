      Rationale: Delirium is a frequently encountered problem in ICU patients and leads to&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality; Delirium in the ICU is associated with sleep deprivation&#xD;
      which is among others caused by a disrupted circadian rhythm; Dynamic Light application aims&#xD;
      at restoring a proper circadian rhythm by rhythmically alternating light intensity and has&#xD;
      shown beneficial effects in sleep quality. Whether DLA improves sleep quality and reduces&#xD;
      delirium incidence in ICU patients is not known&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility of dynamic light application in the ICU and to study the effects&#xD;
      of dynamic light application on the incidence of delirium, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, the number of ICU and hospital days, and mortality in a mixed population of&#xD;
      medical and surgical ICU patients. In a subgroup of patients with a high risk of developing&#xD;
      delirium, markers of circadian rhythm, inflammation and brain damage and post ICU HRQoL will&#xD;
      be assessed Study design: prospective randomized single centre trial Study population: adult&#xD;
      ICU patients &gt; 18 years old with an expected duration of stay of more than 24 hours&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized between Standard Care or Standard Care + DLA; When&#xD;
      receiving standard care, normal lighting settings will be used in that patient room, which&#xD;
      can be controlled by the medical personnel; In the rooms of patients randomized to the DLA&#xD;
      group, DL is applied with a changing intensity during the day according to a fixed rhythm,&#xD;
      which is regulated centrally. In addition when necessary, an intervention light can be used&#xD;
      which can be operated in the patient room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters/endpoints: incidence of delirium as measured by the CAM-ICU; duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, ICU and total hospital mortality; ICU and hospital LOS; Serum levels&#xD;
      of inflammatory markers and markers of brain damage, urinary levels of markers of circadian&#xD;
      rhythm, data of HRQoL questionnaires and total light exposure in both groups&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective randomized, single centre trial. The proposed starting&#xD;
      date is 01-july- 2011 and the duration of the study will be 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ICU patients who are expected to have an ICU stay of more than 24 hours are potential&#xD;
      eligible. On ICU admission, patients will be screened for eligibility. The patients'&#xD;
      demographics, patients' health status, medication use, APACHE II score, SOFA score and&#xD;
      admission diagnosis will be reported at baseline. Before recruitment and enrollment in the&#xD;
      study, each patient and/or relative will be given full explanation of the study and will be&#xD;
      informed that they are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considered eligible, patients will be given a unique patient number in consecutive order&#xD;
      and will be assigned to the treatment corresponding with this number. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a one-on-one fashion according to a computer generated randomization list&#xD;
      between Standard Care and Standard Care + DLA. The randomization list will be kept at the&#xD;
      data co-ordination centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the 20 patient rooms on the 2 ICU wards are equipped with a special lighting system.&#xD;
      This lighting system can offer the standard basic lighting in the patient room, with a set&#xD;
      intensity and light colour, or the DL setting which offers changing light conditions&#xD;
      depending on the time of the day, following a rhythmic pattern. In addition, all rooms have a&#xD;
      basic low-intensity orientation light, which is turned on during night-time in all rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The switch between the two modes is regulated centrally on a control panel that is located in&#xD;
      the nursing station and cannot be altered in the patient-room&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Standard Care On admission, a full physical examination is performed and, when possible,&#xD;
      a history taken. An ECG and chest x-ray, when not performed shortly before, will be done. In&#xD;
      addition, blood will be drawn from the indwelling arterial catheter for haemoglobin,&#xD;
      leucocyte and thrombocyte count, renal and liver function, electrolytes, arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis, lactate and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin). Blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, fluid balance, oxygen saturation are measured continuously and&#xD;
      automatically registered in our Patient Data Management System (PDMS). When considered&#xD;
      necessary, ventilatory support is commenced or continued (post-operative patients) and&#xD;
      additional hemodynamic measurements performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive thromboprophylaxis, when no clear contraindications exist, and&#xD;
      ulcer prophylaxis. When patients are intubated, they receive analgesic and often sedative&#xD;
      medications for patient comfort. If patients are expected to receive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      for at least 48 hours, Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) prophylaxis is commenced,&#xD;
      consisting of application of oral and gastrointestinal antibiotic suspension, administration&#xD;
      of four days of i.v. antibiotics (cefotaxime) and surveillance cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice daily at 0800hrs and 2000hrs, routine blood analysis consisting of arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis, haemoglobin, leucocyte and thrombocyte electrolytes, renal function and markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, is performed. When no clear contraindications exist, sedative infusions are&#xD;
      interrupted every morning since this has proven to decrease length of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (39). In addition, when considered feasible, an attempt is made to &quot;wean&quot; the patient off the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator. Protocol-guided early mobilisation is commenced as soon as possible,&#xD;
      directed by dedicated physical therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of sedation is monitored as part of daily care by nurses in all patients every two&#xD;
      hours using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). This scale divides levels of&#xD;
      consciousness indicated by a number ranging from -5 (unarousable) to +4 (combative, see&#xD;
      Appendix). Ideally, patients have a RASS of 0 (alert and calm) and sedation is titrated to&#xD;
      achieve a RASS of -2 to 0. In addition, screening on the presence of delirium is done using&#xD;
      the CAM-ICU every eight hours by well trained ICU nurses . As has been mentioned before, this&#xD;
      method has been validated for use in ICU patients and is easy to use by non-psychiatric&#xD;
      personnel. When the CAM-ICU is positive, delirium treatment is started according to our&#xD;
      protocol (see Appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard measures to prevent delirium among our patients include maintaining a proper&#xD;
      day-and- night rhythm by promoting night-time sleep (reduction of light and noise disturbance&#xD;
      and reduction of daytime sleep using daily activity programs and mobilisation. When patients&#xD;
      have visual or auditive impairments, glasses and hearing aids are being used as much as&#xD;
      possible. A clock is present in each ICU room and relatives are asked to bring photographs of&#xD;
      them so that patients can have some sense of familiarity. Dosages of deliriogenic medications&#xD;
      (anticholinergics, opiates, benzodiazepines) are reduced as much as possible however cannot&#xD;
      be ruled out completely since benzodiazepines and opiates are often used for sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient is randomized to receive the basic light setting, standard lighting is used,&#xD;
      including the possibility of using a high intensity intervention light when performing&#xD;
      interventions. The light switch in the room then offers three options: 1) main light on 2)&#xD;
      main light off 3) intervention light on/off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Standard Care + DLA In addition to standard care, inpatients who are randomized at&#xD;
      receiving DLA, the light switch in that room is set to DLA, as soon as possible after the&#xD;
      patient is installed and initial investigation and handlings (e.g. placing urinary catheter,&#xD;
      a central venous line and/or arterial cannula) have been performed. When interventions are&#xD;
      necessary, a high intensity intervention light can be turned on manually by physicians or&#xD;
      nurses. The lighting operation panel in this room then offers only one option, i.e.&#xD;
      intervention light on/off. A computer will log the use of the dynamic lighting system,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Assessment During the first 24 hours, the risk of developing delirium will be assessed&#xD;
      using the validated PRE-DELIRIC score. When patients with have a risk of developing delirium&#xD;
      ≥&gt;40%, they will be defined as a high risk patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, the presence of delirium is assessed three times a day until death or&#xD;
      discharge off the ICU or death on fixed times using the CAM-ICU. When patients are&#xD;
      unconscious, either because of their illness or due to sedative medications, the CAM-ICU&#xD;
      cannot be performed and delirium cannot be assessed. This will be recorded in the case-record&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since delirium is associated with the use of sedatives and opioids, 24-hour dosages of these&#xD;
      medications will be recorded daily at 8 am. For a list of these medications, see appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, renal function, (plasma creatinine and urea), electrolytes (sodium, potassium,&#xD;
      ionized calcium) haemoglobin, white blood cell count, procalcitonin) will be monitored daily&#xD;
      until discharge of the ICU. Total hospital length of stay will be registered for all&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be analyzed in an intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess differences in light exposure between the two groups, light levels are measured in&#xD;
      every patient room, close to the patient's head. Since daylight may also influence total&#xD;
      light exposure and differences exist in daylight exposure of the different patient rooms (See&#xD;
      appendix 3) differences between light exposures in different rooms will be analysed and&#xD;
      associated to the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a high risk of developing delirium 5 ml of blood will be drawn on day&#xD;
      1,3,5,7, 14,21 and 28 and will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius until analysis. In addition&#xD;
      in these high risk patients, circadian rhythm derived biomarkers will be determined by means&#xD;
      of urinary excretion collected in 3-hour urinary samples during 24 hours on day 7, 14,21, 28&#xD;
      and then once per 2 weeks. To determine pre-existent quality of life a validated Health&#xD;
      Related Quality of Life questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 randomisation, blinding and allocation of treatment Patients will be randomized in one-on&#xD;
      one fashion according to a computer generated randomization list. The randomization list will&#xD;
      be kept at the data co-ordination centre. Since blinding is impossible with dynamic light,&#xD;
      patients and relatives, nurses and doctors are aware of the treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Study procedures DLA will be applied in the DLA group. In all patients 5 ml of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn within 24 hours after admission and stored. In high risk patients, an extra 5 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be collected during the morning laboratory rounds on day 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and&#xD;
      28. Since all patients have an indwelling arterial line and blood is already collected this&#xD;
      is not considered to be an additional burden for the patient. In total a maximum of ca. 35&#xD;
      millilitres of blood during a period of 28 days will be collected. In addition in high risk&#xD;
      patients, 3 -hour urinary samples will be collected during 24 hours on day 7, 14, 21, 28 and&#xD;
      than every week until discharge off the ICU. On our ICU, all patients have an indwelling&#xD;
      urinary catheter. On admission, a validated QoL questionnaire will be handed over to the&#xD;
      patient or his/her next of kin to determine the pre-existent QoL; after 3, 6 and 12 months a&#xD;
      QoL questionnaire will be sent to the patient to determine the post ICU QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed on the whole group but also in a post-hoc analysis where the&#xD;
      effect of DLA will be analysed per season of admission.&#xD;
