  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore the safety, effectiveness, quality of life, and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHF-RT) as treatment after&#xD;
      lumpectomy in patients with early stage breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional radiation treatment schedule for patients who have had a lumpectomy for early&#xD;
      stage breast cancer is 15 to 30 treatments delivered once a day for 3 to 6 weeks. This&#xD;
      treatment schedule can be inconvenient and costly for elderly, rural, uninsured, and minority&#xD;
      patients. This study will evaluate a new radiation treatment schedule called whole-breast&#xD;
      accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHF-RT). AHF-RT delivers higher doses of radiation&#xD;
      in fewer treatments than traditional radiation therapy. The AHF-RT treatment course is&#xD;
      completed with 5 radiation treatments delivered once a week for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
      (AHF-RT) is a safe, effective, more convenient, and less costly alternative to traditional&#xD;
      radiation that will offer the same chance of cure with no additional side effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only women who satisfy all of the following conditions will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent form&#xD;
             conforming with federal and institutional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. must be at least 21 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. must have stage 0, I, or II breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. On histological examination, the tumor must be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or&#xD;
             invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Surgical treatment of the breast must have been breast conserving surgery (BCS). The&#xD;
             margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (including DCIS&#xD;
             component). Reexcision of surgical margins is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gross disease may be unifocal or multifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS)&#xD;
             tumor size excised with negative margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can&#xD;
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node&#xD;
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary&#xD;
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of&#xD;
             6 axillary nodes). Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. must begin adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) within 9 weeks following&#xD;
             the last surgery for breast cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary&#xD;
             staging procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have all usual and customary hormone receptor (ER/PR) and estrogen&#xD;
             receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to enrollment. Patients&#xD;
             with invasive disease must have HER2 receptor status determined (positive or negative)&#xD;
             with immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At the time of study enrollment, patients must have had a history &amp; physical exam&#xD;
             within 4 months and a bilateral mammogram within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to enrollment and are deemed by their physician&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if&#xD;
             diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix,&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must live in a county that is designated as Appalachian and/or rural by&#xD;
             Kentucky Cancer Registry Criteria (see list below) and/or must hold their primary&#xD;
             residence at least 10 miles from the nearest radiation facility. Patients who do not&#xD;
             fit these criteria may still be considered eligible if they are determined to suffer&#xD;
             significant financial and/or transportation hardship during a typical course of CF-RT&#xD;
             or HF-RT (in the judgment of any of their treating physicians). Patients who live&#xD;
             outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky are eligible if they fit any of these&#xD;
             aforementioned conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Appalachian counties in KY include: Adair, Bath, Bell, Boyd, Breathitt, Carter,&#xD;
                  Casey, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Cumberland, Edmonson, Elliott, Estill, Fleming,&#xD;
                  Floyd, Garrard, Green, Greenup, Harlan, Hart, Jackson, Johnson, Knott, Knox,&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic&#xD;
             evaluation (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by reexcision, the&#xD;
             patient is eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Treatment plan that includes regional nodal irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Current therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or&#xD;
