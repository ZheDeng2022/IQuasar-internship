    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate specific approaches used to prevent/reduce influenza&#xD;
      transmission in the SCI/D System of Care in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, including&#xD;
      assessing infection control strategies used by SCI staff and guidance provided by local&#xD;
      infection control units. Due to the rapid spread of and uncertainties about the H1N1 virus,&#xD;
      we will evaluate patient's beliefs, behaviors, and information seeking strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      social media). These findings will lend to the understanding of ways to handle emergent&#xD;
      issues, such as the H1N1 pandemic, in special populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, H1N1 influenza has been widespread, resulting in many infections,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and deaths. Due to impaired respiratory function following injury, persons&#xD;
      with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D) are at extremely high risk from respiratory&#xD;
      complications that occur as a result of contracting influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to understand approaches used to prevent/reduce influenza transmission in&#xD;
      the SCI/D System of Care in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, in addition to seasonal&#xD;
      influenza. Due to the rapid spread of and uncertainties about the H1N1 virus, one objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate patient's beliefs, behaviors, and information seeking strategies (e.g., social&#xD;
      media). The other objective is to assess infection control strategies used by SCI staff (and&#xD;
      perceptions of) and guidance provided by local infection control units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple data collection efforts will be used to evaluate strategies used and their impact to&#xD;
      address influenza (H1N1 and seasonal) in the VHA SCI/D population. At the facility level, the&#xD;
      guidance provided by local infection control units in general and specific to SCI/D will be&#xD;
      assessed via a semi-structured interview with infection control Chiefs/liaisons. An anonymous&#xD;
      survey will be conducted to assess SCI health care providers' beliefs about and use of&#xD;
      infection control strategies (vaccination and non-vaccine methods such as personal protective&#xD;
      equipment, hand hygiene practices, appropriate work attendance practices) in addition to&#xD;
      their perceptions of strength of evidence for H1N1 prevention measures, resource&#xD;
      availability, and outreach by local infection control to facilitate infection prevention&#xD;
      strategies. In addition, Veterans with SCI/D will be surveyed about their beliefs and&#xD;
      information seeking strategies (e.g., social media) about seasonal and H1N1 influenza during&#xD;
      the most recent influenza season, in addition to occurrence of influenza/ILI, receipt of&#xD;
      influenza vaccination (H1N1 and/or seasonal) during the current influenza vaccination period,&#xD;
      and perceived adverse effects from vaccination. Finally, the use of antiviral medications to&#xD;
      treat influenza in Veterans with SCI/D, a two-group retrospective pre-posttest review of all&#xD;
      visits and admissions associated with influenza (or related) diagnosis and/or antiviral&#xD;
      prescription will be conducted. Charts for Veterans with SCI/D and Veterans who do not have&#xD;
      SCI/D will be reviewed and compared for differences in practices in the SCI/D population&#xD;
      versus the general veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide critical information that can be used to improve compliance with and&#xD;
      understanding of influenza vaccination and infection control strategies at the patient,&#xD;
      provider, and facility levels. These findings will lend to the understanding of ways to&#xD;
      handle emergent issues, such as the H1N1 pandemic, in special populations.&#xD;
