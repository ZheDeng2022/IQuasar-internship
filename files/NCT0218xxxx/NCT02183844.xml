  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important that individuals with serious mental illness make informed choices among&#xD;
      alternative healthcare treatments based on their preferences. However, at present,&#xD;
      individuals' preferences are often not being elicited, nor used to guide which treatments are&#xD;
      made available. In this pilot project, the investigators implement and evaluate a&#xD;
      computerized method for assessing treatment preferences of individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      The investigators use weight management treatments for this initial test of the system. If&#xD;
      this assessment method is found to predict treatment use and satisfaction, it can be used to&#xD;
      guide implementation of treatments that improve outcomes while meeting individuals'&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale: It is important that individuals with serious mental illness have&#xD;
      access to treatments that meet their preferences, and that they make informed choices among&#xD;
      alternative treatments. Too often, preferences are not being routinely elicited, nor used to&#xD;
      guide which treatments are made available. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is&#xD;
      common and produces substantial disability when poorly treated. National treatment guidelines&#xD;
      specify that individuals with schizophrenia should receive evidence-based treatments that&#xD;
      improve outcomes. For example, obesity is a pressing problem in this population, a&#xD;
      side-effect of commonly used medications, and a cause of cardiovascular disease and premature&#xD;
      mortality. There are multiple, different psychosocial interventions for weight management&#xD;
      that can lead to reduced weight. None are widely used. If individuals' preferences were&#xD;
      routinely assessed, then clinicians and managers would know when to make alternative&#xD;
      treatments available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This project implements and evaluates a method for routinely assessing the&#xD;
      treatment preferences of individuals with schizophrenia. The objectives are to: 1) develop a&#xD;
      computerized, kiosk-based system that delivers education regarding treatment options for&#xD;
      weight, uses conjoint analysis to elicit preferences, and meets the cognitive needs of&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia; 2) study the feasibility and acceptability of implementing&#xD;
      this method at a mental health clinic; and, 3) evaluate the extent to which this method&#xD;
      predicts use of evidence-based weight services, and satisfaction with services at three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective evaluation of preferences, treatment use, and satisfaction in&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia. 94 individuals are enrolled who are overweight and receiving&#xD;
      treatment at a busy, urban mental health clinic. These participants use a kiosk system that&#xD;
      provides them with education about treatment options, and assesses their preferences&#xD;
      regarding alternative treatments for weight. They are then offered a weekly, intensive,&#xD;
      evidence-based psychosocial treatment for weight. Research assessments occur at baseline and&#xD;
      3 months. Treatment preferences are analyzed to determine how they relate to use of weight&#xD;
      treatment, and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: People with serious mental illness could benefit from access to effective&#xD;
      treatments. Implementing these treatments would be facilitated by routinely collecting&#xD;
      information regarding individuals' preferences. If the assessment method in this study is&#xD;
      found to be feasible, acceptable, and accurate, it could be used to support implementation of&#xD;
      improved care at clinics, medical centers, and community-based programs.&#xD;
