      TREATMENT PERIOD Patients will start the salvage treatment with CPd, as soon as the screening&#xD;
      visits of the pre-treatment period have been terminated. Patients will receive 8 CPd cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I part of the study, the following dose levels of pomalidomide will be studied&#xD;
      with a constant dose of dexamethasone and carfilzomib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level -1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 27 mg/m2&#xD;
      days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 27 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15&#xD;
      followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level 0 (starting dose) Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1&#xD;
      of cycle 1 only followed by 36 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 36&#xD;
      mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level +1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only&#xD;
      followed by 45 mg/ m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 45 mg/m2 IV once&#xD;
      daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level +2 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only&#xD;
      followed by 56 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 56 mg/m2 IV once&#xD;
      daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22 every 28 days. Patients will be observed during the first cycle of therapy for the&#xD;
      assessment of side effects and observation of DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 patients will be entered at dose level 0. If none of the 3 experience DLT, dose escalation&#xD;
      will continue. If one of three patients experience DLT, three additional patients will be&#xD;
      added to this cohort (max 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two of three patients experience a DLT at any given dose, the MTD will have been exceeded&#xD;
      and the MTD will be the preceding dose at which &lt; one of 6 patients experienced a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no further patients experience DLT (1 of 6) dose escalation will continue. If 2 patients&#xD;
      experience DLT (2 of 6) the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the previous dose&#xD;
      at which &lt;1 patient of 6 experienced DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I of the study will end once the MTD has been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II The phase II of the study will start after the MTD has been defined in the phase I&#xD;
      of the study. The dose used to treat patients in the phase II will be the MTD defined in the&#xD;
      phase I of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, the MTD of the association CPd (or in absence of any MTD&#xD;
      observed) the doses of dose level 3 (maximum per protocol dose) will be administered to a&#xD;
      total of 45 consecutive patients in order to assess response rate and clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE PHASE 2 OF THE STUDY WILL START ONLY AFTER THE ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE 1 RESULTS AND THE&#xD;
      RELEVANT STUDY REPORT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANTEINANCE PERIOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 8 courses, maintenance phase will start. Patients will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib = at the MTD achieved in the phase I of the study on days 1, 8, 15 in 28-days&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22. Patients will be stopped at PD or intolerance. For the maintenance period a&#xD;
      continuous assessment of the toxicity and tolerability profile of the CPd combination could&#xD;
      permit to the Investigators to continue the treatment using Pomalidomide or Carfilzomib alone&#xD;
      according to the dose modification plan.&#xD;

        Age &gt; 18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2. Patient&#xD;
        is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
        study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
        consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
        medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an&#xD;
        acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device,&#xD;
        diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or&#xD;
        abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide. Subjects must&#xD;
        have been received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a prior treatment that include&#xD;
        Lenalidomide alone or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must be primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide, defined as: 1)&#xD;
        never achieved any response better than progressive disease (PD) to any&#xD;
        Lenalidomide-containing regimen; 2) documented disease progression during or within 60 days&#xD;
        of completing their last myeloma Lenalidomide-containing regimen.&#xD;

        Significant neuropathy (Grades 3-4, or Grade 2 with pain) within 14 days prior to&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known history of allergy to Captisol (a cyclodextrin derivative used to solubilize&#xD;
        carfilzomib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs or supportive treatments,&#xD;
        including hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation and antiplatelet options, antiviral&#xD;
        drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to pre-existing pulmonary or cardiac impairment.&#xD;

        opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nonhematologic malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of a) adequately&#xD;
        treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in&#xD;
        situ of the cervix or breast; c) prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less with stable&#xD;
        prostate-specific antigen levels; or d) cancer considered cured by surgical resection or&#xD;
        unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study, such as localized&#xD;
        transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or benign tumors of the adrenal or pancreas.&#xD;
