      The aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement a telemonitoring programme in heart failure and obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
           (COPD) /chronic respiratory patients by assessing the real world impact of on&#xD;
           readmissions, consults, home visits, quality of life and economic endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the effects of telemonitoring across heart and respiratory groups with respect&#xD;
           to i) factors that influence how patients integrate telemonitoring into their daily&#xD;
           routines and self care behaviour and ii) how healthcare professionals use telemonitoring&#xD;
           to aid decision- making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand the impact of telemonitoring on a variety of care pathways.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure exacerbations consume 60-70% of costs for the condition and COPD exacerbations&#xD;
      lead to 1:8 admissions so are costly to the NHS. The roll-out of telemonitoring in chronic&#xD;
      disease is in line with NHS policy (Building Telecare in England; High Quality Care for All,&#xD;
      national health service (NHS) next stage Darzi review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite systematic reviews, the Whole System Demonstrator programme and randomised control&#xD;
      trial (RCT) evidence in heart failure, the outcome of implementing telemonitoring is unclear,&#xD;
      the evidence base in COPD is less consistent, and few studies have included economic analysis&#xD;
      or investigated cross speciality implementation. An Italian trial found that telemedicine&#xD;
      reduces chronic respiratory admissions by a third, but the Italian health service differs&#xD;
      from the united kingdom (UK) system. The european union (EU) Commission Communication on&#xD;
      telemedicine 2009 has stressed the need for new deployments to contribute to the evidence&#xD;
      base in respiratory disease, and include a detailed analysis of the process changes that&#xD;
      determine success. Our group has previously shown that telemonitoring reduces unplanned&#xD;
      admissions in heart failure patients, and that elderly patients were able to cope well with&#xD;
      the equipment. The investigators have also had experience with telesupport in chronic&#xD;
      respiratory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the implementation of a telemonitoring programme to demonstrate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether home telemonitoring alerts patients and health professionals to exacerbations&#xD;
           and reduces admissions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if it can be reasonably implemented cross specialty,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the impact on quality of life of patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. interaction between healthcare professionals, robustness of algorithms and self efficacy&#xD;
           in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-over design allows sustained effects on self care and admissions to be assessed&#xD;
      after removal of telemonitoring at 6 months in first groups treated. The acceptability of&#xD;
      telemonitoring to healthcare workers and factors aiding and limiting integration into care&#xD;
      pathways will be explored. Results should inform the commissioning of telemonitoring&#xD;
      locally/nationally, facilitate buy-in from secondary and primary care teams, and optimise&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Crossover implementation study with patients allocated randomly 1:1 to telemonitoring&#xD;
      or delayed entry to telemonitoring (after 6 months). All patients with receive standard&#xD;
      optimal medical care according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure&#xD;
      guidelines, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) COPD guidelines or other&#xD;
      best practice care pathways as relevant to their condition. Each patient will receive home&#xD;
      telemonitoring for 6 months. Comparisons will be carried out between patients with delayed&#xD;
      entry (controls) and active telemonitoring. In the group receiving telemonitoring in first 6&#xD;
      month period the investigators will be able to assess impact of withdrawal in subsequent 6&#xD;
      months ie longer term benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TELEMONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the monitors are delivered to the health care team members personal computer (PCs)&#xD;
      using a dedicated broad band line which is installed in the patients home and is routed via a&#xD;
      secure Philips Server. Each patient receives education in using the device until he or she&#xD;
      and/or family/carer are fully confident. Via information displayed on their television screen&#xD;
      each day patients are requested to answer interactive questions on level of breathlessness,&#xD;
      sleep quality, phlegm production, wheeze. These results from each patient is used to create a&#xD;
      warning system such that if all parameters are satisfactory this will appear as a green&#xD;
      light; or for example, if a drop in arterial oxygen saturation and increase in wheeze, or&#xD;
      increase in weight and increased breathlessness is seen the Motiva system will generate a red&#xD;
      light for that patient which needs to be acted upon. It is an interactive system and&#xD;
      therefore the healthcare team member can advise the patient through their screen (eg.&#xD;
      increase dose of diuretic or oxygen flow rate, start antibiotic and steroids), or provide&#xD;
      educational material eg. on inhaler use or exercise, and patients can respond. Patients will&#xD;
      also be asked several questions once a week on whether they have consulted their general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP), visited an Accident and Emergency Dept or been admitted to hospital.&#xD;
