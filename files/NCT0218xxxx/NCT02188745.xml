  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor&#xD;
      (ER)-positive breast cancer, high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems&#xD;
      counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function, while estrogens increase ER&#xD;
      function, but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that&#xD;
      develop resistance to anti-estrogens, likely because such cancers have adapted to grow&#xD;
      without ER function, and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer&#xD;
      cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens,&#xD;
      treatment with the estrogen 17B-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore, when&#xD;
      17B-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17B-estradiol, switching back&#xD;
      to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can&#xD;
      alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17B-estradiol-sensitive states. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17B-estradiol / anti-estrogen&#xD;
      therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth&#xD;
      than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer is rarely cured by current therapies. ER+ breast cancers ultimately&#xD;
      become resistant to all available anti-estrogens. Response rates to estrogens are similar to&#xD;
      those of anti-estrogens in the metastatic setting. Given that ER+ breast cancers are often&#xD;
      responsive to anti-estrogens and estrogens, alternating anti-estrogen/estrogen therapies may&#xD;
      be more effective than continuous treatment with either type of agent. Anecdotal evidence&#xD;
      indicates that such a strategy of alternating therapies is effective in some patients.&#xD;
      Preclinical evidence suggests that anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancers are sensitized&#xD;
      to the anti-tumor effects of estrogens. Such cells harbor subpopulations that can ultimately&#xD;
      regain the ability to grow in the presence of estrogens, and revert to their&#xD;
      anti-estrogen-sensitive state. The investigators will formally test whether alternating&#xD;
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies is effective for the management of&#xD;
      anti-estrogen-resistant metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, and to identify molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers that predict tumor response to 1) 17B-estradiol and 2) alternating&#xD;
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies. If successful, this study would present a novel&#xD;
      strategy to manage metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer by pre-emptively switching therapies&#xD;
      prior to disease progression.&#xD;

             metastatic or locally advanced disease performed as standard of care within the past 4&#xD;
             months for assessment of eligibility for study participation (except as noted below in&#xD;
             c/d/e).&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ER strongly+ status defined as ER staining by immunohistochemistry in ≥50% of&#xD;
                  malignant cell nuclei with an intensity ≥2+ on a scale of 0-3+. These criteria&#xD;
                  are equivalent to an Allred score ≥6.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. HER2-negative status is defined as immunohistochemistry score of 0-1+, or with a&#xD;
                  FISH ratio of &lt;2 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done (as per ASCO/CAP&#xD;
                  definitions). In cases of borderline or equivocal HER2 status, eligibility will&#xD;
                  be determined by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Archived tumor specimens: Excess tumor tissue must be available for research&#xD;
                  purposes. This will include tumor tissue sufficient to make ≥10 five-micron&#xD;
                  sections; more tumor tissue is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Freshly acquired tumor specimens: As part of a clinically indicated biopsy&#xD;
                  procedure, an additional 1-3 cores or tissue fragments will be obtained by core&#xD;
                  needle or surgical biopsy for research purposes and FFPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with bone-only metastatic disease with a history of ER+/HER2- breast&#xD;
                  cancer are eligible, and bone biopsy is not required, providing their primary&#xD;
                  cancer is consistent with the above-described ER and HER2 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients with non-bone metastatic disease in whom a safe and accurate biopsy of&#xD;
                  recurrent/metastatic disease cannot be readily obtained are also eligible,&#xD;

                  criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be a candidate for treatment with 17B-estradiol and an aromatase&#xD;
             inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the most recent therapy was in the adjuvant setting, the recurrence-free interval&#xD;
             (time from initiation of adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy to clinical evidence of&#xD;
             disease recurrence) must have been ≥2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the most recent therapy was in the advanced/metastatic setting, the&#xD;

             investigational hormonal therapies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be post-menopausal based on either a history of an oophorectomy, or ≥1&#xD;
             year of amenorrhea. An elevated serum gonadotropin level and estradiol level in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range (as locally defined) can be used to confirm menopausal status in&#xD;
             a subject with &lt;1 year of amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Baseline radiographic staging, including specifically either PET/CT, or CT (CAP) and&#xD;
