      -  Cold forceps polypectomy and hot biopsy forceps electrocauterization (HBF) are still&#xD;
           widely used methods for endoscopic resection of diminutive colorectal polyps&#xD;
           (DCPs)(polyps smaller than 5 mm). Jumbo forceps may be more effective in the removal of&#xD;
           DCPs because of their larger size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This was a prospective study of consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and found to&#xD;
           have at least one diminutive polyp. One experienced endoscopist removed DCPs using&#xD;
           either jumbo or hot biopsy forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim was to evaluate the histological quality and adequacy of the DCPs resected using&#xD;
           jumbo forceps in comparison with HBF.&#xD;

      -  Exclusion criteria were (i) having abnormal coagulation parameters and thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
           taking aspirin or other medications which could affect bleeding time, (ii) history of&#xD;
           inflammatory bowel disease, (iii) pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One experienced endoscopist carried out all the procedures using the same techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a diminutive polyp was detected during colonoscopy, and it was estimated that the&#xD;
           polyp was eligible for the study, the patient was randomly assigned by the physician to&#xD;
           one of the two forceps groups (hot biopsy versus jumbo forceps) using a flipping coin&#xD;
           method. Polypectomy was then performed with the intention to remove all polypoid tissue&#xD;
           with one forceps bite. After the initial bite was obtained, the polypectomy site was&#xD;
           observed with visual inspection. If residual polypoid tissue was observed after the&#xD;
           first bite, additional biopsies were taken until visual eradication was attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The size of the polyp was estimated during colonoscopy by visual comparison with the&#xD;
           open biopsy forceps (Open-biopsy forceps technique). Polypectomies were performed using&#xD;
           jumbo forceps (Conmed, USA) and hot biopsy forceps (Wilson-Cook Medical, USA). For HBF,&#xD;
           the technique was based on the procedure first described in 1973, as follows: slight&#xD;
           pulling force was applied to the polyp and then the electrocautery current was applied&#xD;
           until the white coagulum was seen at the polyp base. The technique for jumbo forceps was&#xD;
           as follows: after initial grasping, slight force was applied until the polyp was&#xD;
           separated from the stalk. The electrocautery current waveform and intensity settings&#xD;
           were the same for each patient. Each biopsy specimen was placed in a separate formalin&#xD;
           solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An experienced blinded pathologist evaluated the tissue samples for depth of specimen,&#xD;
           amount of cautery damage (for hot biopsy forceps) or crush artifacts (for jumbo&#xD;
           forceps), architecture, fragmentation, overall diagnostic quality, evaluation and&#xD;
           positivity of surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows v. 15 (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
           Chicago, IL, USA). Demographic, biochemical and histopathological features were&#xD;
           classified as continuous or categorical variables. Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis was used&#xD;
           to test for Gaussian distribution. The data were expressed as arithmetic mean ± standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD), since the evaluated variables were Gaussian-distributed. Comparisons&#xD;
           between two groups were performed using the Student's t-test for continuous variables.&#xD;
           Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test (2X2, 3X2 and 4X2 tables) and&#xD;
           Fisher's exact test. When the chi-square test was used, Yates' correction for continuity&#xD;
           was used. All reported p-values were two-tailed, and those less than 0.05 were&#xD;
           considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
