  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early mobilization (from the first day if possible), first passive and then passive and&#xD;
      active, is recommended for critically ill patients in whom it reduces the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, the length of hospital stay, improves functional status, muscle&#xD;
      strength and quality of life after hospital discharge. The early addition of leg bicycling on&#xD;
      a cyclo-ergometer is now part of common practice in the ICU. It can preserve or improve&#xD;
      muscle strength and further increase the beneficial effects of early mobilization. Electrical&#xD;
      muscle stimulation of the quadriceps, is practiced in some intensive care units, and it&#xD;
      should, in theory, also through an improvement of muscle strength, increase the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that early quadriceps electrical stimulation and early work on a&#xD;
      cyclo-ergometer associated with a standard protocol of early passive/active mobilization in&#xD;
      the ICU may improve muscle function and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, length&#xD;
      of stay, the number of readmissions and improve the quality of life in the mid term in&#xD;
      critically ill patients, as compared to a conventional protocol of early passive/active&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;
