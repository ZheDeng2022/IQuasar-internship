      The purpose of this study is to determine if vitamin D as an adjuvant therapy can improve the&#xD;
      outcome (i.e. fewer relapses) and the quality of life, including levels of physical activity,&#xD;
      in children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting all segments of the digestive&#xD;
      tract from the mouth to the anus. This condition is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      relapses throughout the course of the disease. Nearly 25% of patients with Crohn's disease&#xD;
      are in the pediatric age range. Many epidemiological data are in favor of an increase&#xD;
      incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease. Environmental factors could explain this increased&#xD;
      incidence. Among them sunlight exposure and vitamin D deficiency have been suggested by many&#xD;
      authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have described how varying doses of oral vitamin D supplementation can alter&#xD;
      serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), but no study has specifically addressed the&#xD;
      question as to whether vitamin D supplementation can alter the rate of relapse/complications&#xD;
      and/or quality of life in children diagnosed with CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments of CD at diagnosis are effective around the time of diagnosis, but in the&#xD;
      short and long term, some of these therapies are inefficient or lead to allergic or&#xD;
      intolerance reactions. Altogether the rate of relapses in the year after diagnosis is&#xD;
      significant. Thus, different therapeutic approaches must be investigated with the aim of&#xD;
      lowering the burden of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From November 2012 to July 2013, we conducted an open label pilot cohort study aiming to&#xD;
      investigate the bioavailability and tolerance of high doses of vitamin D3 (3,000 IU or 4,000&#xD;
      IU per day) administered orally as an adjunct therapy in 20 children with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      pediatric CD (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01692808). Data from laboratory studies,&#xD;
      observational research and pilot trials taken together suggest that vitamin D can be of great&#xD;
      importance in the genesis and progression of CD. Vitamin D deficiency could be a true risk&#xD;
      factor for disease occurrence and/or relapses. The results of our pilot study demonstrate&#xD;
      that in children with active CD at diagnosis, a daily dose of 4,000 IU of vitamin D is well&#xD;
      tolerated and quickly increases the blood levels of 25OHD3 to 100 nmol/L or above in 100% of&#xD;
      children with CD at diagnosis. Moreover a maintenance dosage of 2,000 IU a day is required&#xD;
      (and sufficient) for maintaining this target over several months. Currently there is no&#xD;
      adequately powered study in the pediatric CD population exploring the relationship between&#xD;
      vitamin D therapy at diagnosis and CD outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the efficacy of high-dose oral&#xD;
      vitamin D, as adjunct therapy, in children with newly diagnosed CD, to reduce the relapse&#xD;
      rate and to improve patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy End Point: The proportion of patient with at least one relapse 52 weeks&#xD;
      after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoint: Quality of life scores, Cumulative steroid dose, Time to first&#xD;
      relapse, Duration of corticotherapy, Number of relapses, Number of hospitalizations Safety&#xD;
      Endpoint : incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as a corrected serum calcium level &gt;2.65&#xD;
      mmol/L), incidence of hypercalciuria (defined as urinary calcium to creatinine molar ratio&#xD;
      ≥1.50), incidence of supra-optimal levels of 25OHD3 as defined by a serum level ≥ 250 nmol/L,&#xD;
      rate of study discontinuation due to hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Variable: Occurrence of relapse, Time to relapse, Change in QoL score from baseline&#xD;
      to 26 weeks, 52 weeks. Change in physical activity score from baseline to 26 weeks, 52 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>A relapse is defined as the occurrence of clinical symptoms (&gt; 2 bowel movements per day, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, perianal disease or extra-intestinal symptoms) and a pediatric Crohn's disease Activity Index (PCDAI) &gt; 30.&#xD;
The PCDAI is a validated and reproducible tool that was developed by consensus at a meeting of pediatric (Inflammatory bowel disease) IBD experts and subsequently validated in 12 North American institutions. It includes 11 domains, with clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory parameters, and growth.&#xD;
The PCDAI score can range from 0-100, with higher scores signifying more active disease. A score &lt; 10 is consistent with inactive disease; 11-30 indicates mild disease; &gt; 30 suggests moderate to severe disease. The PCDAI has been used in many pediatric trials.</description>
