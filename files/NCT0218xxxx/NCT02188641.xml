  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a particular pattern of inflammatory arthritis often seen in&#xD;
      association with psoriasis. PsA patients have a higher prevalence of comorbidities including&#xD;
      obesity, metabolic syndrome, depression and premature cardiovascular disease. There is&#xD;
      evidence that obesity is associated with PsA. A 12 month study was conducted to determine&#xD;
      whether exercise and dietary weight loss are more efficacious, either separately or in&#xD;
      combination, than standard care alone in improving symptoms and signs in obese adults with&#xD;
      PsA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-five obese PsA patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30, were recruited. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized into usual lifestyle (controls), diet only, exercise only, and diet plus exercise&#xD;
      groups for 12 months. Disease activity was assessed. Blood samples collected after 12 hours&#xD;
      overnight fasting were analysed for glucose, lipid profile, ESR, hsCRP, proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines; tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17&#xD;
      (IL-17). The primary outcome measures included improvement in ACR20. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      included reduction in PASI score, DAS28-CRP response and physician and patient global&#xD;
      assessment (PGA). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Data was collected at baseline&#xD;
      and every 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that obesity is associated with PsA. Obesity leads to increased&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of multiple disturbances in&#xD;
      PsA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12 month, randomized single blind clinical trial was conducted to determine whether&#xD;
      long-term exercise and dietary weight loss are more efficacious, either separately or in&#xD;
      combination, than standard care alone in improving physical function, pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      depression and systemic inflammation in obese adults with PsA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-five obese ethnically homogenous adult PsA patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30,&#xD;
      who satisfied the classification of psoriatic arthritis criteria were recruited. Patients&#xD;
      were randomized into usual lifestyle (controls), diet only, exercise only, and diet plus&#xD;
      exercise groups together with the continued use of standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included other inflammatory conditions. Detailed skin and rheumatological&#xD;
      assessment was conducted. Disease activity was assessed by psoriasis area and severity index&#xD;
      (PASI), disease activity score (DAS28CRP), Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index&#xD;
      (HAQ-DI), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and fatigue numeric rating scale. Blood samples&#xD;
      collected after 12 hours overnight fasting were analysed for glucose, lipid profile, ESR,&#xD;
      hsCRP, proinflammatory cytokines; tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6&#xD;
      (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17). The primary outcome measures included improvement in&#xD;
      ACR20, systemic inflammation markers, BMI, physical function, pain, fatigue, depression and&#xD;
      HAQ-DI. Secondary endpoints included reduction in PASI score, DAS28-CRP response and&#xD;
      physician and patient global assessment (PGA). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.&#xD;
      Data was collected at baseline and every 6 months.&#xD;
