  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present survey was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      GB-0998(immunoglobulin) in the treatment of unexplained recurrent miscarriage in comparison&#xD;
      to placebo using a multicenter, double-blind, intergroup comparison method.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the patients whose risk factors for recurrent miscarriage are unknown who repeatedly&#xD;
      miscarry or patients who repeatedly miscarry despite treatment for risk factors, those who&#xD;
      have never given birth and have had four or more miscarriages. Patients were assigned into&#xD;
      two groups, GB-0998 or placebo, and received 8 ml/kg body weight of GB-0998 (400 mg/kg body&#xD;
      weight) or placebo once a day for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
      rate at 22 weeks of gestation (excluding miscarriages associated with fetal chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities) and one of the secondary endpoint was live birth rate.&#xD;
