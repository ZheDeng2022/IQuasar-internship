        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  15 years of age or younger&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight of 14 kg or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Typical symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis, and within 2 or higher score of serum&#xD;
             specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) caused by house dust (HD) or mite in the data obtained&#xD;
             with the past one year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Moderate&quot; or &quot;Severe&quot; in the Allergic Rhinitis Severity Classification during the&#xD;
             observation period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Patient Diary can be entered by the patient or parent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute necessity of treatment with a drug that may affect the evaluation of the&#xD;
             effect of the investigational drug (e.g., anti-histamines, anti-allergics, steroid,&#xD;
             vasopressors). Patients being treated with the following drugs, however, may be&#xD;
             included&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intal® Oral or Inhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any eye drops other than Zaditen® Eye Drop&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  External preparations (liniment, poultice)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation of desensitisation therapy within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of acute upper respiratory inflammation during the observation period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nasal disease, such as acute or chronic rhinitis, nasal polyp, hypertrophic rhinitis,&#xD;
             septal deviation*, sinusitis*, and hypertrophied adenoid*, of such a degree that the&#xD;
             disease affects evaluation of the effect of the test drug (*: X-ray examination will&#xD;
             be conducted if necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  That pollen (cider, ragweed, Japanese cypress, orchard grass, etc.) is a double&#xD;
             antigen, and that the study will be conducted in the season of air-borne pollen, and&#xD;
             symptoms may be exacerbated by pollen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present or past history of a convulsive disease, such as epilepsy (convulsion&#xD;
             threshold values may be decreased by the comparator drug, ketotifen fumarate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal changes in laboratory measurements, and thus judgement&#xD;
             that the patient is ineligible for inclusion in this study; however, if the patient is&#xD;
             judged as falling into Grade 2 or more according to the MHW (Ministry of health and&#xD;
             welfare) Adverse Reaction Severity Classification Criteria, the patient will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant renal, hepatic or cardiac disease, or other complications, and&#xD;
             thus judgement that the patient is ineligible for inclusion in the study; however, if&#xD;
             the patient is judged as falling into Grade 2 or more according to the MHW Adverse&#xD;
             Reaction Severity Classification Criteria, the patient will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of drug allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1 month, or 6 times as long as the half life of the investigational drug if it is over&#xD;
             1 month, will not have passed since participation in any other clinical trial study,&#xD;
             at the time of the initiation of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgement by the Principal Investigator or Investigator that the patient is ineligible&#xD;
             for inclusion in this study&#xD;
