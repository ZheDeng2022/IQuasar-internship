        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients of any race between the ages of 18 and 75 years with weight&#xD;
             within 30% of normal for gender, height and frame as specified by the Metropolitan&#xD;
             Life Insurance Table&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in the renal group: stable creatinine clearance based on two estimations&#xD;
             taken at least 3 days apart, corresponding to one of four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1 (mild dysfunction) = 50 ml/min &lt;= Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) &lt; 80 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 2 (moderate dysfunction) = 30 ml/min &lt;= CLcr &lt; 50 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3 (severe dysfunction) = CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 4 = end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in the hepatic group&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two baseline creatinine clearances (taken at least 3 days apart) &gt; 80 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinically diagnosed with hepatic insufficiency and Class A or B liver disease&#xD;
                  according to Child-Pugh's Classification; subjects must have a Child-Pugh score&#xD;
                  of 5-9 points&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in the normal group, i.e. normal with respect to hepatic and renal&#xD;
             function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  matched with hepatic group regarding gender, age (+- 10 years), weight (+- 30&#xD;
                  pounds) and smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two baseline creatinine clearances (taken at least 3 days apart) &gt; 80 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No abnormalities on clinical or laboratory evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a reliable form of&#xD;
             contraception which must include a medically approved form of barrier contraception&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seated systolic blood pressure either &lt; 100 mmHg or &gt; 150 mmHg and/or heart rate&#xD;
             either &lt; 50 beats/min or &gt; 90 beats/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any illness or drug allergy that in the opinion of the investigator might&#xD;
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering nevirapine&#xD;
             to the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had an acute illness or hospitalization other than for routine&#xD;
             dialysis within 2 weeks prior to study initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently taking any over-the-counter drug within 3 days prior to&#xD;
             study initiation, or who are currently taking any prescription drug that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator in consultation with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
             Incorporated (BIPI) medical monitor and pharmacokineticist might interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, distribution or metabolism on the test drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities&#xD;
