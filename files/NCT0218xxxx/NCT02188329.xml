    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) was to provide&#xD;
      a comprehensive snapshot of both the availability and utilization of early care and education&#xD;
      in the United States. The main objectives of the study included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing the first national portrait of the availability of early care and education&#xD;
           for the full spectrum of care providers, including householders and providers from all&#xD;
           50 states and the District of Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying early care and education and school-age care (ECE/SA) needs and preferences&#xD;
           among households in the United States with children under age 13 as they pertain to&#xD;
           supporting both the employment of parents and the development of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capturing data on all forms of non-parental care for all children in a household.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing the perspectives of both families and providers on the services offered in a&#xD;
           system where children are often in multiple arrangements and providers receive funding&#xD;
           from multiple sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Linking the data set collected with policy-relevant data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing the understanding of the care received by low-income children and how that&#xD;
           varies across communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NSECE is a set of four integrated, nationally representative surveys conducted in 2012.&#xD;
      These were surveys of 1) households with children under 13, 2) home-based providers 3)&#xD;
      center-based providers, and 4) the center-based provider workforce. Together they&#xD;
      characterize the supply of and demand for early care and education in America and permit&#xD;
      better understanding of how well families' needs and preferences coordinate with providers'&#xD;
      offerings and constraints.&#xD;

      In order to create a comprehensive portrait of the availability and use of early care and&#xD;
      education, the NSECE fielded a set of four integrated, nationally representative surveys in&#xD;
      2012. These were surveys of 1) households with children under 13, 2) home-based providers 3)&#xD;
      center-based providers, and 4) the center-based provider workforce. Together they&#xD;
      characterize the supply of and demand for early care and education in America and permit&#xD;
      better understanding of how well families' needs and preferences coordinate with providers'&#xD;
      offerings and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Household Survey was conducted with a parent or guardian of a child or children under age&#xD;
      13 in households with at least one member child under age 13. Eligible respondents were&#xD;
      identified through the Household Screener based only on the presence of an age-eligible&#xD;
      child. Screening was completed by mail, by phone, and in person. This survey documents the&#xD;
      nation's demand for early care and education services. Key questionnaire topics include&#xD;
      details on usage of non-parental care, expenditures on non-parental care, parental search&#xD;
      behavior for early care and education, and the balance of parental employment with child care&#xD;
      needs and availability. These data will help to answer such research questions as 1) Who is&#xD;
      caring for America's children when they are not with their parents and do families with&#xD;
      different demographic characteristics have different preferences or different patterns of&#xD;
      usage? 2) How do families search for care and how does this vary by age of children,&#xD;
      characteristics of parents, location, and availability of licensed slots per population? 3)&#xD;
      How and how much do families pay for care? and 4) How many families of different&#xD;
      characteristics receive public financial support for ECE, and how does this vary by age of&#xD;
      child and type of care utilized?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Home-Based Provider Survey was conducted with individuals who provide care in a&#xD;
      home-based setting for children under age 13 who are not their own. Two sample sources&#xD;
      contributed providers. One, home-based providers who appeared in provider sampling frames&#xD;
      constructed from state and national lists were sampled for this survey. We designated these&#xD;
      providers as 'listed.' Listed providers were primarily licensed or regulated family day care&#xD;
      providers, but also included other formally listed home-based providers such as&#xD;
      license-exempt providers or providers participating in Early Head Start. Alternatively,&#xD;
      households could have been identified as eligible based on their responses to the household&#xD;
      screener (specifically, that an adult in the household regularly cared for children not his&#xD;
      or her own at least five hours per week in a home-based setting). These providers did not&#xD;
      appear in the provider sampling frame and are designated as 'unlisted.' Data collection was&#xD;
      conducted by Internet, in person, and by telephone with field interviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key questionnaire topics in the home-based provider questionnaire include enrollment and the&#xD;
      characteristics of the children served, rates charged for care, participation in government&#xD;
      programs, household composition, qualifications for and attitudes toward early childhood&#xD;
      education, use of curricula and activities conducted with children (varied to be appropriate&#xD;
      for younger children and school-age children). Portions of the home-based provider&#xD;
      questionnaire will contribute to analyses of the ECE workforce and mirror the content of the&#xD;
      workforce questionnaire administered to classroom-assigned instructional staff at&#xD;
      center-based providers. Other portions of this questionnaire closely mimic the center-based&#xD;
      provider questionnaire (see below), so that enrollment, program participation, provider&#xD;
      charges for care, attitudes, orientation and activities data can be accurately compared&#xD;
      across all different categories of provider. These data will answer such questions as 1) What&#xD;
      kind of early care and education is available across communities throughout the country? 2)&#xD;
      How well does the available supply of early care and education support parents' employment?&#xD;
      3) How do different types of providers vary in their characteristics of care and&#xD;
      affordability? and 4) Who are the individuals working in early care and education? What are&#xD;
      their experiences in terms of employment characteristics, classroom activities, and&#xD;
      professional development? What are their attitudes, orientations, and stress and depression&#xD;
      levels?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of providers identified through the Household Screener offers unprecedented&#xD;
      nationally representative data on family, friend and neighbor providers and is one of the&#xD;
      pioneering aspects of the NSECE. We will learn about both paid and unpaid care, including how&#xD;
      they differ in their characteristics and their availability to families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Center-Based Provider Survey was conducted with directors of ECE programs that provide&#xD;
      care to children not yet in kindergarten who were identified from the provider sampling frame&#xD;
      built from state or national administrative lists such as state licensing lists, Head Start&#xD;
      program records, or pre-K rolls. These providers included regulated, licensed, and other&#xD;
      private providers as well. The center-based provider questionnaire was preceded by a&#xD;
      Center-Based Provider Screener that confirmed and updated information from the provider&#xD;
      sampling frame, determined the availability of school-age after-school care at elementary&#xD;
      schools, and determined eligibility for the center-based provider questionnaire. Topics&#xD;
      covered by this instrument include enrollment and characteristics of children served,&#xD;
      staffing, prices charged, schedules of service, participation in government programs, and&#xD;
      staff compensation and professional development policies. The questionnaire also includes the&#xD;
      selection of a representative classroom about which more detailed staffing, compensation, and&#xD;
      curriculum information are collected. These data constitute a nationally representative&#xD;
      sample of ECE classrooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The center-based provider questionnaire data will answer such questions as 1) What kind of&#xD;
      early care and education is available across communities throughout the country? 2) How well&#xD;
      does the available supply of early care and education support parents' employment? 3) How do&#xD;
      different types of providers vary in their characteristics of care and affordability? and 4)&#xD;
      How many and what types of providers participate in quality improvement efforts such as staff&#xD;
      quality ratings and professional development?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Workforce Provider Survey sample comprised one classroom-assigned instructional staff&#xD;
      person from each center-based provider who completed a center-based provider interview.&#xD;
      Workforce respondents were drawn from the center-based provider questionnaire data, in which&#xD;
      all staff members had been enumerated from a randomly selected classroom. The questionnaire&#xD;
      closely mirrors portions of the home-based provider questionnaire, so that the two data&#xD;
      sources together can paint a rich portrait of the paid ECE workforce, including center-based&#xD;
      and home-based paid providers. (Individuals who were not paid will be profiled as described&#xD;
      in the family, friends, and neighbor section above.) Topics include information about the&#xD;
      work setting (activities in the classroom, interactions with parents and other staff,&#xD;
      availability of professional development and other supports), roles and responsibilities&#xD;
      (lead teacher, teacher, assistant teacher, aide), compensation (wages and benefits), and&#xD;
      perceived leadership and morale, as well as personal information about qualifications,&#xD;
      attitudes toward ECE, and stress, depression, and demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workforce questionnaire is the simplest of the NSECE survey instruments, but these data&#xD;
      represent a signal contribution of the study. No nationally representative survey of paid ECE&#xD;
      workers has ever been done, yet many of the pressing ECE policy questions require better&#xD;
      understanding of home-based care providers' qualifications, access to professional&#xD;
      development, motivation for working in the field, and nature of participation in the labor&#xD;
      market as well as the extent to which paid home-based providers are more generally available&#xD;
      for expanding and improving overall ECE supply. Some of the workforce questionnaire data will&#xD;
      allow tabulation by provider program characteristics (such as enrollment size, type of care,&#xD;
      geographic location, for-profit/not-for profit status, and participation in government&#xD;
      programs) of factors that have been found in the literature to predict observed quality.&#xD;
      These factors include staff qualifications and compensation, use of curricula, availability&#xD;
      of professional development, and children's activities while in care. The data will answer&#xD;
      such questions as who are the individuals working in early care and education and what are&#xD;
      their experiences in terms of employment characteristics, classroom activities, and&#xD;
      professional development?&#xD;
