      The aim of the study was to prospectively investigate the influence of one-lung ventilation&#xD;
      (OLV) on the inflammatory response and to identify possible antiinflammatory effects of the&#xD;
      volatile anaesthetic sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV were enrolled in this prospective,&#xD;
      randomised study. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either&#xD;
      propofol (Group P) or sevoflurane (Group S) for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory mediators (Interleukin 6 (IL6), Interleukin8 (IL8), Interleukin 10 (IL10), (C-&#xD;
      reactive protein)CRP) were measured intra- and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six hours after surgery oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated and chest X ray was&#xD;
      taken and assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical outcome determinated by postoperative adverse events was assessed as the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung injury is the main complication of open lung surgery and is associated with a very high&#xD;
      mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1984, Zeldin reported on ten patients with a complication that he referred to as&#xD;
      postpneumonectomy pulmonary oedema (PLE). The complication is sometimes not easy to&#xD;
      differentiate from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), defined by Bernard et al,&#xD;
      because the patients may not fulfill all the ARDS criteria. The incidence of this so-called&#xD;
      acute lung injury (ALI) after lobectomy is 1-7%. The mortality rate in patients with ARDS and&#xD;
      ALI is 72% and 33%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing lung resection, mechanical ventilation and surgery may induce alveolar&#xD;
      and systemic inflammatory responses. One-lung ventilation (OLV) has become as a standard&#xD;
      procedure for many interventions in thoracic surgery with a need for deflation of the lung to&#xD;
      facilitate the surgical procedure. It is also the main cause of acute inflammatory response&#xD;
      and is associated with ALI and ARDS. The inflammatory reaction produces injury to the lung&#xD;
      endothelium. The loss of endothelium integrity causes increased protein leak into the&#xD;
      alveolar fluid. The inflammatory reaction leads to other histological changes. These&#xD;
      reactions during OLV have been reported by many investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have shown that sevoflurane attenuates cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury. These results have been lately transferred to lung surgery. Some studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that volatile anaesthetics sevoflurane, isoflurane and desflurane have an impact&#xD;
      on ischaemic-reperfusion lung injury. These studies have confirmed the local alveolar, but&#xD;
      not the systemic antiinflammatory effects of sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies to date have not evaluated long-lasting effects of anaesthetics administered&#xD;
      intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrating the influence of volatile anaesthetics on the inflammatory response and the&#xD;
      treatment outcome in patients undergoing open lung surgery with OLV is still a great&#xD;
      challenge for thoracic anaesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of sevoflurane on release of inflammatory markers has been addressed before, but&#xD;
      the added value of our study is that we tested the systemic imunomodulatory effect of&#xD;
      sevoflurane in combination with postoperative clinical outcome and adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the following null hypothesis was tested: the administration of&#xD;
      sevoflurane or propofol does not affect the systemic proinflammatory response after open lung&#xD;
      surgery with OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANAESTHESIA REGIMEN All patients were given oral diazepam 5-10 mg (Apaurin, Krka, d.d.) one&#xD;
      hour before surgery. On arrival in the operating room, they were randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      Group P or Group S. Randomisation was done according to computer-generated order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous (iv) cefazolin (Cefamezin, Krka, d.d.) 2g/100 ml 0.9%&#xD;
      NaCl was used in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised clinical monitoring devices were attached to all patients prior to induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia. For extended haemodynamic monitoring LiDCO plus system was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thoracic epidural catheter was inserted at the T6-7 level. Anaesthesia induction in Group P&#xD;
      was performed with propofol (Propoven, Fresenius Kabi) and in Group S with sevoflurane&#xD;
      (Sevorane, Abbott Laboratories). Before intubation all patients received remifentanil&#xD;
      (Ultiva, GlaxoSmithKline) and vecuronium (Norcuron, Organon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were intubated with a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube (Malinckrodt,&#xD;
      with hook, 37-41 Charriere) and ventilated by volume-controlled ventilation, provided by a&#xD;
      closed-circuit anaesthesia ventilator (Primus, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany). The tidal volume&#xD;
      was set to 6 ml/kg. The peak inspiratory pressure was limited to 25 cm H2O. The fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen was adjusted to maintain oxyhaemoglobin saturation at greater than 96%&#xD;
      (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.3 to 0.4 before OLV; fraction of inspired oxygen 0.6 to 0.7&#xD;
      during OLV, and the respiratory rate to keep the PaCO2 between 3.8-4.5 kPa. The positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to 5 cm H2O. Gas concentration and airway pressures were&#xD;
      measured at the proximal end of the tube using ventilator-integrated functions. During OLV&#xD;
      the tidal volume was set to 4 ml/kg and peak inspiratory pressure limited to 25 cm H2O. Other&#xD;
      ventilation settings were maintained and PEEP was reduced to 3 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol in Group P (4-6 mg/kg/h) and with sevoflurane (V%&#xD;
      2-2.5) in Group S. The rate of remifentanil iv infusion was 0.3-0.5 mcg/kg/min in both&#xD;
      groups. The depth of anaesthesia was measured by a bispectral index (BIS) monitor; BIS values&#xD;
      were maintained at 40-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For haemodynamic management the following algorithm was used: continuous infusion of 0.9%&#xD;
      NaCl 6 mL /kg for the first hour, followed by 2.5 ml /kg/h, if DO2I&lt;600 ml/min/m2 and SVR&gt;&#xD;
      800 and SVV &gt; 10% 6% hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi) until SVV decreased under&#xD;
      10% ; if there was no improvement after 250 ml 6% HES-a, dobutamine (Inotop Torrex Pharma)&#xD;
      1-10 mcg/kg/min iv is introduced; if SVR &lt; 800 dyn•s/cm5 then ephedrine (0.5% Efedrin, UMC&#xD;
      Ljubljana Pharmacy) 5-10 mg iv was given. If the mean arterial pressure increases by more&#xD;
      than 30% and the heart rate by more than 30% from baseline, the infusion of remifentanil is&#xD;
      increased by 0.1mcg/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the action of muscle relaxants was reversed with neostigmine&#xD;
      (Neostigmin-Actavis, Actavis) 2.5 mg and atropine (Atropinum sulfuricum, Nycomed) 1 mg iv.&#xD;
      All patients were extubated in the operating theatre and then transferred to the recovery&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT After surgery, the patients stayed in the recovery room for one hour&#xD;
      and were then transferred to the intensive care unit of the Department of Thoracic Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard postoperative monitoring generally used in these procedures was implemented.&#xD;
      Haemodynamic monitoring using the LiDCO plus system was continued after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen titrated to the lowest level needed to achieve the target arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      of 96%, was administered via a Venturi mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For postoperative haemodynamic management the following algorithm was implemented: continuous&#xD;
      infusion of 0.9% NaCl 1 ml/kg/h , if oxygen delivery index (DO2I) was less than 600 ml/min/m2&#xD;
      and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was higher than 800 dyn•s/cm5 infusion of 6%&#xD;
      hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi), if no improvement occurs after 250 ml 6% HES,&#xD;
      dobutamine (Inotop, Torrex Pharma) 1-10 mcg/kg/min was initiated, if SVR &lt; 800 than ephedrine&#xD;
      (0.5% Efedrin, Pharmacy UMC Ljubjana ) 5-10 mg iv was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recovery room, all patients received 10 ml of 0.5% levo-bupivacaine (Chirocaine,&#xD;
      Abbott Laboratories) and the level of the epidural sensory block was tested. Postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia was provided by infusion of 0.25 % levobupivacaine via an epidural catheter using a&#xD;
      patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The infusion rate was 5 ml/h and lockout time 30&#xD;
      min. Hourly pain assessments using a visual analogue scale (VAS) were performed. Patients&#xD;
      with VAS scores greater than 3 received a rescue analgetic piritramide 3 mg (Dipidolor,&#xD;
      Johnson&amp;Johnson) intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS The data recorded included demographic characteristics, time of surgery, time of&#xD;
      OLV and DO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood samples for the determinations of cytokines (IL 6, IL 8, IL 10), C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) were drawn at the following time points: 1. before induction, 2. five minutes&#xD;
      after the placement of the retractor, 3. 10 minutes after the beginning of OLV, 4. at the end&#xD;
      of surgery, and 5. 6 hours after surgery. CRP was measured also 24 hours after the operation.&#xD;
      For the analysis of serum CRP, IL 6, IL 8 and IL 10, blood samples were collected without&#xD;
      additive. After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Samples&#xD;
      were analysed in one batch. CRP, IL 6, IL 8 and IL 10 were measured by a chemiluminescent&#xD;
      immunometric assay (Immulite analyser; Simens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany); a&#xD;
      high-sensitivity method with a detection limit of 0.3 mg/L was used for measuring CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured 6 and 24 hours after the operation. Chest X-rays&#xD;
      were taken 6 hours after the procedure to evaluate the infiltration of the nonoperated lung.&#xD;
      The following scoring was used: 0=no infiltration; 1=partly infiltrated; and 2= fully&#xD;
      infiltratied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxygenation index (ratio of partial arterial oxygen pressure to inspiratory fraction of&#xD;
      oxygen =PaO2/FiO2) was calculated 6 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS The clinical postoperative outcome was assessed as secondary endpoint&#xD;
      based on adverse events. The following parameters were determined: prolonged antibiotics,&#xD;
      diagnosed pneumonia, reintubation, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, postoperative nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis were performed using the R software v 3 (R&#xD;
      Development Core Team). All p-values reported are two-sided and the significance level was&#xD;
      set at 5% (p &lt; 0.05). Continuous variables are presented as mean ±SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures ANOVA was used to identify differences in plasma CRP, IL6, IL8 and IL10&#xD;
      concentrations between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on authors' previous pilot study in 6 patients, to detect the significant difference of&#xD;
      the IL 6 concentration with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 16 patients in&#xD;
      each group sufficed for the primary test. To compensate for withdrawals, 20 patients per&#xD;
      group were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where appropriate t-test, Mann-Whitney tests and Chi-square test were also used.&#xD;
