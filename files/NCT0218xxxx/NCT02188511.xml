  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarettes are an increasingly popular alternate nicotine delivery system, but nothing is&#xD;
      known about the effects of electronic cigarettes on the lungs. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      e-cigarettes disorder airway epithelial and alveolar macrophages biology. Our goal is not to&#xD;
      carry out a large epidemiologic study of electronic cigarette users to study lung function&#xD;
      and other possible abnormal clinical phenotypes, but rather to focus on whether electronic&#xD;
      cigarette smoke disorders the biology of the lung cells first exposed to the electronic&#xD;
      cigarette smoke, a parameter that is the precursor of abnormalities in lung function and&#xD;
      which is far more sensitive than lung function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to assess the hypothesis that electronic smoking disorders&#xD;
      the biology of the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages, to evaluate these changes in&#xD;
      the lungs of normal nonsmokers exposed to electronic cigarettes, and to directly determine if&#xD;
      the inhaled smoke from electronic cigarettes disturbs the biology of the naïve lung that has&#xD;
      not been exposed to tobacco products. Because nicotine can be addictive with continual use,&#xD;
      we will limit the exposure to a maximum of a nicotine equivalent of 1/2 pack of cigarettes&#xD;
      over a 5 day period, a level that has been used safely in studies of healthy nonsmokers'&#xD;
      naïve to nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain the most unbiased data about the effect of electronic cigarette use on the lung,&#xD;
      normal nonsmokers will be briefly exposed to electronic cigarettes and lung cells, airway&#xD;
      epithelium and alveolar macrophages, lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and serum will be&#xD;
      collected before and after e-cigarette exposure. There will be 5 study groups consisting of&#xD;
      10 non-smoker subjects (A-E), with each group undergoing an increased exposure to the amount&#xD;
      of e-cigarettes (Group a being the lowest exposure, group E being the highest). Six of the&#xD;
      subjects in each group will be exposed to e-cigarettes with nicotine while the remaining four&#xD;
      in each group being exposed to nicotine-free e-cigarettes. Subjects will be assigned to use&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes that either do or do not contain nicotine in a randomized, blinded&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of which the subjects will be observed for e-cigarette exposure will be 8 days.&#xD;
      Baselines for each group will be established on Day 1 in which all subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy and an assessment of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in group A, at the day 8 visit after the vital signs are assessed, 3 hours prior&#xD;
      to bronchoscopy, the subject will be asked to inhale 10 puffs of a &quot;Blu&quot; brand e-cigarette&#xD;
      (for the nicotine-containing e-cigarette, this is approximately equivalent to &lt; 1 cigarette).&#xD;
      At 2 hours prior to the bronchoscopy procedure, if the subject has no adverse effect to the&#xD;
      e-cigarette he/she will again be asked to inhale 10 puffs of the &quot;Blu&quot; e-cigarette. The vital&#xD;
      signs will again be confirmed and any symptoms assessed prior to proceeding with&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. Subjects in group B will undergo an identical exposure, but on both days 7 and&#xD;
      8. Subjects in group C will undergo similar exposure on days 6-8, group D on days 5-8, and&#xD;
      group E days 4-8 for a maximum of 5 exposure days prior to bronchoscopy. The research team&#xD;
      will contact subjects at 1 month and 6 months after their Day 8 bronchoscopy in order to&#xD;
      determine whether or not they have become dependent on nicotine.&#xD;
