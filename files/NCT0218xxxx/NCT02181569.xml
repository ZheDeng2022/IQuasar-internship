  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite research establishing the relationship between sleep disturbances and alcohol use,&#xD;
      there is no clear understanding or model for what occurs once individuals who seek inpatient&#xD;
      alcoholism treatment are discharged from rehabilitation facilities and attempt to integrate&#xD;
      back into their homes and communities. The purpose of this investigation will be to&#xD;
      characterize sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs throughout the process of alcohol&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The misuse of alcohol is a global public health concern that compromises both&#xD;
      individual and societal wellbeing, resulting in an estimated 2.5 million deaths annually. The&#xD;
      National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) distinguishes alcoholism by&#xD;
      craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance (NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorders).&#xD;
      The relationship between alcohol use and sleep disturbances is complex and bidirectional, but&#xD;
      sleep disturbances are common among alcoholics during phases of drinking, withdrawal, and&#xD;
      abstinence. Outcome expectancies, behavioral capability, and self-efficacy beliefs are&#xD;
      central constructs in the Social Cognitive Theory and will be measured directly in this study&#xD;
      using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A mixed methods approach will be used to&#xD;
      study the following aims: a) to assess individuals' perceptions of and experiences with sleep&#xD;
      during alcohol rehabilitation, b) to describe sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs among&#xD;
      alcohol-dependent individuals throughout the transition from a clinical research facility&#xD;
      providing rehabilitation treatment back to the community, c) to assess whether sleep-related&#xD;
      beliefs and/or behavior of individuals are predictive of sleep quality or relapse to&#xD;
      drinking, and d) to assess whether sleep quality predicts relapse. Adult research&#xD;
      participants admitted to the inpatient behavioral health unit and enrolled on to the NIAAA&#xD;
      intramural study NCT 0010693: Assessment and Treatment of People with Alcohol Drinking&#xD;
      Problems will be recruited for participation in this study (n=215). Sleep quality and&#xD;
      duration will be quantitatively assessed approximately one week prior to discharge from the&#xD;
      inpatient facility and again 4-6 weeks post-discharge. A sub-set of participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear actiwatches (accelerometers) to provide objective data on sleep throughout the&#xD;
      transition from inpatient to outpatient. In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of 25 participants (to reach 25&#xD;
      completed cases) within a week of the scheduled discharge date and again four to six weeks&#xD;
      post-discharge to assess perceptions of sleep during recovery. The proposed study will fill a&#xD;
      gap in the literature by characterizing sleep throughout the rehabilitation process and&#xD;
      ongoing maintenance of abstinence.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 2 of inpatient admission, within 7 days of discharge, and 4-6 weeks after dischange</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-item, self- rated questionnaire used to measure sleep quality and disturbances over a one- month (30 days) time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global summation score of five or higher is indicative of poor sleep quality. The PSQI has been validated in populations with insomnia and other sleep disorders, with psychiatric patients, and in normal populations</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TLFB</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 13 and 4-6 weeks after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The TLFB collects drinking information using personal historical events recounted over a fixed time period. It is a standard assessment for measuring alcohol drinking patterns and quantification in treatment programs. The number of items corresponds to the number of days of interest, typically 90, which usually takes about 30 minutes to complete.</description>
