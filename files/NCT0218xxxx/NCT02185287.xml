    <textblock>
      Aim of the study protocol is to evaluate in a prospective investigation of health statistics&#xD;
      if the dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract in women aged between 18 and 40 years may be&#xD;
      the result of past urinary pediatric dysfunction. The aim is to be able to identify the &quot;risk&#xD;
      conditions&quot; which, if treated properly in early childhood, to help avoid debilitating&#xD;
      problems that manifest themselves as adults and possibly to implement a strategy of&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of this age group is due to the fact that it allows for easier retrieval of data,&#xD;
      as it is presumed that the concerned can more easily remember their history of pediatric and&#xD;
      / or have parents still young enough to ask for such information. The problems of urinary&#xD;
      disorders in childhood era have been the subject of increased attention by pediatricians from&#xD;
      the end of the 70s, therefore, history taking may be more complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Fitzgerald evaluated female subjects with mean age of 56 Â± 9 years, and therefore&#xD;
      our study aim is to investigate an age group that does not appear in the literature to&#xD;
      supplement these findings, already reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimate goal is the need to raise awareness of Pediatric Urologists to interact with adult&#xD;
      Urologists in order to implement a shared strategy for the management of patients with&#xD;
      problems of impaired bladder function in order to improve the future lower urinary tract&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A self administered questionnaire will be used in accordance with the&#xD;
      guidelines of the International Children's Continence Society. The questionnaire consists of&#xD;
      two parts: the first explores the history of urological clinic patient until the age of 14,in&#xD;
      order to evaluate any symptoms reported in a specific category of typical dysfunction of&#xD;
      childhood; the second part refers to the present together with urological disorders of sexual&#xD;
      function which, as emerges from the data of the literature may be of relevance urological&#xD;
      diseases detectors. The data obtained will then be subjected to statistical calculations by&#xD;
      which will evaluate the significance of the symptoms present in childhood in relation to&#xD;
      their penetrance in various forms of adult diseases dysfunctional bladder and / or sexual&#xD;
      abuse, with the prediction of the evolution of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire is anonymous in order to protect privacy. The questions that comprise it&#xD;
      have been partly extracted from the questionnaire validated by the International Children's&#xD;
      Society Continent and partly made by the authors of this study on the basis of the scientific&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Urogynecology Urology Clinic,&#xD;
      University of Perugia, while the healthy controls will be recruited by submitting a&#xD;
      questionnaire to the women chosen to sample a healthy population of Graduate Schools found in&#xD;
      the framework of Urology, Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery, University of Perugia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators defined that the statistically significant number of healthy and&#xD;
      pathological subjects can not be less than 200 units per reference category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time duration of the collection of anamnestic data depend on the ability of the authors&#xD;
      of this research in finding the subjects to be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no conflicts of interest to declare, no drugs or medical equipment will be tested .&#xD;
