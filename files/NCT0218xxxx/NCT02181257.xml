    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) for the treatment of either refractory (240) or newly&#xD;
      diagnosed (400-450) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) in patients after lung&#xD;
      transplantation.In compliance with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS)&#xD;
      Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) decision, the study will collect specified&#xD;
      demographic, comorbidity, treatment, and outcome data exclusively for Medicare beneficiaries&#xD;
      who are treated with ECP for either refractory or New BOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation has become the treatment of choice for selected patients with end-stage&#xD;
      lung disease. Long-term survival after transplantation remains disappointing. Chronic&#xD;
      rejection in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) has emerged as the leading&#xD;
      obstacle to better long-term outcomes, and is the leading cause of death beyond the first&#xD;
      year after transplantation. This disorder is a fibroproliferative scarring process that&#xD;
      involves the narrowing of the airway lumen and ultimately complete luminal obliteration.&#xD;
      Physiologically and clinically, this luminal narrowing results in airflow limitation and&#xD;
      breathlessness. Histologic confirmation of BOS is difficult with bronchoscopy obtained lung&#xD;
      biopsies because of the patchy distribution of the disorder and inadequate sampling of small&#xD;
      airways with transbronchial lung biopsies. As a result, BOS is diagnosed and staged by the&#xD;
      decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) measurement from a pulmonary function&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, BOS is treated by intensifying the immunosuppressive regimen. The specific&#xD;
      approach is variable from center to center, but typically includes optimizing the maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen to include tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, high-dose&#xD;
      steroids, and a course of anti-thymocyte globulin. Despite treatment, most patients continue&#xD;
      to show progressive decline in lung function resulting in worsening functional status,&#xD;
      quality of life, and ultimately graft failure and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been used at some centers as a salvage treatment for&#xD;
      progressive BOS. ECP involves separating the patient's blood into a leukocyte-enriched&#xD;
      component (buffy coat) and a leukocyte-depleted component. The buffy coat is then&#xD;
      photosensitized with 8-methoxypsoralen and treated with ultraviolet light within a&#xD;
      photosensitization chamber, resulting in leukocyte apoptosis. Although the exact mechanism of&#xD;
      action of ECP is unclear, re-infusion of this apoptotic leukocyte population into the&#xD;
      patient's circulation is thought to result in alterations in antigen presenting cells,&#xD;
      cytokine profiles, and the expansion of regulatory T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On May 2, 2012, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued a Decision Memo stating&#xD;
      that ECP is covered for Medicare beneficiaries for the treatment of BOS following lung&#xD;
      allograft transplantation only when the procedure is provided under a clinical research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study looks at (1) Early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans or refractory BOS using a&#xD;
      standardized, more frequent spirometry monitoring approach (i.e., defined as using either&#xD;
      more frequent laboratory based spirometry every 4-8 weeks) and (2) Early implementation of&#xD;
      ECP in both participants with early stage refractory BOS and also as first line therapy in a&#xD;
      subset of participants at the initial diagnosis of BOS, in the context of a new randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will look at whether certain coexisting disease states or patient-related&#xD;
      demographic, functional, treatment-related or diagnostic variables (e.g. extent or&#xD;
      statistical significance of the rate of pre-ECP FEV1 decline) might prove to have predictive&#xD;
      value in identifying subsets of BOS patients that are likely, or unlikely, to experience&#xD;
      reduced rate of decline or stabilization in FEV1 following ECP treatment. Therefore this&#xD;
      study will look to enroll a large series of patients from multiple U.S. centers to confirm&#xD;
      that ECP significantly reduces the rate of FEV1 decline in BOS patients refractory to&#xD;
      standard immunosuppressive drug therapy, and to capture and assess specified patient&#xD;
      demographic, treatment-related, diagnostic, functional and co-morbidity-related variables&#xD;
      that may predict outcomes after ECP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a randomized controlled trial that will compare outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed BOS who receive either conventional (i.e., that involves the standard of care&#xD;
      at the respective enrolling center) or ECP for first line management of New BOS. The&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial component of the study will enable evaluation of potential&#xD;
      survival and quality of life benefits of early treatment of BOS with first-line ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with Refractory BOS who agree to participate in the study will be informed of the&#xD;
      following: to limit the use (and attendant risks) of ECP therapy to those patients who are&#xD;
      most likely to benefit, their eligibility to receive ECP within the study will be determined&#xD;
      by the study team's analysis of their pre-enrollment pulmonary function testing along with&#xD;
      input from their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with Newly-Diagnosed BOS who agree to participate in the study will be informed that&#xD;
      they will be randomly assigned to either a control group (Control) who will receive the local&#xD;
      Standard of Care for management of their BOS or to an Early Photopheresis Intervention (EPI)&#xD;
      group who will receive ECP as first line management of BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol states specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for both the Refractory BOS&#xD;
      participant and the newly diagnosed BOS participant. Once eligibility is confirmed and the&#xD;
      patient has provided informed consent, all FEV1 measurements captured within the 12 months&#xD;
      prior to enrollment will be entered in the electronic database. Based on the slope of the&#xD;
      FEV1 decline over time and achievement of a statistically significant rate of decline in lung&#xD;
      function in the FEV1 the Refractory BOS participant will be electronically assigned to either&#xD;
      ECP treatment or Observation. The newly diagnosed BOS participant will be randomized to&#xD;
      either ECP treatment and standard immunosuppression therapy or Control treatment which is&#xD;
      Standard immunosuppression Therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be assigned a unique identification number created from the electronic&#xD;
      data base. The patient demographics, co-morbidities, medical history including date of lung&#xD;
      transplantation, underlying disease necessitating lung transplantation, vital signs, height,&#xD;
      weight, and current immunosuppression regimen will be entered at baseline. A Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be asked at baseline and every 3 months the first year and then annually.&#xD;
      A pulmonary function test will be captured every 30 days for the first year on all patients&#xD;
      except the Refractory BOS participant assigned to Observation. Pulmonary function tests will&#xD;
      be captured every 30 days for the first six months for the Observation patient. Following the&#xD;
      first six months, the timing of pulmonary function testing must be every 3 months at the very&#xD;
      least to maintain eligibility for ECP Treatment. Certain de-identified source documents will&#xD;
      be required and verified on all forms electronically submitted. Data points will be verified&#xD;
      against de-identified source by the Data Coordinating Center. The online data entry portal&#xD;
      and study database will contain a mechanism to a) clearly denote the status of each submitted&#xD;
      Case Report Form, including whether the case report form is complete; b) list the source&#xD;
      documentation needed c) indicate if the site staff member and investigator have attested to&#xD;
      the validity of the data on the Case Report Form; and d) indicate if the Data Coordinating&#xD;
      Center has verified the accuracy of key elements of the study data and what data queries&#xD;
      remain. This centralized monitoring will complement our remote monitoring visits during&#xD;
      COVID. For most sites an initial remote site monitoring visit will occur after the first&#xD;
      three patients are enrolled to ensure that the site personnel understand study processes and&#xD;
      expectations, and to permit early completion of additional training to address any&#xD;
      deficiencies. Should remote or on-site monitoring reveal areas of particular deficiency or&#xD;
      concern, the monitoring plan will be adjusted to focus on those particular areas for the&#xD;
      site. In general, sites and patients affiliated with a major violation will be monitored with&#xD;
      greater completeness. Sites deemed to be largely compliant with the protocol and regulatory&#xD;
      requirements based upon the initial monitoring visit are expected to have subsequent visits&#xD;
      performed at a reduced level of frequency. Overall, the study team will seek to optimize&#xD;
      resource use by focusing on the most critical data elements that may impact subject safety&#xD;
      and/or data quality and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive ECP treatment will receive 24 treatments over the 6-month period&#xD;
      following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowed Treatment for Refractory BOS patients in the Observation will be ordered at the&#xD;
      physicians discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for the Newly Diagnosed BOS patients in the Control Arm of the randomized control&#xD;
      trial will be dictated by the standard of care within each enrolling institution and will&#xD;
      involve changes in immunosuppressive agents. These patients will not be eligible to receive&#xD;
      ECP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than ECP, no other interventions for BOS will be used except for Azithromycin for&#xD;
      patients in the randomized Early Photopheresis Intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improvement in the FEV1 measurement taken from the pulmonary function test will be used to&#xD;
      assess the success or the benefit of the ECP treatment. Patients will have spirometry the&#xD;
      first week of therapy, which is repeated every 30 days for the first year, and then annually&#xD;
      in the Refractory BOS cohort assigned to ECP treatment. Patient's will have spirometry the&#xD;
      first week of therapy, and repeated every 30 days for the first year, and then every 2 months&#xD;
      in the NEW BOS cohort. All patients will be followed for 5 years. There are considerations&#xD;
      for crossover built into the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods. The primary outcome in the RCT or New BOS will look at annual cumulative&#xD;
      mortality. The outcomes between the two BOS disease severity strata will be assessed&#xD;
      separately. In Refractory BOS, a clinical response will be determined using FEV1 as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint and will be defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the rate of decline of&#xD;
      FEV1 assessed by comparing the average rate of FEV1 decline over the 6 months prior to ECP&#xD;
      against the average rate of FEV1 decline over the 12 months following initiation of ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed for up to five years or until their date of death and the&#xD;
      following data will be collected annually after the first year: Spirometry results, the&#xD;
      number of maintenance Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatments performed and Quality Of Life&#xD;
      surveys will be tabulated.&#xD;

             Diagnosis of New BOS is the first date of the two FEV1s that were used for the BOS&#xD;
             diagnosis. Inherent to the diagnosis of new BOS is the exclusion of other potential&#xD;
             causes of allograft dysfunction such as acute rejection, respiratory tract infection,&#xD;
             and airway anastomotic complications. Thus, sites are encouraged to conduct&#xD;
             appropriate evaluation for declining allograft function including bronchoscopy with&#xD;
             bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung biopsies if clinically appropriate to exclude&#xD;
             other potential causes of allograft dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Achievement of a statistically significant rate of decline in lung function (FEV1) at&#xD;
             the diagnosis of new BOS per the criteria in&#xD;
&#xD;
        Section 3.6 as assessed by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For patients who are monitored with laboratory based spirometry, at least five&#xD;
             recorded FEV1 measurements obtained at intervals of at least two weeks apart, over&#xD;
             either the 6 or 9 (i.e., depending on the frequency of spirometry testing) months&#xD;
             preceding study enrollment accompanied by a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) rate of&#xD;
             decline of FEV1 that exceeds 30 mL/month; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For patients who are monitored with home Spirometry, 4-6 recorded home spirometry FEV1&#xD;
             measurements obtained one week apart, over the 4-6 weeks prior to a confirmed FEV1&#xD;
             variance (i.e., the date of the second of two consecutive FEV1 values below the&#xD;
             patient's normal range) along with 4-6 recorded weekly FEV1 measurements obtained&#xD;
             after a confirmed variance accompanied by a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) rate of&#xD;
             de-cline of FEV1 that exceeds 30 mL/month 7. Documented clinical assessment including&#xD;
             a physical assessment and a CBC with WBC within two weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION Criteria (Subjects meeting any one of these criteria will be excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current participation in another clinical treatment trial with an investigational&#xD;
             agent used to manage BOS before or after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition that may interfere with the subject's ability to perform pulmonary&#xD;
             function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to pharmacologic agents used during ECP&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any condition that would significantly affect the participant's ability to adhere to&#xD;
             the protocol, affect interpretation of the study results, or put the participant at&#xD;
             unacceptable risk for study-related complications as judged by the referring&#xD;
             clinician. This may include a) patients with a specific acute contraindication to&#xD;
             receiving ECP due to any acute condition such as new or evolving myocardial infarction&#xD;
             or central nervous system disorder, hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia, acute&#xD;
             bleeding, respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic&#xD;
             protoporphyria, variegate porphyria, xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, or other&#xD;
             dermatologic or ocular condition that contraindicates the use of methoxsalen or&#xD;
             markedly enhances photosensitivity in the investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Aphakia or absence of ocular lenses&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test - a urine or blood pregnancy test must be obtained&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in women of childbearing potential)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with study treatments or&#xD;
             assessments (e.g. due to cognitive impairment or geographic distance)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Recent (i.e., within 2 weeks prior to enrollment) leukopenia (white blood cell count &lt;&#xD;
             30K/cumm or 3,000/mm3/ or 3.0 109 /L)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients whose decline in lung function (FEV1) is related to either Restrictive&#xD;
             Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) or other causes that do not represent BOS&#xD;
             such as pneumonia, heart failure, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For patients under review for eligibility for ECP for refractory BOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a post-transplant baseline FEV1 &gt; 3 liters and most recent FEV1 &lt; 900 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with a post-transplant FEV1&lt; 3 liters and the most recent FEV1 &lt; 30% of&#xD;
             post-transplant baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Rate of FEV1 decline within the last 6 or 9 months &gt; 300 mL/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of receiving ECP therapy within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For patients under review for eligibility for RCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients post-transplant treated with any agent that depletes T lymphocytes for&#xD;
             In-duction, acute cellular rejection or for any other reason can only be enrolled 12&#xD;
             months after the last dose of these agents assuming they meet enrollment inclusion&#xD;
             criteria. T Lymphocyte depleting therapies include (but not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  monoclonal antibodies such as Alemtuzumab (Campath) that target CD52 T cell&#xD;
                  receptors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  polyclonal antibodies such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) via immunization of&#xD;
                  rabbits (rATG) to either human thymocytes or Jurkat cells or via immunization of&#xD;
                  horses (hATG) to human thymocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation. Anti-B cell agents that do not deplete T lymphocytes such as Rituximab&#xD;
                  can be used and will not affect eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any patient who at least 6 months after transplant is treated with an escalated dose&#xD;
             of steroids (i.e., prednisone greater than 30 mg/day or that exceeds 900 mg in a 30&#xD;
             day period or equipotent doses of other steroids like Solumedrol ) for more than one&#xD;
             month for an acute decline in lung function that is suspected to be secondary to acute&#xD;
             cellular rejection.&#xD;
