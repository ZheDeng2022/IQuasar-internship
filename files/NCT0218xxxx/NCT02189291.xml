      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to help identify the best practice regarding the use of&#xD;
      indwelling catheter after minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery. Investigators propose a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing the immediate removal of indwelling urethral catheter,&#xD;
      after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy, to the present standard catheter removal on post&#xD;
      operative day one. Evidence based catheter management will be helpful to both providers and&#xD;
      patients in post-operative decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy results in shorter hospital stay than removal on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy confers no increased risk of re-catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy decreases the occurrence of urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial comparing the standard overnight indwelling urethral&#xD;
      catheterization with removal of catheter immediately post surgery after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy, at Oregon Health &amp; Science University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are hospital stay in hours after completion of surgery and need for&#xD;
      re-catheterization. Hospital stay will be counted from the time the patient leaves the&#xD;
      operating room to the time she leaves the hospital. To avoid confounding, investigators are&#xD;
      only including the first / morning case of the day. For re-catheterization, investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate if patient was able to void after completion of surgery. Investigators will&#xD;
      compare the post voiding residuals, the need for re-catheterizations and the numbers of&#xD;
      patients going home with an indwelling catheter between the two groups. Investigators will&#xD;
      also compare the number of urinary tract infections, as documented by urine culture and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment, between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be women undergoing minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Women will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study during their preoperative visit. If they agree to&#xD;
      participation, this will be noted in their chart. Randomization to group will occur&#xD;
      immediately following surgery.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to help identify the best practice regarding the use of&#xD;
      indwelling catheter after minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery. Investigators propose a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing the immediate removal of indwelling urethral catheter,&#xD;
      after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy, to the present standard catheter removal on post&#xD;
      operative day one. Evidence based catheter management will be helpful to both providers and&#xD;
      patients in post-operative decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of indwelling catheter after minimally invasive pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery&#xD;
      is routine practice. There is limited evidence to support the use of overnight indwelling&#xD;
      catheters, and despite this, the use of catheters after urogynecologic surgery remains common&#xD;
      practice. The objective of this study is to help identify the best practice regarding the use&#xD;
      of indwelling catheter after minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery. Dunn et al found that&#xD;
      immediate removal of catheter after completion of an uncomplicated abdominal or vaginal&#xD;
      hysterectomy was not associated with re-catheterization, urinary tract infections or fever.&#xD;
      They also found that patients in whom the catheter was removed immediately had less pain&#xD;
      compared to the patients who had indwelling catheter for 24 hours. The applicability of this&#xD;
      study to Urogynecology is limited by the fact that patients with incontinence and / or&#xD;
      prolapse were not included in it. Use of catheters after surgery may be convenient for&#xD;
      providers, but the benefit to the patient is uncertain. Investigators believe that evidence&#xD;
      with regards to the optimal use of catheter use in urogynecologic surgery will be helpful to&#xD;
      the providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of urinary tract infection increases the longer an indwelling catheter stays in a&#xD;
      patient. Urinary tract infections associated with catheters (CAUTI) are responsible for 40%&#xD;
      of hospital acquired infections. CAUTI are associated with 387, 550 hospital acquired&#xD;
      infections in a year, which could be prevented. Investigators believe that avoiding placement&#xD;
      of catheter after minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery will result in shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay and reduction in CAUTI, thereby improving the quality and cost of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy results in shorter hospital stay than removal on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy confers no increased risk of re-catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy decreases the occurrence of urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients stay in hospital for a 23-hour observation following minimally invasive&#xD;
      urogynecologic surgery. The usual practice is to leave the indwelling urethral catheter&#xD;
      overnight after these procedures. The use of indwelling catheters after surgery is carried&#xD;
      for multiple reasons, including measuring urinary output and prevention of urinary retention&#xD;
      after surgery. The use of indwelling Foley catheter after surgery is associated with&#xD;
      prolonged hospital stay, fever and urinary tract infection. A study by Haakvort et al&#xD;
      compared removal of indwelling catheter on post operative day 1 to longer catheterization&#xD;
      after vaginal and found a tenfold reduction in urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removal of indwelling catheter may affect the length of stay in hospital, with associated&#xD;
      budgetary and economic implications. One study found that removal of indwelling catheter at&#xD;
      midnight results in patients being discharged 0.7 days earlier than patients who had their&#xD;
      catheters removed in the morning. This results in shorter length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      improved discharge planning. There is a wide variation in practice and policies regarding&#xD;
      catheter removal. With no clear evidence-based practice regarding catheter removal, and lack&#xD;
      of data in literature with regards to catheter removal after urogynecologic surgery,&#xD;
      practices vary among physicians and institutions. Audits in British hospitals found that&#xD;
      almost half of the catheters were removed either at the discretion of the nurse or at the&#xD;
      time of rounds in the morning. Another study found that when the catheters were scheduled to&#xD;
      be removed in the morning, only 70% were removed in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dunn et al looked into removal of indwelling catheter immediately after hysterectomy compared&#xD;
      to removal after 24 hours. They found that immediate removal of catheter after surgery was&#xD;
      not associated with any adverse outcomes or need for re-catheterization, and patients with&#xD;
      immediate removal reported significantly less pain compared to their counterparts who had&#xD;
      catheter removal at 24 hours. Similarly, Alessandri found that women who had their catheter&#xD;
      removed early had a shorter mean ambulation time and their hospital stay was shorter by 19&#xD;
      hours. This shows the economic benefit with early discharge associated with early catheter&#xD;
      removal, however such a study is lacking in urogynecology literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to potential benefits to health care costs, immediate catheter removal has&#xD;
      several health benefits. There is evidence that early ambulation reduces the incidence of&#xD;
      clinically evident deep venous thrombosis. Therefore, early removal of indwelling urethral&#xD;
      catheter after surgery may contribute towards reducing postoperative morbidity by reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of post operative deep venous thrombosis and decrease health care cost by&#xD;
      aiding towards early discharge. Another advantage of immediate catheter removal after surgery&#xD;
      is lower incidence of urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies offering insight into postoperative voiding efficiency after&#xD;
      uncomplicated minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery. There is variation in practice with&#xD;
      regards to the length of time the indwelling catheter is left in place. Multiple factors&#xD;
      contribute to how long a catheter stays. In the absence of strong evidence, this decision&#xD;
      depends on physician preference, staff convenience and patient tolerance. The use of&#xD;
      indwelling urethral catheter is the usual practice after gynecologic and POP surgery. Despite&#xD;
      this routine practice, there seems to be little evidence supporting the use of indwelling&#xD;
      urethral catheter after gynecologic surgery. Generally, the indwelling urethral catheter is&#xD;
      used after surgery for monitoring output, or if the patient is not mobile. This may not be&#xD;
      the usual case after urogynecologic surgery. Some of the reasons for routine use of catheter&#xD;
      after urogynecologic surgery include allowing bladder emptying as voiding may be difficult&#xD;
      due to the effects of the surgery, such as pain or swelling of surrounding soft tissues. The&#xD;
      routine use of indwelling catheters after routine urogynecologic surgery carries the risk of&#xD;
      morbidity including detrusor overactivity, urinary tract infection or pain in urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of agreement among providers regarding the optimal time for removal of&#xD;
      urethral catheter after surgery. Usual practices are based on provider preference and the&#xD;
      already established institution practices rather than evidence based practice. Although&#xD;
      different institutions and providers have different practices and policies, there is no&#xD;
      evidence based practice regarding the effect of the time when catheter is removed or for the&#xD;
      length of time catheter is left in place prior to removal after surgery. Most places will&#xD;
      leave the catheter overnight after surgery. One possible reason for that may be that the&#xD;
      reduced staff at night may not respond to the complication of urinary retention, following&#xD;
      catheter removal. Another perceived reason for leaving the catheter in overnight is that&#xD;
      patients will rest through the night and then get back to their normal voiding the next day,&#xD;
      once the catheter is removed in the morning. Cochrane review by Griffiths and Fernandez had&#xD;
      suggested the need for randomized trials to address questions regarding catheter removal&#xD;
      among discrete subgroups and specialties. The usual practice of indwelling foley catheter&#xD;
      after urogynecologic surgery may be convenience to the providers, but there is limited&#xD;
      evidence in literature regarding what benefits patients gain from this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are hospital stay in hours after completion of surgery and need for&#xD;
      re-catheterization. Hospital stay will be counted from the time the patient leaves the&#xD;
      operating room to the time she leaves the hospital. To avoid confounding, investigators are&#xD;
      only including the first / morning case of the day. For re-catheterization, investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate if patient was able to void after completion of surgery. Investigators will&#xD;
      compare the post voiding residuals, the need for re-catheterizations and the numbers of&#xD;
      patients going home with an indwelling catheter between the two groups. Investigators will&#xD;
      also compare the number of urinary tract infections, as documented by urine culture and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment, between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain demographic information. On post operative day 1, investigators&#xD;
      will obtain patient satisfaction and pain scores. Pain score will be obtained with the use of&#xD;
      pictorial &quot;Wong Scale,&quot; assessing level of pain and location (i.e., bladder or urethra vs.&#xD;
      the surgical site). Furthermore, patients will be asked whether they will use the same&#xD;
      treatment again (yes or no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are to expect discharge the following day and counseled as such. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to immediate removal will undergo the following protocol: The indwelling catheter&#xD;
      will be removed prior to exiting the operating room. If the patient has an urge to void&#xD;
      immediately post operatively, the void will be recorded and post void residual determined by&#xD;
      bladder scan. If the post void residual is no more than 1/3 of the total volume, the patient&#xD;
      will be considered to have passed the voiding trial and have no further intervention. In&#xD;
      patients with more than 1/3 post void residual or inability to void four hours after&#xD;
      completion of surgery, bladder volume will be checked with a bladder scan. In subjects with&#xD;
      less than 300 mL of urine, they will be given an additional two hours to void. For patients&#xD;
      with &gt;300 mL of urine, they will undergo straight catheterization and re-enter the voiding&#xD;
      trial cycle. For patients who have not voided at six hours, straight catheterization will be&#xD;
      performed and they will re-enter the voiding trial cycle and given four hours to void. This&#xD;
      process will continue for three total cycles (1st cycle post operative, two cycles&#xD;
      thereafter), at which time they will be given an indwelling catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients assigned to catheter removal on post operative day one, investigators will&#xD;
      perform backfill voiding trial prior to catheter removal. Investigators are planning to&#xD;
      perform backfill voiding trial as it has not been shown to be inferior to waiting to void and&#xD;
      this will avoid confounding regarding the discharge time from hospital. Bladder will be&#xD;
      filled with 300 mL of sterile water and the indwelling catheter will then be removed. Patient&#xD;
      will be asked to void in a hat thereafter, if they are able to void at least 200 mL, they&#xD;
      would have completed a successful voiding trial. If they are unable to void, then&#xD;
      investigators will perform straight catheterization and allow them four hours to void.&#xD;
      Patients unable to pass the voiding trial after two attempts will go home with either an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter or performing self catheterization (depending on patient's comfort). For&#xD;
      the purpose of the study, patients going home with a catheter or self catheterization will be&#xD;
      in the same group of going home with a catheter. Investigators will compare the incidence of&#xD;
      urinary tract infections within four weeks after surgery, as documented by urine culture and&#xD;
      / or treatment.&#xD;
