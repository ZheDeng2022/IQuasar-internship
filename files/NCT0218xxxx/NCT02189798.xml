  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate whether low-frequency acoustic hearing&#xD;
      sensitivity can be preserved in newly implanted adults with partial deafness (considerable&#xD;
      low frequency acoustic hearing profiles with severe-to-profound high frequency sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss) using the HiResolution™ 90K™ Advantage cochlear implant with the HiFocus™&#xD;
      Mid-Scala electrode to support the development of electro-acoustic stimulation technology&#xD;
      (EAS).&#xD;
