      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Relay Model helping alcohol dependent patients&#xD;
      at a general hospital to start specialized alcohol treatment in order to assess i) efficacy,&#xD;
      ii) cost-effectiveness and iii) overall societal cost impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the Relay Model will be investigated in a single-blind pragmatic randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial in which the control group consists of patients referred to treatment by&#xD;
      usual procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An increase in individuals with alcohol dependence receiving specialized alcohol treatment&#xD;
      will be of major importance for society's response to alcohol problems and its consequences.&#xD;
      The Danish population has a large intake of alcohol. Approximately 20% of the adult&#xD;
      population are heavy drinkers ( &gt;14/21 drinks/ week (women/men)), 14% are harmful users, and&#xD;
      3% are dependent drinkers. Untreated alcohol use disorders lead to frequent contacts to the&#xD;
      health care system associated with considerable human and societal costs. A first approach&#xD;
      would be to identify and recruit patients from general hospitals, where the proportion of&#xD;
      inpatients with alcohol use disorders range between 16 % and 26%. A referral model to ensure&#xD;
      treatment for alcohol dependent patients after discharge is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to develop strategies which increase the likelihood that&#xD;
      patients report for outpatient alcohol treatment after discharge. It is likely that an&#xD;
      optimization of the transfer procedure between hospital and outpatient clinic will lead to&#xD;
      that more patients will be engage in psychosocial treatment for their alcohol abuse, which&#xD;
      will improve the prognosis, reduce re-admissions and the use of hospital beds and, thus have&#xD;
      positive economic consequences. We evaluate the Relay Model in order to assess i) efficacy,&#xD;
      ii) cost-effectiveness and iii) overall societal cost impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target group of the present study is patients suffering from alcohol dependence admitted&#xD;
      to a general hospital located in an urban area and a general hospital located in a rural&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blind pragmatic randomised controlled trial including patients admitted to Hospital.&#xD;
      The study group(n=500) receive an Intervention and the control group(n=500) are referred to&#xD;
      treatment by usual procedures. All patients complete a lifestyle questionnaire with the&#xD;
      Danish self-report version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) embedded&#xD;
      as a case identification strategy. The patients are informed that an alcohol therapist may&#xD;
      contact them and give feedback on their responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completed forms are reviewed daily and an AUDIT score of 8+prompts a call to the Alcohol&#xD;
      therapist, who attends the departments on different days randomly drawn by a computer. The&#xD;
      RELAY MODEL intervention include a Brief Motivational Intervention. Patients who score AUDIT&#xD;
      16+ are also offered an appointment at the alcohol treatment clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measure is health care expenditures 12 months after discharge, according to the&#xD;
      International Classification of Health Accounts, extracted from population registers. The&#xD;
      analysis will be repeated on a yearly basis during the following 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: The percentage of the target group, who, 30 days after discharge, reports&#xD;
      at the alcohol treatment clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple regression model will be used. Since non-treated alcohol disorders generate a high&#xD;
      number of societal costs annually for health care, social services, traffic accidents,&#xD;
      criminal activities and lost productions we believe the Relay Model to be either cost-neutral&#xD;
      or cost-effective, i.e. low net costs compared to effectiveness. We expect to establish&#xD;
      evidence that the Relay Model is either cost-neutral or cost-effective, compared to referral&#xD;
      by usual procedures.&#xD;
