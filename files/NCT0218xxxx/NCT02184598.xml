      Purpose: This project assess the effectiveness of a cognitive training as an add-on&#xD;
      intervention to drug treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) compared to a placebo training. The cognitive&#xD;
      training consists of 6 computerized games that are based on principles of neuroplastic&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD: current treatment - International clinical guidelines indicate that pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions in particular stimulants are the first-line treatment for ADHD. However, about&#xD;
      30% of children affected by the disorder do not respond to medication alone, exhibit partial&#xD;
      response or can not tolerate the adverse effects. In addition there is a group of parents who&#xD;
      do not accept the use of medication for the treatment of ADHD in their children. In recent&#xD;
      years cognitive training has received considerable attention as a treatment to ADHD. The&#xD;
      evidence base for cognitive training programs are still forming with few randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled studies. However, this approach seems to be effective either as a&#xD;
      treatment for ADHD - and others cognitive disorders in childhood - or as a tool to enhance&#xD;
      cognitive ability and school performance in children and adults. No previous study has&#xD;
      evaluated this cognitive intervention in a clinical trial with placebo-controlled&#xD;
      intervention and as an adjunctive treatment to medication. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess brain changes associated with this intervention using neuroimaging (fMRI).&#xD;

      Material and Methods Trial design Randomized clinical trial with placebo control. This study&#xD;
      will compare the cognitive training program versus the placebo condition to assess the&#xD;
      reduction on residual symptoms, the improvement in the neurocognitive function and brain&#xD;
      activation changes in children and adolescents with ADHD receiving stimulants. Sixty&#xD;
      subjects, six to thirteen years-old with ADHD confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective&#xD;
      Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks of cognitive or&#xD;
      placebo training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants To be included in the study children and adolescent need to meet the following&#xD;
      criteria (a) age between 6-13 years, (b) a diagnosis of ADHD classified according to the&#xD;
      criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition), (c)&#xD;
      medicated and stabilized with psychostimulants but partially restored - inattention SNAP&#xD;
      score (mean scores of parents and teachers &gt; or = 1), (d) a full scale intelligence quotient&#xD;
      (IQ) of at least 80, (e) access to a computer with windows vista 7 and speakers, and access&#xD;
      to internet. Participants will be excluded in case (a) another comorbid psychiatry diagnosis&#xD;
      clinically significant and requiring treatment at the time of enter in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation There was no previous study that used the design proposed in this&#xD;
      investigation. Considering a reduction 20% higher of the SNAP-IV scores in the active group&#xD;
      intervention (stimulants + cognitive training), sample size in both groups of 27 participants&#xD;
      and standard-deviation in the magnitude of half of the medium score in each group (moderate&#xD;
      variability), the study will be able to detect a moderate effect size (ES = 0,4). Calculating&#xD;
      a sample loss of 10% each group, we define a sample size per group of 30 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive intervention protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portuguese version of the new Cognitive Computerized Training was created with the&#xD;
      partnership of Yale University research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive training program is composed by computerized exercises with six different games&#xD;
      divided in multiples levels and sublevels with increasing difficulty. During the games,&#xD;
      several neuropsychological domains are required from the participant such working memory,&#xD;
      sustained attention, response inhibition and others. In each session the participant will&#xD;
      play 6 games divided in 5 minutes blocks. The aim of these games is to engage and activate&#xD;
      targeted neurocognitive systems This protocol will be run in schools. It will be consisted of&#xD;
      4 times/week sessions (3 times at school and 1 time at home) for 12 weeks with 30 min of&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo cognitive training (control group) will contain the same exposure time of the&#xD;
      active group but without any element regarding to the cognitive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological protocol All subjects must be receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD&#xD;
      with a stable dose of stimulants for at least 1 month in doses not inferior of 0.3mg/kg/per&#xD;
      day of methylphenidate or 30mg/per day of lisdexamphetamine. Any increase in doses during the&#xD;
      protocol will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological protocol An assessment before the beginning of the intervention and&#xD;
      pos-treatment will be done by a trained neuropsychologist using three tests of a NIH toolbox&#xD;
      (C8Kids platform): Flanker Test, Go/NoGo Test and List Sorting Test of Working Memory and a&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery created by our team using six tests: CPT II (Conner´s Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Test II), Digit Span, Spatial Span, Reaction Time Task, Trail Making Test and&#xD;
      Picture Concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging protocol A subgroup of 10 participants from each group will be drawn to a&#xD;
      functional resonance exam (MRIf) before and immediately after the cognitive or placebo&#xD;
      training. During the exam they will do a neuropsychological tests ( Go/NoGo; N-Back - working&#xD;
      memory - and SAT - sustained attention test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Statistical analyses will be performed with Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) 12.0. The univariate analyses will be performed with the t student&#xD;
      test / Mann-Whitney to continuous variables or Chi-Square test (X²) / Fischer test to&#xD;
      categorical variables. The variables that present relationship with the outcomes will be&#xD;
      maintained in multivariate models. The effective of the intervention over time will be assess&#xD;
      through analyses of mixed models.&#xD;
