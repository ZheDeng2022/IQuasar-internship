  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative Anxiety is a major problem in anesthesia management. Paediatric patients are a&#xD;
      special group who need special attention. Some studies have shown that cartoons are a very&#xD;
      good tool for distraction in the preoperative period for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that children watching Cartoons in the preoperative period will have less&#xD;
      anxiety and will be fit with preparation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After local ethics committee approval 60 patients scheduled for various types of surgery will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the operation day patients are going to be evaluated in the preoperative preparation room.&#xD;
      For anxiety evaluation the modified yale preoperative anxiety scale will be used. After this&#xD;
      first evaluation patients are going to be separated randomly into two groups; group R&#xD;
      (routine) and group C (cartoon). All patients are going to be premedicated with midazolam.&#xD;
      The first group will receive their premedication straight after the first evaluation and&#xD;
      their response will be recorded as easy, moderate, difficult, does not accept. Group C will&#xD;
      choose a cartoon movie (5 different movies are recorded and will be shown through a tablet&#xD;
      PC)) and will begin to watch it. After 5 minutes they will receive their premedication and&#xD;
      their response will also be recorded. After 30 minutes a physician will try to insert an IV&#xD;
      line and the response of the child will also be evaluated and recorded as easy, moderate,&#xD;
      difficult and does not allow. Afterwards the patient will be transported into the operation&#xD;
      room. In the operation room anesthesia will be induced via Sevoflurane and the response to&#xD;
      mask anesthesia will be evaluated with the mask score as it is described before in previous&#xD;
      studies. Patients in Group C will continue to watch the cartoon movie until the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. And the modified yale score will also be reevaluated and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family anxiety will be evaluated with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family and the child will also be interviewed separately, 4 prepared standard questions&#xD;
      will be asked in order to understand how the family described the operation.&#xD;
