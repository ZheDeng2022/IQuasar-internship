      The goal of this study is to evaluate a group-based motivational interviewing (MI)-delivered&#xD;
      risk reduction program for homeless young adults. It is hypothesized that youth who&#xD;
      participate in the program will show greater reductions in substance use intentions, behavior&#xD;
      and consequences, as well as sexual activity intentions and risk behavior, over a 3-month&#xD;
      period compared to a usual care control sample of youth who do not participate in the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for homeless youth by conducting&#xD;
      a pilot test of an innovative 4-session integrated substance use and sexual risk reduction&#xD;
      program for this population that is feasible to deliver in settings where these youth seek&#xD;
      services. The study has 2 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Investigate whether homeless youth who participate in the program show reductions in&#xD;
      substance use and intentions, behavior and consequences, as well as sexual activity&#xD;
      intentions and risk behavior, over a 3-month period compared to a usual care control sample&#xD;
      of youth who do not receive the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Gain a better understanding of intervention effects by exploring whether improvements&#xD;
      in self-efficacy, readiness to change, outcome expectancies, and exposure to peer substance&#xD;
      use and offers serve as explanatory mechanisms for reductions in substance use- and sexual&#xD;
      activity- related intentions and risk behaviors among youth who participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will be evaluated using a form of group-randomized design, although with&#xD;
      crossover of conditions and groups to avoid the problems of power reduction associated with&#xD;
      conventional group randomization. The unit of analysis will be the individual, but&#xD;
      individuals will be assigned to groups based on the agency where they are seeking services.&#xD;
      Youth at two drop-in centers serving homeless youth will either be in the intervention&#xD;
      condition or a &quot;usual care&quot; control condition. The field period will be divided into four&#xD;
      phases. The two agencies will alternate across phases in serving as the &quot;intervention site&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;control site,&quot; with each agency having a total of two intervention phases and two control&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Condition: This condition involves a four-session voluntary intervention that is&#xD;
      delivered within a drop-in center setting and is based on the investigator's previous&#xD;
      intervention work with adolescents and young adults. Each session lasts approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
      The intervention focuses on both sexual risk behavior and substance use. Although some&#xD;
      sessions focus more heavily on sexual risk and others on substance use, each session includes&#xD;
      content that emphasizes the interrelated nature of these two risk behaviors. In all sessions,&#xD;
      participants will receive a personalized feedback sheet that specifically addresses a topic&#xD;
      being discussed during that particular session. An motivational interviewing approach will be&#xD;
      used to present material during the group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Usual Care&quot; Condition: The &quot;usual care&quot; condition reflects the resources typically available&#xD;
      in settings that serve homeless youth: an HIV informational brochure that discusses the&#xD;
      connection between substance use and HIV risk, and a Community Resource Guide that lists free&#xD;
      or low-cost substance use and HIV-related services.&#xD;
