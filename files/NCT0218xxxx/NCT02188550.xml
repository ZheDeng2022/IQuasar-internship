      The purpose of the study is to determine if the combination of Everolimus and Letrozole is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of women with either recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, primary peritoneal or endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments have shown that everolimus (Afinitor®) can prevent cells such as cancer from&#xD;
      growing in number. Therefore, everolimus (Afinitor®) is being tested in specific diseases to&#xD;
      stop cells from growing too fast (as in cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus (Afinitor®) has been FDA approved for adults with advanced kidney cancer (Renal&#xD;
      Cell Carcinoma). Everolimus (Afinitor®) received approval for patients with subependymal&#xD;
      giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), a brain tumor seen with genetic conditions called tuberous&#xD;
      sclerosis complex (TSC) who require therapy, but are not candidates for surgery. Everolimus&#xD;
      (Afinitor®) was approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. Everolimus (Afinitor®) received&#xD;
      approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive,&#xD;
      HER2- negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure&#xD;
      of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole. Everolimus (Afinitor®) also received approval for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with TSC who have renal angiomyolipoma not requiring immediate&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus (Afinitor®) has been used to treat patients in clinical studies since 2002 and&#xD;
      approximately 25,645 patients (as of 30-Sep-2012) have been treated with everolimus&#xD;
      (Afinitor®).&#xD;

      This is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label study with a combination of everolimus and&#xD;
      letrozole once a day dosing . Each cycle would be 28days and patients would be scanned after&#xD;
      every 3 cycles for response, until disease progression is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take two pills once a day by mouth with a glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study…&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if they can&#xD;
      be in the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be&#xD;
      done even if subjects do not join the study. If subjects have had some of them recently, they&#xD;
      may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history risk and physical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood counts, blood mineral levels, and check liver and kidney&#xD;
           function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to measure detectable tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pregnancy blood test if subjects are capable of becoming pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis (examination of urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The European Organization for research and treatment of cancer global quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) -This standard questionnaire helps us to measure quality of&#xD;
           life. This questionnaire will take subjects 15 minutes to complete and will be completed&#xD;
           at entry into the study and at week 12 and 24 during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be done for hepatitis B and/or C if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects have a risk of having hepatitis B and/or C or if subjects live or have lived in&#xD;
           specific geographical areas, such as Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Eastern&#xD;
           Europe and Spain, Portugal or Greece;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study doctor thinks it is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that have positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C results at screening may be required&#xD;
      to take medication for up to 2 weeks before they start everolimus (Afinitor®) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Study…&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the exams, tests and procedures show that subjects can be in the study, and they choose to&#xD;
      take part, then they will need the following tests and procedures. They are part of regular&#xD;
      cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly blood tests to measure blood counts, blood mineral levels, blood clotting and&#xD;
           check liver and kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of side effects subjects may experience from the study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to having hepatitis B and/or C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis every 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The European Organization for research and treatment of cancer global quality of life&#xD;
