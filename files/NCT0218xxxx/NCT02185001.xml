  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The forces involved in a patella dislocation event can cause significant&#xD;
      collateral damage involving the articular cartilage of the patella femoral joint. As a&#xD;
      result, prevention of recurrent patella dislocation and the associated disability and&#xD;
      morbidity has generated significant interest in the orthopedic community. Historically,&#xD;
      nonoperative treatment for first time patella dislocation has been problematic due to high&#xD;
      redislocation rates. Nonoperative protocols generally involve bracing and/or immobilization,&#xD;
      followed by physical therapy (1). Surgical approaches to recurrent patella dislocation, both&#xD;
      soft tissue and boney realignment operations, have also had mixed results, including low&#xD;
      success rates, associated complications, and variable rates of return to functional activity&#xD;
      (2,3,4). This study is intended to compare the outcomes of a relatively low-risk Medial&#xD;
      Patellofemoral Ligament (MPFL) direct repair procedure to conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This study is designed as a two arm randomized prospective trial.&#xD;
      Approximately fifty subjects will be randomly assigned to either a surgical or non-operative&#xD;
      arm by means of a computer randomized allocation program. All subjects will have X-Ray Images&#xD;
      and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine the site of the MPFL damage, and to&#xD;
      determine if any excluding conditions exist. Subjects randomized to the surgical group will&#xD;
      have repair of the MPFL. Routine aftercare will consist of physical therapy in a clinic that&#xD;
      has agreed to follow our protocol. Subjects randomized to the nonoperative group will receive&#xD;
      2 weeks of patellar immobilization, followed by patellar stabilization bracing with physical&#xD;
      therapy for approximately 12 weeks. Physical therapy will progress through five phases with&#xD;
      the goal of gait normalization, full range of motion and return to sport. Both arms will be&#xD;
      given outcome questionnaires and physical activity assessments before treatment, and at one,&#xD;
      three, six, twelve, and twenty four month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This prospective randomized trial will investigate the results of direct repair&#xD;
      of the medial patellofemoral ligament and conservative treatment by applying subjective&#xD;
      outcome measures (Kujala scores), and exam findings to determine MPFL functional restoration&#xD;
      or redislocation. Subjects will be examined in the clinic setting at 10 days, one month, and&#xD;
      six months post trauma. Any reported recurrent dislocation or subluxation event will be&#xD;
      documented during recovery. All subjects will receive merchant x-ray views at 3 months with&#xD;
      manual lateral translation of the patella.&#xD;

      Background Historic treatment for first time patella dislocation has been largely&#xD;
      conservative. Treatment options include nonoperative treatment and a large variety of&#xD;
      operative options. Nonoperative treatment, usually consists of bracing and/or immobilization&#xD;
      followed by physical therapy, has been problematic due to a relatively high reported&#xD;
      redislocation rate(1). The forces involved in a patella dislocation event can damage the&#xD;
      articular cartilage of the patella femoral joint. As a result, prevention of recurrent&#xD;
      patella dislocation and the associated disability and morbidity has generated significant&#xD;
      interest in the orthopedic community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historic surgical approaches to recurrent patella dislocation have had mixed results. The&#xD;
      isolated &quot;lateral release&quot;, has been shown to have a very low success rate(2), while&#xD;
      associated complications have been appreciated. Lateral release procedures are now more often&#xD;
      performed in conjunction with other proximal or distal realignment procedures(3). More&#xD;
      aggressive bone realignment procedures such as tibial tubercle transfers have the&#xD;
      disadvantage of reported poor long term functional recoveries and low &quot;return to sport&quot;&#xD;
      rates(4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been increasing interest in ligament reconstruction for patella dislocation. The&#xD;
      ligament of interest is the medial patella-femoral ligament (MPFL), which is essentially a&#xD;
      thickened band of the medial capsule of the knee. The MPFL has been established as the&#xD;
      primary constraint to patella dislocation. This ligament extends from a point just anterior&#xD;
      to the attachment of the medial collateral ligament to the medial aspect of the patella, and&#xD;
      is routinely disrupted with a patella dislocation event. The goals of reconstruction&#xD;
      procedures are to replace and/or augment this band of tissue. While many reports of the&#xD;
      results of MPFL reconstruction have been good to excellent, there are significant associated&#xD;
      risks of complication, prolonged recovery, and associated graft costs or autograft harvest&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach to MPFL functional restoration, and the subject of this study&#xD;
      proposal, is a direct repair of the MPFL. Variations of this approach have been previously&#xD;
      studied. A basic understanding of established injury patterns to the MPFL is requisite to&#xD;
      evaluating the limitations to these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating MPFL injury by MRI have shown that acute patella dislocations have a very&#xD;
      high incidence of associated MPFL injury. The location of the lesion in the ligament can be&#xD;
      described in one of four ways: 1) at the patellar attachment, 2) at the femoral attachment,&#xD;
      3) intrasubstance portion of the ligament, or 4) a combined injury pattern. Several studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated varying percent distributions of injury(6,7), but it is clear that all&#xD;
      patterns exist. This conclusion is consistent with the author's experience is treating these&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detecting the injury location can also be a challenge. Arthroscopic examination has been&#xD;
      shown to be ineffective at determining the location of injury(8) and, in the experience of&#xD;
      the author, MRI evaluation is frequently inaccurate, especially in the chronic or recurrent&#xD;
      patella dislocation setting. The author proposes a functional intraoperative test to&#xD;
      determine the ligament injury location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some prior reports have included surgical treatment of MPFL injuries using one technique&#xD;
      only, with results similar to nonoperative treatment. For instance, some studies have&#xD;
      evaluated treating all patella dislocations with repair at the patellar insertion, a&#xD;
      treatment which may have limited or no benefit for patients with injuries at the femoral&#xD;
      attachment of the ligament. There are two limited reports evaluating somewhat similar&#xD;
      techniques, and these reports indicate some of the best results in the literature in the&#xD;
      management of patella-femoral instability (9,10). These results are consistent with the&#xD;
      author's experience with the treatment of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject of this study is to determine the difference in nonoperative and surgical patient&#xD;
      outcomes using contemporary surgical techniques; identifying the location of the injury and&#xD;
      choosing either direct repair or appropriate advancement. We hypothesize that minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgical repair of the MPFL will improve patient outcomes and minimize recurrent&#xD;
      patellar dislocation, when compared to conservative treatment. Our null hypothesis is that&#xD;
      there will be no difference in outcomes between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design Trial Design - The study design will be a prospective parallel-group,&#xD;
      randomized trial with allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - At least 50 subjects will be recruited by referral from primary care&#xD;
      providers, specialists, urgent care and emergency departments, and physical therapy clinics&#xD;
      within a 50 mile radius of the clinic. Men, women, and minors, aged 10-17 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first patellofemoral traumatic dislocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A need for reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An absence of fractures on x-ray exam of the frontal and lateral knee and axial patella&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An absence of knee ligament lesions with surgical indications (with the exception of the&#xD;
           MPFL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous knee surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prior episode of patellofemoral dislocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fractures on x-ray exam of the frontal and lateral knee and axial patella Prior surgery&#xD;
           on the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance greater than 20mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current pregnancy or plan to become pregnant during the study period. Recruitment - The&#xD;
           recruitment process will consist of two phases. Phase one will consist of a short&#xD;
           screening questionnaire, and phase two will consist of a clinical examination and&#xD;
           questionnaire. Recruitment will remain open until at least fifty subjects that meet the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization - After screening and accepting subjects in the recruiting process, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either an operative group or non-operative group by means of&#xD;
      computer randomized sequencing and blind allocation. Random sequence generation will be done&#xD;
      by using Random Allocation Software 1.0.0., and allocation will be concealed by placing&#xD;
      allocations in sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. Randomization, allocation, and&#xD;
      concealment will be accomplished by an administrative assistant with no interest in the study&#xD;
      or its outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - All subjects will be briefed on their respective treatment protocols. The&#xD;
      operative group will be advised on the risks of this surgery, including the chance of&#xD;
      recurrent dislocations, as well as the more general risks of infection, DVT/PE, anesthesia&#xD;
      complications, and associated possible complications (Table 1.1). The non-operative group&#xD;
      will be advised of the possible failure of treatment, possibility of recurrent dislocation,&#xD;
      and the possible need for surgery (Table 1.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive long standing and sunrise x-rays for diagnostic purposes. An MRI&#xD;
      will be obtained for identifying the site of the lesion for both groups. Additionally, we&#xD;
      will ask the subjects to complete a Kujala Scoring questionnaire and physical activity&#xD;
      assessment as a baseline measurement, with the intention of evaluating and subjectively&#xD;
      comparing the two types of treatment. Treatment for the surgical group will be performed at&#xD;
      an outpatient surgical facility, and the non-operative group will receive treatment at a&#xD;
      physical therapy clinic of their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Treatment Group - Subjects who are randomized to the surgical group treatment will&#xD;
      undergo surgical repair of their medial patellofemoral ligament. This will be identified&#xD;
      using an MRI scan for the site of the lesion. If this cannot be identified, the following&#xD;
      process will be used to determine the site of the lesion: On physical examination, the point&#xD;
      of maximal tenderness between the patella and the femur will be identified and that will be&#xD;
      the assumed site of traumatic injury to the medial patellofemoral ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed initially with a diagnostic arthroscopy to evaluate for loose&#xD;
      bodies or chondral damage anywhere in the patellofemoral joint. A video will be taken of this&#xD;
      and provided to the patient postoperatively. If there are no loose bodies or chondral damage&#xD;
      to be treated, the medial patellofemoral ligament will then be repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incision will be made approximately 2 cm in length over the assumed site of the injury.&#xD;
      The medial patellofemoral ligament will be identified and a tag suture will be applied to it.&#xD;
      Traction on the medial patellofemoral ligament at this location will confirm that this is the&#xD;
      site of primary injury by determining whether there is a firm endpoint with traction. If&#xD;
      there is not a firm endpoint, a secondary incision over the alternate location, either the&#xD;
      patella or the femur, will be made and the medial patellofemoral ligament will be identified&#xD;
      in that location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repairs of the medial patellofemoral ligament will be made at all sites opened surgically&#xD;
      whether it be either the femur or the patella, or both. Surgical repair will consist of&#xD;
      providing decortication of the bone at the anatomic location of the medial patellofemoral&#xD;
      ligament. Placement of a single 5 mm metal suture anchor with FiberWire-type sutures and a&#xD;
      repair of the medial patellofemoral ligament using the FiberWire sutures to dock the ligament&#xD;
      into its anatomic location. The repairs will be then be oversewn with #1 Vicryl suture at the&#xD;
      site of the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, the local anesthetic will be applied to the incisions. They will be copiously&#xD;
      irrigated and repaired with absorbable sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be placed in a hinged knee brace postoperatively with a range of motion&#xD;
      restriction of 0-45 degrees. Weight bearing will be allowed immediately following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will start physical therapy the week of surgery and will begin with quadriceps&#xD;
      strengthening with a restriction of range of motion from 0-45 for the first four weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively followed by unrestricted full range of motion after week six. Full sport&#xD;
      activities will be allowed to be resumed after eight weeks, provided the patient have at&#xD;
      least 85% of the strength in their quadriceps compared to the contralateral side. Actual&#xD;
      progression will be individualized based upon the patient's weekly reassessment and the&#xD;
      presence of any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-ups will be made at the below-mentioned intervals with appropriate&#xD;
      Kujala scoring and physical activity assessment (Table 2). X-rays will be taken on the first&#xD;
      postoperative visit to confirm location of suture anchor repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appointments for physical examinations will be made at 7-10 days, 1 month, and three months&#xD;
      after surgery. Any reported recurrent dislocation or subluxation event will be documented&#xD;
      during recovery. All subjects will receive sunrise x-ray views at 3 months with manual&#xD;
      lateral translation of the patella, as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative Treatment Group - The conservative treatment protocol is based on accepted&#xD;
      physical therapy models of care and is established relative to patient tolerance for tissue&#xD;
      healing, recovery, and response to modalities and procedures. Actual progression will be&#xD;
      individualized based upon the patient's weekly reassessment and the presence of any&#xD;
      complications. Prevention and minimization of recurrent dislocation, painful subluxation and&#xD;
      osteoarthrosis are paramount in early management scenarios. The post traumatic and post&#xD;
      surgical sequelae of pain, inflammation, swelling, bruising and muscular deactivation will be&#xD;
      managed with acceptable standards of practice and prescribed medications. Prevention and&#xD;
      dissipation of these sequelae, including modifying activities that put excessive stress or&#xD;
      loading on the patellofemoral joint are the initial goals of rehabilitation in concert with&#xD;
      gradual progression of mobility and muscular reactivation techniques. The protocol is divided&#xD;
      into five phases: Phase I and II, 0-4 weeks; Phase III, 5-8 weeks; Phase IV- 9-12 weeks,&#xD;
      Phase V- 13+ weeks (Table 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to physical therapy appointments, subjects in the conservative treatment group&#xD;
      will be given physical examination appointments and Kujala outcome scoring questionnaires and&#xD;
      physical activity assessments at the same intervals as the surgical intervention group (Table&#xD;
      2). All subjects will receive sunrise x-ray views at 3 months with manual lateral translation&#xD;
      of the patella, as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding-Due to the nature of the study, blinding of subjects after assignment to treatment&#xD;
      groups is not feasible. All records and data will be collected and securely stored in the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Coordinator's office. The data will be blinded before final statistical&#xD;
      analysis by an independent statistician.&#xD;
