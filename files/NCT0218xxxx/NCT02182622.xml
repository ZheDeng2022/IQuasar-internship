    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to first determine the highest dose of LDE225 combined wtih&#xD;
      Docetaxel and Prednisone that can be given that does not cause unacceptable side effects when&#xD;
      given to patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer who failed previous docetaxel&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with&#xD;
             LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             treatment with LDE225&#xD;

             past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history&#xD;
             of prolonged QT-interval syndrome Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g.&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension,&#xD;
             or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)&#xD;

          -  Prior to study entry any ECG abnormality has to be documented by the investigator as&#xD;
             not medically relevant&#xD;
