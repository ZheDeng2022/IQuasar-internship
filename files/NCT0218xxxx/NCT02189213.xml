    <textblock>
      1 out of 8 children, adolescents, and young adults suffer from an anxiety disorder. Studies&#xD;
      over the past decade show that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of&#xD;
      medication that treats anxiety in adults, also works well in young adults, children, and&#xD;
      adolescents with anxiety disorders, but only for about 50%. 50% will have undergone treatment&#xD;
      for several months before it will be established that the medication is not working to treat&#xD;
      the anxiety. The purpose of this study is to find a test that will predict treatment outcome&#xD;
      from the beginning based on behavioral and biological measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence based psychiatric treatment for child, adolescent, and young adult anxiety&#xD;
      disorders involves a trial and error process. Pediatric psychiatrists start with the first&#xD;
      line treatments (i.e. SSRI or psychotherapy), which requires from 4-8 weeks to work. There is&#xD;
      a long interval between treatment initiation and response with only 50 to 60% likelihood that&#xD;
      the treatment chosen will succeed in reducing anxiety symptoms. The science that will enable&#xD;
      us to predict who will respond to medication treatment does not exist. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a correlation between cellular markers in white blood cells and psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders suggesting that certain genes may also change their expression in peripheral cells&#xD;
      in response to treatment of psychiatric disorders. Several studies report a significant&#xD;
      decrease in expression of key genes that are involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression in the brain, such as BDNF, CREB and HDAC5 levels in leukocytes of people with&#xD;
      mood and anxiety disorders. The levels of BDNF, HDAC5 and CREB in white blood cells then&#xD;
      respond to treatment and match that of controls after treatment with SSRIs. The increased&#xD;
      accessibility to sequencing technology allows us to survey many more potential biomarkers&#xD;
      than what was possible just several years ago. This may enable us to formulate a test that&#xD;
      will predict, based on biocellular markers, treatment outcome in anxiety disorders for&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and young adults before the onset of treatment. By finding molecular&#xD;
      markers that can predict treatment success from the onset, the investigators can improve&#xD;
      treatment outcomes considerably compared to current standard treatment practices. This kind&#xD;
      of personalized medicine is the future of psychiatry.&#xD;

    <description>The CGI-I score at the final visit will determine treatment response.&#xD;
The CGI-Improvement scale comprises a one-item measures evaluating the following change from the initiation of treatment on a seven-point scale.&#xD;
The following one query is rated on a seven-point scale: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this patient's condition is: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.&#xD;
CGI-I scale of 1-2 is considered response to treatment. Anything below that is considered non-response to sertraline treatment.</description>
