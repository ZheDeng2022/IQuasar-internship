    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)can be curative with small localized HCCs up to 5 cm in&#xD;
      diameter. However, the long-term prognosis is not satisfactory due to the high incidence of&#xD;
      recurrence.Multimodality treatments are needed to prevent recurrencesï¼Œbut only useful with&#xD;
      locoregional disease. Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor and the only systemic drug&#xD;
      associated with improved overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC. Retrospective&#xD;
      and randomized studies have suggested that the combined use of Sorafenib may be useful in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable HCC. Based on these information and the multiple actions of&#xD;
      Sorafenib, we hypothesized that Sorafenib plus RFA may be useful in patients with early to&#xD;
      Mid term HCC. In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a combination&#xD;
      Sorafenib and RFA therapy in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage 0 -B1&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used as a minimally invasive option to eradicate&#xD;
      tumors and preserve liver function in patients with impaired function or with a postoperative&#xD;
      tumor recurrence. RFA can be curative with small localized HCCs up to 5 cm in diameter.&#xD;
      However, the long-term prognosis for HCC patients treated with RFA is not satisfactory due to&#xD;
      the high incidence of recurrence including local tumor recurrence and multicentric&#xD;
      carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodality treatments are needed to prevent recurrences. Although there is a potential&#xD;
      benefit with this strategy, it is only useful with locoregional disease. Sorafenib is an oral&#xD;
      multi-kinase inhibitor and the only systemic drug associated with improved overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective and randomized studies have suggested that the combined use of Sorafenib, TACE,&#xD;
      and RFA may be useful in patients with unresectable HCC. Based on these information and the&#xD;
      multiple actions of Sorafenib, we hypothesized that Sorafenib plus RFA may be useful in&#xD;
      patients with early HCC or recurrent HCC. Although no supportive data from clinical trials is&#xD;
      available, this hypothesis is supported by recent animal studies. Inadequate RFA has been&#xD;
      shown to promote rapid progression of residual tumors. Adjuvant Sorafenib postponed time to&#xD;
      recurrence by inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-1and vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      A (VEGFA). In a multifocal tumor model of HCC, RFA and Sorafenib alone resulted in a&#xD;
      significant volume reduction of non-RFA-targeted tumors, but this effect was enhanced when&#xD;
      both modalities were combined. This phenomenon was also demonstrated by more recent study on&#xD;
      human subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the advantages, Sorafenib initially promoted necrosis, delayed tissue repair after&#xD;
      RFA and adversely affected normal liver parenchyma, which could result in increased RFA&#xD;
      toxicity and limit its use in patients with HCC who have undergone RFA. Thus, the overall&#xD;
      advantages of RFA plus Sorafenib need to be weighed against its adverse effects. In this&#xD;
      investigation, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a combination Sorafenib and RFA&#xD;
      therapy in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage 0 -B1 HCC in a&#xD;
      multicenter prospective cohort study.&#xD;
