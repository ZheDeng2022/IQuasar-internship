    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of exposure to ergonomic circadian&#xD;
      light on physiological and mental parameters in stroke patients admitted for rehabilitation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke annually affects approximately 12,000 Danes and there are approximately 50,000 living&#xD;
      persons with sequelae after stroke in Denmark. Stroke is the major cause of acquired cerebral&#xD;
      disability among adults and the second most common cause of dementia and the third leading&#xD;
      cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the acute stroke treatment, an effective rehabilitation program is necessary for&#xD;
      optimal recovery. A prerequisite for this is that stroke patients are able to contribute&#xD;
      optimally to the training, however, changes in the sleep pattern and disturbed circadian&#xD;
      rhythm may exert negative effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about circadian disturbances in relation to rehabilitations and which&#xD;
      consequences it may have on the physiological and mental levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Ergonomic circadian light improves well-being and fatigue in post-stroke patients compared&#xD;
      with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Ergonomic circadian light induces improve sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm in&#xD;
      post-stroke patients compared with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: Ergonomic circadian light induces reduction in depression and anxiety in post-stroke&#xD;
      patients compared with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: Ergonomic circadian light improves the cognitive function in post-stroke patients compared&#xD;
      with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E: Ergonomic circadian light induces reduction in autonomic dysfunction in post-stroke&#xD;
      patients compared with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F: Ergonomic circadian light will regulate circadian rhythm specific blood tests in&#xD;
      post-stroke patients compared with a control group receiving standard light facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the acute stroke unit the patients will be random transferred to two rehabilitation&#xD;
      units where the will be the intervention unit with the circadian light installed and a&#xD;
      control unit with conventional light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inclusion, patients will be assessed by the following interventions mentioned below,&#xD;
      which again will be evaluated at discharge. The incompetent patients to these interventions&#xD;
      must abstain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numbers of patients who are expected to be included are 110 calculated with 25% dropout&#xD;
      resulting in approximately 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are found suitable for admission to the two rehabilitation departments will&#xD;
      be listed. If a patient is not suitable for inclusion in the study the reason will be&#xD;
      described and published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization on the rehabilitation unit following tests/interventions will be&#xD;
      performed on the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep physiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep biochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test for depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test for cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test for anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing for sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test for Quality of well being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronotype classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status of physical rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional MRI Resting state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circadian blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthalmological examination&#xD;
