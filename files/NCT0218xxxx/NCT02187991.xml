  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, alisertib, in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel), can shrink or slow tumor growth in women with&#xD;
      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative or HR-negative, HER2-negative (triple negative)&#xD;
      locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of alisertib in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient, symptoms, changes in the&#xD;
      size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research&#xD;
      team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the&#xD;
      activity of Aurora A kinase, a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and&#xD;
      survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer,&#xD;
      including breast cancer, and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this&#xD;
      protein can lead to the death of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer,&#xD;
      including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in&#xD;
      cancer therapy, combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of&#xD;
      the same drugs used alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind assessing the effectiveness of the addition of alisertib to weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel therapy in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer and highly proliferative&#xD;
      ER+ and HER2- breast cancer is based on the unmet clinical need for effective strategies to&#xD;
      prevent or delay resistance to taxane therapy in the metastatic setting. Synergistic or&#xD;
      additive effects have been observed in breast cancer xenograft models which involved&#xD;
      alisertib added to either paclitaxel or docetaxel. Alisertib inhibited the Pgp-mediated&#xD;
      efflux of paclitaxel in a cell culture model. In addition, Aurora Kinase A is frequently&#xD;
      overexpressed in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and expression levels have been shown&#xD;
      to be prognostic in both of these breast cancer subtypes. The combination of alisertib with&#xD;
      paclitaxel has also been investigated in a Phase 1 study in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic ovarian and breast cancers, with preliminary evidence of activity in both tumor&#xD;
      types including 6 PRs (partial response) and 3 SD (stable disease) in 11 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
