  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is widely performed using a surface landmark based 'blind' technique.&#xD;
      Multiple passes and attempts while administering spinal anesthesia are associated with a&#xD;
      greater incidence of post dural-puncture headache, paraesthesia and spinal hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time and pre-procedural neuraxial ultrasound techniques have been used to improve the&#xD;
      success rate of spinal anesthesia. The use of real time ultrasound-guided spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      has to date been limited to case series and case reports.Its use may be limited by the&#xD;
      requirement for wide bore needles and the technical difficulties associated with simultaneous&#xD;
      ultrasound scanning and needle advancement. The use of pre-procedural ultrasound has been&#xD;
      shown to increase the first pass success rate for spinal anesthesia only in patients with&#xD;
      difficult surface anatomic landmarks. No technique has been shown to improve the success rate&#xD;
      of dural puncture when applied routinely to all patients. Routine use of pre-procedure&#xD;
      ultrasound guided paramedian approach results in 50% reduction in number of passes required&#xD;
      for spinal anaesthetic, from a study at Cork University Hospital (awaiting publication).&#xD;
      L5-S1 is the widest interlaminar space and provides minimal contribution to overall movement&#xD;
      of lumbar spine.This interspinous space might still be accessible even if the patient has&#xD;
      minimal spine flexion. We also noted that spinal needle insertion via the L5-S1 interspace&#xD;
      was associated with the fewest passes in the pre-procedure guided ultrasound group (although&#xD;
      non-significant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that the routine use of pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian spinal&#xD;
      technique at L5S1 interspinous space will result in fewer needle passes to enter the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space when compared to the conventional landmark based midline approach.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective, randomised, controlled study. All consented patients scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo elective total knee or total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia will be&#xD;
      included in the study. A written informed consent will be obtained from all patients&#xD;
      participating in the study. Patients with contraindications to spinal anesthesia (allergy to&#xD;
      local anesthetic, coagulopathy, local infection and indeterminate neurological disease) will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomised using random number generating software (Research Randomizer&#xD;
      Version 4.0 ) to undergo either conventional landmark-guided spinal anesthesia (Group C) or&#xD;
      pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian L5S1 spinal (Group P). Group allocation will be&#xD;
      concealed by enclosing the codes in a sealed opaque envelope and will be seen by the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist immediately before performing the procedure. Patients will be&#xD;
      blinded as to their allocated study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, spinal anesthesia will be performed by one of three consultant&#xD;
      anesthesiologists (FL, PL, GI), each having performed more than 75 neuraxial ultrasound scans&#xD;
      prior to the study. On arrival to the anesthesia induction room baseline monitoring&#xD;
      (non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and 3 lead ECG) and intravenous access will be&#xD;
      established. The patients will be then positioned sitting on a level trolley with feet&#xD;
      resting on a foot rest. They will be given a pillow to hug and requested to maintain an&#xD;
      arched back posture with an assistant holding the patient to aid positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group C, the anesthesiologist will palpate the landmarks after positioning and graded the&#xD;
      ease of palpation on a 4 point scale (easy, moderate, difficult or impossible) as described&#xD;
      in previous studies.10 Strict asepsis will be followed throughout the procedure with&#xD;
      anesthesiologist scrubbed prior to procedure, wearing mask and sterile gloves. The skin will&#xD;
      be prepped with 2% Chlorhexidine (Chloraprep 3 ml applicator, CareFusion Corporation, San&#xD;
      Diego, CA 92130,USA) following which 2-5 ml of 1% lidocaine will be used to infiltrate the&#xD;
      skin. The anesthesiologist performing the spinal technique will be allowed to choose the&#xD;
      appropriate needle length ( 90 or 119 mm 25 G Whitacre needle, Becton, Dickinson and Company,&#xD;
      Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, 07417-1880, USA), gauge (25 or 22G), depth and angle of&#xD;
      insertion. Hyperbaric bupivacaine will be used in both groups. After completion of spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic injection, and positioning the patient in lateral decubitus, ultrasound will be&#xD;
      used to identify the interspinous level at which the injection will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group P, a portable ultrasound unit with a curved 2-5 MHz probe will be used for initial&#xD;
      pre-procedural marking. A paramedian sagittal oblique view of the neuraxis will be obtained&#xD;
      and the sacrum will be identified, following which the interlaminar space between L5 and S1&#xD;
      will be noted. At this interspace with the probe positioned to obtain the clearest ultrasound&#xD;
      image of the anterior complex (ligamentum flavum dura complex- LFD) and posterior complex&#xD;
      (posterior longitudinal ligament- PLL) possible, a skin marker will be used to mark the&#xD;
      midpoint of the long border of the probe and the midpoints of the short borders of the probe.&#xD;
      The medial angulation of the probe will also be noted to guide the insertion of the spinal&#xD;
      needle. At the same horizontal level as the midpoint of the long border of the probe, the&#xD;
      midpoint of the line drawn between the two short border midpoints of the probe will be used&#xD;
      as paramedian insertion point for the spinal needle. A transverse median (TM) view at the&#xD;
      same level will also be obtained and the midline will be marked. This marking will be used to&#xD;
      aid the medial angulation of the spinal needle. Both PSO and TM views would be graded as good&#xD;
      (both LFD and PLL visible), intermediate (either LFD or PLL visible) and poor (both LFD and&#xD;
      PLL not visible).15 Following skin marking, care will be taken to make sure that the needle&#xD;
      entry site will be free of ultrasound gel prior to needle insertion. In group P, the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will not palpate the landmarks for grading until the spinal injection is&#xD;
      complete. Spinal anesthesia will be performed in the same aseptic manner as mentioned&#xD;
      earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the anesthesiologists will be given the option to use alternative methods if&#xD;
      unsuccessful after 3 attempts. For patients in group C another interspinous space could be&#xD;
      used or ultrasound employed. For patients in group P a midline approach or a conventional&#xD;
      landmark palpation technique could be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be noted by a single observer for all patients. Due to the nature of the&#xD;
      study, the observer will not be blinded to the groups. A timer will be used to record the&#xD;
      various time intervals. Time for identifying landmarks in group C will be defined as time&#xD;
      from which the anesthesiologist started palpating to identify the landmarks to completion of&#xD;
      the process as declared by the anesthesiologist. In group P it will be defined as time from&#xD;
      which the ultrasound probe will be placed on the skin to the anesthesiologist declaring that&#xD;
      the markings are completed. Time taken for performing spinal anesthetic will be defined as&#xD;
      time taken from insertion of introducer needle to completion of injection. The number of&#xD;
      passes, defined as the number of forward advancements of the spinal needle in a given&#xD;
      interspinous space (i.e. withdrawal and redirection of spinal needle without exiting the&#xD;
      skin) and number of spinal needle insertion attempts (defined as the number of times the&#xD;
      spinal needle will be withdrawn from the skin and reinserted) will be noted.10 The number of&#xD;
      passes and attempts will be recorded either until the completion of spinal anesthetic or&#xD;
      until the anesthesiologist converts to an alternate technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of radicular pain, paraesthesia and blood in the spinal needle will also be noted.&#xD;
      All patients who experienced paraesthesia or radicular pain will be followed over the next 24&#xD;
      hours and any patients with persistent symptoms will be further evaluated as per department&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups following administration of spinal anesthesia, patients will be positioned on&#xD;
      either left or right lateral position depending on the site of surgery. After positioning and&#xD;
      prior to administration of sedation, patients will be asked for their peri-procedural pain&#xD;
      scores measured using an 11 point verbal rating scale (0=no pain, 10=most pain imaginable)&#xD;
      and peri-procedural discomfort scores measured using an 11 point verbal rating measured (0=&#xD;
      no discomfort, 10=most discomfort imaginable). Level of block (loss of cold sensation) will&#xD;
      be noted 30 minutes after spinal anesthetic injection. Type and dose of sedation (Midazolam&#xD;
      +/- Propofol infusion) will be left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes The primary outcome will be the difference in number of passes between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes includes the following,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of spinal needle insertion attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time for identifying landmarks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time taken for performing spinal anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Level of block&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incidence of radicular pain, paraesthesia and blood in the spinal needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Peri-procedural pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Peri-procedural discomfort score Statistics Based on our previous study with same group&#xD;
           of consultants done here in CUH, the average number of passes in group C was 6.4 +/-8.6&#xD;
           (mean +/- SD). We hypothesised that by using pre-procedural paramedian spinal done at&#xD;
           L5S1, the number of passes could be reduced to 1.5. Fourty eight patients in each group&#xD;
           will be needed to achieve a power of 0.8 and type 1 error of &lt;0.05. We are hoping to&#xD;
           randomise 60 patients per group to allow for dropouts. All data will be analysed based&#xD;
           on intention to treat. Data will be visually inspected for normality. Categorical data&#xD;
           were analysed using the Chi-square test. Normally distributed parametric data were&#xD;
           analysed using Students-t test (two groups) or ANOVA (more than 2 groups). A p value of&#xD;
           less than 0.05 will be considered significant. SPSS version 20 will be used for the&#xD;
           statistical analysis.&#xD;
