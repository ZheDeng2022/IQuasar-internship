      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Burden: Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in under-five&#xD;
           children, particularly in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge gap: Although many studies have reported an association between vitamin D&#xD;
           deficiency and pneumonia, there is lack in information on its therapeutic impact, i.e.&#xD;
           the impact of vitamin D supplementation in the management of childhood pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevance: Vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the innate immune response&#xD;
           against infections. We, therefore, propose to conduct this study to assess the impact of&#xD;
           vitamin D supplementation, in addition to standard antibiotic and supportive therapy, on&#xD;
           the outcome of severe childhood pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesise that in the management of hospitalized severe&#xD;
      pneumonia in under-five children, vitamin D3 supplementation, as an adjunct to the standard&#xD;
      antibiotic and other supportive therapy, will hasten recover from severe pneumonia and may&#xD;
      thereby shorten duration of severe pneumonia and also reduce the risk of new episode of&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the investigators study is to assess the clinical benefit of&#xD;
      oral supplementation of vitamin D3, in addition to standard antibiotic and other supportive&#xD;
      therapy, to hospitalised, under-five children with severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This would be a randomised, double blind, controlled clinical trial (RCT). Children&#xD;
      of either sex, aged 3-59 months, attending the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b, with clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed severe pneumonia will comprise the study population. Eligible children will be&#xD;
      allotted a sequential study number, which will have been previously assigned to vitamin D or&#xD;
      placebo in accordance with the randomisation. The study staff and mothers/ caregivers of the&#xD;
      children will be blinded as to whether vitamin D3 or placebo has been added to their child's&#xD;
      diet. Infants aged 3-5 months will receive breast milk and/or infant formula, and those 6&#xD;
      months or older will receive &quot;Milk Suji&quot; as a complementary food. Vitamin D3 supplementation&#xD;
      will be given on five consecutive days, from the day of enrolment in addition to standard&#xD;
      antibiotic and other supportive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be time to resolution of severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be duration of hospitalization, fever, tachypnoea, chest in&#xD;
      drawing, hypoxia, lethargy and inability to feed during hospital stay and as well as new&#xD;
      episode of pneumonia after discharge.&#xD;

      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a hypothesis testing research proposal, briefly mention the hypothesis to be tested and&#xD;
      provide the scientific basis of the hypothesis, critically examining the observations leading&#xD;
      to the formulation of the hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does this research proposal involve testing of hypothesis: 0 No 1 Yes (describe below)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that supplementation of vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol), in&#xD;
      addition to standard antibiotic and other supportive therapy in the management of under-five&#xD;
      children with severe pneumonia will significantly shorten the duration of severity of&#xD;
      pneumonia and thereby reduce hospital stay and also reduce the risk of new episode of&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the clinical benefit of oral vitamin D3 supplementation, in addition to&#xD;
      standard antibiotic and other supportive therapy, in the management of hospitalised,&#xD;
      under-five children with severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the duration of severe pneumonia of children in the two study&#xD;
      groups receiving the standard therapy (appropriate antibiotic and other supportive therapy)&#xD;
      with those receiving vitamin D supplementation in addition to the standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the duration of hospitalization, fever, tachypnoea, chest in drawing,&#xD;
           hypoxia, lethargy and inability to feed during hospital stay, in under-five children in&#xD;
           the two study groups, as mentioned under the primary aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the recurrence of new episode of pneumonia over the next 6 months after&#xD;
           discharge from hospital in the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the optimum safety dose of vitamin D3 for different groups of under-five&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In severe pneumonia patient who also have acute watery diarrhoea we will assess the&#xD;
           indirect absorption of vitamin D by measuring serum vitamin D level and will also assess&#xD;
           the clinical outcome in the subgroup.&#xD;
