  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, research study is looking at the safety and acceptability of a new vaccine&#xD;
      adjuvant (immune booster) called PAL when combined with the seasonal flu vaccine (Fluviral)&#xD;
      to test the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines and medications on healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 48 healthy adult participants, and occur over 3 years. In&#xD;
      the first six months/180 days of the study participants will have visits to the study site&#xD;
      during which safety and immunogenicity outcomes will be measured. From Day 181 to Year 3,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted by telephone or email to collect information on any adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, dose-ranging, randomized (5:1), observer-blind, controlled study of the&#xD;
      safety and immune response to intramuscular injection of PapMV (Papaya Mosaic Virus) rVLP&#xD;
      (Recombinant Virus-Like Particles) which is PAL adjuvant, or &quot;PAL&quot; combined with Trivalent&#xD;
      Influenza Vaccines (TIV) at one of four dose levels of PAL, combined with one of two dose&#xD;
      levels of TIV, or active control (TIV). The study will enroll approximately 48 healthy adult&#xD;
      participants, and occur over 3 years. In the first six months/180 days (Epoch 1) of the study&#xD;
      participants will have visits to the study site during which safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured. In Epoch 2 (Day 181 to Year 3) participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone or email to collect unsolicited adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a controlled clinical trial. The control group will receive the standard dose of TIV,&#xD;
      0.5 mL, which consists of 15 μg haemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza strain recommended by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2013-2014 influenza season in the northern&#xD;
      hemisphere. An active control is used so that the attributable risk of adverse events can be&#xD;
      estimated, and so that outcome measures can be assessed in a blinded fashion. Only adults in&#xD;
      stable health will be eligible in order to minimize participant risk. Only non-pregnant&#xD;
      females of childbearing age are eligible, and they must agree to continue adequate&#xD;
      contraception for 180 days after injection. Study holding rules and a safety evaluation by a&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) will be in place. The study will follow a staggered&#xD;
      dose-escalation design, with each of four steps introducing a new dose of the adjuvant (30,&#xD;
      60, 120 and 240 μg respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose level of PAL adjuvant FB-631 is 0.5 X 60 µg (i.e., 30 µg), which is half the&#xD;
      dose that was found to be most immunogenic in animal studies. The adjuvant is co-administered&#xD;
      with 0.25 mL of TIV, which is half the dose of TIV that is routinely administered to adults&#xD;
      (i.e. 7.5 μg of each of the three influenza subtypes contained in the vaccine). The next dose&#xD;
      level is 60µg of FB-631 combined with 0.25 mL TIV. The third dose level is 120 μg of FB-631&#xD;
      with 0.25 mL TIV. In the fourth and final step the dose of adjuvant is 240 μg of PAL adjuvant&#xD;
      combined with 0.25 mL TIV (8 participants) or 0.125 mL TIV (i.e. 3.75 μg HA of each influenza&#xD;
      subtype contained in the vaccine) (8 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any safety signal observed in the study will lead to a hold until the decision of Safety&#xD;
      Review Committee to continue, modify or suspend the conduct of the study.&#xD;
