  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess if targeting activating EGFR and HER2 mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) is more effective when these mutations are truncal dominant mutations (≥50%), as&#xD;
      opposed to non-dominant (≥5 to &lt;50%) or low frequency mutations (&lt;5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be available to patients registered to the TRACERx study (NCT01888601), or&#xD;
      non-TRACERx patients who have two archival tissue/DNA samples who are willing to have a&#xD;
      biopsy of their relapsed disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests that clonal dominance of the drug target should be considered&#xD;
      when stratifying therapeutics in solid tumours. It is likely that intratumour heterogeneity&#xD;
      and cancer subclonal diversity may contribute to the high failure rate of oncology drugs&#xD;
      relative to other medical specialties where drugs are applied to stable somatic genomes&#xD;
      rather than unstable genomes found in cancer populations. In addition, increasing evidence in&#xD;
      NSCLC and other solid tumours suggests that the selection of resistant subclones during the&#xD;
      disease course is responsible for the acquisition of drug resistance and therapeutic failure.&#xD;
      Finally, spatial separation of cancer subclones within the same tumour is likely to&#xD;
      contribute to the difficulties associated with cancer biomarker validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Actionable mutations&quot; may not be optimally actionable if they are present at one site of&#xD;
      disease or within a minority tumour subclone. Such minority subclones are likely to&#xD;
      contribute to intratumour heterogeneity and discordant results when interpreting multiple&#xD;
      biopsies from the same tumour. Our work in NSCLC, renal cancers and glioblastomas is&#xD;
      demonstrating that such subclones, carrying potentially targetable events, may be spatially&#xD;
      separated within the same tumour or between primary and metastatic sites. This has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in the context of EGFR somatic mutations that may be heterogeneous in up to&#xD;
      25-30% of patients, present at one site of disease but not another. The impact of such&#xD;
      actionable driver heterogeneity on treatment response, drug resistance and outcome is&#xD;
      currently unclear and is the subject of investigation within this protocol; DARWIN1 will&#xD;
      assess the impact of EGFR activating mutation and HER2 mutation heterogeneity on progression&#xD;
      free survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,&#xD;
      afatinib.&#xD;
