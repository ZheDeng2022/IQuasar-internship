  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      peroral dose of 0.5 g and 1.0 g metamizol relative to placebo and 1.0 g acetylsalicylic acid&#xD;
      in 2 episodes of moderate tension headache.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At least two episodes of tension headache per month in the last three months prior to&#xD;
             enrolment into this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The episodes of tension headaches were usually treated by the patient successfully&#xD;
             with a non-opioid-analgesic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First episodic headache occurred at an age under 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local&#xD;
             regulations&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient usually needs for successful treatment of tension headache &quot;Over The&#xD;
             Counter&quot; (OTC) analgesic in doses exceeding the doses tested here&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient takes an OTC-analgesic normally at the first signs of an episode of&#xD;
             tension headache&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has more than 15 episodes of tension headache per month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients whose episodic tension headache is strongly correlated with the start&#xD;
             of hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with (non-) prescriptional analgesics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre- (less than 4 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant treatment&#xD;
             with an antidepressive and/or antipsychotic drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre- (less than 2 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant treatment&#xD;
             with any drug such as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs), propanolol,&#xD;
             metroprolol, flunarizin, cyclandelate, valproic-acid, serotonergic antagonists,&#xD;
             ergotamine, dihydroergotamines and benzodiazepines that may influence the headache&#xD;
             symptomatology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of benzodiazepines in the previous 24 hours to the administration of the study&#xD;
             drug. Occasional use of benzodiazepines - up to 3 per week - is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any drug with analgesic properties in the previous 24 hours to the&#xD;
             administration of the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with any drug containing ASA and/or metamizol&#xD;

          -  Concomitant treatment with anticoagulants such as heparin or coumarin-derivatives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol and drug abuse according to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders )&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Bronchial asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to the investigational drugs, its&#xD;
             excipients and/or to other NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks and concurrent&#xD;
             participation in another clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active gastroesophageal flux disease (Amendment number 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with analgesics or any other drug that may have influenced the&#xD;
             headache symptomatology - including metamizol or ASA -, was referred to its use during&#xD;
             the headache episodes under evaluation. As long as appropriate wash-out periods were&#xD;
             respected, analgesics were allowed in between the episodes of tension headache (TH)&#xD;
             and their use as a rescue medication did not lead to the exclusion of the patient&#xD;
             (Amendment number 2)&#xD;
