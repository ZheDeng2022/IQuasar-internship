      For the duration of 10 weeks, participants will be asked to maintain their current levels of&#xD;
      physical activity and to take part in three testing sessions over the course of 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Objective and subjective measurements will be obtained at (week 0), at midpoint (week 5) and&#xD;
      after the intervention terminates (week 10). The objective measurements will be taken by&#xD;
      inserting pressure sensors directly into the shoe and recording the centre of pressure.&#xD;
      Markers will be attached to the surface of the body on the shoulders, feet and belly button&#xD;
      and video recording will be used to assess the movement of the centre of mass. The first task&#xD;
      requires individuals to stand in one spot with their eyes open, and then eyes closed.&#xD;
      Secondly, standing in one place, upon an auditory cue, arms will be lifted to the sky as fast&#xD;
      as possible. Lastly, participants will walk around a set of chairs while music plays and when&#xD;
      the music stops, this is a cue to stop walking. The Timed-Up-and-Go test requires&#xD;
      participants to rise from a seated position, walk 3 meters, turn and return to their original&#xD;
      seated position. The Berg Balance Scale requires the completion of a 14 task sequence which&#xD;
      evaluates balance ability during seated, and various standing positions as well as&#xD;
      transitioning movements. The other measurements taken are collected via a questionnaire about&#xD;
      balance confidence level. Upon arrival, participants are required to report whether they have&#xD;
      experienced a fall since the last class attended and if yes, a follow-up questionnaire is&#xD;
      also required to gain information about the nature of the fall.&#xD;

      The main purpose of my research is to explore the benefits of a 10 week Tai Chi and&#xD;
      compensatory stepping training program on balance control among older adults by examining&#xD;
      static and dynamic postural responses to perturbations before (0 weeks), at midpoint (5&#xD;
      weeks) and after the intervention (10 weeks). This Tai Chi and compensatory stepping program&#xD;
      will be compared to a control group that will not participate in any physical activity for 10&#xD;
      weeks, but will be offered the chance to partake in a fall prevention program after the 10&#xD;
      weeks of testing has been completed. The program will be administered twice weekly for thirty&#xD;
      minutes each by experienced instructors at a community location (Lab at WLU). The Tai&#xD;
      Chi/compensatory stepping group will engage in 50 minutes of Tai Chi exercise followed by 10&#xD;
      minutes of controlled manual perturbations administered for compensatory stepping training.&#xD;
      The control group will not be participating in the Tai Chi and compensatory stepping training&#xD;
      during the initial 10 weeks of testing, but will be offered the chance to participate in&#xD;
      either the SMART fall prevention program, or given other resources for participation in a&#xD;
      fall prevention exercise program. Testing for both groups will take place at baseline (week&#xD;
      0), midpoint (week 5) and post-intervention (week 10). We will be assessing balance control&#xD;
      by administering the Berg Balance Scale (attached), the Timed-Up-and-Go Test and tracking the&#xD;
      variability, minimum and maximum displacements of the centre of pressure (COP), centre of&#xD;
      mass (COM) and maximum and minimum displacement between the COM and COP as an indication of&#xD;
      instability. The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale questionnaire (attached) will&#xD;
      also be administered as an indication of balance confidence. Tighter regulation of COP and&#xD;
      COM and as well as a small displacement between the 2 values indicates greater balance&#xD;
      control. COP, COM and COP/COM relationship will be measured during three balance tasks.&#xD;
      Participants will have pressure insoles directly inserted into their shoes, markers attached&#xD;
      with tape to record movement velocity and change in position. For testing, participants will&#xD;
      be required to complete 3 tasks. The first is made up of two parts that measure static&#xD;
      balance. Participants will stand in one place with their eyes open for 3 trials for 30&#xD;
      seconds each and then they will be asked to repeat the same standing with their eyes closed.&#xD;
      The second task is a measure of static balance in response to a self -perturbation, where&#xD;
      participants will raise their arms at a high velocity to the sky to offset balance in&#xD;
      response to an unexpected auditory cue. The third task will require participants to walk in a&#xD;
      circle around a set of chairs and perturb their balance by terminating gait upon an&#xD;
      unexpected auditory cue.&#xD;
