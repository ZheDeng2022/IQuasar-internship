      Background: Several clinical trials are underway to investigate if variable forms of vitamin&#xD;
      D (D2 vs. D3) prescribed at different doses (10,000-50,000 IUs/week) can improve the&#xD;
      side-effects associated with treatment for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer,&#xD;
      specifically aromatase inhibitors (AIs.) Presumably for generalizability and potential safety&#xD;
      purposes, these trials predominantly exclude women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC); a&#xD;
      rapidly expanding sector of the cancer survivor population who experience significant&#xD;
      treatment-related side-effects. Evaluation of the safety of vitamin D3 supplementation is&#xD;
      crucial since supplementation can lead to high calcium and importantly, in lab studies have&#xD;
      shown that vitamin D3 affects a gene that increases estrogen production. To assure that&#xD;
      vitamin D3 does not affect the clinical effects of anti-estrogen therapies, the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 supplements on estrogen production requires an evaluation that further explores&#xD;
      and defines its potential role in symptom management for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of vitamin D3 supplementation in&#xD;
      women with MBC, providing much needed data on the preliminary safety and efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment in this patient population. This study will determine: 1) if weekly supplementation&#xD;
      of high dose vitamin D3 increases serum vitamin D levels without adverse effects related to&#xD;
      such therapy (primary aim); 2) the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on symptom&#xD;
      management (secondary aim); and 3) if vitamin D3 supplementation is associated with improved&#xD;
      inflammation (exploratory aim.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is an 8 week &quot;proof of concept&quot; study to monitor laboratory parameters and to&#xD;
      assess potential effects on short-term outcomes. Adult, female patients (&gt;=18 years) with ER+&#xD;
      MBC (Stage IV) of any race/ethnicity and a history of vitamin D &lt; 30 mg/dl will be recruited&#xD;
      from within and around LUMC. Following current clinical practice guidelines, eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks. Laboratory values,&#xD;
      muscle function and inflammation will be examined pre- and post-supplementation, while&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks post-supplementation. We will assess if&#xD;
      increases in vitamin D are associated with clinically significant improvements in symptoms&#xD;
      and QOL, and decreased inflammation.&#xD;

      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials are underway to investigate if vitamin D2 or D3 provided at various&#xD;
      doses (10,000-50,000 IUs/week) can improve the side-effects associated with anti-estrogen&#xD;
      therapies, specifically aromatase inhibitors (AIs). However, these current trials use&#xD;
      variable forms of vitamin D and predominantly include women with Stage I-III disease,&#xD;
      excluding women with metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of the safety of vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation is crucial since supplementation can lead to hypercalcemia and importantly,&#xD;
      in vitro studies have shown that vitamin D3 influences the transcription of a gene that&#xD;
      increases estrogen production.27,28 To assure that vitamin D3 does not abrogate the clinical&#xD;
      effects of anti-estrogen therapies, the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on estrogen&#xD;
      production requires evaluation. Therefore, the overarching goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in women with&#xD;
      MBC. We will address and test the following aims and hypotheses, respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if weekly supplementation of 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 raises serum levels&#xD;
      of 25(OH)D to &gt;30 mg/dl without adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Women who are compliant with vitamin D3 supplementation, as evidenced by&#xD;
      normalization (&gt;30 mg/dl) or increases in their serum 25(OH)D levels, will not experience&#xD;
      significant changes in serum calcium, parathyroid hormone or serum estradiol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Women who achieve serum concentrations of 25 (OH)D ≥30 mg/dl or experience&#xD;
      significant increases in 25(OH)D will exhibit improvements in pain, fatigue, sleep, mood,&#xD;
      muscle function and overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To explore the mechanistic effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and its potential association with symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Evidence from studies involving early stage breast cancer participants confirms that&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, endocrine related symptoms and mood disturbances are commonly&#xD;
      associated with breast cancer treatment, particularly hormone deprivation therapies. The high&#xD;
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency among breast cancer survivors is well&#xD;
      accepted and further hypothesized to aggravate treatment-related side effects, particularly&#xD;
      arthralgias. Women with MBC are excluded from the majority of on-going vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation trials for safety and generalizability purposes. However, novel therapies are&#xD;
      continuing to improve and prolong the lives of these women, resulting in a rapidly expansive&#xD;
      group of breast cancer survivors. While vitamin D supplementation is prescribed to correct an&#xD;
      underlying nutrient deficiency in the clinical context of preserving bone health, emerging&#xD;
      evidence suggests it may have more systemic effects. Thus, vitamin D&#xD;
      repletion/supplementation has profound potential implications for women with MBC, whose&#xD;
      primary goal of treatment is to minimize the side-effects of treatment in support of optimal&#xD;
      quality of life. This study reflects a highly innovative, yet simple therapy that could&#xD;
      ultimately provide these survivors with a much needed evidence-based supportive care&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
