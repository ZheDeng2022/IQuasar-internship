  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      West Nile virus (WNV) is considered an emerging virus in the United States, and infection can&#xD;
      lead to severe illness in older adults. This study will evaluate the safety of and immune&#xD;
      response to a live West Nile virus vaccine (WN/DEN4Δ30) for the prevention of West Nile&#xD;
      encephalitis in adults 50 to 65 years old.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WNV is the leading vector-borne cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. Severe&#xD;
      illness is most common in older adults, and in this population, the virus can cause&#xD;
      hepatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis leading to paralysis, coma, and death. WNV illness is&#xD;
      a public health issue and is an emerging disease in the United States. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated West Nile/dengue chimeric virus&#xD;
      vaccine (WN/DEN4Δ30) for the prevention of West Nile encephalitis in adults 50 to 65 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults, 50 to 65 years old, who have no history of previous&#xD;
      flavivirus infection. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the WN/DEN4Δ30&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo vaccine at study entry (Day 0). At the entry visit, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a medical history review, physical examination, blood collection, and vital sign&#xD;
      measurements; female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive their assigned vaccine, and they will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      vaccination for monitoring. Participants will record their temperature and symptoms 3 times a&#xD;
      day for 16 days after each vaccination. Additional study visits will occur on Days 3, 6, 8,&#xD;
      10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 150. These visits may include the same study procedures&#xD;
      that occurred at the entry visit. At a study visit on Day 180, participants will receive&#xD;
      another dose of their assigned vaccine. Additional study visits will occur on Days 183, 186,&#xD;
      188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. All study procedures after the second&#xD;
      vaccination will be the same that occurred after the first vaccination.&#xD;
