  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: the effectiveness of treatment of Pompe disease with rhGAA enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy (ERT) is limited at least in part because patients develop antibodies against the&#xD;
      provided rhGAA enzyme. Treatment with Zavesca® prior to infusion may dampen or eliminate the&#xD;
      anti-rhGAA immune response in patients receiving ERT, thereby allowing for greater ERT&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with Zavesca® before a enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may decrease the severity&#xD;
      of, or eliminate infusion associated reactions (IAR) in people with Pompe Disease receiving&#xD;
      ERT.&#xD;

      This Study is designed to assess the effects of Zavesca® as immunomodulatory therapy on&#xD;
      anti-rhGAA immune responses in patients with Pompe disease, as well as their health and&#xD;
      disease progression. Subjects will either receive Zavesca® at 100 mg or 300 mg dosing levels&#xD;
      during study participation (n=3 @ 100 mg dosing; n=3 @ 300 mg dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 100 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes prior to ERT&#xD;
      infusion. The subsequent 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 300 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes to&#xD;
      ERT infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are on standard ERT for Pompe disease and have a history of infusion&#xD;
      associated reaction. Travel to the study site in Gainesville, Florida is required for 3&#xD;
      visits. Participants are prescribed medication Zavesca® and have blood tests, punch muscle&#xD;
      biopsy, physical exams, and answer questionnaires over 3 months study participation.&#xD;
