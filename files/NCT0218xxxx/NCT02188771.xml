  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, prospective, active-controlled, randomized, open-label, clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety and tolerability of single intra-articular injection of&#xD;
      RegenoGel-SP for the treatment of OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RegenoGel-SP is composed of fibrinogen in plasma linked to a high molecular weight HA. The&#xD;
      viscoelastic properties resulting from the combination of these two natural macromolecules is&#xD;
      further enhanced by joint surface associated factors to generate a viscoelastic gel with&#xD;
      superior stability and mechanical integrity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighteen subjects will be randomized and sequentially assigned to RegenoGel-SP or to&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA) treatments on a 2:1 basis, respectively. Treatment groups will be&#xD;
      assigned as per a randomization list that will be prepared prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done at Enrollment (Visit 2). Neither surgeon nor subject will be&#xD;
      blinded to treatment. Subjects will be monitored for 6 months following treatment. Following&#xD;
      signing the Informed Consent form (Visit 1), subjects who conform to the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will answer questionnaires for grading of their symptoms, pain level and overall functional&#xD;
      performance. Subjects will be evaluated for vital signs, blood hematology, chemistry, INR,&#xD;
      aPTT and ECG, and will be subjected to a 30-40ml blood withdrawal that will be used for the&#xD;
      production of autologous RegenoGel-SP. Subjects randomized to receive RegenoGel-SP will&#xD;
      receive a single, intra-articular injection (Visit 2), while subjects randomized to receive&#xD;
      HA treatment (Euflexxa®) will be injected with 3 intra-articular weekly injections of (Visits&#xD;
      2-4). Subjects treated with RegenoGel-SP will attend visits 3 and 4 but will not receive&#xD;
      treatment. All subjects will return for Observation visits after 6 weeks, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months following treatment (Visits 5-7). During treatment and observation visits, subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored for safety parameters (local and systemic AEs, blood work analysis ) and&#xD;
      response to treatment using the above questionnaires.&#xD;
