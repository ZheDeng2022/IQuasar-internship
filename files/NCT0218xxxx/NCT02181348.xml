    <textblock>
      Anemia is one of the major health problems of the developing countries of the world [1].&#xD;
      According to the WHO reference criteria, an adult is labeled as anemic, if the blood&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentration falls below 13.0 g/dL in men or less than 12.0 g/dL in the&#xD;
      non-pregnant women [2]. Hemoglobin concentrations below the lower limit of normal are a&#xD;
      common laboratory finding in apparently healthy people in general population all over the&#xD;
      world [3-5]. Many of these mildly anemic individuals are not investigated sufficiently to&#xD;
      establish the probable cause of their anemia and thus may end up with morbidity and health&#xD;
      problems, especially the young women in developing countries [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only few studies on the use of vitamin E in the correction of anemia have been published and&#xD;
      hardly any on correction of mild anemia in healthy adults. The objective of this intervention&#xD;
      study was to investigate the association of vitamin E supplementation with post-supplemental&#xD;
      blood hemoglobin levels in mildly anemic healthy Pakistani adults.&#xD;

      Anemia is one of the major health problems of the developing countries of the world [1].&#xD;
      According to the WHO reference criteria, an adult is labeled as anemic, if the blood&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentration falls below 13.0 g/dL in men or less than 12.0 g/dL in the&#xD;
      non-pregnant women [2]. Hemoglobin concentrations below the lower limit of normal are a&#xD;
      common laboratory finding in apparently healthy people in general population all over the&#xD;
      world [3-5]. Many of these mildly anemic individuals are not investigated sufficiently to&#xD;
      establish the probable cause of their anemia and thus may end up with morbidity and health&#xD;
      problems, especially the young women in developing countries [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few human studies during the past few years have suggested the possible use of antioxidant&#xD;
      vitamins in the correction of anemia [6]. Vitamin E is an essentially required lipophilic&#xD;
      vitamin with a variety of antioxidant and non-antioxidant functions. It has been shown that&#xD;
      treatment with vitamin E resulted in increased number of colony forming units of erythroid&#xD;
      precursors in experimental animals and protected their bone marrow against drug- induced&#xD;
      toxicity [7]. In some of the clinical trials in patients with hematological disorders,&#xD;
      vitamin E supplementation showed decrease in red blood cell deformability and enhanced blood&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels [8,9]. Although clinical benefits of vitamin E on increasing hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels in some disease states have been published, yet its effect on a presumably healthy&#xD;
      adult population with no abnormality other than mild anemia has hardly been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin E supplementation for three months to mildly anemic healthy adults (with no past&#xD;
      history of any iron supplements) would result into improved post-supplemental levels of blood&#xD;
      hemoglobin compared to their basal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the present study: To investigate the association of vitamin E supplementation&#xD;
      in mildly anemic healthy adults with the post-supplemental blood hemoglobin levels in a&#xD;
      general population of Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this placebo-controlled and single blinded study, 357 healthy volunteer subjects, 235&#xD;
      males and 122 non-pregnant females of age 18-45 years were recruited and enrolled through&#xD;
      general practitioners' (GP) clinics from various localities of Karachi and from the personnel&#xD;
      of the Aga Khan University, Karachi. The recruitment was started in 2008 and completed in&#xD;
      2011. The clinical examination of study subjects was carried out by a general physician. The&#xD;
      participants were nonsmokers; had no history of gastrointestinal disorders or chronic disease&#xD;
      or iron deficiency during the last 6 months; had not taken vitamin E supplements or received&#xD;
      blood transfusion during the past 6 months, and were not dehydrated. They were screened for&#xD;
      the presence of mild anemia (10.0-13.9 g/dL, in males and 8.4-11.2 g/dL, in non-pregnant&#xD;
      females using the criteria followed by the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, 124 subjects (80 males and 44 females) who were found to be mildly anemic&#xD;
      and fulfilling the criteria were included in the intervention trial. Eighty two subjects were&#xD;
      randomly placed in Intervention group and 42 in the Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Each subject was provided with 400 mg oral capsule of vitamin E (Evion,&#xD;
      containing dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate) and was asked to take one capsule daily continuously&#xD;
      for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Each subject was provided with placebo (edible oil) capsules to be taken once&#xD;
      daily for three consecutive months. The placebo capsules were identical to vitamin E capsules&#xD;
      in size, shape, color, appearance and taste. The compliance of the participants was monitored&#xD;
      by counting the number of capsules consumed after every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling and Measurement of Biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten mL of fasting blood was collected before the start of supplementation from each&#xD;
      participant and another sample (10 mL) was obtained after 3 months of supplementation. Each&#xD;
      blood sample was divided into two equal parts; one part of blood was transferred to a tube&#xD;
      containing anticoagulant , while the other part was transferred to a plain tube for obtaining&#xD;
      serum. Blood samples were analyzed for blood hemoglobin levels in an automated hematology&#xD;
      analyzer. Serum/plasma samples were kept frozen at -70 degree Centigrade for analysis of&#xD;
      other biomarkers.&#xD;
