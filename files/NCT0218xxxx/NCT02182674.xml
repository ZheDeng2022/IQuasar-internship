      Study to demonstrate the comparability of two puffs of Combivent hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)&#xD;
      inhalation aerosol (18 mcg ipratropium bromide/100 mcg albuterol sulfate / per puff) to two&#xD;
      puffs of the marketed chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) containing product, Combivent (CFC) inhalation&#xD;
      aerosol (18 mcg ipratropium bromide/103 mcg albuterol sulfate / per puff). The dose response&#xD;
      profile, safety and pharmacokinetics of Combivent HFA formulation are to be characterized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients were to have a diagnosis of COPD and must have met the following criteria&#xD;
             at visit 1: Patients were to have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway&#xD;
             obstruction with a baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt;=65 % of&#xD;
             predicted normal and FEV1 / forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;=70 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have demonstrated a &gt;= 015 % improvement in baseline FEV1 within one&#xD;
             hour after the inhalation of two puffs of Combivent (CFC) inhalation aerosol (18 mcg&#xD;
             ipratropium bromide/103 mcg albuterol sulfate per actuation; ex-mouthpiece dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have had a smoking history of more than ten pack-year. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking on pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have been able to perform technical satisfactory pulmonary function&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have been able to be trained in the proper use of a metered dose&#xD;
             inhalator (MDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All patients must have signed an informed consent form prior to participation in the&#xD;
             trial i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with significant disease other than COPD were to be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinical relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the&#xD;
             patient was to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients with a serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum&#xD;
             glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt;&#xD;
             2.0 mg/dL were to be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory&#xD;
             evaluation was not to be conducted in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who had total blood eosinophil count &gt;= 600/mmÂ³. A repeat eosinophil count&#xD;
             was not to be conducted in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or&#xD;
             patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the&#xD;
             last five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a history of life threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a&#xD;
             history or a thoracotomy for other reasons were to be evaluated as per exclusion&#xD;
             criteria no. 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a history of or active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with known active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the six&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening visit (Visit 1) or between the screening visit and visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with current significant psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients who were being treated with beta blocker medication, mono amine oxidase (MAO)&#xD;
             inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patients who were being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patients who were being treated with antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six&#xD;
             weeks on a stable dose before screening visit or a change between the screening visit&#xD;
             and visit 2) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day&#xD;
             or 20 mg every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patients who had been treated with oral beta adrenergics or long-acting&#xD;
             beta-adrenergics such as salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol in the two weeks prior&#xD;
             to the screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last six weeks&#xD;
             prior to the screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2, excluding&#xD;
             changes from long acting or oral beta-adrenergics to short acting inhaled&#xD;
             beta-adrenergics for purposes of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically&#xD;
             approved means of contraception.&#xD;

             other component of either Combivent formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Patients who had taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives&#xD;
             (whichever is greater) prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
