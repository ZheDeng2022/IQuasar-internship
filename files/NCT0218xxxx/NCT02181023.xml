  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by lung hyperinflation and&#xD;
           flow limitation. These physiopathological modifications are secondary to loss of elastic&#xD;
           recoil and bronchial obstruction due to emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cornerstone of COPD treatment is represented by inhaled beta-2 agonists and&#xD;
           anticholinergics. The molecules of the latter classes can be characterized by short&#xD;
           lasting action (few hours), long acting action (12 hours) or ultra long acting duration&#xD;
           of action (24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For years the only anticholinergic (or antimuscarinic) drug other than those used by&#xD;
           aerosol, was Tiotropium Bromide. Recently two new antimuscarinic agents have been&#xD;
           launched on the market: glycopyrronium bromide (once daily) and aclidinium (twice&#xD;
           daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Single Breath Nitrogen Test is capable of identifying the pulmonary closing volume.&#xD;
           The part of the curve that reflects lung ventilation inhomogeneity is the slope of phase&#xD;
           III&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For COPD patients, the most important characteristic for an inhalatory drug is a prompt&#xD;
           action in order to give a quick relief from respiratory symptoms, in particular&#xD;
           dyspnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective of this study is to study the acute action of glycopyrronium and&#xD;
           aclidinium in terms of reduction of hyperinflation, pulmonary specific resistances, lung&#xD;
           volume distribution and dyspnoea at rest in severe COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To our knowledge no study has explored these aspects before.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by progressive and&#xD;
      evolutionary physiopathological changes that are responsible for the developing of&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, disability, poor quality of life and morbidity. These changes are&#xD;
      secondary to parenchymal disruption and chronic bronchiolar inflammation in major part due to&#xD;
      cigarette smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung architectural derangement and loss of elastic recoil secondary to emphysema together&#xD;
      with decreased internal bronchiolar lumen due to mucosal chronic inflammation are responsible&#xD;
      for bronchial obstruction, flow limitation and lung hyperinflation. All these features bring&#xD;
      to exertional dyspnoea, chronic cough and sputum and so decreased activeness in daily life&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Single Breath Nitrogen Washout Test (SBN2) is one of the test that more adequately can&#xD;
      catch the modifications of small airways and their premature collapse called closing volume&#xD;
      (CV). Together with CV the test reflects pulmonary ventilation inhomogeneity through the&#xD;
      slope of the so called phase III (a plateau line of nitrogen concentration that is steeper&#xD;
      the bigger the ventilation inhomogeneity). In literature the effects of COPD inhalatory&#xD;
      treatments on this modifications and on hyperinflation were until today poorly analysed.&#xD;
      Recently some new anticholinergic molecules were developed, in particular Aclidinium Bromide&#xD;
      and Glycopyrronium Bromide, and there is no trace of such evaluation in medical literature&#xD;
      with those new inhalatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the acute effects of these drugs on lung mechanics are mandatory because the&#xD;
      quicker the effects, the faster the patient's dyspnoea relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise a first enrollment visit and then the suitable subjects will undergo&#xD;
      a pharmacological washout of 72 hours from any inhalatory drug except from Salbutamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the patients will be randomised to be given Glycopyrronium Bromide 44 mcg (and matched&#xD;
      Aclidinium Bromide 322 mcg placebo) or Aclidinium Bromide 322 mcg (and matched Glycopyrronium&#xD;
      Bromide 44 mcg placebo) (Day 1) with a double dummy scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 1 the pre-dose (baseline) evaluation consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body plethysmography (with residual volume and specific resistances evaluation),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial blood gas analysis (partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide evaluation),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SBN2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogic Scale for Dyspnoea (VAS scale) evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusion Lung Capacity for Carbon Monoxide with Single Breath method (DLCO). These&#xD;
           tests will be repeated after 5, 15, 30, 60 and 180 minutes after study drug inhalation.&#xD;
           DLCO and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed only at baseline and after 180&#xD;
           minutes after study drug inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After day 1 all the patients will undergo another period of inhalatory therapy washout of 72&#xD;
      hours (only rescue Salbutamol spray permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second pharmacological washout the patients will undergo the crossing over. The&#xD;
      ones who were given Aclidinium Bromide will assume Glycopyrronium Bromide and vice versa (Day&#xD;
      2) always in double dummy conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 2 all the patients will undergo the same evaluation as in day 1. At day 1 and day 2&#xD;
      the study drugs with the two different devices (active drug + placebo) will be given to the&#xD;
      patients by medical personnel not involved in the performing of any of the tests of day 1 and&#xD;
      2, in order to maintain the double blind conditions.&#xD;
