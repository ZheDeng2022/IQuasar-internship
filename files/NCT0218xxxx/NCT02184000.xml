      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing liver fibrosis grade in patients with chronic viral hepatitis is very important&#xD;
      for the prognostic assessment and in making the decision to initiate antiviral treatment.&#xD;
      Although the liver biopsy remains the gold standard, recent studies focused on establishing&#xD;
      the role of noninvasive methods in liver fibrosis grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography is an imaging method which estimates tissue elasticity. The first elastography&#xD;
      method which appeared was Transient Elastography (TE), followed by Real Time Elastography&#xD;
      (RT-E) and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI). TE was a method especially developed for&#xD;
      noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis as an alternative to liver biopsy. Unlike these,&#xD;
      RT-E and ARFI have multiple applications in diffuse and tumoral pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient Elastography (FibroScan) represents a noninvasive method useful in detecting the&#xD;
      degree of liver fibrosis. The ultrasound transducer probe is able to generate elastic shear&#xD;
      waves that propagate through the liver tissue as well as to measure their speed in the&#xD;
      tissue. Wave speed is directly related to tissue stiffness which is expressed in kilopascals&#xD;
      [1]. Initially, this method was validated for use and considered for chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      management guidelines, then for human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      co-infection and cholestatic liver diseases. FibroScan failures to give reliable results in&#xD;
      obese patients were reduced by developing a new XL probe which facilitated an alternative&#xD;
      noninvasive method to liver biopsy for liver fibrosis assessment [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) was proposed as an alternative to FibroScan for the&#xD;
      assessment of liver tissue elasticity, using a conventional ultrasound machine. The main&#xD;
      advantages of this method are the possibility of producing real-time images and its&#xD;
      feasibility in patients with ascites. Preliminary studies show better results for predicting&#xD;
      advanced grades of liver fibrosis than for mild to moderate fibrosis where the method is less&#xD;
      sensitive [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Time Elastography (RT-E) estimates relative tissue stiffness based on soft tissue&#xD;
      distortion and data are provided as real time color images [4, 5]. This is a real time method&#xD;
      that could also be used for patients with ascites. The method is not validated for liver&#xD;
      fibrosis assessment as there are few studies published so far. The appearance of the&#xD;
      elastography software on the convex probe with high penetration and possibility for&#xD;
      elastography to visualize the liver entirely and the development of information elastography&#xD;
      measurement information programs open new perspectives in noninvasive assessment of liver&#xD;
      pathology by RT-E. There are two recent studies showing good results of the software for&#xD;
      quantitative analysis in RT-E equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish the role of elastographic methods (ARFI and RT-E) in&#xD;
      liver fibrosis assessment in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. This multicentric&#xD;
      prospective trial will be approved by the ethical committee of each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To evaluate the role of real time elastography (ARFI and Hitachi elastography) in&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are enrolled consecutively. Patient data are collected (name initials, age, sex,&#xD;
      Civil Registration Number), liver disease etiology, anthropometric data (body mass index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood parameters are included: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT), γ -glutamyl transpeptidase, γ globulins, platelet count The following&#xD;
      indices are calculated: AST/ALT; AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI); AST/upper limit of&#xD;
      normal 100/platelet count (104 /mm3 ) , and FibroIndex [1.738 0.064 x platelet count (104&#xD;
      /mm3 ) + 0.005 x AST (U/l) + 0.463 x γ -globulin (g/dl)] Transient elastography is performed&#xD;
      using FibroScan (FibroScan, Echosens) with the patient lying in the dorsal decubitus position&#xD;
      and with his right arm in maximum abduction. The tip of the transducer probe is placed in the&#xD;
      median axillary line in the intercostal space corresponding to the right lobe of the liver.&#xD;
      The pressure index on the screen indicates that the pressure applied with the probe is&#xD;
      compatible with the measurement. Ten measurements per examination are necessary for good&#xD;
      accuracy of the stiffness assessment, considering the final result expressed in kilopascals&#xD;
      as the mean of the ten measurements. M and XL probes for obese patients are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hitachi Real Time Ultrasound Elastography is performed using the 5-1 MHz (EUP-L52) linear&#xD;
      transducer from Hitachi Preirus equipment (Hitachi Aloka Medical Tokyo, Japan). But, in order&#xD;
      to accommodate the pacient and to get a good section of liver, initialy, we performe&#xD;
      ultrasound exam with the convex transducer. Dual imaging is set in such a manner as to be&#xD;
      visible on the screen in a 2D image as well as in an elastographic image juxtaposed over the&#xD;
      2D image. The examination is underwent through right lobe, V-VIII intercostaly spaces,&#xD;
      between the anterior and middle axillary line, with the transducer towards the direction of&#xD;
      heart. The examination is performed while the pacient is holding its breath with constant&#xD;
      compression on the probe to avoid liver moving in a lateral direction due to heart movement.&#xD;
      The interest region (ROI) is inside the liver parenchyma, 1 cm under the liver capsule, in a&#xD;
      selected box of 1/2,5 cm. The aria of interest is chosen so that the 2D image is as clear as&#xD;
      possible, the large vessels avoided and the artifacts given by ribs and lungs. For each&#xD;
      patient is recording 3 different clips, that includes a stable elastography image of at least&#xD;
      5 heart beats. A sequence on the negative pick is selected, and a value for each film is&#xD;
      calculating. Everything is saved in the report and in data base, along with the 11 parameters&#xD;
      given by the Strain Histogram measurement software such as: mean relative strain value&#xD;
      (MEAN); standard deviation of relative strain value (SD); percentage of low strain area&#xD;
      (percentage of blue color area - %AREA); complexity of low strain area (calculated as&#xD;
      perimeter 2 /area - COMP); skewness (SKEW); kurtosis (KURT); contrast (CONT); entropy (ENT);&#xD;
      textural complexity, inverse difference moment (IDM); angular second moment (ASM);&#xD;
      Correlation (CORR) indicates the feature value of the texture directivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARFI- Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Technology [ACUSON S2000]. Scanning is performed with&#xD;
      a right intercostal approach, in the right liver lobe, segment V-VIII, 1-2 cm under the liver&#xD;
      capsule, with minimal scanning pressure applied by the operator, while the patients is asks&#xD;
      to stop normal breathing for a moment, in order to minimize breathing motion. The operator&#xD;
      selects the depth at which the liver elasticity is evaluated by placing a &quot;measuring box&quot; (10&#xD;
      mm long, 5 mm wide) in the desired area. The maximum depth at which ARFI measurements can be&#xD;
      performed is 8 cm. A total of 10 valid measurements performe in every patient and a median&#xD;
      value in m/s is calculate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy samples is takes via a right intercostal space from the right liver lobe with&#xD;
      direct sonographic guidance. Liver fibrosis stages is evaluate semiquantitatively according&#xD;
      to the METAVIR scoring system on an F0-F4 scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic performance of ARFI and RT-E for liver fibrosis will determine in terms of&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).&#xD;
