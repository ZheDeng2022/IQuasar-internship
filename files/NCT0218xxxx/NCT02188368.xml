  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good&#xD;
      and bad effects) of pomalidomide given as part of a combination therapy that include more&#xD;
      than just steroids to treat subjects with relapsed (subjects whose disease came back) or&#xD;
      refractory (subjects whose disease did not respond to past treatment) multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide (alone or in combination with dexamethasone) has been approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MM patients who have received&#xD;
      at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated&#xD;
      disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of their last therapy. However, the&#xD;
      use of pomalidomide in combination with other drugs used to treat MM, such as&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents and proteasome inhibitors, is currently being tested and is not&#xD;
      approved. Pomalidomide is in the same drug class as thalidomide and lenalidomide. Like&#xD;
      lenalidomide, pomalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere&#xD;
      with the development of small blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in&#xD;
      theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. The testing done with&#xD;
      pomalidomide thus far has shown that it is well-tolerated and effective for subjects with MM&#xD;
      both on its own and in combination with dexamethasone. Using another drug class, namely&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors, we have demonstrated that simply replacing a proteasome inhibitor with&#xD;
      another in an established anti-myeloma treatment regimen can frequently overcome resistance&#xD;
      regardless of the other agents that are part of the anti-myeloma regimen. Importantly, the&#xD;
      toxicity profile of the new combinations closely resembled that of the proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
      administered as a single agent. Based on this experience, we hypothesize that the replacement&#xD;
      of lenalidomide with pomalidomide will yield similar results in a similar relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      MM patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label and non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of pomalidomide as a replacement for lenalidomide among MM patients who have&#xD;
      failed lenalidomide-containing regimens that include more than steroids within 6 months of&#xD;
      their last dose of lenalidomide. Pomalidomide will replace lenalidomide in a combination&#xD;
      regimen containing an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide), anthracycline (doxorubicin or&#xD;
      PLD), proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib or carfilzomib) and/or a glucocorticosteroid&#xD;
      (prednisone, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). Pomalidomide will be administered on days&#xD;
      1-21 of a 28-day cycle, whereas other drugs (anthracyclines, proteasome inhibitors, steroids&#xD;
      or alkylating agents except melphalan) will be administered using the same schedule(s),&#xD;
      dose(s) and drug combination as the last lenalidomide-containing regimen that the patient&#xD;
      received and failed. This study will enroll patients resistant to a lenalidomide-containing&#xD;
      combination regimen as demonstrated by PD while being treated or that has relapsed within 6&#xD;
      months of the last dose of lenalidomide in their last lenalidomide-containing combination&#xD;
      regimen or while on lenalidomide or lenalidomide and steroid maintenance therapy. Forty-five&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3) a&#xD;
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of&#xD;
      eight 28-day treatment cycles, depending on the schedule of their last&#xD;
      lenalidomide-containing regimen. Subjects are to be treated to a maximum response (lowest&#xD;
      level of paraprotein) plus 1 additional cycle, without exceeding a total of 8 cycles, or&#xD;
      complete 8 cycles of therapy without progressing (PD).&#xD;
