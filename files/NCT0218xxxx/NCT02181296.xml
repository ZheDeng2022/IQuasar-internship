      The objective of our study is to compare the degree of phrenic nerve blockade after&#xD;
      interscalene block using 0.1% ropivacaine or 0.2% ropivacaine. Our hypothesis is that using a&#xD;
      lower concentration of local anesthetic will result in lesser degree of phrenic nerve block.&#xD;
      40 patients will be enrolled. Half will receive the block with 0.1% ropivacaine and half with&#xD;
      0.2% ropivacaine. Phrenic nerve and diaphragm function will be assessed by bedside spirometry&#xD;
      and ultrasound visualization.&#xD;

      Abstract Brief abstract (250 words or less) describing the study in language understandable&#xD;
      to a lay person. Include brief description of the purpose, target disease/condition if&#xD;
      applicable, key eligibility criteria, and main study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interscalene brachial plexus block is well-suited for surgical procedures of the shoulder&#xD;
      and proximal humerus. A well-established hazard of the interscalene block is ipsilateral&#xD;
      hemidiaphragm paresis in nearly 100% of patients secondary to phrenic nerve blockade. This&#xD;
      side effect is well-tolerated in most patients; however, extreme caution should be employed&#xD;
      in patients with pulmonary disease, who may experience acute pulmonary failure from&#xD;
      unilateral phrenic nerve blockade and resulting hemidiaphragm paresis. This study seeks to&#xD;
      determine if using a lower concentration of ropivacaine will result in less diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction and reduction in pulmonary function than a higher concentration of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups--Group A and Group B. Group A&#xD;
      will receive ultrasound-guided interscalene block with 20mL 0.1% ropivacaine in the&#xD;
      preoperative holding area prior to induction of general anesthesia. Group B will receive&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided interscalene block with 20mL 0.2% ropivacaine in the preoperative holding&#xD;
      area prior to induction of general anesthesia. The primary outcome variable is the degree of&#xD;
      phrenic nerve blockade as assessed by ultrasonographic evaluation of diaphragm function and&#xD;
      bedside spirometry (lung function testing). Secondary outcome variables will be assessed at&#xD;
      various time intervals. They include oxygen saturation measurements, oxygen requirements,&#xD;
      motor strength and sensation of blocked extremity, pain scores, opioid requirements, PACU&#xD;
      (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit)length of stay, and patient satisfaction and quality of recovery&#xD;
      scores. We hypothesize that interscalene brachial plexus blocks performed with a lower&#xD;
      concentration of ropivacaine will result in less pulmonary dysfunction without compromising&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Overall objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective: Compare the degree of phrenic nerve blockade after ultrasound-guided&#xD;
           interscalene block using either 0.1% ropivacaine or 0.2% ropivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis: Using a lower concentration of local anesthetic will result in lesser degree&#xD;
           of phrenic nerve blockade. Specifically, we hypothesize that outcome measures will be as&#xD;
           follows for patients receiving lower concentrations of ropivacaine: 1. Less dysfunction&#xD;
           of diaphragm movement, 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) values drop less in lower&#xD;
           concentration groups, 3. Less oxygen desaturation in PACU, 4. Less symptomatic shortness&#xD;
           of breath post-block, 5. Less need for supplemental oxygen in PACU, 6. Less unplanned&#xD;
           hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary Objective: Compare the analgesia efficacy as well as block duration between&#xD;
           0.1% and 0.2% ropivacaine. Assess the quality of recovery as well as overall&#xD;
           satisfaction of patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery under combined&#xD;
           regional/ general anesthesia. Also compare and evaluate the presence of other&#xD;
           complications that arise in the two groups Primary outcome variable(s) The primary&#xD;
           outcome variable is the degree of phrenic nerve blockade as assessed by ultrasonographic&#xD;
           evaluation of diaphragm function and bedside spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variable(s) Secondary outcome variables include oxygen saturation&#xD;
      measurements and oxygen requirements before block performance, 20 minutes after block&#xD;
      performance, and in the PACU; motor strength and sensation of affected extremity before block&#xD;
      performance, 20 minutes after block performance, and in the PACU; pain scores and opioid&#xD;
      requirements in the PACU and up to 72 hours post-operatively, PACU length of stay, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and quality of recovery scores 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Describe succinctly and clearly the past findings which justify the plan for this&#xD;
      project. A summary of the relevant literature in the area of interest and reports of previous&#xD;
      studies should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachial plexus, formed by the anterior roots of the spinal nerves C5- T1 innervates the&#xD;
      shoulder, axilla, and upper extremity. The roots each exit posterior to the vertebral artery&#xD;
      and travel laterally in the troughs of the corresponding cervical transverse processes and&#xD;
      finally join to form trunks in the posterior cervical triangle between the anterior and&#xD;
      middle scalene muscles. C5 and C6 join to form the superior trunk. C7 forms the middle trunk,&#xD;
      and C8 and T1 join to form the inferior trunk. The trunks pass over the first rib and under&#xD;
      the clavicle in association with the subclavian artery and branch into anterior and posterior&#xD;
      divisions. The posterior divisions join to form the posterior cord. The lateral cord is&#xD;
      formed by the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks. The medial cord is formed&#xD;
      by the anterior division of the inferior trunk. The cords descend into the axilla where each&#xD;
      has one major branch in addition to several minor branches before becoming a terminal nerve&#xD;
      of the upper extremity. Branches of the lateral and medial cord form the median nerve. A&#xD;
      branch off the lateral cord becomes the musculocutaneous nerve. The posterior cord becomes&#xD;
      the radial nerve and the axillary nerve. The medial cord forms the ulnar nerve as well as the&#xD;
      medial brachial and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves (1,2). Each peripheral nerve has its&#xD;
      own predictable cutaneous innervation pattern which can be mapped along the upper extremity;&#xD;
      furthermore knowledge of peripheral nerve and dermatomal innervation can help guide decisions&#xD;
      on which regional anesthetic approach to employ for a given surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachial plexus provides all of the motor and most of the sensory innervation to the&#xD;
      shoulder except for the most cephalad cutaneous portion of the shoulder which receives&#xD;
      sensory innervation from the supraclavicular nerves of the superficial cervical plexus, nerve&#xD;
      roots C3-C4. It is therefore easy to understand that complete surgical anesthesia of the&#xD;
      shoulder must employ a regional technique that blocks both the cervical and the brachial&#xD;
      plexuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachial plexus can be blocked along multiple anatomic levels depending on which area of&#xD;
      the upper extremity the procedurist wishes to anesthetize. The preferred approach depends on&#xD;
      the surgical site and the risk of complications. The interscalene brachial plexus block is&#xD;
      well-suited for surgical procedures of the shoulder and proximal humerus as it blocks the&#xD;
      cervical plexus (formed by the ventral rami of C1 through C4 spinal nerve roots) in addition&#xD;
      to the brachial plexus, effectively anesthetizing the skin of the shoulder. It is less suited&#xD;
      for surgery of the forearm or hand as incomplete blockade of the inferior trunk results in&#xD;
      incomplete analgesia of ulnar nerve distribution. A well-established hazard of the&#xD;
      interscalene block is ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paresis in nearly 100% of patients secondary&#xD;
      to phrenic nerve blockade from spread of local anesthetic around anterior scalene muscle.&#xD;
      This side effect is well-tolerated in the majority of patients; however extreme caution&#xD;
      should be employed in patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) or other&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, who may experience acute pulmonary failure from unilateral phrenic nerve&#xD;
      blockade and resulting hemidiaphragm paresis. Because the interscalene nerve block provides&#xD;
      excellent post-operative pain control for shoulder surgery and may preclude the use of&#xD;
      general endotracheal anesthesia which has its own inherent risks in patients with severe&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, it would be helpful to establish variables in regional technique that&#xD;
      affect phrenic nerve blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few publications analyzing the degree of phrenic nerve blockade and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function after interscalene brachial plexus block. A detailed review of these studies has&#xD;
      shown that both reduction in volume and concentration of local anesthetic are associated with&#xD;
      decreased reduction in pulmonary function tests and diaphragmatic dysfunction (3,4). There&#xD;
      are; however, still essential questions that remain unclear and improvements in study design&#xD;
      that can be made. Specifically, the study done by Al-Kaisy et al. in 1999 which showed that&#xD;
      lower concentrations of bupivacaine are associated with less reduction in pulmonary function&#xD;
      and less diaphragmatic dysfunction looked at only 11 healthy volunteers. These volunteers did&#xD;
      not have surgery after receiving blocks and therefore are not representative of a true&#xD;
      clinical situation. In addition, the sample size of 11 is too small to draw a conclusion.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study used a nerve stimulator-based approach to interscalene brachial&#xD;
      plexus blockade and therefore deposition of local anesthetic was not visualized. Without&#xD;
      direct visualization of local anesthetic deposition, it is impossible to say that all blocks&#xD;
      in this study were consistently performed. This lack of consistency between blocks could&#xD;
      contribute to variance in outcomes. An ultrasound-guided block approach is more effective at&#xD;
      maintaining consistency in block performance and may decrease variance in outcomes. Also&#xD;
      Al-Kaisy et al. used bupivacaine and our study will be using ropivacaine (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects enrolled in this research study are not considered to receive suboptimal&#xD;
      treatment. The standard of care for shoulder surgery is general anesthesia plus regional&#xD;
      anesthesia if regional anesthesia is not contraindicated. Regional anesthetics are performed&#xD;
      with different local anesthetics of different concentrations. In fact, if our study shows&#xD;
      that a lower concentration of ropivacaine achieves the same analgesic effect with less&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction, many more patients who were previously deemed to not be candidates&#xD;
      for interscalene blockade due to pulmonary disease, may receive the block and receive&#xD;
      superior post-operative pain control than they would have had without the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Phase* Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study is a prospective, randomized, double blinded study with 40 patients.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups--Group A and Group B. Group A will receive&#xD;
      interscalene block with 20mL 0.1% ropivacaine in the preoperative holding area prior to&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia and Group B will receive interscalene block with 20mL 0.2%&#xD;
      ropivacaine in the preoperative holding area prior to induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Interscalene blocks will be performed under ultrasound guidance by attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologists who are experienced in regional anesthesia or by resident physicians under&#xD;
      the direct supervision of attending anesthesiologists with experience in regional anesthesia.&#xD;
      They will be performed in accordance with standard procedure at Penn Presbyterian Medical&#xD;
      Center and ambulatory surgery center. The syringes of both concentrations of ropivacaine will&#xD;
      be supplied by the research investigational pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration We plan to begin enrollment in March 2014. The enrollment of all subjects is&#xD;
      projected to be completed in December 2014 with data analysis to follow. The study is&#xD;
      expected to be completed by June 2015. The length of participation for each subject will be&#xD;
      up to 72 hours in the post-operative period.&#xD;
