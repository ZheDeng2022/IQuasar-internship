  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis claims over 37,000 lives in the United Kingdom each year- more than lung cancer, and&#xD;
      more than breast cancer, bowel cancer and HIV/AIDS combined. Less than two-thirds of patients&#xD;
      who develop sepsis will survive. Sepsis can affect a person of any age, social background,&#xD;
      and can strike irrespective of underlying medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important element in improving the care of patient with sepsis is early identification and&#xD;
      early intervention, both of which have been shown to improve outcomes. Physiological&#xD;
      deterioration often precedes clinical deterioration as patients develop critical illness.&#xD;
      Recognition of this has led to the development of Early Warning Score (EWS) systems which&#xD;
      allow earlier identification of physiological deterioration. By assigning numerical values to&#xD;
      various physiological parameters, a composite score can be assigned to a patient, allowing&#xD;
      early identification of patients who are at risk of critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EWS were initially developed to assist in the management of patients in the general ward&#xD;
      setting. A recent study has shown that an increased EWS on arrival at the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) is associated with higher odds of adverse outcome amongst patients with&#xD;
      sepsis. Consequently, the use of EWS could facilitate patient pathways to ensure triage to a&#xD;
      high acuity area of the ED and senior clinician involvement at an early stage. The use of a&#xD;
      standard single National EWS (NEWS) across the National Health Service in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      has been recommended to improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEWS also lends itself to extension to pre-hospital care and ambulance services. Most&#xD;
      ambulance services routinely collect the physiological data required to calculate a NEWS&#xD;
      score and indeed some ambulance services have incorporated this into electronic patient&#xD;
      record forms (ePRF). An agreed NEWS score of greater than a specific level could be used as a&#xD;
      trigger for ambulance service pre-alert of a receiving ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of care measurement of lactate has also been shown to be feasible in the ED. Serum&#xD;
      lactate is recognised as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis and there may be&#xD;
      potential for combining NEWS systems and point of care to further improve diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      for patients at risk of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to apply the use of early warning scores and point of care testing to a&#xD;
      cohort of all ambulance patients to assess the feasibility and utility of this approach.&#xD;

      Study Question or Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are NEWS score, Sepsis Screening and Lactate measurement predictors of outcome in unselected&#xD;
      out of hospital patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the following, alone or in combination, are predictors of outcome,&#xD;
      namely in-hospital mortality within 24 hours or 30 days or ICU admission within two days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a single prehospital NEWS performed on arrival of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prehospital Sepsis screening (SIRS criteria and evidence of infection) on arrival of the&#xD;
           SAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prehospital Point of Care Lactate performed when NEWS is greater than or equal to 4 or&#xD;
           when Sepsis is present&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHS Scotland is committed to improving the outcome of patients with Sepsis and the&#xD;
      Deteriorating Patient as evidenced by their inclusion in the Scottish Patient Safety&#xD;
      Programme. An important element in improving the care of Sepsis and the deteriorating patient&#xD;
      is early identification and early intervention, both of which have been shown to improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological deterioration often precedes clinical deterioration as patients develop&#xD;
      critical illness. Recognition of this has led to the development of Early Warning Scoring&#xD;
      (EWS) systems, which allow earlier identification of physiological deterioration. By&#xD;
      assigning numerical values to various physiological parameters, a composite score can be&#xD;
      assigned to a patient, allowing early identification of patients who are at risk of critical&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EWS were initially established to assist in the management of patients in the general ward&#xD;
      setting. A recent study has shown that an increased EWS on arrival at the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) is associated with higher odds of adverse outcome amongst patients with&#xD;
      sepsis. Consequently, the use of EWS could facilitate patient pathways to ensure triage to a&#xD;
      high acuity area of the ED and senior clinician involvement at an early stage. The use of a&#xD;
      standard single National EWS (NEWS) across the National Health Service (NHS) in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom has been recommended to improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEWS also lends itself to extension to prehospital care and ambulance services. Most&#xD;
      ambulance services routinely collect the physiological data required to calculate a NEWS&#xD;
      score and indeed some ambulance services have incorporated this into electronic patient&#xD;
      report forms (ePRF). The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has this in place. An agreed NEWS&#xD;
      score of greater than a specific level could be used as a trigger for ambulance service&#xD;
      pre-alert of a receiving ED. However controversy exists as to whether NEWS is valid in the&#xD;
      prehospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of care lactate testing has also been shown to be feasible in the ED. Measurement of in&#xD;
      hospital serum lactate is recognised as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis and&#xD;
      trauma and there may be potential for combining NEWS systems and point of care to further&#xD;
      improve diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk of adverse outcomes. Prehospital Point of&#xD;
      care lactate testing has also shown some promise as a predictor of outcome in trauma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have focused on using early warning scores and point of care lactate on&#xD;
      specific patient groups. Identification of conditions such as sepsis can be challenging,&#xD;
      particularly in the prehospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to apply the use of early warning scores and point of care testing to a&#xD;
      cohort of all ambulance patients to assess the feasibility and utility of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Five areas within NHS Scotland have been identified and each area will have two&#xD;
      paramedic crews taking part in the study. The five areas include NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde&#xD;
      (Royal Alexandra Hospital), NHS Dumfries &amp; Galloway (Dumfries &amp; Galloway Royal Infirmary),&#xD;
      NHS Fife (Victoria Hospital), NHS Lothian (Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh) and NHS Western&#xD;
      Isles (Western Isles Hospital). These areas have been chosen to represent the spectrum of&#xD;
      clinical settings in NHS Scotland from dense urban areas to remote and rural area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posters will be placed in all ambulances in the five clinical areas informing patients that&#xD;
      anonymised data is being collected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will run for a 12-month period. The design is a prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomised, 3 staged interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      No change from current practice. Each Paramedic crew routinely documents patient observations&#xD;
      in an electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter. These physiological&#xD;
      parameters will be electronically captured. The data will be used to calculate NEWS and&#xD;
      screen for Sepsis (2 or more modified SIRS criteria [signs of systemic inflammation] and&#xD;
      suspicion of infection) by the study investigators. An estimate will be made of the time of&#xD;
      completion of the ePRF in relation to patient transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) contains seven physiological parameters, each of&#xD;
      which is assigned a value of between 0 and 3 (0 and 2 for supplemental oxygen). The score for&#xD;
      each parameter is summed to calculate the NEWS which may range between 0 and 20; the higher&#xD;
      the score the greater the deviation from normality. The NEWS is based on previous similar&#xD;
      scoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is defined as the presence of SIRS criteria with the suspicion of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ten crews will undertake implementation of NEWS and Sepsis Screening. Prior to this stage&#xD;
      of the study, each crew will attend a half day educational session covering the rationale for&#xD;
      the use of NEWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Paramedic crew will continue to routinely document patient observations in an electronic&#xD;
      Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter. These physiological parameters will be&#xD;
      used to calculate NEWS and screen for Sepsis (2 or more modified SIRS criteria and suspicion&#xD;
      of infection). The NEWS will be available to the paramedic crew.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If NEWS is greater than or equal to 4 or the patient screens positive for Sepsis, the&#xD;
      patients transfer will be as per normal protocol but receiving ED staff will receive the&#xD;
      information about NEWS score and Sepsis screening as part of a structured handover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 ( 4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ten crews will undertake Point of Care Lactate measurement when NEWS ≥ 4 or when the&#xD;
      patient screens positive for Sepsis. Each Paramedic crew will continue to routinely document&#xD;
      patient observations in an electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter.&#xD;
      These physiological parameters will be used to calculate NEWS and screen for Sepsis (2 or&#xD;
      more modified SIRS criteria and suspicion of infection). If NEWS is greater than or equal to&#xD;
      4 or the patient screens positive for Sepsis, then a Lactate will be measured on the CG4+&#xD;
      i-STAT cartridge. The lactate level, along with the NEWS score and sepsis screening, will be&#xD;
      given to the receiving ED staff as part of a structured handover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each crew will undergo a further half day educational session covering the use of the point&#xD;
      of care lactate meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within all NHS Scotland hospitals, health care practitioners currently screen for sepsis when&#xD;
      NEWS is ≥ 4, and are measuring lactate if there is a positive screen for sepsis. Lactate&#xD;
      point of care measurement is currently being piloted in the prehospital setting in Forth&#xD;
      Valley Health Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-STAT handheld analyser that will be used in this study is CE marked, and has undergone&#xD;
      performance verification against GEM Premier 400 and ROCHE OMNI S blood gas analysers. It is&#xD;
      currently used clinically within NHSGG&amp;C health board, several other Scottish health boards&#xD;
      and the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service (EMRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 12-month duration of the study paramedic crews will continue to work within Scottish&#xD;
      Ambulance Service protocols and under the principles of UK Ambulance Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines, including any changes made to SAS protocols during this time. Any changes will be&#xD;
      noted by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection A researcher will obtain data for all patients in the study from the ePRF&#xD;
      records via the SAS Data Warehouse. This data will be stored as a spreadsheet file in&#xD;
      accordance with NHS data protection guidance. The researcher will then match this data with&#xD;
      the Wardwatcher system at the receiving Intensive Care Units regarding ICU admission and ICU&#xD;
      mortality. Data will be sought from &lt;hospital information systems&gt; at each receiving site&#xD;
      regarding 30 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linked data will be anonymised and given a unique identifier. The anonymised data will then&#xD;
      be analysed by an independent statistician, as described in the analysis plan.&#xD;
