    <textblock>
      Smoking during pregnancy adversely affects the health of the mother and her developing baby.&#xD;
      Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications,&#xD;
      preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse&#xD;
      effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of&#xD;
      the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low&#xD;
      birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately,&#xD;
      smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a&#xD;
      near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first&#xD;
      prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no&#xD;
      carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking.&#xD;
      Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for&#xD;
      that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of&#xD;
      Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion&#xD;
      treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects.&#xD;
      Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater&#xD;
      positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects. These finding will&#xD;
      provide information on the safety and efficacy of bupropion treat for smoking cessation in&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A. General Design: This is a phase II, prospective, placebo-controlled randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of the efficacy and safety of bupropion in combination with behavioral counseling for&#xD;
      smoking cessation during pregnancy. Pregnant smokers (N=360) will receive bupropion or&#xD;
      placebo treatment for 10 weeks, under strict double-blind conditions, with 3 post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up sessions: 2 and 6 weeks postpartum (with counseling to prevent relapse or encourage&#xD;
      a repeat quit attempt) and monitoring of the persistence of treatment effects at 24 weeks&#xD;
      post-quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Recruitment: We will distribute IRB (Institutional Review Board)-approved brochures and&#xD;
      posters to recruit pregnant women who smoke and wish to quit smoking through participation in&#xD;
      the trial. At Penn Medicine sites, we will access the hospitals' EPIC computer programs to&#xD;
      identify pregnant smokers receiving prenatal care and, working with their obstetrician,&#xD;
      invite them to consider study participation. We will conduct a brief screening interview over&#xD;
      the phone or in-person at the participant's obstetrics clinic to assess study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Prospective participants who appear to meet eligibility criteria for the study will&#xD;
      be scheduled for an in-person Informed Consent and Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Screening Visit: Participants will read and sign the informed consent form, after all of&#xD;
      their questions have been answered. Participants will then be asked to provide the&#xD;
      researchers with information to determine whether they are eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      study. On this visit, participants will be interviewed for about an hour. This interview will&#xD;
      include questions about medical and pregnancy history, and any mood or other symptoms and&#xD;
      determine the baby's date of delivery. We will also ask about any past or current use of&#xD;
      alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: Baseline Visit: This in-person visit will be completed within 30 days of the screening&#xD;
      visit and will last approximately 90 minutes. At the visit, we will measure heart rate and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires by telephone and in person. We will take a blood sample (3 tubes,&#xD;
      enough to fill 1.5 tablespoons) to be used to conduct genetic testing and to measure the&#xD;
      body's ability to break down nicotine, which is contained in cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit participants will receive the first of six counseling sessions in the study.&#xD;
      This first, &quot;pre-quit&quot; counseling session will last 30 minutes and will help to prepare them&#xD;
      to quit smoking. They will be given study medication at this visit and will be instructed to&#xD;
      begin taking it the following morning. They will be asked to identify a quit date within a&#xD;
      week of beginning the study medication. They will start the study medication by taking one&#xD;
      capsule (150 mg/day or placebo, a harmless, inactive substance) each morning for the first 3&#xD;
      days and then one capsule each morning and each evening (150 mg twice daily) for the&#xD;
      remainder of the 10-week study treatment period. At this visit, and at every visit while&#xD;
      taking the study medication, we will record any side effects that may have been experienced&#xD;
      from the study medication. We will also ask participants to return all study medication that&#xD;
      they have not taken and the study medication bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after the Baseline Visit, the participants will begin to receive two daily text&#xD;
      messages. The first message of the day (in the morning) will provide information on the&#xD;
      expected development based on the baby's age, accompanied by a reminder to take the study&#xD;
      medication. The second message of the day (in the evening) will ask the participants whether&#xD;
      they took all of their study medication that day. They'll be asked to text back indicating&#xD;
      that they received the message (in the morning) and whether they took the medication that day&#xD;
      (in the evening). We will ask them which times they would like to receive the text messages&#xD;
      each day. Although the information that they provide will help us to keep track of their&#xD;
      participation, the inbox for our texting center is not monitored, so we will direct them to&#xD;
      call our study staff to speak with them directly, rather than texting them if they have any&#xD;
      study-related questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit C: Quit Date Visit: The scheduled quit date visit will occur approximately one week&#xD;
      after the baseline visit and will last approximately 45 minutes. During this visit, we will&#xD;
      measure the participants' heart rate and ask them to blow into an instrument that measures a&#xD;
      chemical (carbon monoxide) that is in tobacco smoke. The study nurse will collect any&#xD;
      medication not taken and the study medication bottle. The participants will receive a&#xD;
      four-week supply of study medication and a study nurse will ask them about any study&#xD;
      medication side effects that they may have experienced since starting the study. They will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete some questionnaires and will receive 20 minutes of &quot;quit-day&quot;&#xD;
      counseling, which will help them to identify things that could cause them to return to&#xD;
      smoking and to develop a plan to avoid tempting situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit D: Week 3: This visit will occur by telephone and will last approximately 25 minutes,&#xD;
      during which time the participants will be asked to complete questionnaires over the&#xD;
      telephone. They will be asked about their cigarette use since the last visit and any&#xD;
      medication side effects they may have experienced. They will also receive 10 minutes of&#xD;
      counseling by phone to help them avoid smoking or, if they need to, set another quit date to&#xD;
      try again to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit E: Week 5: This in-person visit will last approximately 30 minutes. The participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete some questionnaires and be interviewed about their cigarette use&#xD;
      since the last visit. We will measure their heart rate and they will be asked to blow into an&#xD;
      instrument that measures a chemical (carbon monoxide) that is in tobacco smoke. They will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a blood sample (2 tubes, enough to fill 1 tablespoon) to be used to measure&#xD;
      the concentration of study medication in the blood. The study nurse will collect any&#xD;
      medication that the participants have left as well as the study medication bottle. They will&#xD;
      receive a five-week supply of study medication and a study nurse will ask them about any&#xD;
      study medication side effects that they may have experienced since starting the study. They&#xD;
      will also receive 10 minutes of counseling to help they avoid smoking or, if needed, set&#xD;
      another quit date to try quitting again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit F: Week 7: This telephone visit will last approximately 15 minutes. The participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete some questionnaires. They will also be asked about their cigarette&#xD;
      use since the last visit and any medication side effects they may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit G: Endpoint visit: This in-person visit will last approximately 25 minutes. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and about their cigarette use since the&#xD;
      last visit. During the visit we will measure their heart rate and they will be asked to blow&#xD;
      into an instrument that measures a chemical (carbon monoxide) that is in tobacco smoke. The&#xD;
      study nurse will collect any medication that they had not taken and the study medication&#xD;
      bottle. The study nurse will ask them about any study medication side effects that they may&#xD;
      have experienced since starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit H: Week 24 after the Quit Date: About six months after the participants started&#xD;
      treatment, they will be contacted by telephone. During this phone call, a research technician&#xD;
      will complete several questionnaires with them, similar to those they completed previously.&#xD;
      Some participants will be asked to come back to the center following this interview to&#xD;
      provide carbon monoxide breath samples as they did previously. Approximately two weeks prior&#xD;
      to the phone call we may send a reminder letter that the phone visit is coming up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits I and J: 2 and 6 weeks after delivery: The last two sessions will be held by telephone&#xD;
      after the birth of the baby. The participants will be asked to complete several&#xD;
      questionnaires, similar to those completed previously. They will also receive 10 minutes of&#xD;
      counseling over the phone.&#xD;

          <description>Number of cigarettes smoke each day over the past 30 days was collected using the Timeline Follow-back method, combined with the exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. Abstinence was self-reported and confirmed by a CO concentration &lt;8 parts per million (ppm). A CO of 8 ppm or greater indicates cigarettes smoked where smoked with higher CO ppm concentration indicates that a greater number of cigarettes were smoked. Participants were assumed to be smoking if they did not provide self-report data or a breath sample at the time of measurement.</description>
