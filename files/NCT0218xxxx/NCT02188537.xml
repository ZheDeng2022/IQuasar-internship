      Trial objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To decide whether the addition of nelfinavir to the approved antimyeloma therapy with&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone has sufficient activity in proteasome inhibitor-resistant&#xD;
      myeloma patients to merit further clinical investigation in a prospective controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect myeloma cell samples from proteasome inhibitor-resistant myeloma patients for the&#xD;
      assessment of the biology of proteasome inhibitor resistance and the identification of&#xD;
      predictive markers for response to nelfinavir-based antimyeloma therapy.&#xD;

      predictive markers for response to nelfinavir-based antimyeloma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rate based on best response observed during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with multiple myeloma based on standard IMWG criteria, who have received at&#xD;
           least one prior line of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously exposed to or intolerant to at least one immunomodulatory drug (IMID)&#xD;
           (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refractory to their most recent proteasome inhibitor-containing regimen or progressed&#xD;
           during or within 60 days after proteasome inhibitor-containing therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A bortezomib-based therapy in agreement with Swissmedic approval is indicated and&#xD;
           intended&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease based on serum paraprotein or free light chain levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of myeloma within the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No significant neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concomitant use of listed drugs which cannot be replaced or paused during trial&#xD;
           treatment (Amiodarone, Pimozide, quinidine and its derivatives, ergot derivatives&#xD;
           (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine), triazolam, midazolam,&#xD;
           sildenafil, alfuzosin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Schedule and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of patients is planned to start in Q3 2014 and will stop after the inclusion of&#xD;
      34 evaluable patients, which is expected in Q1 2016. End of trial treatment is expected for&#xD;
      Q3 2016. Trial termination (last patient last visit) is expected to be in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual may be interrupted or the trial may be stopped early based on the results of an&#xD;
      interim analysis or if new scientific data become available which change assessment of&#xD;
      risk/benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial nelfinavir is the IMP. Bortezomib (VelcadeÂ®) and dexamethasone are not&#xD;
      investigational drugs in the context of this trial, but will be administered as a background&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial treatment is designed as an &quot;add-on&quot; therapy, where nelfinavir is added to the&#xD;
      approved bortezomib therapy. Bortezomib and dexamethasone background treatment will be given&#xD;
      in the approved dose and schedule (either i.v. or s.c), as per Swissmedic label and&#xD;
      international therapeutic standard, in combination with 2500 mg Nelfinavir bid p.o. day 1-14&#xD;
      for 6 cycles of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the trial treatment Clinical examination; blood analyses; imaging investigations if&#xD;
      applicable (e.g. bone X-ray or computer tomography, MRI); electrocardiogram; evaluation of&#xD;
      the quality of life with a patient's questionnaire; pregnancy test for women in child-bearing&#xD;
      age; optional: a bone marrow sample is taken for translational research. Aside from the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, the pregnancy test and the quality of life questionnaire, all the&#xD;
      pre-treatment assessments performed within the frame of the trial are also routinely&#xD;
      performed for the medical care of patients with multiple myeloma outside of a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial treatment Clinical examination and blood analyses for the control of safety&#xD;
      laboratory parameters; evaluation of the quality of life with a patient's questionnaire will&#xD;
      be performed after completion of 3 cycles of therapy. Besides the quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, all assessments would also be performed routinely outside of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the trial treatment Clinical examination and blood analyses for the control of safety&#xD;
      laboratory parameters; these investigations will be performed within 1 month after treatment&#xD;
      end, premature interruption or before the administration of a new antimyeloma therapy. These&#xD;
      assessments are routinely done also outside of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Simon's two-stage design will be used. A response rate of 15% or less is considered&#xD;
      uninteresting and 35% or higher is promising. The trial will be stopped early if the&#xD;
      treatment appears unpromising at the end of the first stage. To allow patient accrual while&#xD;
      waiting for the stage-1 results, the design is modified according to Herndon's approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 34 patients are required with&#xD;
      10 patients in the first stage and 24 patients in the second stage.&#xD;
