  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to determine the feasibility and safety of stem cell&#xD;
      collection and gamma-globin gene transfer, and success of gene correction in subjects with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of gene transfer using ARU-1801&#xD;
      (CD34+ cells transduced with the gamma-globin lentiviral vector). Gene transfer will occur&#xD;
      ex-vivo into CD34+ enriched human bone marrow or plerixafor-mobilized peripheral blood&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) collected from subjects with severe sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo reduced intensity chemotherapy conditioning with single-dose melphalan&#xD;
      to facilitate engraftment of ex-vivo ARU-1801 via IV infusion. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      study site at regular intervals for follow-up for 2 years after the ARU-1801 infusion. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinical study will be initiated, in&#xD;
      which all subjects completing the 2 year study visit will be asked to consent and enroll, and&#xD;
      will followed for a further 13 years.&#xD;
