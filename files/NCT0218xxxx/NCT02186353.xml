  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study will be to examine the effects of consuming whole&#xD;
      grains, differing in the degree of processing, on insulin sensitivity and other&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors. The overall aim will be to assess feasibility of the test diets&#xD;
      and to generate preliminary data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators will access feasibility and generate preliminary data&#xD;
      to systematically address a major question in nutrition: Does food processing, specifically&#xD;
      with regard to whole grains (WGs), have an independent effect on outcomes related to diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease? Whole grains are defined as intact, ground, cracked, or flaked&#xD;
      caryopsis (kernel or seed), where the principal components (bran, endosperm, germ) are&#xD;
      present in the same proportion as the intact caryopsis. In contrast, refined grains (RGs) are&#xD;
      milled to remove the bran and germ, leaving only the endosperm and resulting in lower fiber,&#xD;
      iron, and many B vitamins. Several previous studies have shown that consumption of WGs vs.&#xD;
      RGs improves insulin sensitivity and decreases risk for chronic disease. However, the effects&#xD;
      of consuming WGs may differ depending on degree of processing. While whole grain products&#xD;
      contain the three components of the kernel, we hypothesize that consuming the food containing&#xD;
      the least processed (and least pulverized) kernels may have beneficial effects on metabolism&#xD;
      that decrease disease risk through plausible physiological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a partial feeding study using a randomized 3-period crossover&#xD;
      design to compare the effects of 1) intact or minimally processed whole grains, 2) highly&#xD;
      processed whole grains, and 3) refined grains, each fed for 4 weeks. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be change in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include hepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, components of the metabolic syndrome and other cardiometabolic risk factors,&#xD;
      arterial stiffness, gut microbiome and fecal short chain fatty acids, and ratings of hunger,&#xD;
      satiation, palatability, and acceptability (gastrointestinal symptoms).&#xD;
