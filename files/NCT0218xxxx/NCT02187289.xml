  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema (significant arm swelling on the surgical side) is one of the most common&#xD;
      complications following treatment for breast cancer. The impact of lymphedema is profound,&#xD;
      resulting in negative self image, increased anxiety and poorer quality of life. In time,&#xD;
      lymphedema can result in recurrent infections in the arm, functional impairment and pain.&#xD;
      Approximately 21% of women who undergo breast cancer treatment develop lymphedema.&#xD;
      Unfortunately this is a life-time condition which tends to worsen over time. Currently,&#xD;
      treatment consists of intensive physiotherapy, meant to reduce the arm volume followed by the&#xD;
      wearing of compression sleeves during the day for maintenance. This study hopes to show that&#xD;
      the addition of night-time compression creates a measurable reduction in arm volume and that&#xD;
      adding night-time compression to the standard care (daytime compression only) will produce&#xD;
      improvements in quality of life for breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a lifetime condition which tends to worsen over time, affecting roughly 21% of&#xD;
      of treated breast cancer patients. An initial intensive rehabilitative treatment is usually&#xD;
      prescribed to reduce the lymphedema, followed by a maintenance program using compression&#xD;
      sleeves (Standard Care). However, compression sleeves are prescribed for daytime use only due&#xD;
      to the potential tourniquet effect of the sleeve rolling up or bunching during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression Bandages (short stretch, low elasticity) can be used at night but proper&#xD;
      application takes 20-30 minutes, require skill to apply properly and are costly. Various&#xD;
      types of night-compression system garments (NCSGs) have been designed as alternatives to&#xD;
      Compression Bandages (CB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether the addition of night-time compression (using CB or NCSG) to standard care&#xD;
           (daytime compression only) improves control of arm lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the use of NCSGs result in better outcomes in quality of life, sleep, treatment&#xD;
           compliance and patient independence than use of Compression Bandages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard care plus the addition of NCSG will provide statistically significant&#xD;
           improvement in management of arm lymphedema volume compared to standard care alone at 12&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard care plus the addition of Compression Bandages will provide statistically&#xD;
           significant improved management of arm lymphedema volume compared to standard care alone&#xD;
           at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard care plus the addition of NCSG will provide statistically significant benefit&#xD;
           in quality of life, sleep and self-efficacy over standard care plus Compression&#xD;
           Bandaging at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Standard care weeks 1 - 12 Group 2: Standard care plus night-time Compression&#xD;
      Bandaging weeks 1 - 12 Group 3: Standard care plus night-time use of NCSG weeks 1 - 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three groups will adopt NCSG use after the 12 week assessments have been done (weeks 13 -&#xD;
      24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size = 40 participants per group, for a total of 120 patients at three sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Standard, CB or NCSG using a secure&#xD;
      central randomization service administered by the Clinical Trials Unit of the Cross Cancer&#xD;
      Institute. Women enrolled in the study will be stratified by accruing site and by lymphedema&#xD;
      severity (i.e. mild versus moderate lymphedema as per the classification criteria of the&#xD;
      International Society of Lymphology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm volume (by Perometer) and arm fluid (by Bioimpedance analysis) will be measured and&#xD;
      compared to that of the unaffected arm. BIA measures the impedance of flow from a low&#xD;
      alternating electrical current that is applied to the body through a skin electrode. BIA&#xD;
      records impedance values for each limb and provides an index that correlates with&#xD;
      quantitative measurements of volume increase in limb size seen in the arm with lymphedema.&#xD;
      This measurement will provide information on extracellular fluid changes that complements the&#xD;
      data on arm lymphedema volume. An Independent Assessor unaware of treatment allocation&#xD;
      (blinded) will perform the measurements of arm volume using the perometer, bioimpedance&#xD;
      analysis, and body weight at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. The duration of the primary&#xD;
      intervention will be 12 weeks. Following the 12-week intervention period, participants in the&#xD;
      CB and standard care groups will be measured for a NCSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period after the intervention (weeks 13 to 24) will follow a longitudinal&#xD;
      observational design and provide an opportunity to examine factors related to long-term&#xD;
      adherence to night-time compression. Lymphedema specific questionnaires and subject diary&#xD;
      will be completed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks to assess subject's Quality of Life, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, self-efficacy and treatment adherence.&#xD;
