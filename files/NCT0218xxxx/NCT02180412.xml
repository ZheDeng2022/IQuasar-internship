  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide high quality evidence for the effectiveness and safety of hemin&#xD;
      (PanhematinTM , Recordati) for treatment of acute attacks of porphyria. These types of&#xD;
      studies have not been done before with either PanhematinTM or the hemin preparation available&#xD;
      in Europe (NormosangTM, Orphan Europe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two treatment groups in this study. One group will be treated with PanhematinTM&#xD;
      plus glucose, and the other group will be treated with glucose plus an inactive salt solution&#xD;
      (called a &quot;placebo&quot;). To avoid prejudice, the treatment given to each participant will be&#xD;
      blinded (meaning the participants and most of the hospital staff will not know which&#xD;
      treatment the participant will receive) and randomized (meaning participants will have an&#xD;
      equal chance of receiving either treatment, like the flip of a coin). A placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      randomized study is the standard method used to prove treatments are effective and safe.&#xD;
      PanhematinTM and glucose will be given in the same manner as is usual for treating an attack&#xD;
      of porphyria. For participants who are chosen to receive the placebo, their treatment will be&#xD;
      switched to real PanhematinTM at any time if their symptoms do not improve. This is called&#xD;
      &quot;rescue&quot; treatment, and assures that they study is safe and patients who need hemin will&#xD;
      receive it. Treatment with hemin will be for 4 days, or longer if needed. Since the study&#xD;
      treatment is started as soon as possible after symptoms appear, there will be very little&#xD;
      delay in providing hemin to those who need it. Funding Source - Office of Orphan Products&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute symptoms (7 days duration or less to time of enrollment) such as abdominal, back&#xD;
             and/or limb pain, diagnosed by the investigator as caused by porphyria after initial&#xD;
             evaluation has excluded other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of acute porphyria documented by a substantial increase in urinary or serum&#xD;
             porphobilinogen (PBG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type of acute porphyria confirmed by additional testing (in addition to increased&#xD;
             PBG), which may be completed before or after treatment begins using pretreatment&#xD;
             samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For acute intermittent porphyria (AIP): Normal or only slight increases in plasma and&#xD;
             fecal porphyrins. Most (~90 percent) will have deficient activity of erythrocyte&#xD;
             porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and almost all (&gt;95 percent) will have a&#xD;
             demonstrable disease-causing PBGD mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For hereditary coproporphyria (HCP): Substantial increases in fecal porphyrins (almost&#xD;
             entirely coproporphyrin III). In the absence of skin photosensitivity, most will have&#xD;
             normal or only slight increases in plasma porphyrins. Almost all (&gt;95 percent) will&#xD;
             have a demonstrable disease-causing coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For variegate porphyria (VP): Substantial increases in fecal porphyrins (mostly&#xD;
             coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin), increased plasma total porphyrins and a&#xD;
             fluorescence emission maximum of diluted plasma at neutral pH near 626 nm. Almost all&#xD;
             (~95 percent) will have a demonstrable disease-causing protoporphyrinogen oxidase&#xD;
             (PPO) mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms such as abdominal, back or limb pain are explained by another condition, as&#xD;
             judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy with hemin within 7 days prior to enrollment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected allergy to Panhematinâ„¢ or related products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting coagulation defect or concurrent treatment with an anticoagulant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously documented renal impairment defined as a serum creatinine above 1.7 mg/dL&#xD;
             or 150 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which might increase the risk of glucose infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart failure, significant chronic anemia or any disease or condition that the&#xD;
             investigator judges would lead to an unacceptable risk to the patient or interfere&#xD;
             with the successful collection of date for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous randomization in this trial&#xD;
