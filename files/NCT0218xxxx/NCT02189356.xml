    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise programs on pregnant women with&#xD;
      pregnancy-related Low Back and Pelvic Pain (LBPP). Hypotheses of the study were: 1) Exercise&#xD;
      programs relieve the intensity of LBPP in pregnant women and 2) Exercise programs promote&#xD;
      functional capacity for pregnant women with LBPP.&#xD;

      Design The study was a prospective randomized trial with a control group (standard care&#xD;
      group) and an intervention group, using a repeated measures design. Forty-eight pregnant&#xD;
      participants with pregnancy-related LBPP were included in the control group and 48 pregnant&#xD;
      participants with pregnancy-related LBPP were included in the intervention (exercise) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants This research was performed between December 2011 and May 2012 at the Department&#xD;
      of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gulhane Military Medical Education and Research Hospital in&#xD;
      Ankara, Turkey. Approximately 3,000 births occur annually at this clinic. Participants were&#xD;
      pregnant women who presented to the obstetrics department for routine pregnancy examinations,&#xD;
      had pregnancy-related LBPP and fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria of&#xD;
      the research were determined following a literature review. The eligibility criteria were;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age over 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to read and write in Turkish,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteering to participate in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being between 20-35 weeks of gestation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having no complications for any reason during the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No diagnosis of low back and/or pelvic disease prior to pregnancy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not performing exercise for half an hour at least three days a week during pregnancy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not using analgesics for low back and pelvis pain,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not using other methods for the treatment low back and pelvic pain,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Giving birth before the completion of the study Interventions Participants diagnosed&#xD;
           with pregnancy-related LBPP by a doctor and with no medical obstacles to participation&#xD;
           in the study were directed to nurse. The nurse invited the pregnant women to the&#xD;
           research room for a discussion about low back and pelvic pain. After the eligibility&#xD;
           criteria of the pregnant women were reviewed, initial assessments were completed and the&#xD;
           participants were subsequently randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse gave health counseling to the participants in the intervention group about the&#xD;
      prevention of pregnancy-related LBPP and initiated an exercise program that included exercise&#xD;
      training. The health counseling and exercise training booklets provided were prepared based&#xD;
      on the literature. Each counseling session lasted an average of 45 minutes. Sessions were&#xD;
      completed in a positive education atmosphere and were face-to-face as consistent with the&#xD;
      principles of adult education. The structure and function of the vertebrae, physical changes&#xD;
      occurring during pregnancy, causes of pregnancy-related LBPP, the problems that the pain&#xD;
      causes, methods of pain management, correct posture development, body mechanics during&#xD;
      activities of daily life and ergonomics were explained to the pregnant women using&#xD;
      illustrated booklets given during the trainings. During the counseling, the nurse received&#xD;
      information from the participants regarding their daily activities and educated the&#xD;
      participants about the behaviors that might damage the low back and pelvic regions.&#xD;
      Participants were given practical demonstrations of how to move and how to protect the low&#xD;
      back and pelvic regions during daily life. For example, the nurse demonstrated how to&#xD;
      retrieve an object from the ground, how to reach shelves, how to sit and stand up and how to&#xD;
      lie down, guiding the participants through these activities as well. The participants'&#xD;
      questions were answered, and they were given educational booklets. Following the health&#xD;
      consultation, exercise education was given. The participants were given illustrated booklets&#xD;
      explaining the effects of pregnancy exercises on maternal and fetal health, situations that&#xD;
      need attention before starting and during exercises, signs of danger, what should be done in&#xD;
      potentially dangerous situations, how to breathe during exercise and the method, frequency&#xD;
      and amount of the exercise. The exercises given to the intervention group were based on the&#xD;
      guidelines from &quot;Exercise in Pregnancy&quot; by the Royal College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the guidelines from &quot;Pregnancy and Exercise&quot; by Hacettepe&#xD;
      University in Turkey. It was emphasized that pregnant women should complete their exercises&#xD;
      as shown at least three days a week for 30 minutes. The duration of the exercise program was&#xD;
      four weeks. Participants were offered a choice of two types of exercise according to the&#xD;
      weather conditions. The first option comprised exercises performed on a mattress, including&#xD;
      stretching, tightening and loosening movements that targeted large muscle groups from the&#xD;
      neck to the vertebrae. The nurse explained that the mattress exercises would start with a 5&#xD;
      minute warm up, continue for at least 15-20 minutes at mid-tempo and end with a 5 minute cool&#xD;
      down. The second option was a walking exercise. The participants were expected to warm up for&#xD;
      5 minutes, increase their speed for 5 minutes, continue at mid-tempo for 15 minutes and&#xD;
      complete a 5 minute cool down. It was emphasized that the pulse rate should be between&#xD;
      120-160/min when the participants reached mid-tempo. In this exercise program, we assumed&#xD;
      that both the walking exercise and the mattress exercises had equal effects on the low back&#xD;
      and pelvic pain. Pregnant women were able to choose the type of exercise according to their&#xD;
      wishes and requirements and could use either or both of the exercise options. The nurse&#xD;
      determined the exercise plan with the pregnant women, creating an individual exercise program&#xD;
      according to the patient's personal characteristics. The participants were asked to record&#xD;
      the type and the duration of the completed exercises during the program on the data&#xD;
      collection form and were asked to note if they encountered any problems during the program.&#xD;
      The nurse taught the participants how to fill out the forms and answered any questions about&#xD;
      the programs. The nurse spoke with the pregnant women on the phone three times a week and&#xD;
      gave counseling according to their needs. During interviews, pregnant women were reminded to&#xD;
      complete the data collection forms. After four weeks, the researchers made a final assessment&#xD;
      of the pregnant women and collected the forms during a face-to-face interview. The exercise&#xD;
      programs were terminated at this point, though the pregnant women were able to continue the&#xD;
      counseling if they wished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnant women in the control group received usual care, comprised of routine clinical&#xD;
      practice for pregnancy-related LBPP. The control group participants were recommended bed rest&#xD;
      and analgesics for LBPP and were not given any treatment for LBPP in addition to standard&#xD;
      care. Pregnant women in the control group did not exercise before the study or during the&#xD;
      study. The nurse spoke with the women in the control group on the phone once a week and asked&#xD;
      them to assess their LBPP and complete the data collection form. The final assessments of the&#xD;
      participants were made during a face-to-face interview four weeks later. Willing pregnant&#xD;
      women in the control group were advised on pain management strategies after completion of the&#xD;
      four weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical power considerations The sample size was calculated using the PS&#xD;
      Software: Power and Sample Size program. Using the literature, we calculated that a sample&#xD;
      size of 48 pregnant women in both the exercise group and the control group (total 96 pregnant&#xD;
      women) could allow for detection of a difference in VAS score of 10 mm between the&#xD;
      intervention and control group, given a SD of 15 mm with accompanying 0.95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CI) and a power of 0.90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization According to the CONSORT requirements, the participants were randomly allocated&#xD;
      to either the intervention group (n=48) or the control group (n=48) using opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes and a simple randomization method. The nurse at the clinic randomly drew the&#xD;
      envelopes and broke the seal in the nursing room. The nurse explained the study's purpose and&#xD;
      procedures to the pregnant women in the control and intervention groups. The same procedure&#xD;
      was repeated for all the pregnant women. Blinding of participants was not feasible due to the&#xD;
      study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes The primary outcomes of this study were the change in pain intensity at the&#xD;
      end of four weeks compared with the baseline and the changes in functional status at the end&#xD;
      of weeks first and fourth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The nurse collected the data by meeting with the pregnant women at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study for a total of two interviews. The data collection form&#xD;
      included the sociodemographic characteristics of the pregnant women, their pregnancy history,&#xD;
      and questions regarding any history of pain. In these meetings the nurse measured the&#xD;
      severity of the LBPP and determined the functional status of the pregnant women. The&#xD;
      participants measured the severity of LBPP at the end of each week for a total of 4&#xD;
      measurements and recorded their pain on a &quot;Weekly Pain Follow-up Form&quot;. Additionally,&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group recorded their exercises on a &quot;Daily Exercise Form&quot;.&#xD;
      The forms were collected for evaluation by the nurse at the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Pain Intensity We used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure the intensity of&#xD;
      the participants' pain. The VAS is a reliable and valid scale that widely used all over the&#xD;
      world for the assessment of pain intensity. Pregnant women noted the severity of the low back&#xD;
      and pelvic pain that they perceived on a 100 mm VAS. The nurse determined the intensity of&#xD;
      pain by measuring the point the pregnant woman had marked with a ruler. We examined the&#xD;
      intensity of two types of pain; perceived pain intensity at rest as VASrelaxation and&#xD;
      perceived pain intensity during activity as VASactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Level The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to determine the participants'&#xD;
      functional status. The ODI was developed in 1976 by O'Brien and is a condition-specific&#xD;
      outcome measure used in the management of spinal disorders. The ODI has been broadly tested&#xD;
      and was found to have good psychometric properties and to be useful in a wide variety of&#xD;
      settings. The ODI is the 'gold standard' for low back functional outcome instruments, is&#xD;
      self-administered and consists of a 10-item questionnaire. The first section evaluates the&#xD;
      intensity of pain and the others describe its disabling effects on typical daily activities&#xD;
      including personal care activities (washing, dressing), lifting, walking, sitting, standing,&#xD;
      sleeping, social life and travelling. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher values&#xD;
      demonstrating greater disability. The ODI's validity and reliability in the Turkish&#xD;
      population was examined by Yakut et al. (2004) and the Cronbach α value was reported as 0.91.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Level Exercise diaries are easy, cost-effective and frequently used methods to&#xD;
      measure physical activity. In this study, exercise diaries were used to determine the&#xD;
      exercise levels of participants in the intervention group. Exercise for 30 minutes at least 3&#xD;
      days a week was considered sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations An Academy Ethical Committee approved the study design, protocols and&#xD;
      informed consent procedure with number 1491-348-11/1539-227. Participants were informed about&#xD;
      the study before inclusion and could decline to participate at any time. The participants&#xD;
      read and signed the informed consent form with the help of the nurse at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Based on the intention-to-treat principle, all pregnant women were analyzed&#xD;
      according to the group they were assigned to, regardless of whether they received the&#xD;
      intervention or not. Missing data were not imputed. To investigate the differences between&#xD;
      the groups, the Student's t test was used for values with a normal distribution and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test was used for values without a normal distribution. To investigate the&#xD;
      differences within the groups, the paired samples t test was used for values with a normal&#xD;
      distribution and the Wilcoxon test was used for values without a normal distribution.&#xD;
      Repeated measurement results that did not have a normal distribution were analyzed using the&#xD;
      Friedman Test. The error level for all analysis was set at p = 0.05. The results were&#xD;
      analyzed using SPSS, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
