  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current literature in social epidemiology and public health suggests that low financial&#xD;
      savings has an unsurprising negative relationship with subjective well-being, and increases&#xD;
      the odds of making visits to a healthcare provider, receiving a chronic disease diagnosis,&#xD;
      and experiencing medical disability. Earn.org is a community-based non-profit based in San&#xD;
      Francisco with a mission to help low-income workers build lifelong savings habits and&#xD;
      financial capability. The organization is one of the largest providers of &quot;goal-based savings&#xD;
      accounts&quot; or &quot;matched savings accounts&quot; in the US. The investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to determine the health effects of Earn's savings program.&#xD;
      Through this trial, the investigators will test three principal hypotheses: (1) Participants&#xD;
      in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to demonstrate improved&#xD;
      scores on mental health scales assessing depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Participants in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to&#xD;
      experience lower odds of harmful behaviors associated with stress, specifically tobacco and&#xD;
      alcohol abuse. The investigators hypothesize that the effect on behaviors will be of smaller&#xD;
      effect size, and more delayed, than the effect on mental health outcomes, judging from&#xD;
      similar effects observed in the micro-credit literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) The mediating variables between Earn account participation and beneficial health outcomes&#xD;
      will include increased optimism and internal locus of control.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to conduct an RCT comparing participants in the new EARN program&#xD;
      against wait-listed control subjects. The program provides low-wage workers with incentives&#xD;
      and rewards for savings. The program involves a web-based platform that permits eligible&#xD;
      savers to create a centralized savings account, which is a secure online account without&#xD;
      fees. The account offers eligible savers small monetary rewards for dollars saved each month.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a baseline online month 0 survey and a follow-up 6 month&#xD;
      and 12 month online survey among participants and wait-listed nonparticipants, with telephone&#xD;
      follow-up to maximize 6- and 12-month survey completion. The surveys consist of&#xD;
      previously-validated instruments to assess key health behaviors self-reported well-being, and&#xD;
      require approximately 20 minutes each. The surveys includes the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor&#xD;
      Surveillance System scales for assessing demographics and income, overall self-rated health,&#xD;
      tobacco and alcohol use, depression and anxiety symptoms, and optimism and locus of control.&#xD;
      Participants will receive prorated a gift card for each survey, to compensate participants&#xD;
      for their time while avoiding a direct income effect of a cash incentive for participation.&#xD;
