  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of A-PLUS trial is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of induction&#xD;
      BEEP (bevacizumab preconditioning followed by etoposide and cisplatin) followed by whole bran&#xD;
      radiotherapy (WBRT) with WBRT alone in the controlling of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (MBC) patients who have not previously received WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In past 2 years, the research team has demonstrated that BEEP regimen is a highly effective&#xD;
      treatment for brain metastases of breast cancer progressing from WBRT by a multi-center phase&#xD;
      II study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01281696). The basic concept of preconditioning,&#xD;
      as referred to starting bevacizumab 1 day before chemotherapy, is that the effect of&#xD;
      bevacizumab induced tumor vascular normalization takes time to mature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that as induction BEEP decreased the size of brain tumors, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of WBRT would be maximized. The investigators expect this integrated approach&#xD;
      will do greater benefit to MBC patients with BM, irrespective of subtype.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis (BM) occurs in about 20% to 35% of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.&#xD;
      In contrast to recent advances in systemic treatment of MBC, there is much room for&#xD;
      improvement in treatment of BM. At present, the standard treatment for inoperable/not&#xD;
      suitable for radiosurgery BM is whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), but with only a median&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) of 6 to 12 months and a high brain relapse rate ranging from 30% to&#xD;
      100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MBC, 70% to 80% of patients with BM are presented with more than two brain metastatic&#xD;
      tumors and are not candidate for both surgical treatment and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).&#xD;
      Unlike patients with solitary or oligo-brain metastatic tumors, for whom the addition of&#xD;
      local treatments such as surgery or SRS has been shown to improve OS and relapse rate; for&#xD;
      patients with multiple brain metastases, WBRT remained the only standard treatment and&#xD;
      improvements are desperately awaited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain was once considered as a &quot;sanctuary&quot; area for systemic drugs due to the protection of&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Although some preclinical studies suggest that the BBB could be&#xD;
      disrupted during the growth of brain metastatic tumor, the amount of chemotherapy drugs be&#xD;
      delivered to brain tissue was still far lower than that could be achieved in serum.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, has shown the ability to&#xD;
      &quot;normalize&quot; the peri-tumoral vessels in preclinical models. The investigators hypothesized&#xD;
      that with the addition of bevacizumab, the chemotherapy drugs-etoposide and cisplatin, which&#xD;
      were shown also to have some activity for BM-will be delivered more efficiently into the once&#xD;
      &quot;sanctuary&quot; brain parenchyma, thus increasing the efficacy of BM treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the research team have demonstrated that bevacizumab preconditioning followed by&#xD;
      etoposide and cisplatin (BEEP) is a highly effective treatment for brain metastases of breast&#xD;
      cancer progressing from radiotherapy by a multi-center phase II study. The basic concept of&#xD;
      preconditioning, as referred to starting bevacizumab 1 day before chemotherapy, is that&#xD;
      normalization effect takes time to mature. In that study, 35 patients were enrolled. Twenty&#xD;
      seven patients (77.2%; 95%CI 59.9-89.6) achieved brain tumor volumetric response, defined as&#xD;
      a ≥50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable brain lesions in the absence of&#xD;
      increasing steroid use, development of new brain lesion, or progressive neurologic symptoms.&#xD;
      With a median follow-up of 11.0 months, the median CNS progression free survival (PFS) was&#xD;
      6.7 months (95% CI 5.1 to 8.3 months), and OS was 9.4 months (95% CI 7.3 to 11.5 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, lapatinib is the only molecular targeted agent proven effective for MBC patients&#xD;
      with BM. The CNS response rate of first-line lapatinib plus capecitabine was 65% in&#xD;
      WBRT-naïve, HER2-positive MBC patients with BM. However, the median CNS PFS is still&#xD;
      disappointingly short at 5.5 months and the result is limited to MBC patients who are&#xD;
      HER2-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that brain tumor size is a predictor of WBRT failure. Given the high&#xD;
      response rate of BEEP for BM in our phase II trial, the investigators hypothesized that as&#xD;
      induction BEEP decreased the size of BM, the effectiveness of WBRT would also be enhanced.&#xD;
      This integrated approach will do greater benefit to MBC patients with BM, irrespective of&#xD;
      subtype. Hence, the investigators plan to conduct this randomized phase II trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of induction BEEP followed by WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study of A-PLUS: A Integrated Study of MRI and PET of The Brain in Evaluation of&#xD;
      Neurocognitive Outcomes of Patients with Brain Metastasis Treated by Radiotherapy and&#xD;
      Chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of A-PLUS trial may be enrolled in an additional study of this trial. This&#xD;
      additional prospective study aims to investigate the neurocognitive outcomes of patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases treated by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The evaluations include&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessments, serial MRI and FDG PET-CT (Integrated MR-PET) at before and after&#xD;
      the study treatment. A total of 80 participants will be enrolled. The study protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the NTUH REC, No. 201412046MINA.&#xD;
