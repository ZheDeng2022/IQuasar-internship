  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are considering whether to&#xD;
      receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation&#xD;
      (LDKT). Although Blacks are 3.4 times more likely to develop end stage renal disease, they&#xD;
      are less likely to receive LDKTs. To address this disparity, this randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will assess whether Black and White transplant patients' knowledge and receipt of LDKTs can&#xD;
      be increased when they receive access to the Your Path to Transplant computerized Expert&#xD;
      System (YPT). This trial will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare&#xD;
      system barriers to LDKT impact YPT's effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine hundred (900) Black,White and Hispanic ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical&#xD;
      evaluation at University of California-Los Angeles Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program&#xD;
      (UCLA-KPTP) in Los Angeles, California will be stratified by race and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two education conditions (YPT vs. Usual Care Education). As they undergo transplant&#xD;
      evaluation, patients in the YPT condition will receive individually-tailored feedback&#xD;
      reports, coaching, and socioeconomic resource guidance associated with reducing barriers to&#xD;
      access to LDKT. Control patients will receive usual care transplant education provided by&#xD;
      UCLA-KPTP. Changes in knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, pros/cons to LDKT, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy will be assessed at four time points: prior to presenting at the transplant&#xD;
      center (baseline), during transplant evaluation (approximately 2 months post-baseline), and&#xD;
      4- and 8-months post-baseline. Completion of transplant evaluation and receipt of LDKTs will&#xD;
      be assessed 18-months post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective YPT&#xD;
      Computerized Expert System that could be utilized to tailor LDKT discussion and education in&#xD;
      different medical settings based on the needs of individual patients of different races.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal, parallel randomized control trial has two treatment conditions with equal&#xD;
      allocation, the YPT intervention and the standard of care transplant education as provided by&#xD;
      UCLAKPT. Patients in both groups will be assessed at four time points: 1) a phone survey at&#xD;
      baseline; 2) a phone survey at 4 months post-baseline; 3) a phone survey at 8 months&#xD;
      post-baseline; and 4) a medical records review at 4, 8 and 18 months post-baseline.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients in the YPT intervention group will receive individualized YPT&#xD;
      transplant education at various time points: 14 days post-baseline by phone, the in-person&#xD;
      transplant education (ITE) session, during the 4 month post-baseline survey, and during the 8&#xD;
      month post-baseline survey. The date of the ITE education session cannot be fixed because it&#xD;
      may occur at different points in each patient's transplant evaluation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patient records are received via the transplant database, a data manager will determine&#xD;
      which are eligible for the study, then assign eligible patients a PIN that has been&#xD;
      pre-randomized to treatment group before uploading the record to the recruitment database.&#xD;
      Randomization will be completed by using a computer software program called TTMX&#xD;
      (Transtheoretical Model Expert). Knowledge of treatment assignment is required at and after&#xD;
      this stage so that the YPT expert system can be delivered to patients randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention condition. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: usual care or&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Control Group-UCLA The control group for this trial consists of the usual care for&#xD;
      transplant education which, for this facility, begins when a referral is made. A physician,&#xD;
      patient medical group or dialysis center can make the referral. Once UCLAKPTP receives the&#xD;
      patient's information via a patient information form and their insurance has been verified,&#xD;
      the patient is called to schedule an Education Seminar and a one-on-one evaluation&#xD;
      appointment. Next, both UCLAKPTP mail out an &quot;Appointment Letter&quot; for the patient to complete&#xD;
      and bring with them to Evaluation Day. These packets include a UCLAKPTP Appointment Letter&#xD;
      and a Doctor's Information Worksheet. Patients are asked to fill out and bring the&#xD;
      Information Worksheet with them on their appointment day. The evaluation day is a full day of&#xD;
      group education, physician appointment, meetings with several coordinators of care and if&#xD;
      necessary completing several medical tests with blood and urine collection. During the two&#xD;
      hour group education a power point presentation is given that reviews different&#xD;
      transplantation options including living and deceased donors as well as high risk donors. The&#xD;
      social worker concludes the education by reviewing important insurance information with the&#xD;
      group. Next, the patients have a series of individual appointments with the transplant&#xD;
      physician (either a nephrologist or a surgeon), a social worker and the transplant&#xD;
      coordinator where they can ask questions and will receive additional information on&#xD;
      transplant. Psychosocial evaluations are completed by the social workers to identify any risk&#xD;
      factors or red flags which would contradict transplant as a treatment. This routine is&#xD;
      standard for all patients evaluated for transplant. Patients in this group will be surveyed&#xD;
      at baseline, 4 months and 8 months post baseline. These surveys will be conducted over the&#xD;
      phone and can last up to 50 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPT Intervention Group Patients in the intervention group with receive individualized YPT&#xD;
      transplant education at four time points. Their total participation is estimated to be 2.5&#xD;
      hours. Printed materials and videos will be sent to the patients after each time point.&#xD;
      Patients will also receive individualized feedback reports based on their stage of readiness&#xD;
      to pursue DDKT and LDKT. In addition to being tailored to the individual's stage of&#xD;
      readiness, these reports will address any concerns the patient has mentioned as well as&#xD;
      answers to knowledge questions the patient may have missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPT intervention: baseline time point. We will first administer verbal consent form and&#xD;
      assess for ineligibility criteria. After consent has been given and eligibility determined,&#xD;
      we will conduct a baseline assessment of the patient's demographics, knowledge, decision&#xD;
      making, readiness, and self-efficacy for both DDKT and LDKT. Family support and living donor&#xD;
      availability will also be assessed for LDKT. This time point is estimated to last 40 minutes.&#xD;
      At the end of the survey the patient will be asked schedule a time to conduct the first&#xD;
      education session.The education session will occur at any time up to 14 days after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment and will last between 20-30 minutes. The coach will then discuss the&#xD;
      patient's readiness to pursue DDKT. This will be guided by the patient's stage of change.&#xD;
      Next, the coach addresses the benefits of DDKT and provides coaching for any concerns the&#xD;
      patient mentioned in the assessment. After this, the coach will discuss the patient's over&#xD;
      all confidence for pursuing DDKT and then provide itemized feedback for problems the patient&#xD;
      believes will prevent them from pursuing DDKT. The coach will then provide the same education&#xD;
      and coaching for LDKT. At the end of the education session the coach will inform the patient&#xD;
      that they will meet the patient on the day of their ITE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coach will then mail a folder containing the first set of educational materials which&#xD;
      includes factsheets, brochures and the patient's personalized, tailored feedback report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPT intervention: ITE time point. The ITE session will occur at the UCLAKPTP during the&#xD;
      patient's medical evaluation visits. It is expected to last 40 minutes. Patients will be&#xD;
      taken to a semi-private area in the transplant center at either facility and re-assess the&#xD;
      patient's readiness to pursue DDKT and LDKT as well as the perceived benefits and concerns.&#xD;
      The patient's confidence for pursuing both DDKT and LDKT will also be re-assessed. We will&#xD;
      provide feedback to the patient based on any changes in readiness, confidence, and perceived&#xD;
      benefits or concerns that may have occurred since the initial assessment. DDKT feedback will&#xD;
      occur directly after DDKT re-assessment and LDKT feedback will occur after LDKT&#xD;
      re-assessment. The patient will then be asked to watch a 10 minute video while we print off&#xD;
      the patient's personalized feedback report. Based on the patient's stage of change, one of&#xD;
      two videos will be shown: &quot;Pursuing Donation&quot; to those patients who are in the&#xD;
      pre-contemplation and contemplation phases and &quot;Exploring Donation&quot; will be for patients in&#xD;
      all of the other stages. At the end of the session we will give the patient a second folder&#xD;
      with educational materials, a DVD, and their personalized feedback report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPT intervention: 4 month and 8 month time point. We will contact the patient four months and&#xD;
      eight months after their baseline survey. Pre-survey reminder postcards will be sent one&#xD;
      month prior to the survey. It is estimated that each survey will last 45 minutes. These&#xD;
      interviews will be similar to the baseline survey given at the beginning of the trial.&#xD;
      However, we will not re-assess demographic information, comorbidities, or unmet needs. At&#xD;
      both time points, we will provide tailored feedback throughout the interview. This will occur&#xD;
      immediately after the re-assessment of potential barriers to pursuing transplant, knowledge,&#xD;
      and transplant decision making for both DDKT and LDKT. During the eight month interview, we&#xD;
      will ask the patient questions regarding the cultural competency of their medical providers,&#xD;
      their decision about which treatment to pursue, and their ability to have made an informed&#xD;
      decision as to whether or not pursue DDKT or LDKT. As with previous time points,&#xD;
      individualized feedback reports and tailored education will be sent to the patients following&#xD;
      the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YPT patients: 4, 8, and 18 month medical record review. Patients' medical records will be&#xD;
      reviewed at 4, 8 and 18 months after their baseline survey in order to determine whether they&#xD;
      had: 1) been waitlisted for transplant; 2) received a DDKT; 3) received an LDKT; 4) gone&#xD;
      inactive or been determined ineligible for transplant; 5) died.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient LDKT Attitude &amp; Decision Making Measure: Decisional Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months post-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Balance measures will assess how patients weigh the relative importance of possible LDKT and DDKT positive and negative outcomes (e.g., &quot;My living donor will feel good seeing my health improve&quot;). Patients will be asked to rate the importance of each statement on a 5-point scale ranging from, (1) &quot;Not important&quot; to (5) &quot;Extremely important&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient LDKT Attitude &amp; Decision Making Measure: Small Steps towards LDKT and DDKT</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months post-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To assess their steps toward transplant, patients will be asked to respond whether they have &quot;Already done&quot;, &quot;Are planning to do&quot;, or &quot;Don't plan to do&quot; a list of actions related to LDKT and DDKT. Examples of steps toward LDKT include &quot;Read information/watch videos about getting a living donor transplant&quot; and &quot;Ask potential donors to be tested&quot;, while examples of steps toward DDKT include &quot;Share educational materials about deceased donation with people in your life&quot; and &quot;Follow-up with the transplant coordinator until transplant evaluation is complete&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient LDKT Attitude &amp; Decision Making Measure: Transplant Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months post-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked 11 true/false and 8 multiple choice questions to determine their level of knowledge regarding basic facts, advantages, risks and outcomes of DDKT and LDKT (e.g., &quot;Patients older than 80 years can receive transplants&quot;; &quot;Compared to transplants from donors who have died, how long do transplants from living donors last?&quot;). A measure of transplant knowledge is then created by summing the number of correct answers to the questions.</description>

    <measure>Final Outcome: Pursuit of Transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months post-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Finally, patients' electronic medical records at UCLA and data from the Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients (SRTR) will be reviewed 18 months post-baseline to create a final study outcome for each patient. At the study's conclusion, the patient will be coded as to: 1) be waitlisted for a DDKT; 2) have received a DDKT; 3) have received a LDKT; 4) have been determined to be medically ineligible for transplant; 5) have died; or 6) have dropped out of evaluation.</description>
