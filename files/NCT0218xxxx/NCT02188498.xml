    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if a non-invasive technique, using an innovative&#xD;
      analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data, would allow for detection of respiratory events&#xD;
      during sleep and discrimination between central and obstructive apnea. Obstructive Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea (OSA) is the most common respiratory disturbance seen during sleep, with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 10 % in the population and is strongly associated with the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. In patients with underlying cardiac disease, particularly in heart&#xD;
      failure (HF), central respiratory events such as Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) are often&#xD;
      seen during sleep. The presence of CSR is also associated with increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Currently, the identification and classification of sleep related&#xD;
      respiratory disturbances is performed during over-night sleep studies (polysomnography),&#xD;
      which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive and difficult for patients. Thus, the&#xD;
      development of alternative techniques to assist in the identification of those events in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting is of marked importance for widespread screening of sleep apnea.&#xD;

      This study aims to use novel analyses of electrocardiogram data to detect the presence and&#xD;
      type of respiratory event observed in patients during sleep. Our specific aims include:&#xD;
      determining the accuracy of using a non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect sleep&#xD;
      apnea and to distinguish between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Cheyne-Stokes Respiration&#xD;
      (CSR). For this investigator-initiated study, data from approximately 400 consecutive&#xD;
      patients presenting to the Weill Cornell Center for Sleep Medicine for polysomnography will&#xD;
      be collected. A sample size of 45 subjects in each group will be needed to quantify mean&#xD;
      amplitude change in the ECG derived respiratory signal. Study procedures are outlined below.&#xD;
      Standard and novel, research measurements from the ECG will be correlated with findings from&#xD;
      polysomnography and used to assess the presence and severity of a variety of ECG-based&#xD;
      measures of cardiovascular disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and prior Q-wave&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. Subjects will also have to complete a Questionnaire prior to their ECG&#xD;
      at their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire (see attached). This&#xD;
           questionnaire will ask questions relating to subjects' sleep patterns, etc. Potential&#xD;
           risks include possible discomfort while completing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuous 12-lead ECG recordings, using torso-located electrodes, will be obtained with&#xD;
           Mortara Instrument H12+ recorders. An MTA Agreement has been established for the use of&#xD;
           this equipment for the duration of this study. Electrocardiograms will be obtained in&#xD;
           standard clinical fashion using GE Medical Systems equipment. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
           lie in the supine position and 10 recording electrodes will be applied. With the patient&#xD;
           lying quietly, a 10 second digital ECG will be recorded and then downloaded via analog&#xD;
           modem to the MUSE ECG analysis and storage system at New York Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
           where it will be stored on a dedicated site of our password protected MUSE server. ECG&#xD;
           information:12-lead ECGs will be downloaded from the MUSE system to a secure network&#xD;
           drive and then copied to the hard drive of a password protected computer where they will&#xD;
           be batch-analyzed using an ECG research analysis program, Magellan, provided by GE&#xD;
           Medical Systems. Magellan will generate a series of measurements from each ECG and will&#xD;
           then export these measurements to an Excel file which will be converted to SPSS files&#xD;
           for data analysis. Deidentified ECG data may be downloaded to the Electrocardiography&#xD;
           data center and transferred using a secure file transfer system, such as Cornell's file&#xD;
           transfer website, to an outside company (Mortara, Inc.) for further analysis as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard polysomnography will be performed for 12 hours at approximately the patients&#xD;
           regular sleep time. Sleep data will be recorded in a digitized system and analyzed using&#xD;
           Grass Twin software Â® (Middleton, WI) for the determination and classification of&#xD;
           respiratory events and other sleep related parameters. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)&#xD;
           will be calculated by computing the average number of obstructive apneas plus&#xD;
           obstructive hypopneas per hour of sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is here defined&#xD;
           by an AHI &amp;#8805;5. Intermittent hypoxemia (IH) will be determined by the number of&#xD;
           periods &amp;#8805;6 sec with SaO2 drops &amp;#8805;4%. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration will be&#xD;
           determined by the typical crescendo-decrescendo pattern on the respiratory flow signal,&#xD;
           chest and thoracic impedance, using standard criteria. Total duration of CSR will be&#xD;
           calculated for the determination of the % of sleep time on CSR. Data regarding&#xD;
           percentage of sleep time at SaO2 &amp;#8804;90% (%TST&amp;lt;90) and lowest saturation level&#xD;
           (LowSaO2) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of data attainment some de-identified data will be remote analyzed.&#xD;
