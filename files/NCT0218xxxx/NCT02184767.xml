      <textblock>
        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent is obtained from each patient's parent or legal guardian and&#xD;
             written assent is obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is a boy or girl 10 through 17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is within the 2.5 to 97.5 percentile for body mass index (BMI) on the&#xD;
             basis of age and sex and is within the following weight range, as appropriate:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  boys: more than 27 kg and 127 kg or less&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  girls: more than 27 kg and 111 kg or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has a documented history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, or&#xD;
             any condition for which the use of antipsychotic medication (eg, risperidone,&#xD;
             olanzapine, aripirazole, haloperidol, etc.) is warranted and/or administered. Note:&#xD;
             Patients currently receiving treatment for any condition must be on a stable regimen&#xD;
             (dose and frequency) for a minimum of 28 days before administration of ADASUVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is in good general health as determined by a complete medical history&#xD;
             (including psychiatric and respiratory), clinical laboratory tests (include&#xD;
             hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examination, body weight,&#xD;
             12-lead ECG, spirometry, vital signs measurements (blood pressure [systolic and&#xD;
             diastolic], heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate), pulse oximetry, chest&#xD;
             auscultation, neurologic examination, suicidality assessment, and concomitant&#xD;
             medication usage inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients who are postmenarche or sexually active must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test result, must have exclusively same sex partners or be using an acceptable method&#xD;
             of contraception, and must agree to continued use of this method for the duration of&#xD;
             the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of ADASUVE. Acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception include abstinence or an intrauterine device (known to have a failure&#xD;
             rate of less than 1% per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has negative alcohol test and urine drug screen (UDS) results. A positive&#xD;
             UDS result with appropriate medical explanation (eg, prescribed amphetamines) may be&#xD;
             permitted after consultation with the medical monitor. Note: The UDS will also detect&#xD;
             the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A positive result for THC may be permitted&#xD;
             after discussion with the sponsor if the result is low and is consistent (eg, positive&#xD;
             at all predose assessments). If a patient tests negative for THC at screening, the&#xD;
             result must remain negative at check-in for the patient to be eligible for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient and parent/legal guardian must be willing and able to comply with study&#xD;
             restrictions and to remain at the investigational center for the required duration at&#xD;
             each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has any clinically significant uncontrolled medical condition (treated or&#xD;
             untreated) other than the conditions specified in inclusion criterion d.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has a current diagnosis or history of asthma, chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. The patient has received or donated blood or blood products (eg, plasma or platelets)&#xD;
             in the 3 months before administration of ADASUVE or has made more than 2 blood (≥ 450&#xD;

             or has plans to donate during the study or within 3 months after completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The patient has 1 or more clinical laboratory test values outside the range specified&#xD;
             below, or any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality, as determined by&#xD;
