  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this phase II trial was to evaluate the efficacy of 250 mg BIBF 1120&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) versus 150 mg BIBF 1120 BID in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In addition, safety&#xD;
      data for the two different dosages were collected and analysed.&#xD;
