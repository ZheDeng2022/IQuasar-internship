  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our intervention will be the injection of Abobotulinum toxin A into the affected site/vocal&#xD;
      cords for patients with the diagnosis of Primary Tourette's syndrome. This is an efficacy&#xD;
      trial to understand the right dosage of Abobotulinum toxin A which can be affective. The&#xD;
      study will involve an injection of 2.5 units of Dysport on each side of the affected vocal&#xD;
      cords for patients with a diagnosis of Primary Tourette's syndrome. The patients will also&#xD;
      complete a self assessment survey on how vocal tics affect their daily lives. Afterward, a&#xD;
      further evaluation of the tics will be conducted by the investigator using the Yale Global&#xD;
      Tic Severity Scale. (YGTSS) evaluation. How this will be done is by a licensed ENT (Ear, Nose&#xD;
      and Throat) physician. The windpipe will be number by a 2% lidocaine followed by a provoked&#xD;
      cough by the patient. This will allow the lidocaine to be sprayed throughout the airway&#xD;
      preventing coughing and swallowing during the procedure. An Electromyography (EMG) guidance a&#xD;
      needle containing Dysport will be injected into the thyroarytenoid muscles will potentially&#xD;
      reduce the vocal dyskinetic features in patients with TS. This needle will be connected to a&#xD;
      syringe and once determined active, it will be placed appropriately when the EMG emits a&#xD;
      characteristic sound. If this does not occur with the patient then the injection will be&#xD;
      administered under direct vision via direct laryngoscopy using an orotracheal injector&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is conducted in an outpatient clinic because no hospitalization is required.&#xD;
      The patient is not allowed to consume food or drink for about 45-60 minutes after the&#xD;
      injection. The throat will be numb and may cause coughing and some blood tinged sputum: The&#xD;
      expectancy of this outcome is reason to not consider is a serious event. Asprin and ibuprofen&#xD;
      is not allowed a week prior to and until the injection at least 3-4 days after to prevent&#xD;
      excessive bleeding. The patient is also instructed to ensure that they chew their food&#xD;
      thoroughly and drink sufficient water for the initial days after the study intervention. Mild&#xD;
      dysphasia may be noted initially which should resolve within a few hours. On Visit 1, the&#xD;
      patient will complete all required study documents and forms. Then the ENT physician will&#xD;
      proceed with the injection Dysport on the same day. If unforeseen circumstances render the&#xD;
      subject unable to be injected on the same day, the intervention must take place within three&#xD;
      days and this will be considered V1, follow up events should be scheduled accordingly.&#xD;

      The intervention for this pilot study will be the injection of Dysport (Abobotulinum toxin A)&#xD;
      into the affected vocal cords for all patients with the diagnosis of Primary Tourette's&#xD;
      syndrome. A total of 5 units of Dysport (on each side) will be administered to patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with TS to determine whether they exhibit a reduction in the number of vocal tics.&#xD;
      The patients will complete a self assessment survey about the manner in which the vocal tics&#xD;
      are affecting their daily lives. Further evaluation of the tics will be conducted by the&#xD;
      investigator using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be completed by a licensed ENT (Ears Nose and Throat) physician. The&#xD;
      procedure will be conducted in an outpatient clinic setting because no hospitalization is&#xD;
      required for this study. The windpipe will be numbed by a 2% lidocaine followed by a provoked&#xD;
      cough by the patient. This will enable the lidocaine to be sprayed throughout the airway&#xD;
      preventing any coughs or swallowing during the main intervention procedure. Under&#xD;
      Electromyography (EMG) guidance a needle containing Dysport will be injected into the&#xD;
      thyroarytenoid muscles which will potentially reduce the vocal dyskinetic features in&#xD;
      individuals with TS. The needle containing Dysport will be connected to a syringe and once it&#xD;
      is determined it is active, it will be placed appropriately when the EMG emits a&#xD;
      characteristic sound. A total of 5 units of Dysport (2.5 units on each side) will be&#xD;
      administered to the patient. If this does not occur with the patient then the injection will&#xD;
      be administered under direct vision via direct laryngoscopy using an orotracheal injector&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will not be allowed to consume food or drink for approximately 45-60 minutes&#xD;
      after Dysport has been injected. The throat will be numb after the anesthetic and may cause&#xD;
      coughing and some blood tinged sputum which is expected and hence will not be considered a&#xD;
      serious event. The patient will not be allowed to consume aspirin or ibuprofen a week prior&#xD;
      to and till the intervention for at least 3-4 days after the intervention to prevent&#xD;
      excessive bleeding. The patient will also be provided with specific instructions to ensure&#xD;
      that they chew their food thoroughly and drink sufficient water for the initial days after&#xD;
      the study intervention. Mild dysphasia may be noted initially which should resolve within a&#xD;
      few hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Visit 1 (Day 1), after the patient has completed all the required study documents and&#xD;
      forms, the ENT physician will proceed with the injection of Dysport on the same day. However,&#xD;
      if due to unforeseen circumstances, the subject cannot be injected on the same day, the&#xD;
      intervention must take place within three days and this will be considered V1 (Day 1) and all&#xD;
      follow up visits should be scheduled accordingly.&#xD;
