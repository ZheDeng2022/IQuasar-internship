      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A brain protein called translocator protein (TSPO) shows changes in some brain diseases. A&#xD;
      radioactive drug called 11C-(R)-PK 11195 is used to take pictures of TSPO using a camera&#xD;
      called positron emission tomography (PET). Researchers want to find out how well 11C-(R)-PK&#xD;
      11195 takes the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the radioactive chemical 11C-(R)-PK 11195.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers ages 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have scans at up to 4 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PET scan using 11C-(R)-PK 11195:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  A small tube (catheter) will be put into an artery at the wrist or elbow, by a&#xD;
                     needle. The needle will be removed, leaving only the catheter in the artery.&#xD;
                     Blood samples will be taken through this catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Another catheter will be placed into a vein in the arm or hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  11C-(R)-PK 11195 will be injected through the second catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut. Participants will lie on a bed that&#xD;
                     slides in and out of it. They may get a plastic mask for their face and head.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will receive a dose of emapunil by mouth. Participants will then have&#xD;
                another PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a&#xD;
                metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The participant will lie on a table&#xD;
                that can slide in and out of the cylinder. Participants will get earplugs for the&#xD;
                loud knocking noises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After each scan, participants will get a follow-up phone call. Two to seven days after&#xD;
           taking emapunil, participants will return for a follow-up visit.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 18kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO, formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine&#xD;
      receptor (PBR)) is expressed in activated microglia and reactive astrocyte. It has therefore&#xD;
      been used as an imaging target for positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate diseases&#xD;
      involving microglial activation and/or macrophage recruitment, such as multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
      herpes encephalitis, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and ischemic stroke. The vast&#xD;
      majority of PET studies reported to date have used 11C-(R,S) and 11C-(R)-PK 11195, a&#xD;
      3-isoquinolinecarboxamide antagonist, with nanomolar affinity for TSPO. Several second&#xD;
      generation radioligands, including 11C-PBR28, 11C-DPA-713, and 11C-ER176 have been developed.&#xD;
      Although these ligands have greater signal to noise (specific to nondisplaceable uptake)&#xD;
      ratio than 11C-(R)-PK 11195,their binding to TSPO is affected by a single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP). Specific to nondisplaceable ratio of 11C-PBR28 has recently been&#xD;
      reported. However, no one has ever measured the specific to nondisplaceable ratio of other&#xD;
      TSPO radioligands including 11C-(R)-PK 11195, 11C-DPA-713 and 11C-ER176 in human subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, differences in this binding site between species preclude comparisons based on&#xD;
      studies in animals. The purposes of this study are to measure the signal to noise ratio&#xD;
      (i.e., ratio of specific to non-displaceable uptake) of 11C-(R)-PK 11195, 11C-ER176 and&#xD;
      11C-DPA-713 in human subjects with two scans in each subject: at baseline and after emapunil,&#xD;
      an agonist at the TSPO site and a putative anxiolytic based on studies in animals and in&#xD;
      humans and study the effect of the SNP on the in vivo specific binding of the PET ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      75 healthy volunteers in total aged 18 to 55 years. Of these, 25 will have 11C-(R)-PK 11195,&#xD;
      25 have 11C-DPA-713 scans, and 25 have 11C-ER176.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers (n = up to 25) will have two scanning sessions using 11C-(R)-PK 11195: a)&#xD;
      baseline i.e., medication-free and b) blocking i.e. with medication. For blocking, we will&#xD;
      give one oral dose of emapunil (15 or 90 mg), about 1.5 hours before the second injection of&#xD;
      the radioligand. Both scanning sessions would include an arterial line and measurement of the&#xD;
      input function of parent radioligand separated from radiometabolites as well as plasma free&#xD;
      fraction of radioligand. Additional 25 healthy volunteers will have two scanning sessions&#xD;
      using 11C-DPA-713 in the same design, one baseline and another after one oral dose of&#xD;
      emapunil. An additional 25 healthy volunteers will have two scanning sessions using 11C-ER176&#xD;
      in the same design, one baseline and another after one oral dose of emapunil. The total&#xD;
      number of participants is 75 (= 25 + 25 + 25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline scans measure total binding i.e., total distribution volume (V[T]). By applying the&#xD;
      Lassen plot, combined data from both baseline scans and those with administration of emapunil&#xD;
      measure nonspecific binding i.e., nondisplaceable distribution volume (V[ND]). From these&#xD;
      V[T] and V[ND] values, specific-to-nondisplaceable ratios will be calculated as (V[T] V[ND])&#xD;
      / V[ND[ and the influence of the SNP to specific binding, V[S] = V[T] - VND will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
