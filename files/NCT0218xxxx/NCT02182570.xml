        of atopic dermatitis will be conducted in accordance with the &quot;Definition and Diagnostic&#xD;
        Criteria of Atopic Dermatitis&quot;, issued by the Japanese Dermatological Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  15 years of age or younger&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of sustained release adrenocorticotropic hormone (Kenacort® A, Depo-medrol®,&#xD;
             etc.), oral preparation of methotrexate, or oral preparation of ciclosporin, within 4&#xD;
             weeks before initial administration of the investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oral intake, inhalation and injection of any steroid within 2 weeks before initial&#xD;
             administration of the investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any external steroid preparation at &quot;Strongest&quot; in any sites other than the&#xD;
             face or scalp within 2 weeks before initial administration of the investigational&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing phototherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing specific desensitization therapy or modulation therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other clinical study, or history of participation in any other&#xD;
             clinical study within 6 months before the date when the patient gave consent to&#xD;
             participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgement by the Principal Investigator or Investigator that the patient is ineligible&#xD;
