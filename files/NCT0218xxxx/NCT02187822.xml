  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether addition of TPI 287 to FSRT is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable. Researchers also want to find out if adding TPI 287 to FSRT can help with better&#xD;
      controlling the growth of brain lesions in people with brain metastases from their cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care for treatment of patients with brain metastases, which are considered not&#xD;
      surgically removable, is radiation therapy to the brain lesions. This treatment is called&#xD;
      Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) and is given without chemotherapy and usually&#xD;
      over 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers of this study want to find out if adding an investigational drug, called TPI 287,&#xD;
      to standard radiation therapy (FSRT) can help people with brain metastases from cancer. TPI&#xD;
      287 is a drug that is being tested and is not approved for sale in the United States by the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

    <description>MTD of TPI 287 given concurrently with Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) to treat brain metastases from advanced solid tumors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. Complete Response (CR): The tumor is no longer seen on two sequential MRI scans, and the patient is on no steroids or only adrenal-maintenance dose of steroids. Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50% decrease in the product of two diameters of target lesions on two sequential MRIs, taking as reference the baseline product of two diameters, provided that the patient has not had his/her dose of steroids increased since the last evaluation period. Stable Disease (SD): The scan shows no change, taking as reference the smallest product of diameters while on study. Patient should be receiving stable or decreasing doses of steroids.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.0) definition of Progression follows. One or more of the following must occur: 20% or greater increase in the sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline. Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opinion of the treating physician (an explanation must be provided). Appearance of any new lesion/site. Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration.</description>

Dose Escalation Phase: The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for TPI 287 given concurrently with Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) will be determined using the standard 3+3 study design.&#xD;
Dose Expansion Phase: Participants will be treated with TPI 287 at MTD given concurrently with FSRT to further assess toxicity and tumor response.</description>
