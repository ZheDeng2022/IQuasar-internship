  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by the presence of persistent worry or&#xD;
      fear of no explicit object and fixed content, or things that might occur in real life，which&#xD;
      not corresponds with the realities. Patients with GAD may occur a series of somatic symptoms&#xD;
      including muscle tension, backaches, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, restlessness, as well as&#xD;
      psychological feelings of anxiety, worry and feeling overwhelmed. And it always brings some&#xD;
      type of functional disability or decrease in quality of life. GAD is treated by Selective&#xD;
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin, Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors(SNRI)&#xD;
      and 5-ht1a receptor agonists as regular medication which have the definite effects. But, some&#xD;
      adverse reaction of SSRIs or SNRI leads to the compliance of taking medicine of patients with&#xD;
      GAD. There is an impressive data suggesting that Abdominal Massage Therapy is effective in&#xD;
      decreasing some symptoms of somatic symptoms and psychological feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a parallel group, positive control, non-inferiority study. It will&#xD;
      recruit 140 cases of generalized anxiety disorder of deficiency of both heart and spleen&#xD;
      type. Both the treatment group and the control group will be randomly assigned 70 cases.&#xD;
      Patients in the treatment group will be treated by Abdominal Massage for 6 weeks，and the&#xD;
      control group by buspirone . The total study includes 4 views that are respectively before&#xD;
      the treatment，after 3 weeks treatment, after the whole treatment , and 3 months after the&#xD;
      whole treatment. At all of the 4 views, all participants will be estimated the scores of&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD) ,self-rating anxiety scale(SAS), and Quality of life&#xD;
      assessment scale. At the second, third and the forth views, all participants will be&#xD;
      estimated Clinical Global Impression ( CGI). At the first and the third views, all&#xD;
      participants will be collected the data of content of hydroxytryptamine（5-HT）, Norepinephrine&#xD;
      and total cortisol in blood plasma, and of blood stream speed, vascular resistance index and&#xD;
      pulsatility index of middle cerebral artery （MCA）, anterior cerebral artery（ACA）, posterior&#xD;
      cerebral artery （PCA） and basilar artery（BA）. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Abdominal Massage Therapy vs. buspirone, and discover the correlation between these scales&#xD;
      and these objective indicators.&#xD;
