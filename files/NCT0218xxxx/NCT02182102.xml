  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerate dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed. Secondary objectives were to characterize&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic profiles of BIBF 1120 and pemetrexed and to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumour efficacy information.&#xD;
