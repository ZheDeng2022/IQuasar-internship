    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, prospective interventional study to assess the&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of Harnalidge® OCAS® 0.4 mg in Taiwan patients who are unsatisfied&#xD;
      with tamsulosin 0.2 mg for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated&#xD;
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent, subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and not violating&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive Harnalidge® OCAS® 0.4 mg for treatment.&#xD;
      The interventional period for the study is three months after the first date of enrollment or&#xD;
      until the patients are discontinued the treatment of Harnalidge® OCAS®. All subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the site if a patient's partner becomes pregnant during or within 90&#xD;
      days from the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator should report the information to&#xD;
      the sponsor as if it is an SAE.&#xD;
