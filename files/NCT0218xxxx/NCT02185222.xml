    <textblock>
      As recommended allowance of oral vitamine D are unable to ensure the recommended serum&#xD;
      concentration of vitamine D, the purpose of this study is to show that a dose of vitamin D3&#xD;
      higher than the recommended allowance may slow the cognitive decline of patients with a&#xD;
      memory complaint.&#xD;
