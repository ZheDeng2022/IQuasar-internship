  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI) has an increasing prevalence in the geriatric population which cannot&#xD;
      be explained by co-morbidity or anatomical and psychological changes of aging alone. In the&#xD;
      nursing home population previous studies suggest a prevalence between 10 and 69%, but is most&#xD;
      often reported to be between 40 and 55%. FI leads to a high direct and indirect economic&#xD;
      burden to the health-care system, and is an important cause og institutionalization of the&#xD;
      elderly patients. In addition, FI is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of identifying treatable causes of FI in the frail elderly, rather than just&#xD;
      managing passively, is strongly emphasized. It is indicated that the level of awareness among&#xD;
      health personnel regarding appropriate assessment and treatment options is limited, and that&#xD;
      FI is considered a normal part of aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on the assumption that FI among nursing home patients can be prevented,&#xD;
      cured or ameliorated by offering nursing home staff knowledge of best practise. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for&#xD;
      staff on assessment and treatment of FI, is associated with a reduction in patients'&#xD;
      frequency of FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is a two armed cluster randomized trail (C-RCT) with a repeated&#xD;
      cross-sectional approach.The results will be analysed according to multilevel and&#xD;
      longitudinal modelling, and the study will use mixed effect models with the cluster treated&#xD;
      as a random effect.&#xD;

    <description>As measured by The Long-Term Care Facilities Assessment System (interRAI-LTCF 2012), section H: Continence. Because of relatively high risk of death and movement out of clusters, a repeated cross-sectional opproach to analyses will be used. Frequency of FI will thereby be analysed on a across-sectional group level.</description>
