      Introduction: Among the systems of the organism, it is believed that the respiratory system&#xD;
      is the one which gets older faster due to the greater exposure to environmental pollutants&#xD;
      over the years.The Pilates method has emerged as a form of fitness particularly providing&#xD;
      general welfare to the individual. Objective: To evaluate the effects of Pilates' exercises&#xD;
      on respiratory muscle strength in elderly women. Methods: The investigators have studied 07&#xD;
      women aged 60 and over, with preserved autonomy and cognitive skills. The Pulmonary Function&#xD;
      Test (Spirometry) was performed using the Vitalograph® spirometer, model 8600. Respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength was obtained by technical measurements of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)&#xD;
      and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), through an analog Gerar manometer. The experiment&#xD;
      lasted eleven (11) weeks. For comparative analysis of the data obtained in the evaluations,&#xD;
      the investigators applied the paired t test and a significance level of 5%.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY This study is a clinical, longitudinal, prospective trial conducted at the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Kinesiology and Cinesioterapia of Physiotherapy, Federal University of&#xD;
      Triangulo Mineiro - UFTM. All participants signed an informed consent. The research started&#xD;
      after approval by the Ethics Committee UFTM Research Protocol (2147-2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Initially the invitation was made to all students enrolled in the Open University of&#xD;
      Third Age - UATI / UFTM from August to October 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection was based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age and above 60 years, (2)&#xD;
      non-practicing regular physical activity, (3) availability to attend Pilates classes twice a&#xD;
      week (in addition to the time UATI ) and (4) with preserved cognitive autonomy and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: history (1) diseases that directly affect the posture (disc herniation and angular&#xD;
      deformities of the spine), (2) cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases that&#xD;
      prevent attainment of Pilates exercises, (3) impaired cognitive capacity limited autonomy or&#xD;
      self-determination, (4) withdrawal of participation during the assessment process, and (5)&#xD;
      two consecutive absences or a total of three absences during the proposed time for the&#xD;
      training set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the proposed methodology for this study was applied in seven women with a mean age of&#xD;
      64 ± 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review / Procedures The assessment instruments were used: (1) Initial Assessment Sheet, (2)&#xD;
      spirometer and (3) manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The record initial assessment and spirometry were applied for the selection of participants.&#xD;
      Through the initial evaluation form was possible to assess aspects of health status of&#xD;
      participants (associated diseases, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rate, postural&#xD;
      assessment) as well as information on personal history, family history and current medication&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pulmonary function test (spirometry) was performed using the Vitalograph ® spirometer brand&#xD;
      model 8600. Equipment was calibrated, and the tests were performed by a single trained and&#xD;
      qualified examiner with instructions and standardized voice commands, as I standards&#xD;
      advocated by Consensus Brazilian on Espirometria.12 Spirometry was performed to rule out any&#xD;
      lung disease that affects the performance of the proposed exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess respiratory muscle strength, the volunteers remained in the standing position using&#xD;
      a nose clip. Respiratory muscle strength was obtained by the techniques of measurements of&#xD;
      maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), by means of an&#xD;
      analog manometer Generate brand, scaled to ± 300 cmH2O, equipped with nozzle adapter,&#xD;
      containing a hole 2 mm in diameter, serving as relief of muscles bocais.4 MIP valve was&#xD;
      obtained with the maximal inspiration preceded by maximal expiration to residual volume level&#xD;
      and MEP through the maximal expiration preceded by a maximal inspiration, to total lung&#xD;
      capacity. Were performed at least three maneuvers maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal&#xD;
      expiratory pressure, in order to obtain the greatest value from three acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of respiratory muscle strength occurred through an analog manometer (Ger-Air&#xD;
      ®, São Paulo, Brazil), with scales - 300 to +300 cmH2O (calibrated), equipped with plastic&#xD;
      trachea 16 cm long and 2.4 cm internal diameter, hard plastic mouthpiece and drain hole&#xD;
      approximately 2 mm in diameter to dissipate the pressures generated by the muscles of the&#xD;
      face and orofaringe.13 the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and expiratory pressures were&#xD;
      obtained maximum (MEP), carried a maximum of five times, acceptable and reproducible, and in&#xD;
      the standing position, using a nose clip, for a time of sustained three seconds. The value of&#xD;
      MIP was obtained from residual volume, and MEP from total lung capacity. Volunteers were due&#xD;
      verbal encouragement and if there were more than 10% between a measure and another, a new&#xD;
      difference maneuver was performed, considering the highest value since this was not the&#xD;
      último.14 Therapeutic Intervention - Pilates Method The training through the Pilates&#xD;
      exercises were performed in eleven weeks. The participants were instructed not to miss and&#xD;
      attend classes twice a week. Each class consisted of five exercises lasting 40 minutes each&#xD;
      lesson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first four weeks (1 st to 4 th week) exercises performed were: Cat, Coffee Table,&#xD;
      Single legcircle, pelvic movements, contraction of the glutes and closure was performed with&#xD;
      posterior chain elongation range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next four weeks (5th to 8th weeks) began a new series of exercises, which are: Bridge,&#xD;
      Side Table, Bridge hip roll with legextension, Abdominal - halfhollup, obliques, and&#xD;
      ultimately Stretching - Series of William's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last four weeks of training (9th to 11th weeks) proposed a new series of exercises&#xD;
      involving: Beaststroke, Support heel Bridge - hip roll with leg extension, and Hundred Squats&#xD;
      with bat on the wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercises were performed during expiration. Statistical Analysis Descriptive data&#xD;
      analysis was performed, with a mean and standard deviation. For comparative analysis of the&#xD;
      data obtained in the pre-and post-intervention, the paired t test was applied (after&#xD;
      confirmed the normal distribution of the sample - Shapiro Wilk test). The level of&#xD;
      significance was set at 5%. The statistical program used was 18.0 SSPSS.&#xD;
