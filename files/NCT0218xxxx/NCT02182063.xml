    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of BIBF 1120 (250&#xD;
      mg twice daily versus 150 mg twice daily) in an exploratory manner. Safety, quality of life&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic parameters on a sub-sample of 20 patients were also analysed for the two&#xD;
      different doses.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             guidelines and local law&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Progression after orchidectomy or during LH-RH (Luteinising hormone - releasing&#xD;
             hormone) analogs with castrate testosterone serum levels &lt;30 ng/ml (chemical&#xD;
             castration had to be continued) and absence of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Minimum value of PSA = 20 ng/ml at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Stopping the previous treatment with docetaxel based regimen or/and with antiandrogen&#xD;
             4 weeks before the inclusion of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Progression after only one previous chemotherapy with docetaxel based regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Appearance of a new lesion or increase of an existing measurable / non measurable&#xD;
                  lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increase of PSA ≥ 25% documented by two successive exams&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increase of pain if there is a correlation with a radiological progression or&#xD;
                  with a PSA increase as defined above&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin within normal limits, ALT (Alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase) and/or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal&#xD;

             psychiatric-, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or study drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the&#xD;
             patient inappropriate for entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Significant cardiovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, instable angina,&#xD;
