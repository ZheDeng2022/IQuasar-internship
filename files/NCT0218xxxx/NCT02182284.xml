    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to establish the relative bioavailability of a new soft&#xD;
      gelatin capsule (SGC) formulation of BI 201335 NA compared to the current solution&#xD;
      formulation (powder in bottle, PIB) for two doses (40 mg, 240 mg) in a parallel, two-way&#xD;
      cross-over study design.&#xD;
