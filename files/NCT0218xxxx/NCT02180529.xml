      Background: The increase in life expectancy and the rise in the ratio of older to younger&#xD;
      people in the population has resulted in an increase in the number of those suffering from a&#xD;
      decrease in cognitive ability, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methylphenidate can&#xD;
      improve cognitive ability, mainly in memory and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines the effect of Ritalin treatment in older people suffering from MCI. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that treatment with Ritalin will improve cognitive function in those suffering&#xD;
      from MCI, especially in the domains of attention and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A randomized, double-blind, case-control study. 120 patients older than 65 years of&#xD;
      age diagnosed as suffering from MCI in the past year in geriatric assessment facilities in&#xD;
      Beersheva. Patients will be randomized in equal groups to either the study group (Ritalin&#xD;
      treatment) and control group (placebo). Each participant will attend the geriatric unit for&#xD;
      four consecutive days: on the day prior to beginning the intervention participants will&#xD;
      undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 am. On the intervention days (days 2-4) participants&#xD;
      will undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 in the morning, followed by the administration (at&#xD;
      10:30) of different doses of Ritalin (10, 20 and 30mg) every day of intervention.&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive placebo. Two hours after taking the drug or&#xD;
      placebo participants in both groups will be assessed cognitively by means of Mindstreams and&#xD;
      MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Ritalin treatment will improve the cognitive function of the subjects,&#xD;
      mainly in the domains of concentration and executive function&#xD;
