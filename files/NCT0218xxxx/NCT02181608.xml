      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to see if people with alcohol dependence have more trouble learning to&#xD;
      feel calm, or learn to fear things more easily, than non-alcoholics and to study how early&#xD;
      life stress (ELS) affects these things.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if people with alcohol dependence and/or ELS have a harder time learning to feel&#xD;
      calm than people without these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 21 65 with diagnosed alcohol dependence, with/without ELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers age 21 65 with/without ELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have&#xD;
           blood and urine tests, and a psychological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with alcohol dependence will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be at the NIH Clinical Center for 4 weeks. Then they will have weekly telephone calls&#xD;
           and 3 in-person visits over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow the NIH alcohol treatment program during the study. They cannot take psychiatric&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate their alcohol craving, depression, and anxiety throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have fear conditioning and extinction sessions that use noise and mild electric shock.&#xD;
           Some take place during a functional MRI (fMRI) scan. Participants will lie in a machine&#xD;
           that takes images, while they perform tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  listen to recordings that describe stressful events. They will rate their feelings and&#xD;
           have blood drawn through an intravenous (IV) line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have their hormone response to stress tested. They will take a pill and get a hormone&#xD;
           via an IV, then have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have 2 inpatient stays, each lasting a few days. They will answer questions about how&#xD;
           they feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have fear conditioning and extinction sessions, including fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood drawn several times.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of early life stress (ELS),&#xD;
      alcohol dependence (AD), and their interaction in psychophysiology and neural mechanisms of&#xD;
      fear conditioning and extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of interest is fear extinction, as measured by laboratory-based and fMRI&#xD;
      paradigms. Secondary objectives of the study include: (1) explore the impact of early life&#xD;
      stress on behavioral and endocrine response to challenge procedures among individuals with&#xD;
      AD; (2) explore differences in reward processing, emotion processing, and neural response to&#xD;
      alcohol beverages as measured by fMRI as a function of AD and ELS; and (3) examine the&#xD;
      relationship between fear extinction and clinical outcomes in our patient sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample includes four groups: 1) treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence (AD) and ELS exposure; 2) treatment seeking individuals with alcohol dependence&#xD;
      without ELS exposure; 3) healthy social drinkers without alcohol use disorders (AUD) but with&#xD;
      ELS exposure; and 4) healthy social drinkers without AUD and without ELS exposure. Target&#xD;
      accrual for each of these groups is 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be evaluated for fear conditioning and extinction using two separate&#xD;
      paradigms: an out-of-the scanner shock conditioning extinction procedure that utilizes&#xD;
      acoustic startle, and a shock conditioning extinction procedure combined with fMR imaging&#xD;
      that utilizes galvanic skin response. In addition, the two alcohol dependent groups will be&#xD;
      evaluated for several biomarkers including a guided imagery procedure designed to induce&#xD;
      stress and/or craving for alcohol, and an assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)&#xD;
      axis function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include fear-potentiated startle responses and galvanic skin&#xD;
      responses; and neural BOLD fMRI responses during presentation of fear associated stimuli.&#xD;
      Secondary and exploratory measures in alcohol dependent subjects include measures of distress&#xD;
      and craving for alcohol in response to guided imagery scripts; neuroendocrine stress&#xD;
      responses and clinical outcomes (alcohol consumption and self-reported anxiety and mood&#xD;
      symptoms).&#xD;
