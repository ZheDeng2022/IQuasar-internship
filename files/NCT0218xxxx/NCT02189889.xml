    <textblock>
      Anemia which is a decreased blood count or lower than normal hemoglobin (hgb), is a major&#xD;
      health problem for patients having heart surgery. Hemoglobin is the part of our blood that&#xD;
      carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia that is present before surgery,&#xD;
      called preoperative anemia, is a risk factor for an increased chance of morbidity (illness)&#xD;
      and/or mortality (death) after heart surgery. It is also an important indicator of blood&#xD;
      transfusion necessity. Recent clinical research investigations done to study preoperative&#xD;
      anemia suggest a blood transfusion can damage the immune system (the system that protects us&#xD;
      from disease) which can lead to infection, organ dysfunction (especially of the heart,&#xD;
      kidney, brain), prolonged hospital stays, as well as increased supplies, resources and cost&#xD;
      in surgical patients. Comprehensive anemia management can reduce or eliminate the need for&#xD;
      blood transfusions and provide better outcomes after surgery. Therefore, controlling anemia&#xD;
      before surgery is extremely important, and could be a lifesaving measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot, feasibility study is being done for several reasons. First of all, it will test&#xD;
      the the safety and effectiveness of using a short-course of two medications, erythropoietin&#xD;
      (EPO) and Feraheme (iron given intravenously [IV]), to increase hemoglobin levels in order to&#xD;
      improve preoperative anemia, reduce transfusions and lower postoperative complications in&#xD;
      anemic patients undergoing heart surgery. Secondly, findings will be used to design a large&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT will establish a protocol to actively manage&#xD;
      anemia before surgery, thus reducing transfusions during surgery and improving recovery&#xD;
      afterwards. It will also help identify valuable information regarding what needs to be done&#xD;
      for timely completion of the planned RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPO is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used to treat anemia&#xD;
      in patients with certain conditions in order to reduce blood transfusions. And although&#xD;
      approved for use during surgery, it has not been FDA approved for use in cardiac (heart) or&#xD;
      vascular (blood vessels, including veins and arteries) surgery. Common side effects include&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, itching, headache, injection site pain, chills, deep vein thrombosis (blood&#xD;
      clot), cough, and changes in blood pressure (BP). Feraheme is an iron replacement product&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of low iron anemia in adult patients. It may cause serious&#xD;
      allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (severe, whole body allergic reaction), as well as&#xD;
      low BP and excessive iron storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all eligibility requirements that consent to participate will be randomized&#xD;
      into the study. Randomization is being placed by chance (like a flip of a coin) into one of&#xD;
      two study groups, the treatment group or the control group. There is an equal chance of being&#xD;
      placed into either group, which will be done by a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Treatment Group will receive a 300 unit (U) per kilogram (kg) injection of EPO and a&#xD;
           510 milligram (mg) IV infusion of Feraheme 7-28 days before the day of surgery. And&#xD;
           again 1-7 days before the day of surgery, a second dose of both of these medications&#xD;
           will be given. The third dose, of EPO only, will be administered 2 days after surgery.&#xD;
           Before initiating a dose or giving a subsequent dose, laboratory parameters will be&#xD;
           measured to assess the hemoglobin level and response to the medication. If blood values&#xD;
           increase too rapidly or are too high, the meds will not be started or, if already dosed,&#xD;
           they will not be given again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Control Group will receive no preoperative intervention for anemia unless lab&#xD;
           results show iron deficiency anemia. The control group will be screened for the presence&#xD;
           of iron deficiency anemia by evaluating blood laboratory values drawn during the&#xD;
           baseline or preoperative visit. If lab results indicate iron deficiency anemia,&#xD;
           over-the-counter oral iron will be recommended, to take until the day of surgery. In&#xD;
           doing so, patients may benefit by potentially reducing the need for blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from all participants from the preoperative visits throughout the&#xD;
      admission, including lab results, medications, vital signs, information about the procedure,&#xD;
      transfusions, and any problems or adverse events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anemia and transfusion are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in the cardiac&#xD;
      surgical patient population. Even so, active preoperative anemia management is not currently&#xD;
      the standard of care at our institution. Cost associated with erythrocyte transfusions at&#xD;
      University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) University Hospitals exceeds twenty million dollars&#xD;
      annually, not including costs associated with treatment of known complications of red cell&#xD;
      transfusions (renal insufficiency, respiratory failure, infection and prolonged length of&#xD;
      stay, etc). Fifty percent of our cardiac surgical population suffer from preoperative anemia&#xD;
      and 79% of these patients will receive one or more red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. In&#xD;
      contrast, the incidence of RBC transfusion was only 35% in those without preoperative anemia&#xD;
      in the calendar year 2011-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of injury in patients with preoperative anemia is either the duration/intensity&#xD;
      of the anemia exposure and resultant organ ischemia, or the harmful effects of erythrocyte&#xD;
      transfusion(s) itself. Active preoperative anemia management is a strategy that attempts to&#xD;
      minimize both of these events, and in doing so, exert an additive or possibly synergistic&#xD;
      effect on improving clinical outcomes. A randomized controlled trial utilizing a standardized&#xD;
      transfusion strategy is a necessary step in determining if increases in preoperative&#xD;
      hemoglobin lead to improved outcomes. A pilot, feasibility study is the first essential step&#xD;
      in insuring the adequacy of future trials designed to answer this important question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APART study is being conducted to test the safety and efficacy of using a short-course&#xD;
      (1-4 weeks) of EPO plus Feraheme to increase erythrocyte mass. The findings will be used to&#xD;
      guide the design of a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) that examines the effects of active&#xD;
      preoperative anemia management on erythrocyte transfusion and clinical outcomes. The RCT will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that a short-course (1-4 weeks) of EPO plus Feraheme is superior to the&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) at reducing transfusion and improving outcomes in anemic patients&#xD;
      scheduled for cardiac surgery. Means and standard deviations derived from pilot data on&#xD;
      changes in hemoglobin levels, reticulocyte counts and differences in erythrocyte transfusions&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes will be analyzed for possible use in sample size calculations for the&#xD;
      larger RCT. This pilot will also provide information in determining logistics for timely&#xD;
      completion of the RCT, and will also address data collection, data management, adherence to&#xD;
      the study protocol, transfusion and surveillance strategies and classification of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Study Specific Aims Include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the proportion of patients who fulfill all the eligibility criteria for the&#xD;
           study and agree to be part of a randomized trial of short-course EPO plus supplemental&#xD;
           Feraheme (up to 3 doses given over a 1-4 week interval prior to surgery) vs. standard of&#xD;
           care management in patients scheduled for coronary bypass grafting (CABG), valve&#xD;
           surgery, or CABG/valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the adherence of patients and health care team to the procedures included&#xD;
           in the study protocol (scheduled appointments, surveillance and transfusion strategies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the increase in hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts following a&#xD;
           short-course of EPO plus supplemental Feraheme over a 1-4 week interval prior to the&#xD;
           date of surgery vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG, valve,&#xD;
           or CABG/valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess differences in the proportion of patients receiving erythrocyte transfusions&#xD;
           and number of blood products utilized (RBC, platelets and plasma) in the peri- and&#xD;
           post-operative periods for those receiving a short-course of EPO plus supplemental&#xD;
           Feraheme vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG, valve or&#xD;
           CABG/valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the frequency and intensity of pre-defined clinical outcomes (mortality,&#xD;
           major cardiac, renal, neurological events [associated with anemia] and infection) in the&#xD;
           peri- and post-operative periods for those receiving a short-course of EPO plus Feraheme&#xD;
           vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG, valve, or CABG/valve&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts from baseline to the day of surgery&#xD;
      and postop day (POD) 5, proportion of patients receiving transfusions and number of blood&#xD;
      products utilized and the pre-defined clinical events will be assessed between the two&#xD;
      groups. Each patient will be enrolled in the study up to 28 days before the day of surgery&#xD;
      and for up to 30 days following the day of surgery. This pilot, feasibility study will enroll&#xD;
      50 subjects (25 per group). Both groups will have detailed clinical data and biological&#xD;
      specimens collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG, valve, CABG/valve) with anemia&#xD;
           will be identified in advance of their operations. Basic features of patient medical and&#xD;
           surgical histories (i.e. age, gender, type of surgery) will be screened. If eligible for&#xD;
           the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be consented into the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Visit: Data on demographics, lab results, vital signs, medical history, current&#xD;
           medications, height/weight will be reviewed and recorded. Randomization by computer will&#xD;
           be done and the patient will receive the 1st dose of study drugs, as assigned, then&#xD;
           monitored for any serious reactions (chest pain, dyspnea, seizures, severe headache,&#xD;
           fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in BP). Control group patients with evidence&#xD;
           of iron-deficiency by laboratory criteria will be advised to initiate supplementation&#xD;
           with a non-prescription, over-the-counter oral iron preparation (ferrous sulfate 325 mg,&#xD;
           three times a day is commonly used) to be taken until the planned surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-op Visit: Patients will receive the 2nd dose of study drugs as assigned. Vital signs&#xD;
           (heart rate, BP, oxygen saturation, temperature) will be recorded before and after drug&#xD;
           administration, then monitored for any serious adverse events; SOC lab results;&#xD;
           reticulocyte count, troponin, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) samples will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day of Surgery: Patient vital signs (BP, electrocardiogram [EKG], etc) will be monitored&#xD;
           as part of standard of care. Reticulocyte count, iron panel (includes transferrin,&#xD;
           ferritin, total iron binding capacity, iron level) samples will be collected. SOC lab&#xD;
           results, record of transfusions, estimated blood loss, adverse events will be&#xD;
           monitored/recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POD 2: Troponin, CK-MB, Rotem (Rotational thromboelastometry) samples will be collected.&#xD;
           Patients will receive study drug, as assigned, then monitored for serious events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POD 1-7: Vital signs (BP, EKG, etc) will be monitored; SOC lab results, record of&#xD;
           transfusions, and adverse events will be monitored/recorded. Estimated blood loss will&#xD;
           be recorded on POD 1 and 2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other lab to be collected: POD 1 - reticulocyte count, iron panel, troponin, CK-MB; POD&#xD;
           2 - troponin, CK-MB, Rotem; POD 5 - reticulocyte count, iron panel, aspartate&#xD;
           transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT); POD 7 - complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
           reticulocyte count, creatinine; POD 14 or discharge (whichever comes first) - CBC,&#xD;
           creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion Strategy: Erythrocyte transfusion is permitted during cardiopulmonary bypass,&#xD;
      during surgery and afterwards per protocol, when criteria is met. Red cell transfusions&#xD;
      should be given one unit at a time with measurement of the pre- and post-transfusion&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels along with physiologic parameters used to assess adequacy of organ&#xD;
      perfusion. A consensus for transfusion thresholds was established among anesthesiologists,&#xD;
      perfusionists and surgeons in our practice. The transfusion thresholds implemented in this&#xD;
      protocol reflects our current &quot;standard of care;&quot; a threshold at which clinicians generally&#xD;
      believe the benefits of erythrocyte transfusion outweigh the risks. Adherence to the&#xD;
      transfusion strategy will be recorded by the research nurse and protocol deviations will be&#xD;
      discussed with the attending physician of record and a member of the clinical research team.&#xD;
      However, research staff will not order nor prohibit erythrocyte transfusions. This will be&#xD;
      left to the discretion of the treating physician(s) if he/she deems it clinically necessary.&#xD;
      Following randomization, patient's charts will be clearly labeled to indicate participation&#xD;
      in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance Strategy: The decision to initiate and continue administering doses of EPO is&#xD;
      based on evidence accrued from randomized controlled trials and clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      provided by multiple sub-specialty and international societies. Substantial heterogeneity&#xD;
      exists in factors that could be included in a surveillance strategy to minimize the risk of a&#xD;
      thrombotic event in this setting; with no one strategy proven to be superior. The&#xD;
      surveillance strategy included in this protocol derives from, what we believe to be, the most&#xD;
      current safety analyses of perioperative EPO use reflected in the literature. Implementing&#xD;
      such surveillance methods are intended to minimize the possibly rare but potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening adverse events. Risk factors considered in our surveillance strategy&#xD;
      include: evidence of unstable angina or myocardial infarction, recent thrombotic event,&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels associated with a higher risk of a myocardial event, excessive&#xD;
      thrombocytosis or laboratory evidence of a hypercoagulable postoperative state. EPO dosing&#xD;
      will be stratified based on patient risk (degree of perioperative anemia), type of procedure&#xD;
      (CABG vs. valve) and laboratory data (hgb, Rotem). All doses will be given per surveillance&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Point: The primary objective is to assess the enrollment rate and adherence to&#xD;
      the dosing protocol and surveillance strategies. We define successful adherence as adherence&#xD;
      to dosing in more than 90% of patients for more than 90% of the doses deemed appropriate by&#xD;
      the surveillance strategy. Secondary outcomes will include changes in hemoglobin levels and&#xD;
      reticulocyte counts within the two groups from baseline to the day of surgery and POD 5,&#xD;
      number of RBC units transfused, frequency of pre-specified clinical outcomes and incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events in each of the study groups. Data from this pilot study will be used for the&#xD;
      power analysis and design of the larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) are events that involve physiological, social, or psychological harm to&#xD;
      subjects or risks of harm to additional subjects or others. AEs include expected and&#xD;
      unexpected harmful effects, and unexpected risks of an interaction or an intervention. AEs&#xD;
      may be caused by: the test article or test procedure, other aspects of the interaction or&#xD;
      intervention, the subject's underlying condition, or the subject's concurrent standard&#xD;
      treatment. AEs may be definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely to be&#xD;
      related, or definitely not related to the research. We will report all adverse events and&#xD;
      other reportable incidences to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) per reporting guidelines.&#xD;
      Any adverse event will be documented of that event including a description, subject number,&#xD;
      date, outcome, and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events associated with&#xD;
      the use of the study medications. These include: hypersensitivity (e.g. pruritis, rash, and&#xD;
      urticaria), hypertension, hypotension, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, injection site pain, deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis or other thrombotic complications. Surveillance for these adverse events&#xD;
      will be conducted by direct observation (during drug administration), daily bedside visits by&#xD;
      the research nurse for the first 7 postoperative days, review of the patients medical record&#xD;
      and listing any of these complications in the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) database. The&#xD;
      definition of a stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), mesenteric artery occlusion or peripheral&#xD;
      vascular event will be based on STS criteria. Any event resulting in death from time of&#xD;
      initial drug administration to hospital discharge will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator, along with the Secondary Investigators, will be responsible for&#xD;
      the monitoring, reviewing and analyses of study data. This will be done quarterly unless an&#xD;
      issue requires immediate attention or if a recurrent pattern develops into a need for a more&#xD;
      frequent review. An interim analysis will be done at 50% enrollment by the principal and&#xD;
      secondary investigators.&#xD;
