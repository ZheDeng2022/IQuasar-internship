    <textblock>
      S100B, a calcium-binding protein, is found predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      and is increased in CSF and blood after CNS injury. There are two objectives to this study.&#xD;
      Is urine S100B concentration correlated with the serum concentration of S100B in infants born&#xD;
      at 29-36 weeks gestation. The presence and severity of intracranial pathology on S100B&#xD;
      concentration will be investigated. Further analysis will demonstrate if birth weight, daily&#xD;
      fluid intake, urine output, and urine creatinine influence this relationship.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S100B is a low molecular weight calcium binding protein found predominantly in the central&#xD;
      nervous system, specifically astroglial cells.[1] S100B plays a role in calcium-dependent&#xD;
      information processing and intracellular is involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton and&#xD;
      cell morphology.[1] S100B is secreted by astrocytes and exhibits dose dependent extracellular&#xD;
      cytokine functions. In tissue culture at nanomolar concentration, S100B stimulates neuronal&#xD;
      growth, development, and regeneration and protects against degeneration. At micromolar&#xD;
      concentration, S100B is neurotoxic [2] and stimulates apoptosis potentially through&#xD;
      interaction with RAGE receptor, by induction of NO synthase, and through the caspase cascade.&#xD;
      Thus, markedly elevated concentration of S100B, released from damaged astrocytes, may&#xD;
      propagate neuronal death. To support this hypothesis, over expression of S100B is present in&#xD;
      wobble mice, an animal model for neuronal degeneration.[3] S100B is also increased in brains&#xD;
      of patients with Alzheimer's disease [1] and in the amniotic fluid of fetuses [4] and brains&#xD;
      of patients with Down's syndrome.[1]&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B is released from damaged astroglial cells and may indirectly reflect neuronal&#xD;
      damage.[5,6] S100B is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adult patients within 48 hours&#xD;
      after infarction and remains elevated for at least 7 days after the event.[6] S100B is also&#xD;
      elevated in CSF for the first 3 days after traumatic brain injury [7] and subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage.[8] S100B readily crosses a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier and serum&#xD;
      concentration of S100B is significantly increased in adult patients after traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury [9], stroke [10], or cardiac arrest.[5] Serum S100B rises for 2-4 days after brain&#xD;
      trauma or infarct and its concentration correlates with size of damage as identified by CT&#xD;
      scan. [9,10] For patients with traumatic brain injury, elevated concentration of S100B was&#xD;
      noted on admission and significantly predicted development of increased intracranial pressure&#xD;
      4-5 days later. [9] After cardiac arrest, serum S100B concentration was statistically&#xD;
      elevated by 30 minutes after initiation of CPR and continued to be significantly elevated in&#xD;
      those patients who later exhibited brain damage by CT scan or neurological exam.[5] This&#xD;
      significant elevation in serum S100B lasted for at least 7 days. In addition, serum S100B&#xD;
      concentration correlated with morbidity [9] and neurological outcome. [10] While the t1/2 of&#xD;
      S100B is ~2 hours in adults, persistent increased concentration of S100B in serum indicates&#xD;
      continuous release from damaged cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B has been shown to be differentially distributed in different cortical regions of the&#xD;
      brain during fetal development and increases in concentration during gestation, supporting&#xD;
      its role in the development and maturation of the CNS.[11] It is postulated that early in&#xD;
      development, S100B leads to glial cell proliferation while later it leads to extension of&#xD;
      neurites, regulation of fiber sprouting, formation/maintenance of synapses, and maturation of&#xD;
      glial cells.[1] Cord blood concentration of S100B has been shown to be inversely related to&#xD;
      gestational age between 27 to 42 weeks gestation.[12] Thirty term infants (37-42 weeks) had&#xD;
      cord blood S100B levels &lt; 1 ug/L while 28 preterm infants (27-36 weeks) had cord blood levels&#xD;
      between 0.5 and 2.7 ug/L. Higher serum concentration of S100B may be due to the lack of&#xD;
      integrity of the blood-brain barrier in preterm infants in conjunction with an increased&#xD;
      secretion of S100B from astroglial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its low molecular weight (10.5 kD) and high degree of solubility, S100B is excreted&#xD;
      through the kidneys. It has been detected in the first void urine of infants between 26-42&#xD;
      weeks gestation with the most preterm infant exhibiting the highest concentration of S100B&#xD;
      (3.17 ug/L). [13] Urine S100B concentration was at the detection limit of the assay (0.02&#xD;
      ug/L) for term infants. There was a significant negative correlation between S100B&#xD;
      concentration in the urine and gestational age (r=-.79, p&lt;0.001), but the data was not shown.&#xD;
      Only 23 preterm infants (gestational age 26-36 weeks) were enrolled in the study and the&#xD;
      average gestational age was not stated. Previous study from this laboratory demonstrated that&#xD;
      urine S100B concentration did not significantly vary between 23-28 weeks gestation. {spr}&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with CNS injury have increased CSF, serum, and urine concentration of S100B. In&#xD;
      asphyxiated term infants who later developed intracranial hemorrhage, S100B was shown to be&#xD;
      elevated at 12 hours after birth when compared to asphyxiated term infants who did not&#xD;
      develop intracranial pathology and to control term infants.[14] In another report,&#xD;
      asphyxiated term infants, who at 3 months exhibited abnormal neurologic outcome or death, had&#xD;
      markedly elevated S100B levels 12-24 hours after birth.[15] However, that study was limited&#xD;
      by a small number of patients. Serum concentration of S100B was also significantly elevated&#xD;
      (2.9 ug/L) in 8 term infants 3 days after initiating ECMO therapy. Daily cranial ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation identified intracranial hemorrhage in these infants by day 5-6. In other words,&#xD;
      significant elevation of serum concentration of S100B occurred at least 2-3 days prior to&#xD;
      ultrasound evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Eight control infants, who also received ECMO&#xD;
      therapy, had no ultrasonic evidence of intracranial hemorrhage and had no change in S100B&#xD;
      above baseline (0.5 ug/L).[16]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common CNS trauma for preterm infants is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).[17] IVH&#xD;
      originates in the microcirculation/capillary network of the germinal matrix. Altered cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow secondary to poor cerebral autoregulation or systemic hypo- or hypertension,&#xD;
      platelet and coagulation disturbances as seen in infection, and decreased capillary integrity&#xD;
      and vascular support have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IVH. IVH is graded (1-4) by&#xD;
      extent of hemorrhage seen by ultrasound. In grade I IVH, the blood is confined to the&#xD;
      germinal matrix. In Grade II IVH, blood is present in the germinal matrix and a small of&#xD;
      blood is present in the ventricles. Grade III IVH occurs when the ventricles are filled with&#xD;
      blood and dilated. In Grade IV IVH, blood extends into the brain parenchyma due to venous&#xD;
      congestion of the terminal veins that border the lateral ventricles which leads to white&#xD;
      matter necrosis. Grades I and II IVH are not associated with an increase in developmental&#xD;
      abnormalities, but do not insure normalcy. Grades III and IV IVH (severe IVH) are highly&#xD;
      associated with developmental delay, specifically spastic hemiplegia affecting the lower&#xD;
      extremities more than the upper extremities due to the proximity of the hemorrhage to the&#xD;
      descending motor fibers, and may also affect intellect. IVH, both mild (grade 1-2) and severe&#xD;
      (grade 3-4) are rarely seen in infants with gestational age &gt; 28 weeks due to the&#xD;
      developmental involution of vessels in the germinal matrix which is the source of this&#xD;
      hemorrhage.[17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B is elevated in CSF, serum and urine in preterm infants with IVH. S100B is elevated in&#xD;
      CSF of preterm infants who had IVH and posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation and subsequent&#xD;
      neurologic disability at 12 months of age.[18] The timing of the ventricular tap was not&#xD;
      specified or uniform and correlation between IVH and serum concentration of S100B was not&#xD;
      determined. Serum concentration of S100B is increased in preterm infants (mean gestational&#xD;
      age 35 weeks) with IVH (grade 1-4) when compared to preterm infants without IVH.[19] In this&#xD;
      study, the highest serum level of S100B (5 ug/L) was noted in an infant who died. However,&#xD;
      that study was complicated by a small number of patients (11 with IVH and 14 control&#xD;
      infants), nonspecified range of gestational age, non-uniform blood sampling time (within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours after birth), and grade 1 IVH seen in 50% of the infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine concentration of S100B in preterm infants (29-35 weeks) with IVH (grade 2-4) is&#xD;
      elevated at birth and continues to increase over the subsequent 3 days when compared to&#xD;
      control preterm infants.[20] The severity of IVH significantly correlated with the level of&#xD;
      S100B in the urine. The highest level of S100B was seen in the five infants who died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that urine concentration of S100B was&#xD;
      elevated in those infants with gestational age 23-28 weeks with severe (grade 3 or 4 IVH)&#xD;
      when compared to control infants with no or grade 1 IVH on day 1. (SPR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important limitation of the above cited studies is insufficient numbers of neonates were&#xD;
      studied to allow correlation of both gestational age and presence of severe IVH on either&#xD;
      urine or serum S100B concentration. Most importantly, those studies involved preterm infants&#xD;
      whose gestational age was &gt; 27 weeks gestation. Severe IVH (grade 3-4) is rarely seen in&#xD;
      infants who are &gt; 28 weeks gestation. In addition, no report to date in adults, children, or&#xD;
      infants has defined the relationship between urine and serum concentration of S100B.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no report has clearly established baseline S100B concentration in infants with&#xD;
      gestational age &lt; 28 weeks. The specific aims of this study have been stated. If S100B&#xD;
      concentration is significantly increased in infants with severe IVH, then S100B concentration&#xD;
      may predict which infants are highly likely to develop severe IVH with ensuing significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and allow for early initiation of treatment to decrease extension of&#xD;
      intracranial damage.&#xD;
