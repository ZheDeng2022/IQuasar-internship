    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Among Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sezary Syndrome (SS) Participants (Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured Progressive Disease (PD) [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)]</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate is percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR as per modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for MF group; mSWAT and Sezary count for SS group. mSWAT is a weighted sum of percent (%) of total body surface area attributed to skin lesions which yield a mSWAT score [0 (unaffected) to 400 (severely affected)] transformed into responses. As per mSWAT (CR: No detectable malignant disease for ≥4 weeks; PR: ≥50% mSWAT score reduction from baseline). Sezary cells percentage in lymphocytes measured using flow cytometry. As per Sezary count (CR: Sezary cells &lt;5%; PR: ≥50% reduction in Sezary cells from baseline). Response rate is calculated as total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until PD or recurrence divided by the number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>Time from first confirmed response [Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)] until Progressive Disease (PD) as per mSWAT for MF group; mSWAT and Sezary count for SS group. mSWAT: weighted sum of percent (%) of total body surface area attributed to skin lesions; scores [0 (unaffected) to 400 (severely affected)] transformed into responses. As per mSWAT (CR: No detectable malignant disease for ≥4 weeks; PR: ≥50% reduction in mSWAT score from baseline; PD: ≥25% of mSWAT score from nadir). Sezary cells percentage in lymphocytes measured using flow cytometry. As per Sezary count (CR: Sezary cells &lt;5%; PR: ≥50% reduction in Sezary cells from baseline; PD: ≥40% of Sezary cells from nadir). Responders or those who died without PD were censored at date of last progression-free disease assessment. Responders who received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy were censored at date of last progression-free disease assessment prior to post-discontinuation therapy.</description>

    <description>Elapsed time from enrollment (baseline) to date of Progressive Disease (PD) as per mSWAT for Mycosis Fungoides (MF) group; mSWAT and Sezary count for Sezary Syndrome (SS) group. mSWAT: weighted sum of percent (%) of total body surface area attributed to skin lesions; scores [0 (unaffected) to 400 (severely affected)] transformed to responses. PD: ≥25% of mSWAT score from nadir. Sezary cells percentage in lymphocytes measured using flow cytometry. PD: ≥40% Sezary cells from nadir.

    <measure>Time to Objective Response for Responding Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to confirmed response [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)]</time_frame>
    <description>Elapsed time from date of study enrollment (baseline) to first evidence of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as per mSWAT for Mycosis Fungoides (MF) group; mSWAT and Sezary count for Sezary Syndrome (SS) group. mSWAT: weighted sum of percent (%) of total body surface area attributed to skin lesions; scores [0 (unaffected) to 400 (severely affected)] transformed into responses. As per mSWAT (CR: No detectable malignant disease for ≥4 weeks. PR: ≥50% mSWAT score reduction from baseline). Sezary cells percentage in lymphocytes measured using flow cytometry. As per Sezary count (CR: Sezary cells &lt;5%; PR: ≥50% reduction in Sezary cells from baseline). Response must be confirmed, but the time to objective response ended at the first assessment. Participants who were not confirmed responders did not contribute to the time to objective response calculation.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life Questionnaire-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health State Utility Score United States (US) Index (Participant-Reported Measure of Health-State Utility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to study completion [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)], end of treatment reported</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (1 (no problem), 2 (some problems), and 3 (extreme problems)). These combinations of attributes were converted into a single summary health-state index score by applying weights from the US-specific value set to the scoring algorithm. The EQ-5D US value set of health state index scores ranged from 0 (worst imagined health state) to 1 (best imagined health state).</description>

    <measure>Pruritus 5-Item Severity Assessment Questionnaire (Participant-Reported Experiences With Pruritus)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to study completion [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)], end of treatment reported</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their present level of itch through the use of an 11-point numeric rating scale anchored at 0 (no itch) and 10 (itch as bad as can be imagined).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Itchy Quality of Life (QoL) Domain and Total Scores (Participant-Reported Experiences With Pruritus)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to study completion [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)], end of treatment reported</time_frame>
    <description>The Itchy QoL is a non-validated 22-item questionnaire designed to assess pruritus-associated symptoms with a 7-day recall using 3 domains: Emotions (9 items), Functions (7 items) and Symptoms domain (6 items). Each Itchy QoL item was evaluated by level of itch frequency through the use of a 5-point adjectival scale 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (sometimes), 4 (often), 5 (all the time). Unweighted means were calculated individually for the 3 domains each with scores range from 1 to 5 and the total score is expressed as the mean of the three dimension scores and ranges from 1 (no itch) to 5 (worst imaginable itch).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Deaths (Safety and Tolerability of Enzastaurin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to study completion [up to 9 cycles (28-day cycles)] plus 30-day safety follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced 1 or more AEs or any serious AEs (SAEs) regardless of causality, deaths during the study including 30 days after treatment discontinuation. A summary of SAEs and other non-SAEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Among Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sezary Syndrome (SS) Participants (Response Rate)</title>
        <description>Response rate is percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR as per modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for MF group; mSWAT and Sezary count for SS group. mSWAT is a weighted sum of percent (%) of total body surface area attributed to skin lesions which yield a mSWAT score [0 (unaffected) to 400 (severely affected)] transformed into responses. As per mSWAT (CR: No detectable malignant disease for ≥4 weeks; PR: ≥50% mSWAT score reduction from baseline). Sezary cells percentage in lymphocytes measured using flow cytometry. As per Sezary count (CR: Sezary cells &lt;5%; PR: ≥50% reduction in Sezary cells from baseline). Response rate is calculated as total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until PD or recurrence divided by the number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (1 (no problem), 2 (some problems), and 3 (extreme problems)). These combinations of attributes were converted into a single summary health-state index score by applying weights from the US-specific value set to the scoring algorithm. The EQ-5D US value set of health state index scores ranged from 0 (worst imagined health state) to 1 (best imagined health state).</description>
