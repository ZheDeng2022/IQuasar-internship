    <textblock>
      This study will examine the way cognitive behavioral therapy changes the structure of the&#xD;
      brain in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and will thereby determine what makes&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy an effective treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) afflicts 2% to 4% of children and adolescents, who suffer&#xD;
      from persistent, unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors. One of the most effective&#xD;
      treatments of OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), yet researchers do not know how CBT&#xD;
      affects the brain. In this study, brain scans will be performed to determine concentrations&#xD;
      of several neurometabolites, which are chemicals involved in providing energy to the brain.&#xD;
      Of particular importance are the neurometabolites glutamine and glutamate, which, in addition&#xD;
      to providing energy to the brain, are among the most common excitatory neurotransmitters.&#xD;
      Disruption of glutamine and glutamate is thought to be related to OCD. By examining where in&#xD;
      the brain levels of glutamate and glutamine change, researchers will attempt to determine&#xD;
      whether CBT modifies brain activity, whether a circuit targeted by researchers is affected by&#xD;
      CBT, and how brain activity in people with OCD differs from that of people without the&#xD;
      disorder in terms of the targeted circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents ages 8 through 17 with OCD will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      receive a 12-week CBT intervention or be placed on a waiting list for 8 weeks before&#xD;
      receiving the 12-week intervention. A group of non-OCD participants in the same age group&#xD;
      will be used as a control. All groups will undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging&#xD;
      (MRSI), which will measure the concentrations of neurometabolites in multiple brain regions.&#xD;
      The control group and the group initially given the CBT intervention will be scanned upon&#xD;
      entry of the study and after 12 weeks. The group initially placed on a waiting list will be&#xD;
      scanned three times: once upon entry, once after the 8-week waiting period, and once after&#xD;
      the 12-week CBT intervention. To determine which participants are benefitting from the&#xD;
      treatment, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and other clinical and neurocognitive&#xD;
      measures will be administered concurrently with each brain scan.&#xD;
