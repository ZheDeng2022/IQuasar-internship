  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression affects over one million people in Canada, resulting in $14.4 billion per year in&#xD;
      costs to Canadian society. In order to prevent this often lifelong disorder, it is critically&#xD;
      important to identify risk factors for the recurrence of depression. A crucial force in&#xD;
      maintaining depression is the generation of stressful life events. That is, individuals who&#xD;
      have a history of depression are likely to generate the very events that precipitate future&#xD;
      depressive episodes (e.g., relationship break-up, fired from job, conflicts with the law) due&#xD;
      to negative personality characteristics and disrupted social support networks resulting from&#xD;
      previous episodes. This project is the first to test a model that examines the role of&#xD;
      negative personality, low social support, and childhood abuse and neglect as risk factors for&#xD;
      the generation of stressful life events that predict future depression. We will test this&#xD;
      model in a group of patients meeting formal criteria for depression who will be treated and&#xD;
      then followed up for 12 months or until depression recurrence. With this long-term design we&#xD;
      will be in a unique position to understand how depression is maintained over time, thus&#xD;
      suggesting important treatment strategies to prevent depression recurrence.&#xD;

      The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research&#xD;
      Programme (TDCRP) (Elkin et al., 1989; Sotsky et al., 1991) compared three forms of treatment&#xD;
      for depression -- imipramine plus clinical management (IMI-CM), cognitive behaviour therapy&#xD;
      alone (CBT), interpersonal therapy alone (IPT) -- against a placebo control plus clinical&#xD;
      management (PLA-CM) condition. These three treatments were found equally effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of the index episode of depression when compared to the placebo control (Elkin et&#xD;
      al., 1989). The results from the TDCRP study also indicated that patient characteristics,&#xD;
      irrespective of treatment modality, were predictive of treatment effects. Six patient&#xD;
      dimensions -- social dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, expectation for improvement,&#xD;
      endogenous features, double depression and duration of current episode -- were all found to&#xD;
      be significant predictors of outcome (Sotsky et al., 1991). Patient characteristics were also&#xD;
      found to be associated with differential outcome depending on treatment modality. Elevated&#xD;
      social dysfunction, for example, interfered with successful outcome in IPT, whereas cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction hindered successful outcome with CBT. Cognitive dysfunction also predicted poor&#xD;
      treatment response in the IMI-CM condition. Cognitive vulnerability would be expected to&#xD;
      mediate response to treatment in CBT, as the presumed mechanism of change is dysfunctional&#xD;
      depressogenic cognitions (e.g., Beck et al., 1979; Whisman, 1993). The finding that cognitive&#xD;
      vulnerability was also implicated in treatment response to a pharmacological intervention is&#xD;
      without theoretical explanation or specific causal agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed research is to further examine the relationship between treatment&#xD;
      outcome and patient characteristics associated depression. In particular, the relationship&#xD;
      between treatment outcome and two personality/cognitive characteristics implicated as&#xD;
      vulnerability factors for depression - self-criticism and dependency - will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the proposed investigation is to examine the relationship between change in&#xD;
      self-criticism and dependency and the relationship of this change to treatment response and&#xD;
      reduction in severity of depression. Mode-specific outcome measures will be administered to&#xD;
      outpatients with major depression randomly assigned and treated with CBT, IPT or PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study is to examine the issue of whether successful targeting of&#xD;
      either cognitive dysfunction in CBT or interpersonal functioning in IPT will result in a&#xD;
      reduced risk for relapse and/or recurrence of a major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the dependent type, who centres their definition of self entirely around&#xD;
      issues of affiliation with others, would be more likely to show changes related to such&#xD;
      themes in a therapeutic intervention specifically designed to address interpersonal problems.&#xD;
      In contrast, the self-critic who defines self primarily around issues related to achievement&#xD;
      and engages in excessively harsh and unrealistic self-appraisal would respond best to an&#xD;
      intervention that targeted these punitive cognitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES/RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of Treatment Outcome (Objective 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sets of hypotheses are proposed. In all analyses the DEQ will be used to assess&#xD;
      self-criticism and dependency. The first set of hypotheses involves mode specific treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and the second set of hypotheses address differences in the mechanisms of change&#xD;
      across the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set of hypotheses are: (a) all treatments will be equally effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of the index episode, (b) baseline self-criticism and dependency scores will&#xD;
      predict outcome in all treatments, with higher self-criticism and dependency scores related&#xD;
      to poor outcome, (c) CBT will demonstrate greater specificity for targeting self-criticism&#xD;
      than will either PHT or IPT, (d) IPT will demonstrate greater specificity for treating&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning than will either PHT or CBT, (e) PHT will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      specificity for treating endogenous symptoms than will either CBT or IPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second set of hypotheses are: (a) change in self-criticism scores and dysfunctional&#xD;
      cognitions will mediate a positive treatment response in CBT but not in IPT or PHT, (b)&#xD;
      change in dependency scores and interpersonal deficits will mediate positive treatment&#xD;
      response in IPT but not in CBT or PHT, (c) change in endogeneity will mediate positive&#xD;
      treatment response in PHT but not in CBT or IPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of Relapse and Recurrence (Objective 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that: (a) CBT and IPT will produce a lower rate of relapse and recurrence&#xD;
      than PHT because of the greater reduction in stable dysfunctional cognitions related to&#xD;
      either self-critical and/or interpersonal vulnerabilities; (b) in cases where interpersonal&#xD;
      vulnerabilities are predominant, IPT will produce lower rates of relapse and recurrence than&#xD;
      either CBT and PHT, in cases where self-critical vulnerabilities are predominant, CBT will&#xD;
      produce lower rates of relapse and recurrence than either IPT or PHT.&#xD;

    <description>Patients patients randomized to this condition will be treated for 16 weeks with different classes of anti-depressant medications, using standardized protocols. Patients will receive 16 weeks of treatment with either a SSRI (sertraline or paroxetine) or a SNRI (venlafaxine). The dose range is as follows: sertraline 50-200 mg/day, paroxetine 20-40 mg/day, venlafaxine 75-375 mg/day. Patients unable to continue with the prescribed medication due to side effects and/or lack of response will be prescribed an alternate medication during the first two weeks of the protocol.</description>
