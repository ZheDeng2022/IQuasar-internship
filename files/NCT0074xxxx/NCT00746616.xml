  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gather clinical information on the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      resurfacing devices in the young, active patient with advanced hip disease. Study enrollment&#xD;
      has been temporarily suspended due to a change in the surgical technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety will be evaluated based on the frequency and incidence of any device related adverse&#xD;
      events or unanticipated adverse device events. The efficacy will be measured by comparing the&#xD;
      overall functional performance based on the Harris Hip Score, implant survivorship, and&#xD;
      radiographic parameters, including radiolucencies, osteolysis, stem subsidence, cup&#xD;
      migration, and change in cup angle and a change in the femoral shaft angle.&#xD;
