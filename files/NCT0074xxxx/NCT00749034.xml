  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of VPM is the development of a recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin expressing&#xD;
      BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine against TB for&#xD;
      residents in endemic areas and persons at risk in non-endemic areas. The new live vaccine&#xD;
      VPM1002 should be at least as potent as the currently used BCG vaccine and should cause fewer&#xD;
      side effects (Kaufmann, 2007; Grode et al., 2005). It is formulated as lyophilised bacteria&#xD;
      to be resuspended before intradermal injection. First application of VPM1002 in human male&#xD;
      volunteers will evaluate its safety, local and systemic tolerability as well as its&#xD;
      immunogenicity. The study has a dose-escalating sequential design with comparison to&#xD;
      commercially available BCG. 80 volunteers in Germany will randomly be allocated to 4 groups&#xD;
      each with 20 volunteers stratified for their history of BCG-vaccination.&#xD;
