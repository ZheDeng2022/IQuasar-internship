    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, 3-period crossover trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction (process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and eliminated by&#xD;
      the body) between TMC125 and fluconazole, and between TMC125 and voriconazole.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this Phase I, open-label, 3-period crossover trial the potential pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction between TMC125 and fluconazole and between TMC125 and voriconazole will be&#xD;
      investigated. Fluconazole and voriconazole are triazole antifungal agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluconazole and voriconazole are inhibitors of CYP isoenzymes 2C19, 2C9 and CYP3A4.&#xD;
      Fluconazole is metabolized by the liver to a small extent. Approximately 80% of the&#xD;
      administered fluconazole dose appears in the urine in unchanged form. Voriconazole is&#xD;
      metabolized by CYP2C19, 2C9 and 3A4. TMC125 is also metabolized by CYP3A, 2C9 and 2C19.&#xD;
      Because of the effect of fluconazole and voriconazole on the metabolic pathways relevant for&#xD;
      TMC125 metabolism, concomitant administration of TMC125 and fluconazole or voriconazole might&#xD;
      increase TMC125 pharmacokinetics. Because of the effect of TMC125 on the metabolic pathways&#xD;
      relevant for voriconazole metabolism, concomitant administration of TMC125 and voriconazole&#xD;
      might also modify voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Since the elimination of fluconazole is&#xD;
      mainly via the kidneys, an effect of TMC125 on fluconazole pharmacokinetics is not expected.&#xD;
      The current trial aims to assess the 2-way pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC125 and&#xD;
      fluconazole, and between TMC125 and voriconazole, to provide dosing recommendations for&#xD;
      combined use in the treatment of HIV infected patients.In this trial the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction between TMC125 and fluconazole, and between TMC125 and voriconazole, all at&#xD;
      steady-state will be investigated in 18 healthy subjects. During the first two sessions, each&#xD;
      subject will receive 2 treatments (Treatments A and B) in a randomized way. In Treatment A,&#xD;
      200 mg TMC125 twice a day. will be administered from Day 1 to Day 7 with an additional&#xD;
      morning dose on Day 8. In Treatment B, 200 mg fluconazole once a day in the morning will be&#xD;
      administered from Day 1 to Day 16, co-administered with 200 mg TMC125 twice a day from Day 9&#xD;
      to Day 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sessions are followed by a third session, Treatment C, in which 400 mg voriconazole&#xD;
      twice a day will be administered on Day 1 and 200 mg voriconazole twice a day will be&#xD;
      administered from Day 2 to Day 15, with an additional morning dose on Day 16. From Day 9 to&#xD;
      Day 15, 200 mg TMC125 twice a day will be co-administered, with an additional morning dose on&#xD;
      Day 16. All TMC125 and fluconazole intakes will be under fed conditions, within 10 minutes&#xD;
      after a meal. Voriconazole will be administered 1.5 hour before a meal. Between subsequent&#xD;
      treatment sessions, there will be a washout period of at least 2 weeks. Full pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiles will be determined for one dosing interval (12 hours) for TMC125 on Day 8 of&#xD;
      Treatment A and on Day 16 of Treatments B and C. For fluconazole, full pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiles will be determined for one dosing interval (24 hours) on Days 8 and 16 of Treatment&#xD;
      B. For voriconazole, full pharmacokinetic profiles will be determined for one dosing interval&#xD;
      (12 hours) on Days 8 and 16 of Treatment C. Safety and tolerability will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously throughout the trial. Treatment A: 200 mg TMC125 twice daily, orally from Day 1&#xD;
      to 7 and a morning dose on Day 8. Treatment B: 200 mg fluconazole once daily, orally from Day&#xD;
      1 to 16, co-administered with 200 mg TMC125 twice daily from Day 9 to 16. Treatment C: 400 mg&#xD;
      voriconazole twice daily, orally on Day 1 and 200 mg voriconazole twice daily will be&#xD;
      administered from Day 2 to 15, with a morning dose on Day 16. From Day 9 to 15, 200 mg TMC125&#xD;
      twice daily will be co-administered, with a morning dose on Day 16.&#xD;
