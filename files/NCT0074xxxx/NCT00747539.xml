      This study will evaluate the impact of standard hepatitis C virus treatment on brain deficits&#xD;
      in people who are infected with both HIV and the hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization estimates at least 3% of the world's population is infected&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), and up to one third of all HIV infected people are&#xD;
      coinfected with HCV. HCV can damage the liver cells and cause liver diseases such as&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. People infected with HCV can also suffer from&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficits, including problems with information processing, slowing of muscular&#xD;
      processes related to thinking, and difficulty focusing on complex things. These&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficits are similar to those found in HIV infected individuals, and previous&#xD;
      research indicates that people infected with both HIV and HCV have greater overall cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. This study aims to determine the impact of anti-HCV treatment on neurocognitive,&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric, and neuroimaging factors in people infected with HCV and people coinfected&#xD;
      with both HCV and HIV. The study also aims to measure whether possible neurocognitive&#xD;
      improvements from anti-HCV treatment are related to a physical health outcome, measured as a&#xD;
      sustained virologic response, and whether adherence to the medication schedule laid out for&#xD;
      the participants influences possible positive effects on either neurocognitive or physical&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two kinds of participants will be recruited for this study: those infected with HCV and those&#xD;
      infected with both HCV and HIV. These two groups will be compared to determine how comorbid&#xD;
      HCV and HIV infection affects treatment outcomes. The treatment specified for HCV is&#xD;
      pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV), considered standard care for patients&#xD;
      with chronic HCV. Participants will continue to see their doctors as regularly scheduled, and&#xD;
      any other prescribed medications or advice concerning HCV treatment will be noted by&#xD;
      researchers. All participants will be tested at baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and 12&#xD;
      weeks after the completion of treatment. A subset from each group of participants will&#xD;
      undergo additional neuroimaging tests. Participation in this study will last for varied&#xD;
      amounts of time depending on the recommended treatments for HCV. Based on each virus'&#xD;
      genotype and rapid virologic response, the treatment period for HCV may last 24 or 48 weeks,&#xD;
      with further extensions of 12 to 24 weeks in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the three testing sessions, each lasting 5 hours, participants' health, cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, and medication adherence will be measured. Testing will include self-report&#xD;
      measures, intelligence tests, tasks designed to assess cognitive functioning, and motor&#xD;
      functioning tasks. Urine tests screening for narcotics will also be collected. In addition to&#xD;
      self-report measures, caps to pill bottles storing HCV medication will automatically record&#xD;
      every time the cap is removed to measure adherence to the medication schedule.&#xD;
