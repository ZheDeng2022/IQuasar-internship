  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some unstable traumatic vertebral fractures (types A3.2, A3.3, B1 et C1 according to MAGERL&#xD;
      classification) may undergo unpredictable secondary displacement. Such fractures require a&#xD;
      two session surgery with a first operation carried out immediately to achieve posterior&#xD;
      fixation and a second surgery which is performed some days later to stabilize the anterior&#xD;
      spine and restore stress resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of the present study is to show that percutaneous Balloon Kyphoplasty is able to restore&#xD;
      anterior spine strength and replace second session surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with traumatic vertebral fractures type A3.2, A3.3, B1 and C1 of the MAGERL&#xD;
      classification will be enrolled in this open study. They will be operated on in emergency to&#xD;
      perform spinal canal decompression, fracture reduction and posterior fixation using fixation&#xD;
      plates with pedicular screws combined with bone graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same surgery or some days later on, percutaneous Balloon kyphoplasty of the&#xD;
      fractured vertebral body (ies) using polymethylmetacrylate cement injection through a&#xD;
      posterior transpedicular approach will be carried out in replacement of anterior spine&#xD;
      surgery to restore vertebral body strength.Patients will be followed up for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected advantages of this management compared the conventional two session surgery include&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreased morbidity due to suppression of the anterior surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve final spine alignment and vertebral Kyphotic angle avoiding the loss in kyphotic&#xD;
           angle which often occurs between the posterior and anterior surgery with the&#xD;
           conventional two session surgery.&#xD;
