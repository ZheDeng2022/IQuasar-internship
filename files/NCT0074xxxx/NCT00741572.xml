    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) is a collective noun for various chronic lung diseases,&#xD;
      including sarcoidosis and idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF). Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic&#xD;
      disease that includes damage to the lungs in 90% of the patients. Generally, the disease can&#xD;
      be described as a systemic, granulomatous and antigen-driven disorder. IPF is a disease of&#xD;
      only the lungs, in which an unknown cause induces a strong inflammation reaction leading to&#xD;
      acute lung damage that ultimately results in the formation of scar tissue and stiffness of&#xD;
      the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the exact cause of ILD is still unknown. It is suggested that environmental&#xD;
      and work-related exposure to various triggers can exert an effect on the course of the&#xD;
      diseases. Examples of such triggers include bacteria, organic agents such as pollen and&#xD;
      cotton dust and inorganic agents like metals and talc. Due to this unknown cause, it is&#xD;
      difficult to treat ILD. Consequently, the current guideline is no medication or&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents in severe cases. Unfortunately, this therapy is not completely&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triggers that are suggested to cause ILD can exert their effects via various mechanisms. On&#xD;
      the one hand, they can induce an inflammatory reaction as we recently demonstrated for&#xD;
      various triggers including instillation material and sicila. During such an inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction, cytokines are released that can induce oxidative stress, i.e. an imbalance between&#xD;
      the formation of and the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand,&#xD;
      ILD-inducing triggers may directly cause an increased ROS production that subsequently can&#xD;
      evoke an inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the individual sensitivity for the&#xD;
      development of ILD after exposure to various triggers. Main focus will be the differences in&#xD;
      the formation of and the protection against ROS as well as the occurring inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction after exposure to such triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a simple blood test will be developed to study and eventually even predict the&#xD;
      individual reaction of subjects to various triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to fully characterize the development of ILD after exposure to various triggers, the&#xD;
      exhaled air of patients will be studied in order to identify specific markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and damage.&#xD;

        Participants in this study include both men and women, who are 18 years of age or older and&#xD;
        diagnosed with ILD using lung biopsy, X ray or BALF (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid)&#xD;
        analysis and are either treated for this with anti-inflammatory agents or not. There's no&#xD;
        maximum age set for this study since ILD can occur at all ages. Additional criteria are non&#xD;
        smoking, no pregnancy or lactation and no use of vitamins or nutritional supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion of both treated and untreated patients enables us to study the effectiveness&#xD;
        of anti-inflammatory agents on a larger scale.&#xD;
