  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the use of a new compound, SB-656933. Accumulation of inflammatory&#xD;
      white blood cells (mostly polymorphonuclear neutrophils)in the gut (colon) may be&#xD;
      contributing to the pathology of ulcerative colitis. It has been shown that SB-656933 reduces&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) accumulation in pre-clinical models of colitis.&#xD;
      99m-Tc-HMPAO scintigraphy is a imaging technique which will be used in this study to observe&#xD;
      the effect of SB656933 on the migration of PMN to inflamed tissue.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline at 1 and 7 Days Treatment With Daily Dose of SB-656933-AAA in 99m(Technetium-hexamethyl Derivative of Propylene Amine Oxide)Tc-HMPAO Leukocyte Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) Scintigraphic Activity Scores (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 1 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Data has been presented for participants since change from Baseline data was not analyzed. For scintigraphy, blood was obtained for radiolabelling. Labelled white cells were then injected for SPECT scintigraphy and scanning began 45 minutes after injection of labelled White blood cells (WBCs). SPECT images of the colon were divided into 5 segments: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.T he SPECT segment uptake ratio was expressed as a fraction of bone marrow activity obtained from counts in the lumbar spine. The SPECT segment uptake ratio was converted into a four-point (0 to 3) segmental SPECT severity score where grade 0 was equal to no uptake. Only 3 participants were included before the study was discontinued.It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done. Baseline was Day -1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to follow-up (7 to 10 days after last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Vital Signs Assessment- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Vital sign measurements included SBP and DBP at Day 1 and 7. Data was collected in supine position. It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.</description>

    <measure>Vital Signs Assessment- Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Vital sign measurements included heart rate at Day 1 and 7. Data was collected in supine position. It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.</description>

    <description>Stool sample was collected from 1-hour post dose until 8 hours post dose for faecal calprotectin measures. It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.

    <description>Blood samples were collected at 1, 2.25, 4, 8 hour on Day 1 and 7 for the analysis of amount of medicine in blood.

        <title>Change From Baseline at 1 and 7 Days Treatment With Daily Dose of SB-656933-AAA in 99m(Technetium-hexamethyl Derivative of Propylene Amine Oxide)Tc-HMPAO Leukocyte Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) Scintigraphic Activity Scores (SAS)</title>
        <description>Data has been presented for participants since change from Baseline data was not analyzed. For scintigraphy, blood was obtained for radiolabelling. Labelled white cells were then injected for SPECT scintigraphy and scanning began 45 minutes after injection of labelled White blood cells (WBCs). SPECT images of the colon were divided into 5 segments: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.T he SPECT segment uptake ratio was expressed as a fraction of bone marrow activity obtained from counts in the lumbar spine. The SPECT segment uptake ratio was converted into a four-point (0 to 3) segmental SPECT severity score where grade 0 was equal to no uptake. Only 3 participants were included before the study was discontinued.It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done. Baseline was Day -1.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>Vital sign measurements included SBP and DBP at Day 1 and 7. Data was collected in supine position. It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.</description>

        <description>Vital sign measurements included heart rate at Day 1 and 7. Data was collected in supine position. It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.</description>

It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from the very limited data available. Data has been presented for the 3 participants (99001, 99002 and 99003) since the analysis was not done.
