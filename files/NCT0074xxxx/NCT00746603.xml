      Lay abstract: Study Purpose With contemporary combined modality therapy the expected longterm&#xD;
      survival of children and adolescents with Hodgkin's disease (HD) is exceedingly high. Thus,&#xD;
      the emphasis for future therapeutic interventions must include attention to the late effects&#xD;
      of therapy. The development of cardiovascular disease as a late effect of radiation therapy&#xD;
      has been well described and documented. Our recent pilot study of child and young adult HD&#xD;
      survivors revealed significant subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by increased Carotid&#xD;
      Artery Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) compared to controls. The higher CIMT values were&#xD;
      positively associated with increasing age, total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and diastolic&#xD;
      BP. This finding was present in children and young adults who had received no or low dose&#xD;
      radiation suggesting that chemotherapy or the disease process itself contributes to the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis and risk for cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have&#xD;
      shown HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (&quot;statins&quot;) to be effective in reducing the progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in adults. These agents have been studied in children and young adults for&#xD;
      over a decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pilot safety data on the use of simvastatin in young adults treated for HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pilot data on the effect of simvastatin on subclinical carotid artery&#xD;
      atherosclerosis as measured by Carotid Artery IMT in young adults treated for HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pilot data on the effect of simvastatin on markers of inflammation measured in the&#xD;
      serum of young adults treated for HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pilot data to serve as the basis for the development of a multicenter randomized&#xD;
      study for the use of simvastatin in survivors of HD.&#xD;
