      This is a study to evaluate the effect of TMC278 25 mg daily on the QT/QTc interval (heart&#xD;
      conduction and heart rhythm) in healthy volunteers. In a separate panel of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, the effect of efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg daily on the QT/QTc interval will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      This is a trial to evaluate the effect of TMC278 25 mg daily on the QT/QTc interval (heart&#xD;
      conduction and heart rhythm) in healthy volunteers. In a separate panel of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, the effect of efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg daily on the QT/QTc interval will be&#xD;
      evaluated. TMC278 is being investigated as a treatment for HIV-1 infection. In one panel, the&#xD;
      effect of TMC278 at steady-state on the QT/QTc interval in healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a double-blind (neither the doctor nor the patient know if the patient is&#xD;
      getting active drug or placebo), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo&#xD;
      controlled and positive controlled 3-way crossover design. One dose regimen of 25 mg daily of&#xD;
      TMC278 will be tested for 11 days. In a second session, a single dose of 400 mg of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to assess trial sensitivity. A placebo&#xD;
      session will be included as a reference. In a separate panel, the effect of EFV at&#xD;
      steady-state on the QT/QTc interval in healthy volunteers will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled 2-way crossover design. One dose regimen of 600&#xD;
      mg daily of EFV will be tested for 11 days. Similar to the TMC278 panel, a placebo session&#xD;
      will be included as a reference. The overall trial population will consist of 120 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers of which at least 30% and no more than 50% are female and of which at least 20%&#xD;
      are non-Hispanic Caucasians. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the TMC278&#xD;
      panel or the EFV panel. The randomization between the 2 panels will be stratified by gender&#xD;
      and ethnicity and the randomization within each panel will be stratified by gender. Each&#xD;
      patient in the TMC278 panel will receive in 3 sessions in a random order: TMC278 25 mg daily&#xD;
      on Day 1-11 and moxifloxacin placebo q.d. on Day 11 (Treatment A), TMC278 placebo daily on&#xD;
      Day 1-11 and moxifloxacin placebo q.d. on Day 11 (Treatment B), and TMC278 placebo daily on&#xD;
      Day 1-11 and moxifloxacin 400 mg q.d. on Day 11 (Treatment C). All intakes of TMC278,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin, TMC278 placebo and moxifloxacin placebo will be under fed conditions and will&#xD;
      take place under supervision in the unit. There will be a washout period of at least 21 days&#xD;
      between consecutive treatments. Each patient in the EFV panel will receive in 2 sessions in a&#xD;
      random order: EFV 600 mg daily for 11 days (Treatment D) or EFV placebo q.d. for 11 days&#xD;
      (Treatment E). All intakes of EFV and EFV placebo will be under fasted conditions and will&#xD;
      take place under supervision in the unit. There will be a washout period of at least 53 days&#xD;
      between the 2 treatments. In both the TMC278 and the EFV panels, ECGs will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously for 24 hours by Holter monitoring on Day -1 and Day 11 of all treatment&#xD;
      sessions. In addition, for safety monitoring, 12-lead ECGs will be performed at predefined&#xD;
      time points. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day -1, Day 9, Day 10, and Day 11,&#xD;
      within 5 minutes after safety ECG recording or Holter extraction time point, if applicable,&#xD;
      for the determination of TMC278, moxifloxacin or EFV plasma concentrations, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the trial. In the TMC278 Panel, TMC278&#xD;
      or placebo will be given by mouth on Days 1-11 and Moxifloxican or placebo will be given by&#xD;
      mouth on Day 11. Patients will return after each washout period for a total of 3 cycles. In&#xD;
      the EFV Panel, EFV or placebo will be given by mouth on Days 1-11. Patients will return after&#xD;
      the washout period for a total of 2 cycles.&#xD;
