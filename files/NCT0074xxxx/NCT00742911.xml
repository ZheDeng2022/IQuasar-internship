      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Determine the safety and toxicity profile of co-administration of disulfiram and copper&#xD;
      gluconate for the treatment of refractory malignancies that have metastasized to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if disulfiram and copper gluconate induce measurable responses for the&#xD;
           treatment of hepatic metastases from solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative assessment of the induction of S-glutathionylation in proteins of&#xD;
           circulating leukocytes in patients treated with disulfiram and copper gluconate.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have performed experimental studies demonstrating the anti-cancer efficacy of an old&#xD;
      alcoholism treatment drug, disulfiram, combined with supplementation with certain metal ions.&#xD;
      Together, disulfiram and metal ions induce S-glutathionylation of critical cancer cell&#xD;
      proteins, inhibiting their activity, reducing tumor growth and inducing tumor cell apoptosis.&#xD;
      The most active metal ion that can be paired with disulfiram appears to be the divalent metal&#xD;
      ion copper. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of co-administrating the&#xD;
      thiocarbamate molecule disulfiram together with copper gluconate to patients with stage IV&#xD;
      cancer metastatic to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigators have studied the effect of disulfiram alone administered to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma, and have observed no clinical benefit when disulfiram is administered&#xD;
      without metal ion supplements (Dr. Patrick J. Farmer, University of California Irvine,&#xD;
      personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose that the optimum approach to using disulfiram as an antineoplastic agent&#xD;
      is to co-administer it with metal ion supplements. While a number of metal ions can enhance&#xD;
      the antineoplastic activity of disulfiram, including Zn2+, we have found Cu2+ to be the most&#xD;
      active. This observation has been confirmed by others, who have shown that Cu2+&#xD;
      supplementation of growth media increases the pro-apoptotic (Cen 2004) and&#xD;
      proteosomal-inhibitory (Chen 2006) activities of disulfiram. Compared to surrounding normal&#xD;
      tissue, many cancer cells contain highly elevated levels of copper (Habib 1980; Rizk 1984;&#xD;
      Turecky 1984; Diez 1989; Huang 1999; Kuo 2002; Nayak 2003). However, typical Western diets&#xD;
      provide only 1 mg of copper daily, less than even the lower limit of 1.5 to 3.0 mg estimated&#xD;
      safe and adequate daily dietary intake (ESADDI) of copper (Kelvay 1998; Failla 1999; Ma 2000;&#xD;
      Pang 2001; Davis 2003). Therefore, dietary copper supplementation is likely necessary for&#xD;
      disulfiram to be maximally effective as an antineoplastic drug. We project that the optimal&#xD;
      dose of copper supplementation to pair with disulfiram is 8 mg elemental copper a day, the&#xD;
      upper level of recommended daily copper (Institute for Medicine 2002), administered as copper&#xD;
      gluconate, a substance generally regarded as safe (GRAS) (Code of Federal Regulation 2004).&#xD;
      This amount would provide an eight-fold higher intake of copper than most American adults&#xD;
      consume daily. Large amounts of ingested copper could result in hepatic failure and hemolysis&#xD;
      similar to that seen with Wilson's disease, the rare genetic syndrome from hyperabsorption of&#xD;
      copper. However, 8 mg of elemental copper has been previously administered to humans with few&#xD;
      untoward effects (Pratt 1985; Olivares 1996; Rosado 2003; Mendez 2004; Araya 2005), and in&#xD;
      one study even 20 mg of daily copper supplementation was well-tolerated (Araya 2004).&#xD;
      Although copper intake is homeostatically regulated, with reduced gastrointestinal absorption&#xD;
      at high intakes (Turnland 2005), chronic ingestion of as much as 60 mg elemental copper daily&#xD;
      is likely toxic to normal individuals (O'Donohue 1993). In combining copper gluconate with&#xD;
      disulfiram as an antineoplastic strategy, we would propose to administer the two in a fashion&#xD;
      similar to that used for treatment of our patient with metastatic ocular melanoma, who&#xD;
      experienced no diarrhea from zinc gluconate and disulfiram given at different times of the&#xD;
      day (Figure 6.10). Copper gluconate containing up to 8 mg elemental copper would be given in&#xD;
      the morning a half hour before breakfast, and disulfiram would be consumed with the evening&#xD;
      meal. The rationale for separating administration of the two agents in time is to avoid&#xD;
      producing gastrointestinal toxicity such as mucositis from complexation of copper by&#xD;
      disulfiram in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administered separately, we believe that disulfiram and Cu2+ will complex in vivo, forming a&#xD;
      bis(diethyldi-thiocarbamato)-copper(II) complex (Johansson 1992) that will provide enhanced&#xD;
      antineoplastic activity. It is also possible that metabolites of disulfiram have important&#xD;
      activities (Loo 2004) that might also be enhanced by supplementation with copper.&#xD;
      Administered orally, both disulfiram and Cu2+ will likely achieve high hepatic concentrations&#xD;
      before distribution to other body tissues. This might suggest a utility of disulfiram and&#xD;
      Cu2+ in treating primary hepatic tumors such as hepatomas, or secondary hepatic metastases&#xD;
      from common malignancies such as colonic adenocarcinoma. The possibility of selective hepatic&#xD;
      antineoplastic activity is supported by our experience with the patient suffering from&#xD;
      metastatic ocular melanoma (Figure 6.10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this study will include those with advanced cancers metastatic to the liver who&#xD;
      are not currently receiving or are eligible for other therapeutic approaches. When prescribed&#xD;
      clinically for alcohol aversion, disulfiram is indicated in doses ranging from 125 mg to 500&#xD;
      mg orally each day. For safety reasons, we will initiate disulfiram use at a fixed dose of&#xD;
      250 mg per day, given with the evening meal. We will begin dosing with copper gluconate (2 mg&#xD;
      elemental copper) given daily with the morning breakfast meal. These dose times are chosen to&#xD;
      separate in time the administration of copper gluconate and disulfiram so that they will not&#xD;
      be within the gastrointestinal lumen simultaneously, thereby preventing development of&#xD;
      diarrhea and other side effects of mucositis from intraluminal formation of&#xD;
      metal-thiocarbamate complexes. Copper gluconate doses will be increased in cohorts of 3 to 6&#xD;
      patients as detailed below as long as dose limiting toxicity is not observed. The maximum&#xD;
      dose of copper gluconate to be administered will be the equivalent of 8 mg of elemental&#xD;
      copper for the reasons outlined above. Subjects will be maintained on this regimen and&#xD;
      followed for the duration of the protocol as long as they are not showing toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression, with periodic measurement of end-points outlined later. Major emphasis will be&#xD;
      placed on following ALT and AST as indices of safety and serial abdominal imaging to&#xD;
      determine the anatomic burden of hepatic metastases. During the protocol and for four weeks&#xD;
      thereafter, subjects will be warned against the ingestion of ethanol and against exposure to&#xD;
      alcohol-containing medications or consumer products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose the gradually escalated dosing scheme above in anticipation of the most likely&#xD;
      toxicity of the combined ingestion of disulfiram and copper supplements: hepatotoxicity.&#xD;
      After gastrointestinal absorption, both agents are likely to be concentrated first in the&#xD;
      liver. Therefore, the greatest risk will likely be an increase in hepatic transaminases. From&#xD;
      experience with the combined administration of disulfiram and zinc supplements to a patient&#xD;
      (Brar 2004) we believe that separating the times at which copper gluconate (morning breakfast&#xD;
      meal) and disulfiram (evening meal) are ingested will prevent bothersome diarrhea or other&#xD;
      symptoms of mucositis resulting from metal-thiocarbamate complexation within the bowel lumen.&#xD;
      We anticipate that careful warning against the ingestion of ethanol-containing beverages or&#xD;
      exposure to alcohol-containing consumer products will avert the risk of an inadvertent&#xD;
      disulfiram ethanol reaction.&#xD;
