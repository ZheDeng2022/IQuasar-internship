  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the&#xD;
      body, how it is distributed within the body and removed from the body over time),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (how the study medication affects the body) and safety of rabeprazole after&#xD;
      single and multiple daily administration in infants between the ages of 1 and 11 months,&#xD;
      inclusive, with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both physician and patient know the name of the study medication),&#xD;
      multicenter, Phase I study, consisting of 2 parts. The first part of the study will be&#xD;
      nonrandomized (study drug is intentionally assigned), and all patients will receive the same&#xD;
      dose. In the second part of the study, patients will be randomized (study medication assigned&#xD;
      by chance) into 2 dose groups. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (intraesophageal/intragastric pH, clinical global impression,&#xD;
      formulation palatability and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) daily symptom diary) and&#xD;
      safety of rabeprazole after single and multiple daily administration at 2 dose levels in&#xD;
      children between the ages of 1 and 11 months, inclusive (up to 11 months 29 days), with GERD.&#xD;
      As this study is an exploratory assessment of the PK, pharmacodynamics and safety of&#xD;
      rabeprazole in children, no formal hypothesis testing is applied. Safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      including monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory results, physical examination,&#xD;
      vital signs and electrocardiogram measurements (the measuring of the electrical currents in&#xD;
      the heart), will be evaluated throughout the study. Patients will receive rabeprazole sodium&#xD;
      as single daily oral doses for 5 successive days (Option 1), or up to 14 successive days (10&#xD;
      days minimum) (Option 2) as a bead formulation. In Part 1, patients will receive single and&#xD;
      multiple daily (every 24 hours) doses of 0.5 mg/kg, using increments of 1 mg dose. Safety and&#xD;
      PK data from Part 1 of the study will determine the 2 dosages to be studied in Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study. In Part 2, patients may receive rabeprazole sodium as single daily oral doses for up&#xD;
      to a maximum of 28 consecutive days as a bead formulation. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      either the 5 mg dose or 10 mg dose group.&#xD;
