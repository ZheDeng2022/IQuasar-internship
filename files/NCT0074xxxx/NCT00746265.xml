      This project compares gold standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (based on LEARN, Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program, LOOK Ahead) used in both research and clinical settings, with&#xD;
      acceptance-based behavioral therapy for weight loss. Standard behavior treatment (SBT)&#xD;
      focuses on modifying eating, thinking, and activity levels. Participants limit their daily&#xD;
      caloric intake, keep food records, increase physical activity, and practice weight control&#xD;
      behaviors, such as stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, alternative coping skills, and&#xD;
      distinguishing hunger from cravings. The acceptance-based approach (ABT) incorporates the&#xD;
      behavioral and nutritional components, but replaced the cognitive and motivational components&#xD;
      with components that are consistent with an acceptance-based approach, such as acceptance and&#xD;
      willingness to experience cravings, cognitive defusion, mindfulness training to interrupt&#xD;
      automatic eating, and values work. These components are drawn from Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999), a cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been&#xD;
      gaining increasing attention and empirical support (Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002; Bond &amp; Bunce, 2000;&#xD;
      Hayes et al. 2004). Though relatively new, acceptance-based strategies have demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness in helping individuals to respond to unwanted thoughts and feelings (Hayes,&#xD;
      Rissett, Korn, Zettle, Rosenfarb, Cooper, &amp; Grundt, 1999, Keogh, Bond, Hanmer, &amp; Tilston,&#xD;
      2005) and offer a novel alternative to control-based strategies (such as distraction and&#xD;
      confrontation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either the traditional behavioral&#xD;
      therapy condition (SBT) or the acceptance-based behavioral therapy condition (ABT). Both&#xD;
      conditions are delivered in group format. A total of 30, 75 minute sessions will take place&#xD;
      over the course of 40 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment, and its short and&#xD;
           moderate-term effectiveness relative to the current gold standard behavioral treatment&#xD;
           (SBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of ABT with novice clinicians and with weight control&#xD;
           experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of ABT would be moderated by mood disturbance, emotional&#xD;
           eating, disinhibition or susceptibility to food stimuli.&#xD;
