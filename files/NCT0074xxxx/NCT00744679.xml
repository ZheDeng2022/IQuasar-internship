      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of natalizumab (Tysabri)&#xD;
      at steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile (α4 integrin&#xD;
      saturation) of Tysabri at steady state.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach: United&#xD;
             Commitment to Health Prescribing Program (TOUCH) who is not expected to discontinue&#xD;
             Tysabri therapy prior to completion of the requirements of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have been treated with monthly IV infusions of Tysabri 300 mg for at least 12&#xD;

          -  Must test negative for antibodies to Tysabri at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan, performed prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of treatment with Tysabri, on file.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or abnormal laboratory results indicative of, any clinically significant&#xD;
             cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic,&#xD;
