      An open label, dose-escalation study to evaluate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 given twice weekly for three&#xD;
      consecutive weeks in cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and MTD of CPI-613 when administered 2x weekly for 3 consecutive&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacokinetics of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the anti-tumor effects of CPI-613, if any occur.&#xD;

    <description>CPI-613, the investigational drug, is a novel anti-tumor compound believed to operate via a novel mechanism of action that does not belong to any existing pharmacological class of anticancer agents currently being used in the clinics. Specifically, CPI-613 is Cornerstone Pharmaceutical Inc.'s lead drug from its Altered Energy Metabolism-Directed (AEMD) technology platform. It is selective against tumor cells (but not normal cells)according to preclinical studies</description>

             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation. (Note: Pregnant&#xD;
