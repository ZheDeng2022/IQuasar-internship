      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, administered&#xD;
      during cardiac catheterization, on right ventricular contractility in children with pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of Sildenafil as a pulmonary vasodilator in children with heart disease was&#xD;
      first reported in detail during cardiac catheterization and postoperatively in 2003. It is&#xD;
      now used frequently for long-term treatment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;
      at The Hospital for Sick Children and it is now a routine part of the hospital's testing&#xD;
      protocol for all patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension in the cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effects of Sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension are thought to result&#xD;
      predominantly from relative vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature. On the basis of early data showing lack of significant PDE5 expression in the&#xD;
      normal heart, PDE5 was thought to be expressed in the coronary vessels but not in the human&#xD;
      myocardium. Very recently, it was reported for the first time that PDE5 is markedly&#xD;
      upregulated in hypertrophied right ventricular myocardium in humans and that in the rat PDE5&#xD;
      inhibition with Sildenafil increases contractility in hypertrophied right ventricular&#xD;
      myocardium but not in normal right ventricle, which lacks PDE5 expression. The assessment of&#xD;
      right ventricular contractility in humans is a challenge, but we have developed several&#xD;
      techniques that are recognized as 'state of the art' assessment of right ventricular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, which is routinely&#xD;
      administered during cardiac catheterization to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, on right&#xD;
      ventricular contractility in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
