    <textblock>
      Sudden death is a natural death occurring within one hour after the onset of symptoms. It&#xD;
      remains a major public health problem and accounts for 5 to 10 % of the annual total&#xD;
      mortality ie about 300.000 in the United States. Despite community-based interventions,&#xD;
      overall survival remains below 5%. Better understanding of the mechanisms causing sudden&#xD;
      death could allow early identification of high risk subjects and implementation of specific&#xD;
      prevention strategies. The cause of more than 90% of sudden deaths is cardiac with&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation or fast ventricular tachycardia complicating an underlying heart&#xD;
      disease. Coronary heart disease and its consequences account for at least 80% of sudden&#xD;
      cardiac deaths. Several risk factors associated with sudden death and not with myocardial&#xD;
      infarction have been identified in population-based studies. However, the relationship&#xD;
      between the occurrence of a coronary artery occlusion and the onset of arrhythmia is unclear.&#xD;
      In particular, coronary artery occlusion can be rapidly followed by chest pain, which acts as&#xD;
      a signal and allows identification of patients for emergency reperfusion. However, in some&#xD;
      cases, the coronary artery occlusion is followed by a sudden onset of arrhythmia and sudden&#xD;
      death. Recent data suggest that acute coronary occlusion is caused by plaque erosion or&#xD;
      rupture and is followed by an intense local inflammation and rapid thrombus formation. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the speed of thrombus formation and coronary occlusion determines the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. Slow and progressive thrombus formation is likely to induce myocardial&#xD;
      pre-conditioning thereby reducing the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. In contrast,&#xD;
      rapid thrombus formation followed by acute coronary artery occlusion and ischemia is more&#xD;
      likely to trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmia. During angioplasty procedures, coronary&#xD;
      artery thrombus are aspirated, providing the opportunity for pathological studies. The aim of&#xD;
      the TIDE study (Thrombus and Inflammation in Sudden Death) is therefore to compare the&#xD;
      composition and age of thrombus collected at the site of coronary occlusion in patients with&#xD;
      sudden death due to acute coronary artery occlusion and patients with an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction without ventricular arrhythmia. The following hypothesis will be tested : fresh&#xD;
      thrombus is more frequent in patients with sudden cardiac death versus patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;

      Sudden death is a natural death occurring within one hour after the onset of symptoms. It&#xD;
      remains a major public health problem and accounts for 5 to 10 % of the annual total&#xD;
      mortality ie about 40 000 deaths in France and 300.000 in the United States.(1) Despite&#xD;
      community-based interventions, overall survival remains below 5%. (2) Better understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms causing sudden death could allow early identification of high risk subjects&#xD;
      and implementation of specific prevention strategies. (3)The cause of more than 90% of sudden&#xD;
      deaths is cardiac with ventricular fibrillation or fast ventricular tachycardia complicating&#xD;
      an underlying heart disease. (4) Coronary heart disease and its consequences account for at&#xD;
      least 80% of sudden cardiac deaths and hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies account for&#xD;
      another 10 to 15% of cardiac causes.(4,5) Several risk factors associated with sudden death&#xD;
      and not with myocardial infarction have been identified in population-based studies.(6-10)&#xD;
      However, the relationship between the occurrence of a coronary artery occlusion and the onset&#xD;
      of arrhythmia is unclear.The Framingham study reported that sudden death occurred without&#xD;
      prior manifestations of coronary heart disease in more than 50% of men and 65% of women. (11)&#xD;
      Data from 10 countries from WHO MONICA PROJECT show that sudden deaths are more frequent than&#xD;
      non sudden coronary deaths until age 60. (figure). In a study on the value of immediate&#xD;
      coronary angiography and angioplasty in survivors of SCD, a recent coronary artery occlusion&#xD;
      was found in over 50% of patients and unstable coronary artery lesions in 20% (12). In two&#xD;
      series based on autopsies, the rate of coronary artery lesions in non-survivors of SCD was&#xD;
      over 80% (13-15). In a study based on autopsies of non-survivors of SCD, fresh thrombus was&#xD;
      found in a majority of cases. (2)Furthermore, noninflammatory plaque erosion was found as an&#xD;
      underlying cause to thrombus formation in 40% of cases (14). In this case, thrombus is formed&#xD;
      on a denuded endothelial plaque surface and is in direct contact with activated smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells. In 211 patients with non-complicated acute myocardial infarction caused by acute&#xD;
      coronary occlusion, SASKIA et al studied the age of intracoronary thrombi, aspirated during&#xD;
      angioplasty (16). In at least 50% of patients, thrombi were days or weeks old, thereby&#xD;
      suggesting ischemic pre-conditioning in this sub-group of acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      patients with no ventricular arrhythmia. Maier et al studied intra-coronary concentrations of&#xD;
      selected inflammatory biomarkers in 42 patients with acute myocardial infarction (17). High&#xD;
      levels of interleukin 6 and serum amyloid A were found at the occlusion site; and these&#xD;
      levels were even higher in patients with no previous clinical symptoms before the acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. These data suggest that plaque erosion or rupture is followed by an&#xD;
      intense local inflammation and rapid thrombus formation. Our hypothesis is that the speed of&#xD;
      thrombus formation and coronary occlusion determines the clinical symptoms. Slow and&#xD;
      progressive thrombus formation is likely to induce myocardial pre-conditioning thereby&#xD;
      reducing the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. In contrast, rapid thrombus formation&#xD;
      followed by acute coronary artery occlusion and ischemia is more likely to trigger fatal&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia. We also believe that a precise determination of endothelial cell&#xD;
      apoptosis, plaque erosion, and systemic and local inflammation could shed light on the&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms prevailing in SCD due to acute coronary artery occlusion. Protection&#xD;
      and thrombectomy devices were recently developed to avoid distal embolisation during&#xD;
      angioplasty procedures in saphenous vein graphs or during angioplasty for acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. These devices provide the unique opportunity to harvest blood and thrombi from&#xD;
      the site of coronary occlusion. The aspirate can be used to study the speed and the intensity&#xD;
      of local thrombus formation. The use of such techniques could be extended to patients with a&#xD;
      SCD due to an acute coronary artery occlusion and the data compared to that of patients with&#xD;
      an acute myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, markers of&#xD;
      endothelial cell apoptosis, local and systemic inflammatory biomarkers in the culprit&#xD;
      coronary artery and in the systemic blood could be studied in such patients and also during&#xD;
      angioplasty procedures performed in patients with stable coronary lesions.(18-23) The aim of&#xD;
      the TIDE study (Thrombus and Inflammation in Sudden Death) is therefore to compare the&#xD;
      composition and age of thrombus collected at the site of coronary occlusion in patients with&#xD;
      sudden death due to acute coronary artery occlusion and patients with an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction without ventricular arrhythmia. The following hypothesis will be tested : fresh&#xD;
      thrombus is more frequent in patients with sudden cardiac death versus patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, coronary artery and&#xD;
      systemic blood samples will be drawn in both groups and before coronary angioplasty&#xD;
      procedures in patients with stable angina pectoris to determine the role of local and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation and endothelial cell apoptosis in these settings.&#xD;
