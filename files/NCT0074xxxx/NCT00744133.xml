  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how many infected mosquito bites are required to&#xD;
      reliably give volunteers a case of malaria. It is expected that volunteers will develop&#xD;
      malaria and may have symptoms. Safety is the main concern. A malaria challenge is given by&#xD;
      allowing a volunteer to receive 1, 3, or 5 mosquito's bites. Then participants are carefully&#xD;
      followed and blood is tested. The study will also look at how immune systems (the cells and&#xD;
      substances that protect the body from infection and foreign matter) respond after mosquito&#xD;
      bite challenges. About 38 subjects (aged 18-40 years) from the greater Baltimore, Maryland&#xD;
      (United States) community will participate and may stay overnight for 10 days at a local&#xD;
      medical center. Procedures include medical screening, assignment to a dose group, a mosquito&#xD;
      bite challenge, and 56 day follow-up. Volunteers will be contacted by telephone at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months after the malaria challenge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of the aseptically raised anopheles mosquito malaria challenge.&#xD;
      Adults aged 18-40 years will be randomized to one group of 18 subjects (Part A) or a second&#xD;
      group of 20 subjects (Part B). Adults will be randomized to receive 1, 3 or 5 bites of&#xD;
      Anopheles (A.) stephensi mosquitoes infected with the NF54 strain of chloroquine-sensitive&#xD;
      Plasmodium (P.) falciparum. Part B will be informed by the results of Part A. Thus, a total&#xD;
      of approximately 38 adults will receive a malaria challenge. The challenge for Part A will be&#xD;
      given on day 0 with the subsequent group (Part B) commencing after a 56 day safety review.&#xD;
      Solicited adverse events will be recorded on the days of malaria challenge, outpatient days&#xD;
      5-7, 19-28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 post-challenge event. Inpatient analysis will occur from Days&#xD;
      8-18 or until three-day directly observed therapy for P. falciparum infection is complete.&#xD;
      Additional outpatient, post-malaria infection follow-up will occur weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Unsolicited adverse events will be recorded for 56 days after each malaria challenge event.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a telephone follow-up six and twelve months after enrollment. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to develop and evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new human&#xD;
      malaria challenge model using aseptically-raised anopheles mosquitoes infected with the NF54&#xD;
      isolate of P. falciparum and reared under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs)&#xD;
      conditions. Secondary objectives are to obtain information on the minimum number of A.&#xD;
      stephensi bites required to safely achieve 100 percent adult human volunteer infectivity&#xD;
      (Malaria challenge, Part A); obtain information on the minimum quantity of A. stephensi bites&#xD;
      in a second challenge study to achieve 100 percent adult human volunteer infectivity (Malaria&#xD;
      challenge, Part B); develop molecular diagnostic techniques for rapid and accurate real-time&#xD;
      diagnosis of P. falciparum infection to assess the role as a new diagnostic standard for P.&#xD;
      falciparum challenge studies.&#xD;
