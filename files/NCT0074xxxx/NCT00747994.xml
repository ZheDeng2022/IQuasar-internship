    <textblock>
      Paget's disease of bone is a frequent bone disorder which usually starts after the age of 40&#xD;
      and which is characterized by bone pain and deformities. Although often without any symptoms,&#xD;
      this disease may have severe complications such as fissures, fractures, neurological&#xD;
      compression, or deafness. In some cases, it is a genetic disorder transmitted with a dominant&#xD;
      autosomal pattern of inheritance: one of the two parents carrying the disease transmits it to&#xD;
      his offspring with a risk of 50% for each child. Since 2002, the first gene involved in&#xD;
      Paget's disease of bone is known and 14 mutations of this gene have been published. A study&#xD;
      confirmed that the presence of those mutations was associated with younger age of onset and&#xD;
      more extensive disease. Thus, the knowledge of those genetic factors in the relatives of an&#xD;
      affected individual allows the screening of the patients with a higher risk for&#xD;
      complications, who may benefit from a medical follow up and earlier treatment, in order to&#xD;
      avoid complications. Indeed, Paget's disease of bone may be treated efficiently by&#xD;
      bisphosphonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims at identifying and collecting over one year, 15 affected individuals&#xD;
      affected by Paget's disease of bone and the relatives up to the second degree of relativeness&#xD;
      (a total of 100 individuals is expected). The blood samples may be analysed in order to&#xD;
      search for mutations of the previously known gene and/or to search for new mutations on new&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;

      Background : Paget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder with a late onset, usually&#xD;
      after the age of 40. This disease is transmitted on a dominant autosomal pattern of&#xD;
      inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Since 2002, the first gene (SEQUESTOSOME 1 or SQSTM1)&#xD;
      involved in Paget's disease of bone is known. Actually, 14 mutations of this gene located in&#xD;
      exons 7 and 8 have been reported in familial forms of the disease as well as in sporadic&#xD;
      forms. Although the size of the samples studied in the literature are rather small to&#xD;
      establish phenotype genotype correlations, it seems that the presence of those mutations are&#xD;
      associated with an earlier onset of the disease and a more extensive disease. However, the&#xD;
      presence of those mutations seems not sufficient to explain the whole development of the&#xD;
      disease, but functional analyses may help to understand the real effect of those mutations.&#xD;
      The link between the genetics and the observation of PARANYXOVIRAL inclusions in the nucleus&#xD;
      of osteoclasts is not actually established. The hypothesis of an interaction between gene and&#xD;
      environment may be plausible for several authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of a study on 94 sporadic French patients with Paget's disease of bone lead to&#xD;
      the identification of two new mutations of SQSTM1 gene and showed the presence of double&#xD;
      SQSTM1 mutations. This study established phenotype genotype correlations, affected&#xD;
      individuals who carry a mutation have a younger age at diagnosis and a polyostotic&#xD;
      involvement. This phenotype genotype correlation is a major element that may help to target&#xD;
      the relatives at risk for complications, who may benefit from an earlier treatment to prevent&#xD;
      complications occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : to recruit 15 patients affected by Paget's disease of bone, with a&#xD;
      familial form, and their relatives healthy or affected, up to the second degree of&#xD;
      relativeness (total of about 100 individuals) for a genetic study on Paget's disease of bone&#xD;
      with : DNA collection, blood puncture for RNA collection, serum collection and urinary&#xD;
      collection to study the bone remodelling parameters. DNA samples will be used to search for&#xD;
      mutations involved in Paget's disease of bone in collaboration with the research center of&#xD;
      the University hospital center of LAVAL, Quebec, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Identification of the affected patients (15 index cases). Inclusion visit for the index&#xD;
      case : information on the project and signature of the consent, validation of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the index case, clinical exam, answers to the questionnaire. Detailed family&#xD;
      pedigree and information given to the index case for the relatives up the second degree of&#xD;
      relativeness for participation in the present study. Blood puncture and urinary collection,&#xD;
      imaging is required in the next three months only if not previously done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit for the relative, healthy or affected by Paget's disease of bone: Information&#xD;
      on the project and signature of the consent, validation of the inclusion criteria, clinical&#xD;
      exam and answer to the questionnaire, blood and urinary collection. Imaging is required only&#xD;
      for healthy relatives with bone scintigraphy in the next three months or skull and pelvis&#xD;
      radiographies. For the affected relatives, imaging tests are required only when not&#xD;
      previously done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exams realized on the patient for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual, healthy or affected by Paget's disease of bone, included in this study, has&#xD;
      to undergo biological tests (alkalies phosphatases, creatinin and gammaGT) and imaging tests&#xD;
      if not realized during the past 10 years (bone scintigraphy and /or radiographies of the&#xD;
      skull and pelvis). Blood puncture will be done to extract DNA, RNA and serum samples and&#xD;
      urinary samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits : The realisation of biological and imaging exams to search for asymptomatic lesions&#xD;
      of Paget's disease of bone, may lead to fortuitously identify bone lesions of various&#xD;
      etiologies, which treatment and follow up may be beneficial to the relatives, but the kind of&#xD;
      benefit is not certain. The identification of a SQSTM1 mutation in a relative may lead to an&#xD;
      earlier treatment that may prevent the occurrence of complications. Indeed, there is an&#xD;
      efficient medical treatment for Paget's disease of bone (bisphosphonates). There is no&#xD;
      benefit for the index case, nor for the affected relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known risks : Pain due to veinous blood puncture et irradiation with the bone scintigraphy&#xD;
      and/or radiographies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers of patients : 15 patients affected by Paget's disease of bone and their relatives at&#xD;
      the first or second degree of relativeness, in a total of about 100 individuals. This number&#xD;
      is based on the feasibility of the recruitment and on the fact that those families may be&#xD;
      pooled for the analysis with families from Quebec and will allow to increase the power to&#xD;
      detect by linkage analysis new mutations, new haplotypes and/or new genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective : New mutations or new haplotypes of already identified mutations, new&#xD;
      mutations of new genes of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  According to the frequency of the SQSTM1 mutations in familial forms of the disease, a&#xD;
           mutation in this gene may be identified in 1/3 of the families, ie about 5 families. In&#xD;
           those families, the haplotypes study may show two major haplotypes containing the P392L&#xD;
           mutation. This family material with identified mutation may be useful to search for&#xD;
           phenotype genotype correlation and to search for modifier factors (genetic, epigenetic,&#xD;
           environmental).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the 10 other families, no SQSTM1 mutations are expected. Those families may be pooled&#xD;
           to families with the genetic background (French Canadian), who may allow to reach a&#xD;
           sufficient power to detect by linkage analysis new regions of the genome that may&#xD;
           contain an other gene of Paget's disease of bone.&#xD;
