    <textblock>
      Ministries of Health consider wait lists for total joint replacement a top priority. Research&#xD;
      priorities to manage wait lists indicate the need to establish benchmarks that consider&#xD;
      patient preferences. However, patients' preferences for hip or knee replacements are strongly&#xD;
      associated with their misperceptions of the indicators for, and the risks and benefits of,&#xD;
      these procedures. These misperceptions can be corrected with the use of patient decision&#xD;
      aids. When decision aids are used in combination with assessing surgical eligibility, there&#xD;
      may be a reduction in unnecessary referrals for surgery either because the patient is&#xD;
      ineligible or because the eligible candidates make informed decisions to forgo this option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to pilot test the feasibility of a trial evaluating the effects of&#xD;
      patient decision aids on reducing unnecessary surgical referrals for total joint replacement,&#xD;
      when used in combination with a general practitioner run clinic to screen patients with hip&#xD;
      or knee osteoarthritis for surgical eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to provide evidence of feasibility (e.g. ease of recruiting&#xD;
      patients, delivering the interventions, measuring patient outcomes) and sample size needed&#xD;
      for a larger scale study. This study should also provide evidence for planning implementation&#xD;
      of the interventions and standardized training across other centers.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research priorities to manage wait times for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) indicate&#xD;
      the need to establish benchmarks that consider patient preferences. Among clinically&#xD;
      appropriate candidates for this procedure, patients' preferences for surgery is very low;&#xD;
      between 8.5 and 14.9% of clinically ideal candidates were definitely willing to consider&#xD;
      TJA.However, patients' preferences for hip or knee replacements are strongly associated with&#xD;
      their misperceptions of the indications for, and the risks and benefits of, these procedures.&#xD;
      These misperceptions can be corrected with the use of patient decision aids. Therefore,&#xD;
      patient decision aids may have a role in ensuring that wait list reforms address under-use of&#xD;
      surgical procedures that informed patients need and want, while preventing the over-use of&#xD;
      procedures that informed patients do not value. If they were used in combination with&#xD;
      screening for surgical eligibility, they might also prevent inappropriate referrals for&#xD;
      surgery (i.e., patients who are not clinically eligible or who would not want surgery even if&#xD;
      they were clinically eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To pilot test the feasibility of a trial evaluating the incremental effects of patient&#xD;
      decision aids on reducing unnecessary surgical referrals for TJA, when used in combination&#xD;
      with a general practitioner intake clinic that screens patients for surgical eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for surgical consultation for hip or knee osteoarthritis at The Ottawa&#xD;
      Hospital will be recruited. Excluded are those with inflammatory arthritis, previous TJA, or&#xD;
      those unable to understand video/DVD decision aids due to deafness, blindness, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, or language barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, patients will be screened for surgical eligibility by a trained general&#xD;
      practitioner using a standardized examination of the hip/knee and questionnaire assessing&#xD;
      joint symptoms and disability. Eligible patients will be stratified by affected joint&#xD;
      (hip/knee) and randomly allocated to either: a) usual education; or b) a patient decision aid&#xD;
      which presents balanced evidence-based information on the treatment options, including the&#xD;
      risks and benefits. Automated reports will be sent to the surgeon for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of participant recruitment, intervention provision, and data collection;&#xD;
           sample size needed to detect differences in the rates of unnecessary referral&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of unnecessary surgical referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision quality, the extent to which patients' decisions are informed and values-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perception of Preparation for Decision Making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline and Deliverables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of this one year study, we will prepare a report and policy brief on the evidence&#xD;
      of feasibility to support a larger scale multi-centre trial and a fully implementable set of&#xD;
      interventions, with standardized training, to facilitate replication elsewhere.&#xD;
