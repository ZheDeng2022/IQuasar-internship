  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction trial in&#xD;
      patients on stable methadone maintenance therapy is to investigate the potential interaction&#xD;
      between TMC278 25 mg daily and methadone, at steady-state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction trial in patients on&#xD;
      stable methadone maintenance therapy, to investigate the potential interaction between TMC278&#xD;
      25 mg daily and methadone, at steady-state. TMC278 is under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-1 infected patients. The trial population will consist of 16 HIV-negative patients on&#xD;
      stable methadone maintenance therapy. Patients will receive TMC278 25 mg daily for 11 days,&#xD;
      added to their current methadone therapy. The current methadone dosage for each patient is&#xD;
      not to be changed from screening until Day 11 inclusive. Methadone dose will be&#xD;
      individualized for each patient and should be between 60 and 150 mg daily. Full 24 hour&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles of R- and S-methadone will be determined on Day -1 (methadone alone)&#xD;
      and on Day 11 (methadone + TMC278). A full 24 hour pharmacokinetic profile of TMC278 will be&#xD;
      determined on Day 11 (methadone + TMC278). Pharmacodynamic assessments of the symptoms of&#xD;
      methadone withdrawal (Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), Desires for Drugs Questionnaire&#xD;
      (DDQ), pupillometry) will be performed on Day -7 and daily from Day -3 until Day 11, within 2&#xD;
      hours before the intake of methadone. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated continuously&#xD;
      throughout the trial. Patients will receive TMC278 added to their current methadone therapy&#xD;
      in the following way: methadone individualized maintenance therapy, 60 to 150 mg daily from&#xD;
      Day -14 to 11 and TMC278 25 mg tablet by mouth daily from Day 1 to 11. TMC278 and methadone&#xD;
      will both be taken within 10 minutes after completion of a breakfast.&#xD;
