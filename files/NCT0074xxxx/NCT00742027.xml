    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the efficacy of oral panobinostat in participants with&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed classical Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) who have received prior treatment with&#xD;
      high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Safety of panobinostat also was&#xD;
      assessed. Other markers that may correlate with efficacy or safety were explored.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From start of treatment until progression/recurrence or start of a new cancer therapy (up to approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall radiological response (CT/MRI) was recorded from start of treatment until progression/ recurrence. CR=complete normalization of all index nodal,extranodal lesions,complete disappearance of all extranodal lesions.PR=50% decrease in SPD for up to 6 identified dominant lesions (splenic,hepatic nodules) from baseline.Stable=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase for progressive disease (PD), reference smallest sum diameters while on study.Progression=50% increase in sum of longest diameter of all target lesions,from smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline/a new lesion/progression of non-target lesions.Unknown is progression not documented,one/more of index lesions not assessed or have been assessed using a different method than baseline at the time of radiologic evaluation.</description>

    <description>Time to overall disease response (CR or PR) was defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of first documented disease response (PR or CR). Per Cheson response criteria, CR= is a complete normalization of all index nodal and extranodal lesions and complete disappearance of all extranodal lesions. PR= is a 50% decrease in the SPD for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including splenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. Participants were considered responders if they had a partial or complete response to a treatment while in the study as per Investigator's assessment.</description>

    <description>Duration of overall response (CR or PR) was defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death due to lymphoma. Per Cheson response criteria, CR= is a complete normalization of all index nodal and extranodal lesions and complete disappearance of all extranodal lesions. PR= is a 50% decrease in the SPD for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including splenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. Participants were considered responders if they had a partial or complete response to a treatment while in the study.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a participant has not had an event, progression-free survival was censored at the date of the last adequate assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of death from any cause (up to approximately 5 years)</time_frame>

PR= is a 50% decrease in the SPD for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including splenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. Participants were considered responders if they had a partial or complete response to a treatment while in the study as per Investigator's assessment.</description>
