  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is very common, affecting approximately 5% of women of&#xD;
      reproductive age, and impacts not only on quality of life, but also has long-term health&#xD;
      consequences for many sufferers, such as increased risks of developing Type II diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and cancer of the womb. The symptoms that may occur such as irregular&#xD;
      periods; lots of body hair; thinning hair on scalp, obesity and infertility, can also lead to&#xD;
      poor self-esteem. Whilst treatments can help fertility, other treatments to correct the other&#xD;
      symptoms are less successful. Alternative methods to regulate periods would be helpful,&#xD;
      especially ones which avoid the long-term use of steroids in patients who may already be&#xD;
      overweight. Reflexology is poorly represented in scientific papers, with nothing published&#xD;
      regarding reflexology and its effect upon PCOS. However patients who use reflexology report&#xD;
      more regular periods, thicker hair on scalp and greater wellbeing. Therefore we aim to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of reflexology on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The menstruation cycle (normal being every 21-35 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imbalances in hormone, insulin and blood sugar levels associated with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other problems associated with PCOS such as thinning hair on scalp, excessive body hair,&#xD;
           and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life. Government and NHS agendas agree that if there's evidence of an&#xD;
           effective complimentary therapy the NHS should provide it. Therefore the results may&#xD;
           have an influence on the care pathways of patients with PCOS towards a more holistic,&#xD;
           patient centred and empowered approach. It is also non invasive and liable to result in&#xD;
           higher patient satisfaction regarding their treatment. This research may also inform&#xD;
           policy makers so that complementary medicine provision is provided on a wider basis&#xD;
           within the NHS, which at the moment is dictated by the individual Trust's budget&#xD;
           allocation. However this research could save money overall as in America, the yearly&#xD;
           cost of treating PCOS is $4.36 billion.&#xD;
