      Treatment for 3.5-8 weeks with GH (0.05 mg/kg/day) +GLN+Diet, followed by continued&#xD;
      compliance to the individualized oral diet and enteral GLN, will result in reduced volume of&#xD;
      TPN infusion/week and/or reduced frequency of TPN infusions/week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male or female between 19 and 78 years of age, inclusive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Dependent upon TPN and/or IV fluids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to receive TPN because of a documented history of complications associated with&#xD;
             the long-term parenteral infusions (e.g. lack of venous access, multiple septic&#xD;
             events, progressive liver dysfunction while on TPN, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A documented remnant bowel anatomy that is inconsistent with adequately supporting&#xD;
             life without parenteral support (e.g. &lt; 70 cm of healthy small intestine and a portion&#xD;
             of colon, or less than 150 cm in patients with no colon)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A documented history of diarrhea and/or malabsorption that has significantly&#xD;
             compromised the patient's nutritional and hydration status (e.g. significant weight&#xD;
             loss - 5% over 1 month or 10% over 6 months, or a serum albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dl, documented&#xD;
