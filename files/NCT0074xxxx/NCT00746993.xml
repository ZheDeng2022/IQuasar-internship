    <textblock>
      In the United States, highly effective methods of birth control are often not used.&#xD;
      Healthcare providers use birth control counseling and patient education as ways to increase&#xD;
      the usage of birth control. However, little evidence exists to show that patient education&#xD;
      and birth control counseling changes birth control use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to evaluate the effectiveness of using a uniform set of birth control information to&#xD;
      provide birth control education to women having an early pregnancy termination. The&#xD;
      counselors will allow the clients to both read as well as hear the information. We propose to&#xD;
      evaluate whether this counseling will lead to 1) more women choosing highly effective&#xD;
      nonpermanent birth control methods and 2) more women continuing to use these methods for a&#xD;
      longer time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the study will complete a questionaire about their health. Half of them will have&#xD;
      the structured counseling and half will have the routine counseling currently offered to&#xD;
      women as a part of their routine care. We will contact all study participants with a&#xD;
      telephone call three months and six months later to have a 10 minute conversation about what&#xD;
      birth control they are using.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the primary study&#xD;
      hypothesis that structured counseling immediately before a first trimester vacuum aspiration&#xD;
      procedure will result in more women choosing a highly effective contraceptive method compared&#xD;
      to women receiving routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of pregnant women seeking a first trimester suction procedure&#xD;
      in a single Medicaid-based practice in New York City. We need 125 participants in both the&#xD;
      control group and the intervention group for a total of 250 participants. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for enrollment in the study are (1) age greater than or equal to 18 years,(2)&#xD;
      seeking contraception, (3) Spanish or English speaking, (4) access to a telephone, and (5)&#xD;
      willing to participate in the study. We recognize that patients may be anxious about their&#xD;
      scheduled procedure. Information about the procedure will be available to all patients in our&#xD;
      clinic to inform and help alleviate anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being consented, all participants will complete the baseline questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the control group will proceed to routine care. Routine care consists of&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling by the clinician performing the vacuum procedure. The clinician will&#xD;
      evaluate the medical eligibility of each participant for FDA-approved contraceptive methods&#xD;
      as part of routine care. Every clinician in the practice is a faculty member, fellow, or&#xD;
      resident physician training under faculty supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the intervention group will engage in structured counseling with the&#xD;
      research coordinator, and then proceed to routine care. The structured counseling will take&#xD;
      place while the participant would normally be waiting for care. We will pay attention to&#xD;
      ensure that study participation does not prolong the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured counseling consists of a bilingual research coordinator going through the 2005&#xD;
      Decision Making Tool (D.M.T.) for family planning clients and providers developed by the&#xD;
      World Health Organization(W.H.O.). Samples of each FDA-approved method will be present during&#xD;
      the structured counseling session for participants to directly see and touch as desired. The&#xD;
      link to this freely available counseling tool in English and Spanish is&#xD;
      www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/dmt/index.html.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our study, we modified the original version to include only FDA-approved contraceptive&#xD;
      methods available in the United States suitable for a post-abortion population. Information&#xD;
      about methods not available in the United States(NETEN injections, monthly injections and&#xD;
      norplant) was removed. Information about new FDA-approved methods available in the United&#xD;
      States (contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, levonorgestrel IUS, and etonogestrel&#xD;
      implant),but not previously included, was added. Information about methods not appropriate&#xD;
      for post abortion patients (lactational amenorrhea and fertility awareness) was removed. We&#xD;
      performed all modifications with the full support and cooperation of Sarah Johnson, technical&#xD;
      officer in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research at the World Health&#xD;
      Organization. We have attached our modified version with this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All FDA-approved methods will be available to participants on the day of their scheduled&#xD;
      procedure for immediate initiation. Participants choosing an intrauterine device or implant&#xD;
      will be able to have them placed that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants choosing depot medroxyprogesterone acetate will be able to have the injection&#xD;
      that day. Participants choosing the pill, ring, or patch will receive a one month supply and&#xD;
      continuing prescription that day. All participants will receive condoms and information about&#xD;
      emergency contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the visit, we will perform a brief secondary questionnaire. We will ask&#xD;
      participants to indicate their chosen FDA-approved method and identify if the method was&#xD;
      initiated that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will take place at three months and six months with phone calls to obtain data from&#xD;
      participants about the contraceptive method adopted and the contraceptive method use since&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
