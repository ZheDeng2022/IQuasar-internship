  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of&#xD;
      rabeprazole after single and multiple daily administration in children between the ages of 1&#xD;
      and 11 years, inclusive, with GERD.&#xD;

      This is an open-label (both the physician and the patient know the name of the study&#xD;
      medication), multi-center, Phase 1 study, consisting of 2 parts. The first part of the study&#xD;
      will be non-randomized, all patients will receive the same dose. In the second part of the&#xD;
      study, patients will be randomized (study medication assigned by chance) into 2 dose groups.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (clinical&#xD;
      global impressions and formulation palatability) and safety of rabrepazole after single and&#xD;
      multiple daily administration at 2 dose levels in children between the ages of 1 and 11&#xD;
      years, inclusive, with GERD. As this study is an exploratory assessment of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of rabeprazole in children, no formal&#xD;
      hypothesis testing is applied. Safety and tolerability, including monitoring of adverse&#xD;
      events, clinical laboratory results, physical examination, vital signs and ECG measurements,&#xD;
      will be evaluated throughout the study. Patients will receive rabeprazole sodium as single&#xD;
      daily oral doses for 5 successive days as a bead formulation. Patients in the first part of&#xD;
      the study will receive single and multiple daily every 24 hours doses of 0.14 mg/kg, using&#xD;
      increments of 1 mg dose. Safety and pk data from part 1 of the study will determine the 2&#xD;
      dosages to be studied in part 2 of the study.&#xD;

             an endoscopic examination as part of their diagnostic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with, or are currently receiving a proton pump&#xD;
             inhibitor (PPI), H2 blockers, or antacids are eligible (as long as they can go off&#xD;
             antacids for 24 hours, and PPIs and H2 blockers for 3 days prior to dosing, except for&#xD;
