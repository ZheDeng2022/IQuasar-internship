      Postpartum depression (PPD) is depression that occurs shortly after the mother delivers her&#xD;
      baby. Mothers with postpartum depression may feel sad mood, low motivation or stress; some&#xD;
      may have problems caring for their new baby. Successful depression treatment involves early&#xD;
      screening and detection of postpartum depression and early access to treatment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone-based depression&#xD;
      screening and care management program for postpartum women. We will evaluate the: 1) how&#xD;
      often (frequency) young mothers develop symptoms of depression 4 to 6 weeks after birth, 2)&#xD;
      how quickly (timeliness) young mother receive treatment and how effective (adequacy) are the&#xD;
      treatments for the symptoms of postpartum depression, 3) the effects of depression care&#xD;
      support on young mothers' symptoms and their ability to function at 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      entering the study, 4) visits to the pediatrician or nurse practitioner (preventive health&#xD;
      services) during their baby's first year of life, and 5) cost and cost savings associated&#xD;
      with depression care management.&#xD;

      Depression during the perinatal period is a major public health concern. Postpartum&#xD;
      depression (PPD) causes personal and family suffering at a time when adaptation to parenthood&#xD;
      is critical. Successful interventions for treating depression in medical settings have been&#xD;
      framed by a chronic disease management model. The key ingredient to success is a dedicated&#xD;
      care manager who provides education and support to patients, actively coordinates care, and&#xD;
      thereby improves treatment outcomes for patients. Compared to interventions in medical office&#xD;
      settings, telephone care management positioned at the level of the health plan offers a&#xD;
      systematic and efficient mechanism for ongoing treatment support of women with PPD,&#xD;
      particularly in a geographically dispersed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a comprehensive project to improve treatment outcomes for depressed&#xD;
      postpartum women through adaptation of the depression care management model used in primary&#xD;
      care settings. The major components are: 1) depression screening in a population of&#xD;
      postpartum adolescents, 2) depression education for all who screen positive, 3) a diagnostic&#xD;
      interview to evaluate for depressive disorders in mothers who score above and below a defined&#xD;
      threshold on the screening instrument, 4) telephone-based care management intervention, and&#xD;
      5) longitudinal evaluation across the first year post-birth for depression and maternal and&#xD;
      child public health outcomes. Focus groups will precede the major study components. A focus&#xD;
      group of adolescent mothers will inform the investigators about the barriers to depression&#xD;
      care management that encompass resource needs, acceptability of interventions to cope with&#xD;
      stress or depression, and access to care. A separate focus group of community professionals&#xD;
      of representatives from agencies or groups that provide community supports and health&#xD;
      services will be used to explore the perceptions of barriers to care for new adolescent&#xD;
      mothers. All participants in this project will be eligible for mental health services through&#xD;
      their health plans that serve Medicaid and commercial members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to identify 125 child or adolescent new mothers with PPD. The child or adolescent new&#xD;
      mothers will be assigned to depression care management. They will be supported in making&#xD;
      choices about depression treatment (after receiving education about options), encouraged to&#xD;
      access their preferred treatment (through the direct discussion of barriers and solutions),&#xD;
      counseled to comply with treatment recommendations, and assisted to problem-solve if failure&#xD;
      to respond occurs. All participants will have systematic evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-birth. Outcomes include not only maternal depressive symptom levels but also functional&#xD;
      and public health outcomes for mothers, families, and infants. We have developed a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team with expertise in clinical research with depressed and minority women&#xD;
      and health services to address these needs.&#xD;
