  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to understand whether it is possible to reduce medical&#xD;
      risk factors in adults with bipolar disorder and, in doing so, to improve psychiatric and&#xD;
      functional outcomes. We will examine the role of behavioral risk factors and presumed&#xD;
      behavioral mediators and moderators of health risk in individuals suffering from bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder. The investigators will employ an innovative behavioral intervention with guideline&#xD;
      based psychiatric care ( Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention - IRRI) in order to target&#xD;
      modifiable medical risk factors.&#xD;

      IRRI is aimed at improving sleep/wake and social rhythm disturbance and achieving modest&#xD;
      weight reduction by increasing physical activity and improving nutrition and dietary habits,&#xD;
      while at the same time providing optimal psychiatric care and medical monitoring. This will&#xD;
      allow us to investigate the role that improvements in sleep/wake and social rhythm&#xD;
      regularity, diet, and physical activity have in improving psychiatric and functional&#xD;
      outcomes. In order to examine another set or possible pathways (i.e., that it is the&#xD;
      amelioration or psychiatric symptoms that leads to the improvements in physical health), we&#xD;
      will contrast outcomes of subjects receiving IRRI with those of subjects receiving&#xD;
      psychiatric care with medical monitoring (PCMM), which incorporates the same optimal&#xD;
      psychiatric care plus monitoring of medical conditions. These aims will be achieved in a&#xD;
      24-month randomized treatment trial of 144 adult subjects with bipolar I disorder.&#xD;

    <description>The integrated risk reduction intervention (IRRI) consists of three components:&#xD;
psychiatric treatment by a study psychiatrist&#xD;
assessment, referral, monitoring, and coordination by a certified registered nurse practitioner (CRNP) of medical treatment provided by the subject's own primary care physician&#xD;
a healthy lifestyle behaviors program delivered by a lifestyle coach. The treating psychiatrist will work in collaboration with a CRNP and a lifestyle coach. The CRNP will assess and monitor the subject's medical needs and refer the subject to their primary care physician for care and will follow-up on adherence to the medical treatment recommendations. The CRNP will be responsible for coordinating the psychopharmacological care provided by the psychiatrist, the healthy lifestyle behaviors program that will be delivered by the lifestyle coach, and the medical care provided by the subject's PCP.</description>

The psychiatric care with medical monitoring condition (PCMM) consists of two components:&#xD;
psychiatric treatment by a study psychiatrist&#xD;
assessment and referral by a psychiatric research nurse for medical treatment provided by the subject's own primary care physician.&#xD;
The treating psychiatrist will be assisted by a psychiatric nurse clinician who will assess and monitor the subject's medical needs and refer the subject to their primary care physician for care.</description>
