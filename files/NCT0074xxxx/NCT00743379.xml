  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TH-302, in combination with A) Gemcitabine, or&#xD;
      B) Docetaxel or C) Pemetrexed methotrexate, are safe and effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      Pancreatic Cancer, Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer, and Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A broad range of tumors have been shown to contain significant numbers of hypoxic cells and&#xD;
      hypoxia has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis and an increase in resistance&#xD;
      to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brizel 1997, Vaupel 2007, Shannon 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that an agent that could effectively target hypoxic regions in tumors would&#xD;
      improve efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TH-302 is&#xD;
      activated at lower oxygen concentrations than other bioreductive prodrugs (Duan 2008) and&#xD;
      tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin that has been extensively studied in both preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical studies. This should result in an improved therapeutic ratio (tumor vs normal tissue&#xD;
      toxicity) as compared with other bioreductive agents. Because TH-302 is expected to be&#xD;
      minimally toxic to aerobic cancer cells, optimal efficacy would be expected when TH-302 is&#xD;
      combined with treatments that are most effective under aerobic conditions such as&#xD;
      radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preclinical data have shown at least additive&#xD;
      efficacy when TH-302 is combined with either docetaxel or gemcitabine. In order to minimize&#xD;
      the risk of additive toxicity, TH-302 is not being evaluated in combination with alkylating&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
