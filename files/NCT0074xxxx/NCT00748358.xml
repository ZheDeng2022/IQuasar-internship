  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      as second-line treatment in metastatic prostate cancer, the present study will investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy of sunitinib (SUTENT) given orally at a dose of 37.5 mg continuously, for 6&#xD;
      cycles of 6 consecutive weeks .Patients who are still responders after 6 cycles will be&#xD;
      treated until disease progression, pain progression, unacceptable toxicity or death due to&#xD;
      any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose increase or reduction of 12.5 mg increments and change of schedule is recommended based&#xD;
      on individual safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for up to 1 year from the last dose of sunitinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Antitumor efficacy of sunitinib will be assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PSA response rate and PSA progression according Working Group Criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variation of PSA doubling time (PSADT) before and after initiation of the&#xD;
                treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical benefit,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic endpoints will include sunitinib and its metabolite, SU012662, plasma&#xD;
           levels and estimation of the population pharmacokinetic parameters as well as the&#xD;
           inter-individual variability of these parameters, for a subgroup of 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biological effects of sunitinib in patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma will&#xD;
           be evaluated by measurements of the different biological markers that could be modulated&#xD;
           by this antiangiogenic therapeutic, and could then predict and monitor disease&#xD;
           progression and response to treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone tumor markers: bone resorption markers (uCTX, uCTX, ICTP, CTX-MMP and&#xD;
                TRACP-5b), bone formation markers (OC, PINP and BALP), osteoclastogenesis markers&#xD;
                (OPG and RANKL) and parameters as calcium, phosphate, creatinine, albumin, PTH and&#xD;
                25(OH)D.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Angiogenesis markers: bFGF, SDF-1, VEGF-A, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, CECs and CEPs,&#xD;
                endothelial and platelet microparticles.&#xD;
