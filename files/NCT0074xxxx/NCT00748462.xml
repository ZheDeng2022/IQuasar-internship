      -  The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and side effects of a&#xD;
           fractional CO2 laser for treatment of acne scar in Asians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Reduction in acne scars based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one&#xD;
                and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low&#xD;
                density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant&#xD;
                (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in acne scars based on before&#xD;
                photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is&#xD;
                statistically significant (5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reduction in fine lines based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one&#xD;
                and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low&#xD;
                density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant&#xD;
                (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in fine lines based on before&#xD;
                photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is&#xD;
                statistically significant (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Reduction in pigmented disorders based on blinded evaluation of before photos and&#xD;
                the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with&#xD;
                low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant&#xD;
                (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in pigmented disorders based on&#xD;
                before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is&#xD;
                statistically significant (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Improvements in skin texture and pore size based on blinded evaluation of before&#xD;
                photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse&#xD;
                Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically&#xD;
                significant (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in skin texture and pore size based&#xD;
                on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is&#xD;
                statistically significant (5%).&#xD;
