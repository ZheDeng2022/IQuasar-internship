  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that participants with Paget's disease of the&#xD;
      bone who had responded to zoledronic acid treatment as participants in the core registration&#xD;
      studies CZOL446K2304 and CZOL446K2305 and later experienced a relapse can be successfully&#xD;
      treated with a 5 milligram (mg) infusion of zoledronic acid.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Within the Normal Range at Month 6 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) occurred if the SAP measurement fell within the normal ranges. The lower and upper limits of normal ranges were 31 and 110 Units/Liter (U/L) for participants with age ≤ 58 years old and 35 and 115 U/L for participants with age &gt; 58 years old, respectively. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was defined as the last post-baseline SAP value prior to month 6 for a participant who did not have an SAP value at month 6.</description>

    <description>Adverse event was the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that occurred after starting the study drug even if the event was not considered to be related to study drug. TEAEs were defined as AEs that were absent prior to, but occurred after the i.v. infusion of study drug. TEAEs also included those that were present prior to the i.v. study drug infusion (i.e., as part of the extended observation period) but occurred at an increased severity after the i.v. infusion of study drug.</description>
