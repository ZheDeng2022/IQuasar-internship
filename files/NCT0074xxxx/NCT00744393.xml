  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what effect sodium oxybate has on the functions of&#xD;
      sleep in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients hospitalized in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is disrupted in the critically ill and may lead to impaired neurocognitive function,&#xD;
      decreased immune function, increased protein catabolism, and may compromise the ability to&#xD;
      wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Critically ill patients may appear to sleep&#xD;
      throughout most of their stay, but their quality of sleep is different from that of a normal&#xD;
      healthy subject.Critically ill patients spend more time in the wakefulness stages of sleep&#xD;
      (Stage 1 and 2) at the expense of the restorative stages (Stage 3 and 4) and REM sleep. These&#xD;
      patients also experience an increased number of arousals and awakenings. Various factors are&#xD;
      thought to be the cause of abnormal sleep architecture: ICU environment, pain, illness&#xD;
      severity, psychosocial stress, medications, and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) is the sodium salt of the central nervous system depressant&#xD;
      γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and is currently approved for use in narcoleptic patients to&#xD;
      improve cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating the use of sodium oxybate in narcoleptic patients suggest that sodium&#xD;
      oxybate is effective at increasing slow-wave sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and&#xD;
      REM-sleep efficiency, while also decreasing REM-sleep latency, stage 1 NREM sleep and sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation.3, 16-19 Currently there is a lack of data evaluating the effects of sodium&#xD;
      oxybate on sleep in critically ill patients. Obtaining evidence that sodium oxybate improves&#xD;
      sleep architecture in the critically ill, may provide the foundation to complete future&#xD;
      studies evaluating the effect of sodium oxybate on clinical outcomes such as duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. Based on sodium oxybate's ability to improve&#xD;
      sleep architecture in narcoleptic patients along with the fact that critically ill patients&#xD;
      have similar disrupted sleep architecture, it's postulated that sodium oxybate may improve&#xD;
      the sleep architecture in critically ill patients.&#xD;
