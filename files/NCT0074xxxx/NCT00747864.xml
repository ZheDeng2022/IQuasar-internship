  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S100B, a calcium-binding protein, is found predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      and is increased in CSF and blood after CNS injury. There are two objectives to this study.&#xD;
      1) To complement our previous study, is urine S100B concentration correlated with gestational&#xD;
      age in infants born at &gt; 28 weeks gestation during the first week of life? 2) Is the urine&#xD;
      concentration of S100B affected by intracranial pathology in this gestational age range?&#xD;
      Elevation of urine concentration of S100B may be an indicator that the infant will develop&#xD;
      serious intracranial pathology and may allow for early initiation of treatment to potentially&#xD;
      decrease morbidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S100B is a low molecular weight calcium binding protein found predominantly in the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS), specifically astroglial cells.[1] S100B plays a role in&#xD;
      calcium-dependent information processing and intracellulary is involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      cytoskeleton and cell morphology.[1] S100B is secreted by astrocytes and exhibits dose&#xD;
      dependent extracellular cytokine functions. In tissue culture at nanomolar concentration,&#xD;
      S100B stimulates neuronal growth, development, and regeneration and protects against&#xD;
      degeneration. At micromolar concentration, S100B is neurotoxic [2] and stimulates apoptosis&#xD;
      potentially through interaction with RAGE receptor, by induction of NO synthase, and through&#xD;
      the caspase cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence to support the S100B's role in development and maturation of the CNS is that&#xD;
      S100B is differentially distributed in different cortical regions of the brain during fetal&#xD;
      development and increases in concentration during gestation.[3] It is postulated that early&#xD;
      in development, S100B stimulates glial cell proliferation while later it leads to extension&#xD;
      of neurites, regulation of fiber sprouting, formation/maintenance of synapses, and maturation&#xD;
      of glial cells.[1] Cord blood concentration of S100B has been shown to be inversely related&#xD;
      to gestational age between 27 to 42 weeks gestation.[4] Thirty term infants (37-42 weeks) had&#xD;
      mean cord blood S100B concentration of 0.47 ug/L (range 0-1.5ug/L) while 28 preterm infants&#xD;
      (27-36 weeks) had a mean cord blood concentration of 1.14ug/L (range 0.5 and 2.7 ug/L).&#xD;
      Higher serum concentration of S100B in preterm infants may be due the physiologic increase&#xD;
      noted during development and/or lack of integrity of the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B is released from damaged astroglial cells and may reflect neuronal damage.[5,6]&#xD;
      Concentration of S100B is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adult patients within 48&#xD;
      hours after infarction and remains elevated for at least 7 days after the event.[6] S100B is&#xD;
      also elevated in CSF for the first 3 days after traumatic brain injury [7] and subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage.[8] Due to its low molecular weight, S100B readily crosses a dysfunctional&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier and serum concentration of S100B is significantly increased in adult&#xD;
      patients after traumatic brain injury [9], stroke [10], or cardiac arrest.[5] Serum S100B&#xD;
      rises for 2-4 days after brain trauma or infarct and its concentration correlates with size&#xD;
      of damage as identified by CT scan. [9,10] After cardiac arrest, serum S100B concentration&#xD;
      was statistically elevated by 30 minutes after initiation of CPR and continued to be&#xD;
      significantly elevated in those patients who later exhibited brain damage by CT scan or&#xD;
      neurological exam.[5] This significant elevation in serum S100B lasted for at least 7 days.&#xD;
      In addition, serum S100B concentration correlated with morbidity [9] and neurological&#xD;
      outcome.[10] While the t1/2 of S100B is ~2 hours in adults, persistently increased&#xD;
      concentration of S100B in serum indicates continuous release from damaged cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common CNS trauma for preterm infants is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).[11] IVH&#xD;
      originates in the microcirculation/capillary network of the germinal matrix. Altered cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow secondary to poor cerebral autoregulation or systemic hypo- or hypertension,&#xD;
      platelet and coagulation disturbances, infection, and decreased capillary integrity and&#xD;
      vascular support have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IVH. IVH is graded (1-4) by&#xD;
      extent of hemorrhage seen by ultrasound. In grade I IVH, the blood is confined to the&#xD;
      germinal matrix. In Grade II IVH, blood is present in the germinal matrix and a small of&#xD;
      blood is present in the ventricles. Grade III IVH occurs when the ventricles are filled with&#xD;
      blood and dilated. In Grade IV IVH, blood extends into the brain parenchyma due to venous&#xD;
      congestion of the terminal veins that border the lateral ventricles which leads to white&#xD;
      matter necrosis. Grades I and II IVH are not associated with an increase in developmental&#xD;
      abnormalities, but do not insure normalcy. Grades III and IV IVH (severe IVH) are highly&#xD;
      associated with developmental delay, specifically spastic hemiplegia affecting the lower&#xD;
      extremities more than the upper extremities due to the proximity of the hemorrhage to the&#xD;
      descending motor fibers, and may also affect intellect. IVH, both mild (grade 1-2) and severe&#xD;
      (grade 3-4) are rarely seen in infants with gestational age &gt; 28 weeks due to the&#xD;
      developmental involution of vessels in the germinal matrix which is the source of this&#xD;
      hemorrhage.[11]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its low molecular weight (10.5 kD) and high degree of solubility, S100B is excreted&#xD;
      through the kidneys. It has been detected in the first void urine of infants between 26-42&#xD;
      weeks gestation with the most preterm infant exhibiting the highest concentration of S100B&#xD;
      (3.17 ug/L).[12] Mean urine S100B concentration in term infants (n=60) was 0.07 ug/L. This&#xD;
      study is confounded by no mention of intracranial pathology, insufficient number of preterm&#xD;
      infants, and actual data was not shown. In another study, S100B was elevated in urine in&#xD;
      preterm infants (29-35 weeks gestation) with IVH (grade 2-4) at birth and continued to&#xD;
      increase over the subsequent 3 days when compared to control preterm infants.[13] The&#xD;
      severity of IVH significantly correlated with the concentration of S100B in the urine. The&#xD;
      highest level of S100B was seen in the five infants who died. An important limitation of the&#xD;
      above cited study is insufficient patient enrollment to allow for correlation of both&#xD;
      gestational age and presence of severe IVH on urine S100B concentration. Recently, we have&#xD;
      shown that urine concentration of S100B is not elevated in very preterm infants (23-28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation) without intracranial pathology.[pas abstract] However, very preterm infants with&#xD;
      severe IVH (grade 3-4) had significantly elevated urine concentration of S100B on day 1.[14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to establish baseline S100B concentration in the urine of&#xD;
      infants with gestational age &gt; 28 weeks. In addition, the impact of intracranial pathology,&#xD;
      that is IVH in preterm infants, will be further investigated. In the previous study, infants&#xD;
      who developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) had extremely high levels of S100B in the first&#xD;
      week of life. NEC affects preterm infants, mostly 26-32 weeks gestation, and can result in&#xD;
      death or markedly increased complications and prolonged length of stay. Secondary analysis of&#xD;
      infants in this study will investigate if the development of NEC is significantly associated&#xD;
      with a high concentration S100B in the urine. If this is true, one theory to explain this&#xD;
      finding is that infants who develop NEC had an event around the time of birth that caused&#xD;
      decrease intestinal perfusion allowing increased susceptibility to development of NEC.&#xD;
