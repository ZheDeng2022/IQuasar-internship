  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials indicate that genetic factors play a&#xD;
      significant role in the success of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) prior to in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization - embryo trandfer (IVF-ET). Women with the FSHR Ser680Asn Ser/Ser genotype make&#xD;
      up between 13% and 26% of women undergoing IVF-ET and are characterised by higher basal FSH&#xD;
      serum concentrations, the need for a higher amount of FSH for COS, and a higher risk of poor&#xD;
      response to COS and cycle cancellation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore intend to perform a study to investigate whether a&#xD;
      dose-intensified COS protocol based on FSHR genotype status in women with the FSHR Ser680Asn&#xD;
      Ser/Ser genotype is more effective than routine management in terms of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mean number of follicles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mean number of embryos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of poor responders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of women with cycle cancellations, and v) the clinical pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be randomized to a stimulation protocol characterised by a longer&#xD;
      duration and increased dosage of FSH stimulation (group A) or a standard stimulation protocol&#xD;
      (group B).&#xD;

      Women in group A will undergo controlled ovarian stimulation according to the following&#xD;
      protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pituitary down-regulation will be achieved using buserelin (Suprefact®, Hoechst, Frankfurt,&#xD;
      Germany) at a fixed daily dose of 200 mg s.c., according to a long agonist protocol, starting&#xD;
      on day 2 of the normal menstrual cycle. Treatment with r-hFSH (Gonal-F®, Serono Austria GmbH,&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria) will be started in women with serum E2 concentrations &lt;200 pmol/l and no&#xD;
      follicles &gt;15 mm in diameter or ovarian cysts on ultrasonographic examination. The initial&#xD;
      r-hFSH dose will be 250 IU s.c. daily for 5 days, after which the dose will be increased to a&#xD;
      maximum of 450 IU per day using a step-up protocol with steps of 50 IU/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the leading follicle has reached a diameter of 14 mm, patients will receive r-hLH&#xD;
      (lutropin alfa; Luveris®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) at a dose of 75 IU s.c. for a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 days. A dose of 75 IU LH per day was chosen based on findings from a&#xD;
      controlled, prospective, dose-finding study in gonadotrophin-deficient women (WHO I&#xD;
      classification) (7). Ovulation will be induced by administration of HCG (Profasi®, Serono&#xD;
      Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 10 000 IU i.m. or s.c., when at least two follicles have&#xD;
      reached a diameter of &gt;17 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval will be performed by ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration techniques&#xD;
      34-38 h after administration of HCG. IVF will be performed according to standard practices at&#xD;
      our institution. A maximum of three embryos will be transferred 48 h after oocyte retrieval&#xD;
      (ESHRE Committee on Good Clinical and Laboratory Practice, 1995 ). Patients will receive&#xD;
      micronized progesterone, 600 mg/day, by vaginal administration for at least the first 3 weeks&#xD;
      of pregnancy, beginning on the day of embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in group B will undergo ovarian hyperstimulation according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No pituitary down-regulation will be performed. Treatment with r-hFSH (Gonal-F®, Serono&#xD;
      Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) will be started in women with serum E2 concentrations &lt;200&#xD;
      pmol/l and no follicles &gt;15 mm in diameter or ovarian cysts on ultrasonographic examination.&#xD;
      The r-hFSH dose will be 150 IU s.c. daily for 11 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the leading follicle has reached a diameter of 14 mm, patients will receive r-hLH&#xD;
      (lutropin alfa; Luveris®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) at a dose of 75 IU s.c. for a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 days. A dose of 75 IU LH per day was chosen based on findings from a&#xD;
      controlled, prospective, dose-finding study in gonadotrophin-deficient women (WHO I&#xD;
      classification) (European Recombinant Human LH Study Group, 1998 ). Ovulation will be induced&#xD;
      by administration of HCG (Profasi®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 10 000 IU i.m. or&#xD;
      s.c., when at least two follicles have reached a diameter of &gt;17 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval will be performed by ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration techniques&#xD;
      34-38 h after administration of HCG. IVF will be performed according to standard practices at&#xD;
      our institution. A maximum of three embryos will be transferred 48 h after oocyte retrieval&#xD;

      micronized progesterone, 600 mg/day, by vaginal administration for at least the first 3 weeks&#xD;
      of pregnancy, beginning on the day of embryo transfer.&#xD;
