  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the developmental stage of laparoscopic cholecystectomy it was considered 'unsafe' or&#xD;
      'technically difficult' to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. With&#xD;
      increasing experience in laparoscopic surgery, a number of centers have reported on the use&#xD;
      of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, suggesting that it is technically&#xD;
      feasible but at the expense of a high conversion rate, which can be up to 35 per cent and&#xD;
      common bile duct lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HARMONIC SCALPEL® (H) is the leading ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device,&#xD;
      offering surgeons important benefits including: minimal lateral thermal tissue damage,&#xD;
      minimal charring and desiccation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H technology reduces the need for ligatures with simultaneous cutting and coagulation:&#xD;
      moreover there is not electricity to or through the patient H has a greater precision near&#xD;
      vital structures and it produces minimal smoke with improved visibility in the surgical&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In retrospective series LC performed with H was demonstrated feasible and effective with&#xD;
      minimal operating time and blood loss: it was reported also a low conversion rate (3.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However there are not prospective randomized controlled trials showing the advantages of H&#xD;
      compared to MD (the commonly used electrical scalpel) in LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this RCT is to demonstrate that H can reduce conversion rate compared to MD in LC for&#xD;
      AC.&#xD;

      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study project is a prospective, randomized investigation. The study will be performed in&#xD;
      the Department of Emergency Surgery St Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital (Bologna, Italy),&#xD;
      a large teaching institutions, with the participation of all surgeons who accept to be&#xD;
      involved in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided in two groups: in the first group the patient will be submitted&#xD;
      to early LC within 72 hours after the diagnosis with H while in the second group will be&#xD;
      submitted to early LC within 72 hours with MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW RANDOMIZED&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be obtained through computer-generated schedule. The result of this&#xD;
      randomization will be sealed in numbered envelopes. After cholecystitis diagnosis if the&#xD;
      patient fulfils the inclusion criteria the responsible surgeon will ask the patient to&#xD;
      participate to the study. If the patient agree, he/ she will sign the informed consent. After&#xD;
      patient's consent the randomization will be carried out. The responsible surgeon will record&#xD;
      the patient name (and number).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been calculated to reach a confidence level of 95% with a power of 80%.A&#xD;
      sample size of 42 patients is calculated supposing that the hospital stay for LC with H the&#xD;
      conversion rate can be reduced from 35% to 3%. The sample size will be 21 patients for each&#xD;
      group (42 patients for the whole study).For comparison of the two groups, chi-square analysis&#xD;
      and Fisher's exact test are used when appropriate for qualitative data, and the Student&#xD;
      t-test (for normal variables) or the Mann Whitney U-test (for nonnormal variables) for&#xD;
      quantitative data. For multivariate analysis the stepwise logistic regression is applied. A&#xD;
      probability of 0.05 or less is accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data collected will include patient demographics and comorbid conditions&#xD;
      (genitourinary, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, or rheumatologic) and a detailed&#xD;
      history of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure was performed by a surgeon that had performed at least 50 LCs. On admission,&#xD;
      the patients were started on cefotaxime, 2 g IV every 12h, which was continued&#xD;
      postoperatively according to NNISS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard four-trocar operative technique is used for LC for acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the gallbladder is distended it will be first aspirated. To allow a good hold on the&#xD;
      gallbladder larger graspers will be inserted through a 5 mm right lower port. The cystic&#xD;
      artery and duct are clip-ligated in the MD group whereas in the H group cystic artery and&#xD;
      duct are closed by H. In the H group the surgeon will use only H, whereas in the MD group the&#xD;
      surgeon will use only MD. The gallbladder and intraperitoneal &quot;dropped&quot; stones are collected&#xD;
      in an endoscopic bag and extracted through the umbilical cannula site, which can be extended.&#xD;
      A closed system suction drain is left. Fascial closure is attempted only at the umbilical&#xD;
      cannula site. The skin at all the cannula sites are closed with staples. Conversion to&#xD;
      laparotomy will be decided by the operating surgeon and each conversion will be motivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Patients' data sheets are generated containing demographic data and&#xD;
      preoperative, operative, and postoperative information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative notes concern the history of gallbladder stones, the presence of associated&#xD;
      diseases (cardiac, hypertension, diabetes, malignancy), duration of gallbladder complaints&#xD;
      (as an indication for the onset of the disease), finding of a palpable gallbladder,&#xD;
      temperature, and laboratory results of WBC count, serum bilirubin, gamma GT, PCR, IL-6 and&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound findings are also reported. Operative data of concern are macroscopic findings (of&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis, gangrenous cholecystitis, hydrops, and empyema of the gallbladder), the&#xD;
      presence of small stones (&lt; 1 cm diameter) or large bile stones (&gt; 1 cm diameter),&#xD;
      information regarding perforation of the gallbladder and intraperitoneally &quot;lost&quot; stones,&#xD;
      reasons for con¬version, and duration of surgery. Postoperative notes of interest included&#xD;
      the use of nasogastric tubes and drains, the amount of analgesics used, (evaluation of pain&#xD;
      with VAS score), complications, and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications are classified as surgical infections (wound infection, subphrenic or&#xD;
      subhepatic abscess); noninfectious surgi¬cal problems (e.g., bile duct injury, hemorrhage);&#xD;
      remote infec¬tions (urinary or respiratory); and miscellaneous problems (e.g., atelectasis,&#xD;
      deep vein thrombosis, AMI, CVA, etc). The collected information are entered into a database&#xD;
      as either continuous or categorical variables for statistical analysis. Following the&#xD;
      operative procedure, a normal sterile dressing will be applied to cover the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second surgical team, aware of the operative findings but not the surgical dissection&#xD;
      instrument, then will assume the care of the patient. Postoperative care and ability to be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital will be determined by the second surgical team. The primary&#xD;
      operative team will be in every moment available for emergent consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient discharge will be base on good medical practice criteria: 1) apyrexia 2) absence of&#xD;
      diseases requiring hospitalisation 3) return of bowel function 4) patient's compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IS THERE A PLACEBO? No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INFORMED CONSENT TO BE SOUGHT? Yes (see: Case Report Form)&#xD;

      protocol, the confidential nature of personal data and will fill up a questionnaire before&#xD;
      signing or refuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be not inconveniences caused to the patients. No incentives are planned for the&#xD;
      patients regarding the operation or the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the medical informations obtained from the patients will be kept confidentially among the&#xD;
      research scientists conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be free to withdraw from the study, whenever they want without any&#xD;
      obligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STOPPING RULES&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of newly discovered statistically significant advantages in one group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate that H can reduce conversion rate compared to MD in LC&#xD;
      for AC but also differences in terms of morbidity, mortality, operation time, hospital stay,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, return to normal activity will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of our study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the conversion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate morbidity, mortality, operation time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate hospital stay, postoperative pain, return to normal activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of any other complications will be recorded intraoperatively, postoperatively, at&#xD;
      discharge, at 7-days, 1-month and 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES? No.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SIDE EFFECTS QUANTIFICATION? Yes There are not different side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IS THERE AN ANALYSIS PLAN? Yes All the above mentioned data will be recorded in the Case&#xD;
           Report Form (annexed to this proposal) and later stored in computer database. At the end&#xD;
           of the study the final statistical examination will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARE THERE PLANS FOR INTERIM ANALYSIS? Yes An interim statistical examination of the data&#xD;
           will be done every 3 months during the period of patients' inclusion in the study. Then&#xD;
           at the end of every completed follow-up period (1-month, 6-months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARE THERE AN INDEPENDENT DATA-MONITORING COMITTEE? No&#xD;
&#xD;
      TYPE OF ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be carried out using Epi Info 2000, Version 1.1 software&#xD;
      package (Dean AG, Arner TG, Sangam S, Sunki GG, Friedman R, Lantinga M, Zubieta JC, Sullivan&#xD;
      KM, Smith DC. Epi Info 2000, a database and statistics program for public health&#xD;
      professionals for use on Windows 95, 98, NT, and 2000 computers; Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEMNITIES SPECIFIED&#xD;
&#xD;
      No incentives are planned for the patients regarding the operation or the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINISHING DATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take approximately 6 months - 1 year for the inclusion period. According to&#xD;
      the number of AC managed monthly, the duration of the inclusion period can be approximately&#xD;
      of 1 year to reach the number of about 42 enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPORTING DATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim report is planned at the end of any completed follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IS THE STUDY CLINICALLY NECESSARY? Yes&#xD;
&#xD;
      AC is a common disease. Any improvement in this field will benefit many patients reducing&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, conversion rate, operation time, hospital stay, postoperative pain,&#xD;
      return to normal activity and aesthetic result. All our patients will be informed about the&#xD;
      study and an informed consent will be obtained. There will not be inconveniences caused to&#xD;
      the patients. All the medical informations obtained from the patients will be kept&#xD;
      confidentially among the research scientists conducting the study. The patients will be free&#xD;
      to withdrawn from the study, whenever they want without any obligation.&#xD;
