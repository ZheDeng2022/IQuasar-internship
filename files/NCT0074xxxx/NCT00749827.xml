    <textblock>
      Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is a term applied to acute renal failure associated with&#xD;
      intravascular injection of iodinated contrast agents typically used for cardiac angiography.&#xD;
      CIN occurs in about 15% of those who have had cardiac angiography, with dialysis required by&#xD;
      about 0.5% of cases. The development of CIN is associated with other adverse outcomes&#xD;
      including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death. The mechanism underlying the&#xD;
      association with MACE and death is unclear and it is largely unknown whether measures&#xD;
      reducing the frequency or severity of CIN also reduce these associated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of CIN in humans is not known, but many preventive therapies have been tested based&#xD;
      on our understanding of the mechanism underlying CIN from animal models. Despite multiple&#xD;
      studies, no one drug or therapy has been proven to consistently prevent CIN at this time.&#xD;
      Prophylactic fluid therapy is uniformly recommended as a component of preventive approaches&#xD;
      for CIN. However, the optimal type, dose and duration of fluid therapy remain unclear.&#xD;
      Existing studies suggest a role for isotonic saline[3] or bicarbonate[4]. Initial use of&#xD;
      hypotonic fluid followed by isotonic fluid might allow a more rapid and sustained increase in&#xD;
      tubular fluid flow by suppression of ADH. This should assist in reducing tubular fluid&#xD;
      viscosity and the potential for injury by contrast medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research program is to design and test strategies for the prevention of CIN&#xD;
      in patients undergoing elective cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI). The primary purpose of this pilot study will be to determine the biological&#xD;
      plausibility of using a hypotonic solution for CIN prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effects of two fluid prophylaxis strategies for CIN on urine output,&#xD;
           urine pH, urine composition (urine metabolic profiling), a novel marker of renal injury&#xD;
           (NGAL) and urine osmolality Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relative sensitivity of definitions of CIN based on changes in serum&#xD;
           creatinine or cystatin C within 72 hours post contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the feasibility of a future multicenter randomized trial of a hypotonic&#xD;
           fluid prophylaxis strategy for the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.&#xD;

      Study Design We propose a pilot randomized trial evaluating the type of fluid chosen for CIN&#xD;
      prophylaxis. This study will be conducted at the Health Sciences Centre, St. John's, and the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bicarbonate hydration arm. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate (130 mEq per L) in 4.35% dextrose&#xD;
      at 3.5 ml per Kg over 1 hour pre-contrast, followed by the same solution intravenously at 1&#xD;
      ml/Kg/hr for 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotonic hydration arm. Intravenous 5% dextrose in water at 3.5 ml per Kg over 1 hour&#xD;
      pre-contrast followed by 0.9% saline intravenously at 1 ml per Kg per hr for 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases the maximum rate of fluid permitted is that for a body weight of 110 Kg.&#xD;
      Intra-vascular low-osmolal or iso-osmolal contrast (according to operator or institution&#xD;
      choice) will be used in the minimal dose needed to complete the required imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population The patient population for this study will be limited to urban dwellers&#xD;
      who meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our rationale for limiting this&#xD;
      study to urban dwellers is that blood and urine samples for NGAL need to be frozen at -70 for&#xD;
      shipping, therefore these tests will need to be done at the sites of storage and not in&#xD;
      peripheral labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment and Follow up Active treatment is limited to the hours while the&#xD;
      patient is in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Patients will be followed up to 7 days&#xD;
      post intervention. They will be asked to provide urine and/or blood samples collected at&#xD;
      baseline, pre-catheterization, 2 6, 24, and 48-72 hours post-angiography. They will be&#xD;
      followed up by telephone at 7 days post intervention to determine if they experienced any&#xD;
      adverse events related to the procedure or the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Baseline Information Baseline measures will include demographic information,&#xD;
      comorbidity, location, and indications for cardiac procedure, type of procedure to be&#xD;
      performed. Detailed information about the angiographic procedure will be recorded including&#xD;
      type and volume of parenteral contrast used. In addition accurate information regarding&#xD;
      baseline blood pressure, use of medications (specifically ACE inhibitors, angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers, NSAIDS, and diuretics) will be recorded as well as an evaluation of known&#xD;
      risk factors for CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Blood will be collected for measurement of serum creatinine and cystatin C&#xD;
      at baseline just prior to fluid administration, and at 6, 24 and 48-72 hours&#xD;
      post-angiography. Urine samples for measurement of urine pH, osmolality, electrolytes and&#xD;
      creatinine, and NGAL as well as metabolic profiling will be collected on all patients at&#xD;
      baseline, pre cardiac catheterization, 6 hours postcardiac catheterization, at the end of the&#xD;
      hydration period. As the majority of these patients will not have indwelling urinary&#xD;
      catheters, the urine samples will be collected as close to these time points as possible. A&#xD;
      table of sample collection timepoints is appended to this application. Assays will be&#xD;
      performed on stored samples at a single laboratory to ensure assay standardization between&#xD;
      sites. Duration of hospitalization (if any) will be determined by review of records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Identification of potential participants is feasible by review of data&#xD;
      collected for pre-admission purposes at each site's catheterization laboratory. Study&#xD;
      investigators will work collaboratively with the catheterization labs to identify and screen&#xD;
      potential participants. Following introduction by clinical staff, potential participants will&#xD;
      be approached by study nurses at each site, either on the day of or the day prior to cardiac&#xD;
      angiography. The study nurses will obtain consent, collect baseline information and blood and&#xD;
      urine specimens, and contact the local investigator for randomization. Once each patient has&#xD;
      been randomized the study nurse will arrange for administration of the study therapies and&#xD;
      provide the patient with requisitions for follow up blood work. The study investigator will&#xD;
      contact the patients either in person if hospitalized or by phone if discharged post&#xD;
      procedure and remind them about specimen collections at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size This study is exploratory in nature and therefore not powered to a specific&#xD;
      endpoint. Previous studies in this area have demonstrated positive results with sample sizes&#xD;
      in the order of 50 -100 subjects. We plan to enroll 100 patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Analysis will be by intention to treat. P values &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Given that this is a pilot study there will be no&#xD;
      interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effect of interventions on urinary outcomes The differences between treatment groups&#xD;
           will be analyzed using a linear regression model. Estimates and corresponding 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals will be reported. Additional covariates will be explored. Residual,&#xD;
           leverage and influence diagnostics will be examined. As metabolic profiling is a&#xD;
           relatively new technology patients will serve as their own controls and the results will&#xD;
           be reported as paired t tests, describing changes in metabolism associated with&#xD;
           radiocontrast administration. Attempts will be made to determine if fluid type&#xD;
           influences changes in metabolic profiles by comparing treatment arms using linear&#xD;
           regression techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relationship of changes in NGAL to serum creatinine and cystatin C Diagnostic statistics&#xD;
           (such as sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve) will also be explored for change in NGAL&#xD;
           level at 24 hours using a common definition of CIN as the reference standard (a 44umol/L&#xD;
           or 25% rise in serum creatinine at 72 hours post contrast). Additionally, different time&#xD;
           points (4 and 48 hours) for NGAL level will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Dr. Barrett and Dr. Pannu will oversee the data management for this study.&#xD;
      Blood and urine will be collected and stored at -70C locally at both participating centers,&#xD;
      which each have appropriate storage facilities&#xD;
