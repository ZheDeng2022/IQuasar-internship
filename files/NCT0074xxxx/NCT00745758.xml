      Extensive research has shown that the big event that leads to the initiation of vasospasm is&#xD;
      the release of oxyhemoglobin (blood breakdown product).Depletion of NO synthase (19,20,21)&#xD;
      was also noted after SAH.CSF is produced from choroid plexus in the ventricle. If the SAH is&#xD;
      too dense, the blood in the subarachnoid space will not easy to be washed out.&#xD;

      Cerebral vasospasm remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients with&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after an aneurysmal rupture. Despite being a significant source&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality, death and disability from vasospasm have declined from&#xD;
      approximately 35% in the early 1970's, to between 15% and 20% in the 1980's to &lt;10% in the&#xD;
      1990's(1,2,3,4).Extensive research has shown that the big event that leads to the initiation&#xD;
      of vasospasm is the release of oxyhemoglobin (blood breakdown product)(1,12,13). This&#xD;
      mechanism appears to be a multifactorial process that involves the generation of free&#xD;
      radicals, lipid peroxidation and activation of protein kinase C as well as phospholipase C&#xD;
      and A2 with resultant accumulation of diacylglycerol and the release of&#xD;
      endothelin-1(14,15,16,17,18). On the other hand, depletion of NO synthase (19,20,21) was also&#xD;
      noted after SAH. Previous reports showed that shunting of CSF through a lumbar drain after an&#xD;
      SAH markedly reduces the risk of clinically evident vasospasm and its sequelae, shortens&#xD;
      hospital stay, and improves outcome. Its beneficial effects are probably mediated through the&#xD;
      removal of spasmogens that exist in the CSF(22). In our preliminary data, we have&#xD;
      demonstrated a case with severe vasospasm, CSF was collected both from EVD and lumbar drain.&#xD;
      The ADMA level and amount of Nitrate was well correlate with vasospasm and the level was much&#xD;
      higher in lumbar drain then EVD. So, we will compared the CSF from EVD and lumbar puncture to&#xD;
      see which factor is correlate with vasospasm.&#xD;
