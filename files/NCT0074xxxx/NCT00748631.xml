      Balloon Kyphoplasty is an alternative to vertebroplasty in the treatment of painful malignant&#xD;
      vertebral fractures. This is a mini-invasive percutaneous treatment, aiming to stabilize the&#xD;
      vertebral fracture, decrease of pain. This technique also improves patient function. Namely,&#xD;
      bedridden patients are often able to resume walking in the days following vertebral cement&#xD;
      injection. Advantage of Balloon Kyphoplasty as compared to vertebroplasty is the ability to&#xD;
      inject the cement into the diseased vertebral body which shows cortical destruction with&#xD;
      lower pressure, thereby possibly reducing cement leakage and related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentric, observational prospective study. Patients are evaluated before and&#xD;
      after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty women or men older than 18 years, with 1 to 3 painful vertebral fracture(s) of&#xD;
      malignant origin (due to multiple myeloma or osteolytic vertebral metastasis) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Each patient will be followed during 1 year after the procedure with 7 visits at&#xD;
      D-8, D-1, D1, D15, D90, D180, and D360 or until the death of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main evaluation outcome is patient self-global satisfaction regarding the procedure on a&#xD;
      semi-quantitative satisfaction scale, 15 days after the Balloon Kyphoplasty.&#xD;

      Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) represent an important source of morbidity in patients&#xD;
      presenting osteolytic metastatic or myelomatous vertebral involvement. In addition, cancer&#xD;
      treatments may induce osteoporosis with an additional risk of vertebral fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medical treatments are symptomatic. They do not treat the fracture itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vertebroplasty is an interventional radiological technique that consists of injecting,&#xD;
           percutaneously, acrylic cement into the fractured vertebra under radiological guidance&#xD;
           and local or general anaesthesia, in order to combine two effects: stabilization of the&#xD;
           vertebral body fracture and pain reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balloon Kyphoplasty is a variant of vertebroplasty which is performed using the KyphX®&#xD;
           System (Medtronic., Sunnyvale, California). Balloon kyphoplasty aims at restore&#xD;
           vertebral height of the fractured vertebra using an inflatable balloon prior to inject&#xD;
           surgical polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA)cement,into the vertebral body to fix the fracture.&#xD;
           It is an expensive technique costing around 4,000 euros for up to 2 vertebrae in the&#xD;
           same patient. The surgical technique for the procedure has been described by LIBERMEAN&#xD;
           et al: A bilateral approach is usually chosen to insert working cannulas into the&#xD;
           posterior part of the vertebral body through a posterior transpedicular approach. In&#xD;
           case of limited and asymmetric vertebral destruction, a single unilateral approach may&#xD;
           be preferred. Fluoroscopy is used to insert the tools and control the procedure. With&#xD;
           reaming tools, two working channels are created and the balloons are inserted. The&#xD;
           balloons are available in lengths of 10, 15 and 20 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two balloons (one on each side) should ideally be centered at middle height between the&#xD;
      superior and inferior endplates and in the anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body. Balloon&#xD;
      placement into the vertebral body is checked using radiopaque markers at the two extremities&#xD;
      of the balloon. Once inserted, the balloons are inflated using visual, volume and pressure&#xD;
      control to create a cavity. Inflation is stopped when one of the following inflation&#xD;
      endpoints is reached: pressure raised over 400 psi, balloon contacts one of the cortical bone&#xD;
      of the vertebra or reaching maximal balloon inflation volume. The balloons are then deflated&#xD;
      and removed. The mean balloon inflation volume is 2 to 3ml. The Bone Filler Device, filled&#xD;
      before with 1.5 ml of PMMA, is then advanced through the working cannula towards the anterior&#xD;
      part of the cavity and cement is slowly extruded by a stainless steel stylet, acting as a&#xD;
      plunger. When the amount of cement from the first Bone Filler Device is delivered in the&#xD;
      cavity, it is removed and another Bone Filler Device is advanced through the working cannula.&#xD;
      This step is repeated till a complete fill of the cavity is obtained. The same procedure is&#xD;
      repeated through the other working cannula at the contra-lateral pedicle. Filling of the&#xD;
      cavity with highly viscous PMMA is performed under continuous fluoroscopic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to quantify the analgesic and patient function improvement of&#xD;
      Balloon Kyphoplasty together with complication types and rate in patients with malignant&#xD;
      vertebral fractures due to metastatic disease or multiple myeloma.&#xD;
