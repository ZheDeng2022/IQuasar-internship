      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of oral therapy with ZD6474 by evaluating the frequency, severity,&#xD;
           and duration of treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with poor prognosis lung&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record the extent, frequency and duration of any tumor responses to this treatment&#xD;
           regimen and assess whether ZD6474 augments the efficacy of radiation therapy in&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of ZD6474 for future clinical studies with&#xD;
           radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects on metabolism and angiogenic factors by positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (PET) scan/computed tomography (CT) scan , vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
           (VEGF), and circulating endothelial cell levels in patients treated with ZD6474 and&#xD;
           radiation therapy.&#xD;

      ZD6474 is a new drug that is thought to block the formation of new blood vessels. The growth&#xD;
      of new blood vessels is called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is thought to be essential for the&#xD;
      growth of tumors beyond a small size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, you will have several tests and procedures performed. These tests&#xD;
      will include a complete medical history and physical exam, including recent weight loss,&#xD;
      vital signs, and a test to check how easily you swallow. Laboratory tests needed will require&#xD;
      a urine sample, and blood samples (about 3-4 teaspoons). Women who are able to have children&#xD;
      must have a negative blood pregnancy test in order to participate in this study. You will&#xD;
      have an electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical activity of the heart),&#xD;
      heart function tests, and scans of your brain, chest, and bones. You will also have PET scans&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take part in this study if you are a patient with NSCLC who is not able to receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to participate, you will receive ZD6474 by mouth once a day every day,&#xD;
      along with radiation therapy. You must take your medication on an empty stomach, at&#xD;
      approximately the same time each morning. ZD6474 should be swallowed as a whole tablet (not&#xD;
      chewed, crushed or divided) and taken with 8 oz of water. Missed doses may be taken by the&#xD;
      end of the same calendar day. However, if a subject misses taking their scheduled dose on the&#xD;
      same day, he or she must take the next scheduled dose and the missed dose will not be made&#xD;
      up. The missed dose must be documented on patients medication diary ZD6474 will be given 5-7&#xD;
      days before starting radiation therapy and will continue through the entire course of&#xD;
      radiation therapy, unless there is proof that the cancer is progressing. ZD6474 may interact&#xD;
      with many commonly prescribed medications. A list will be provided to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation will be given every weekday (Monday - Friday) for 3-7 weeks as your doctor thinks&#xD;
      is necessary and useful. You will have weekly evaluations during radiation treatment,&#xD;
      including blood samples (3-4 teaspoons) for routine testing, oxygen saturation (a test that&#xD;
      measures how much oxygen is in the blood), and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you need anti-nausea medication (such as Zofran) during this study, you will have an ECG&#xD;
      performed within 24 hours of starting the medication and then again at least once a week&#xD;
      while you remain on the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue on study, unless there is evidence that the disease has gotten worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be seen for a follow-up visit one month after completing radiation therapy, and&#xD;
      again at 3 months. You will then come in for a follow-up visit every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years, then once a year. Scheduled tests and follow-ups should be&#xD;
      performed within 1 week (before or after) of the scheduled time period (a 14-day window). At&#xD;
      these visits, you will have blood draws (about 3-4 teaspoons), urine tests and x-rays. You&#xD;
      will have an ECG, lung function tests, and PET/CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3 months&#xD;
      following their last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ZD6474 is not FDA approved, and has been authorized for&#xD;
      research only. A total of up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;
