      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Placing gold&#xD;
      markers in the area where the tumor was removed may help doctors better direct radiation&#xD;
      therapy and help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well radiation therapy using gold markers works&#xD;
      in treating women with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the delivery of external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation&#xD;
           (APBI) based on gold fiducial markers is more accurate when compared to the delivery of&#xD;
           radiotherapy based on bony anatomy in women with early-stage, node-negative breast&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the migration of fiducial markers during a course of APBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the change in the volume of the seroma (lumpectomy) cavity during a course&#xD;
           of APBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall operative time for suturing fiducial markers into place vs current&#xD;
           standard method of placing surgical clips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo planned lumpectomy with gold fiducial marker placement (if&#xD;
      procedure not already performed). Patients who meet the post lumpectomy criteria for continue&#xD;
      treatment in this study proceed to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Between&#xD;
      15-80 days after surgery, patients undergo 3-dimensional APBI (may be intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy) using CT-guided planning (with gold fiducial markers placed at lumpectomy) once&#xD;
      daily, 5 days a week, for 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo fluoroscopy weekly to determine real-time movement of bony anatomy and&#xD;
      fiducial markers and cone-beam CT weekly to determine any change in volume of seroma cavity.&#xD;

                  invasive carcinoma is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
