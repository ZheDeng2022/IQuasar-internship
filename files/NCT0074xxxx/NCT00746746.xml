  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of giving subjects with advanced,&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory melanoma the HyperAcute® Melanoma vaccine with a variant of a drug,&#xD;
      called Interferon (PEG-Intron®) that is specially formulated to be given on a weekly basis&#xD;
      (instead of daily). The study vaccine (HyperAcute®-Melanoma) is made from three types of&#xD;
      human melanoma cell lines (grown in the laboratory) in which the genes have been slightly&#xD;
      changed. This clinical study will try to discover the safety of the study vaccine combined&#xD;
      with PEG-Intron®, its side effects and the potential benefits, if any.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the anti-tumor vaccine effect, side effects and toxicity of the&#xD;
      HyperAcute® Vaccine with PEG-Intron®. It is hoped that the immune system's response to these&#xD;
      genetically engineered melanoma cells and PEG-Intron® will cause a reaction that will make it&#xD;
      react to and attack and kill the melanoma cells and keep it from growing, possibly causing&#xD;
      the tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are eligible are 19 years or older and have been diagnosed with advanced,&#xD;
      treatment resistant or recurrent melanoma, an aggressive usually pigmented form of skin&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
