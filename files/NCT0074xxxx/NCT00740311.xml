  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a dental extraction, the osseous alveoli fill naturally of a blood clot which is&#xD;
      transformed some month later into osseous tissues. Even if the alveolar walls remain intact&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention, the healing always comes along with a physiological reduction&#xD;
      at the level of the site. The reduction of the alveolar crests is a continuous, cumulative&#xD;
      and inexorable phenomenon This reduction entails in the long term aesthetic and functional&#xD;
      damages which complicate the prosthetic rehabilitation of the dental articulate. That the&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitation is removable or fixed, implanto-carried or not, it is made more&#xD;
      difficult and less comfortable for the patient. In oral surgery, certain pathologies require&#xD;
      for their treatment the use of materials of filling generating an activity of reduction /&#xD;
      osseous replacement ending in the formation of a physiological calcified neo-tissue. Numerous&#xD;
      products of osseous replacement were already used to realize alveolar fillings to avoid this&#xD;
      inevitable and strongly harmful osseous loss.The purpose of the present study is to quantify&#xD;
      the physiological osseous loss due to the dental extraction with or without filling by a&#xD;
      randomized study and with calibrated criteria of evaluation. The current standard of care is&#xD;
      no filling (healing from the blood clot) and we know the consecutive osseous loss during the&#xD;
      aging. The technique by filling with an osseous substitute is more and more used in Europe&#xD;
      and in Asia because of the decrease of the osseous loss. At first, these substitutes were&#xD;
      constituted by bone grafts (autografts, allografts, xenografts) that tend to be replaced by&#xD;
      synthetic materials. To realize these fillings according to countries, various materials are&#xD;
      used (bovine bone, coral, bio glasses, phosphates of calcium). The most used synthetic&#xD;
      materials are calcium ortho phosphates, the composition of which is close to mineral phases&#xD;
      of calcified tissues. Ceramic of phosphate of calcium and more particularly the Biphasic&#xD;
      Phosphate Calcium (BCP) was already used in numerous clinical applications.We chose as this&#xD;
      study MBCP gel â„¢, same product beforehand used in 2 clinical studies for which the Nantes&#xD;
      University Hospital was the sponsor.The perspectives of this study are to be able to propose&#xD;
      the systematization of the alveolar filling to be able to decrease the osseous reduction&#xD;
      after an extraction and to be able to propose more functional prosthetic rehabilitation&#xD;
      (improvement of the masticatory power), more aesthetic and comfortable. When we know the&#xD;
      effect of the under nutrition due to masticator difficulties notably at the aged persons, we&#xD;
      measure all the importance of this major problem of Public health.&#xD;
