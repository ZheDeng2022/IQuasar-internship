      The purpose of this study is: to determine the safety, (local) tolerability and plasma&#xD;
      exposure over time of single intramuscular (IM) doses of 600 and 1200 mg of a new formulation&#xD;
      (F006) of TMC278LA, to determine the safety, (local) tolerability and long-term plasma&#xD;
      exposure over time of 2 dose regimens of 4 monthly IM doses of a new formulation (F006) of&#xD;
      TMC278LA., To determine the safety, (local) tolerability and long-term plasma exposure over&#xD;
      time of 1 dose regimen of 4 monthly subcutaneous (SC) doses of a new formulation (F006) of&#xD;
      TMC278LA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients are routinely being treated&#xD;
      with combinations of 3 or 4 drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), including&#xD;
      nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs/NtRTIs),&#xD;
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of viral resistance development. TMC278 is a new potent and selective NNRTI&#xD;
      under development. It may be able to prevent replication of the virus and by consequence,&#xD;
      prevent new HIV-1 infection. For this novel indication, a sustained release parenteral (IM =&#xD;
      Intramuscular or SC = Subcutaneous) formulation, named TMC278LA, allowing sporadic dosing is&#xD;
      under development. As a second perspective, the TMC278LA has been designed to cope, for&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment in patients, with pill burden and the obligation of having&#xD;
      uninterrupted NNRTI treatment at very regular time intervals, imposing considerable&#xD;
      compliance constraints on HIV-infected patients. This formulation intends to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patient and the drug compliance of the NNRTI treatment. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind (neither patient nor the physician know the name of the study drug),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety, (local) tolerability and plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of a novel formulation (nanosuspension) of TMC278LA,&#xD;
      containing 300 mg of TMC278 per mL. A total of 30 healthy volunteers will be selected and&#xD;
      equally divided into 3 panels. This study will be conducted in male or female volunteers. The&#xD;
      clinical study may not necessarily be balanced regarding gender, but it is intended to aim at&#xD;
      50% of each gender. For safety reasons, females must be post-menopausal or surgically&#xD;
      sterile. The clinical study consists of 3 panels: Panel 1 (Multiple Dose 1 = MD1), Panel 2&#xD;
      (Multiple Dose 2 = MD2) and Panel 3 (Multiple Dose 3 = MD3). MD1, MD2 and MD3 will receive a&#xD;
      multiple dosing regimen of the new formulation of TMC278LA consisting of 4 successive IM&#xD;
      doses (at a 1-month interval) in the Gluteus maximus (MD1 and MD2) or 4 successive SC doses&#xD;
      (at a 1- month interval) in the periumbilical region (MD3). The first dose (the loading dose)&#xD;
      is twice as high as the following 3 doses. Data collected after the first dose in each&#xD;
      regimen will serve as a substitute for a single dose. The dosing regimens are:&#xD;
      MD1=600/300/300/300 mg; MD2=1200/600/600/600 (IM) and MD3=1200/600/600/600 mg (SC). The study&#xD;
      population will include a total of 30 healthy adult volunteers. Ten volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled in MD1, MD2 and MD3 (6 on active, 2 on vehicle, 2 on saline). Each IM dose will be&#xD;
      given at one Injection Site (IS) (in the Gluteus maximus muscle), except for the 1200 mg dose&#xD;
      in MD2 for which 600 mg will be injected in each muscle (left and right Gluteus maximus&#xD;
      muscle). Likewise, the SC doses will be given at one IS (periumbilical region), except for&#xD;
      the 1200 mg loading dose for which 600 mg will be injected in two ISs on either site of the&#xD;
      umbilicus. The new formulation has a concentration of 300 mg/mL of TMC278LA. Hence, the&#xD;
      maximum volume to be injected per injection site is 2 mL. For the multiple injection panels,&#xD;
      rotation of the injected site is recommended. The purpose of the dose sequence in all 3 MD&#xD;
      panels is to provide a loading dose for the 300 mg (MD1) and 600 mg (MD2, 3) once monthly&#xD;
      regimens. In pharmacokinetics, a loading dose refers to an initial higher dose of a drug that&#xD;
      may be given at the beginning of a course of treatment before dropping down to a lower&#xD;
      maintenance dose. A first safety review is planned after the first 3 patients and if no acute&#xD;
      effects are observed, the following 3 patients will be dosed. A 2nd safety review is planned&#xD;
      and if no acute effects are observed, the last 4 patients will be dosed. Within each Panel,&#xD;
      the second dose will only be administered when the first dose was considered safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. The first dose of MD2 will start 1 month after start of MD1, when the first IM&#xD;
      dose of MD1 has been evaluated in a Data Review Meeting (DRM), approximately 3 weeks after&#xD;
      dosing, and is considered safe and well tolerated. Similarly, MD3 will start after the first&#xD;
      dose in MD2 is considered safe and well tolerated during a DRM. An extra DRM will be planned&#xD;
      approximately 3 weeks after the 4th dose of each panel, in order to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      (local) tolerability after 4 successive doses given at a 1-month interval. Dose Limiting&#xD;
      Toxicities and stopping rules will guide decision making during the DRMs. At the DRMs, all&#xD;
      safety, local tolerability, systemic tolerability and pharmacokinetic data collected till and&#xD;
      including 2 weeks after dosing will be evaluated. Based on these data collected after the&#xD;
      loading dose (1st dose), the investigator and the sponsor will decide whether it is safe to&#xD;
      proceed to the next dose in a given panel. The next dose can be adjusted, if required, based&#xD;
      on safety or pharmacokinetic data available at that time, but will not exceed 600 mg in MD1&#xD;
      and 1200 mg in MD2 and MD3. Such a dose adjustment is applicable to all patients of that&#xD;
      particular panel. Upon unblinding on Week 24, patients who were on placebo treatment are&#xD;
      allowed to leave the study. In addition, patients who received active treatment and for which&#xD;
      the TMC278 plasma concentration in the last sample taken prior to unblinding (= WK20) is&#xD;
      below 20 ng/mL are allowed to leave the study as well, provided that there are no persistent&#xD;
      AEs that require further follow-up. All patients on active treatment with TMC278 plasma&#xD;
      concentrations above 20ng/mL in the last sample taken prior to unblinding, or patients with&#xD;
      AEs that require further follow up will be followed up until plasma exposure of TMC278 is&#xD;
      below 20 ng/mL or until pending adverse events are resolved or stabilized, respectively.&#xD;
      Based on results of the TMC278-TiDP15-C146 clinical study, more than 90% of TMC278 is&#xD;
      expected to be washed out within 20 weeks after the last dose. In case TMC278 exposure is&#xD;
      still above 20 ng/mL at the WK 32 visit or in case of a persistent AE that needs further&#xD;
      follow up, the follow up period will be extended until TMC278 plasma exposure is below 20&#xD;
      ng/mL, or until the AE is resolved or stabilized. The decision to extent the follow-up period&#xD;
      will be communicated to the respective subjects at WK33. These patients will be asked to&#xD;
      visit the site once every 4 weeks in case of follow-up on TMC278 plasma exposures. Frequency&#xD;
      of on-site follow-up on safety will be determined by the investigator on a case by case&#xD;
      basis. In this Phase-I study in healthy volunteers no further treatment or medical care is&#xD;
      planned after the end of the clinical study. There are 3 panels, and patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment with either TMC278LA (n=6), vehicle (n=2) or saline (n=2). The dosing&#xD;
      regimens consist of 4 successive doses at a 1-month interval. Dosing regimens are MD1 =&#xD;
      600/300/300/300 mg (IM), MD2 = 1200/600/600/600 mg (IM) and MD3 = 1200/600/600/600 mg (SC).&#xD;
      Patients who received saline or vehicle, or who have TMC278 plasma exposures below 20 ng/ml,&#xD;
      will leave the study at WK24. Other patients will continue till WK32 or beyond.&#xD;
