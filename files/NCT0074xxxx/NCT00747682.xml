      The specific aim of the research proposal in preterm infants with IVH and PHH who require&#xD;
      placement of an Omaya reservoir or a shunt is to determine if decreasing ventricular volume&#xD;
      improves, middle cerebral artery flow, cerebral oxygenation, and cortical neuronal electrical&#xD;
      activity. To accomplish this aim, we will simultaneously perform the following evaluations&#xD;
      prior to shunt placement or prior to and after routine CSF aspiration from reservoir in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. middle cerebral artery velocity time integral and resistive index using Doppler&#xD;
           ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cerebral oxygenation using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. background neuronal electrical activity using an EEG. In addition, we will measure&#xD;
           serial CSF concentration of neuroproteins, S100B, GFAP, NSE, TGF-ß, and IL-6, as&#xD;
           evidence of ongoing neuronal damage and correlate the concentration with cerebral&#xD;
           perfusion and activity as measured above.&#xD;

      Very low birth weight infants are at risk for developing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).&#xD;
      Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PPH) is a major complication of IVH and contributes to&#xD;
      long-term developmental delays. Progressive PHH often requires management of ventricular&#xD;
      dilation by adjusting CSF fluid volume. There are 3 methods employed to acutely decrease CSF&#xD;
      volume: 1) serial lumbar puncture, 2) open drain system (continuous CSF removal), and 3)&#xD;
      reservoir system. Serial lumbar puncture is only effective if there is communicating&#xD;
      hydrocephalus. The open drain system is infrequently used as it is cumbersome and there is a&#xD;
      relatively high risk of infection. The method most commonly used to manage CSF volume is the&#xD;
      reservoir system where an in-situ drain is connected to a subcutaneous (Omaya) reservoir&#xD;
      which is periodically aspirated by needle puncture through the scalp. Because the Omaya&#xD;
      system is closed, intraventricular volume and, thus, pressure must necessarily rise prior to&#xD;
      and decrease after CSF aspiration. Ventricular dilation is controlled by the frequency and&#xD;
      volume of CSF aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When hydrocephalus continues to be a problem despite removal of CSF, a ventricular-peritoneal&#xD;
      (VP) shunt is placed. Approximately 50% of infants with hydrocephalus treated with removal of&#xD;
      CSF resolve their hydrocephalus and do not require VP shunt placement. Placement of a VP&#xD;
      shunt is difficult in extremely preterm infants due to increased risk of ulceration around&#xD;
      the shunt site and the high protein concentration in CSF which can occlude the valve in the&#xD;
      VP shunt requiring revision. Thus, hydrocephalus is usually treated with serial removal of&#xD;
      CSF to allow for identification of those infant's whose hydrocephalus resolves over time.&#xD;
      However, timing and method of CSF management is controversial because the effect of&#xD;
      increasing hydrocephalus on cerebral perfusion, oxygenation, electrical activity, and&#xD;
      neuronal damage has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial removal of CSF causes a change in intracranial volume/pressure that can be potentially&#xD;
      transmitted to intracranial vessels. The caliber of cerebral vessels may be modified by this&#xD;
      balance between intravascular and intracranial pressure, and if the caliber should change,&#xD;
      the blood flow characteristics should also change. In cerebral veins and capillaries where&#xD;
      intraluminal pressure is low, high intraventricular pressure may significantly affect blood&#xD;
      flow and can cause venous stasis. NIRS measures cerebral oxygenation in capillaries and&#xD;
      veins. Intracranial arteries and arterioles may be somewhat less affected, except when&#xD;
      intraventricular pressure greatly increases. The resultant decrease in the arterial supply&#xD;
      can affect tissue perfusion. Arterial flow can be measured by Doppler ultrasonography. Thus,&#xD;
      there is concern that during periods of increasing or fluctuating ventricular size cerebral&#xD;
      arterial perfusion may be compromised and further cerebral injury may result. Intracranial&#xD;
      pressure is further influenced by the plasticity/deformability of the immature brain and the&#xD;
      easy expansibility of the cranial vault due to the presence of sutures and open fontanelles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is indirect evidence from experiments in animals that ventricular distention itself may&#xD;
      cause secondary brain injury. Thus, axonal stretching and disruption secondary to progressive&#xD;
      ventriculomegaly is be associated with gliosis. Periventricular vascular distortion and&#xD;
      compression may decrease cerebral blood flow causing ischemic injury to periventricular white&#xD;
      matter. Inflammation and repair may interfere with CSF flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research is available that helps answer the primary question involved in clinical&#xD;
      management of ventricular dilation in premature infants: Are there relationships between&#xD;
      ventricular enlargement, cerebral perfusion, brain oxygen delivery, and on-going cerebral&#xD;
      damage?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasonography has been applied in premature infants to characterize post delivery&#xD;
      changes in arterial and venous cerebral blood flow velocities.[1] Critically low superior&#xD;
      vena cava flow measured by Doppler ultrasonography in the first 24 hours of life has been&#xD;
      associated with intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants born before 30 weeks&#xD;
      gestation.[2] Using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography, the resistive index can be measured which&#xD;
      is a inversely related to blood flow. In older infants with established hydrocephalus,&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow resistive index appeared to be a good indicator of increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure.[3] However, in a review article, the value of Doppler indices alone in predicting&#xD;
      increased intracranial pressure was strongly questioned.[4] In a recent article, the&#xD;
      resistive index of the anterior cerebral artery decreased significantly after CSF drainage in&#xD;
      infants with PHH. [5] Although Doppler ultrasonography is easy to perform, its role in&#xD;
      detecting significant changes in cerebral perfusion associated with increased CSF volume and&#xD;
      ventricular dilation is not yet established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a portable non-invasive technique used to measure&#xD;
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation in cerebral blood.[6] NIRS has been used to evaluate&#xD;
      effect of head [7] and body position [8] on cerebral hemodynamics in preterm infants, and the&#xD;
      effect of certain treatments, such as surfactant administration [9] and suctioning on&#xD;
      conventional or high-frequency ventilation.[10] NIRS measurement of cerebral oxygenation and&#xD;
      hemodynamics shows impairment in those neonates at risk for developing severe brain&#xD;
      ischemia.[11] In premature infants with PHH, CSF fluid aspiration was associated with a&#xD;
      significant increase in cerebral perfusion, cerebral blood volume, and oxidative&#xD;
      metabolism.[12,13] In a small animal model of acute hydrocephalus, NIRS measurement of global&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow using oxygen as a tracer was highly correlated to cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      measured by radioactive microspheres over a wide range of increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure.[14] As intracranial pressure increased, NIRS measurement and absolute measurement&#xD;
      of cerebral blood flow decreased. NIRS measured cerebral perfusion appears to directly&#xD;
      reflect absolute cerebral blood flow and is sensitive enough to detect significant changes in&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion which occur with evacuation of CSF in infants with PHH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is a device used for neurologic surveillance. The cortical&#xD;
      electrical activity is transformed into a single signal that represents overall&#xD;
      electrocortical background activity of the brain. Specifically the upper and lower voltage&#xD;
      margins and the amplitude of the tracing and the presence of seizure activity can be&#xD;
      evaluated. In addition, the presence of sleep-wake cycles, a rhythmic sinusoidal variation in&#xD;
      amplitude, can be evaluated. Infants &gt; 34 weeks gestation have predictable aEEG patterns. The&#xD;
      signal depends on gestational age and postnatal age and standards for preterm infants have&#xD;
      been reported.[15,16] In a case report, 2 preterm infants with PHH demonstrated abnormal&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycles and markedly decreased cerebral electrical activity with increasing&#xD;
      ventricular enlargement prior to clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure. In one&#xD;
      infant, aEEG normalized after VP shunt placement.[17] To date, there are no clinical studies&#xD;
      on the effect of aspiration of CSF on aEEG in preterm infants with PHH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers for cerebral injury have been used to predict severity of injury and long-term&#xD;
      outcome, identify patients early at risk for poor neurologic outcomes, and evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Neuronal specific enolase (NSE), a marker for&#xD;
      neuronal damage, and S100B, secreted by astrocytes and a marker of glial/neuronal injury,&#xD;
      have been shown to be increased in children after traumatic brain injury.[18] In preterm&#xD;
      infants with PHH, S100B and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), a structural protein in&#xD;
      astrocytes, were significantly elevated in those infants who had brain parenchymal lesions&#xD;
      and poor neurological outcomes.[19] These biomarkers are quickly metabolized and thus ongoing&#xD;
      elevation would indicate ongoing damage. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß), produced by&#xD;
      fibroblasts and released into the CSF after injury, stimulates production of extracellular&#xD;
      protein which could result in PHH due to a permanent obstruction to CSF flow.[20] Cytokine&#xD;
      IL-6 is a marker of inflammation. There are no longitudinal studies on the effect of&#xD;
      aspiration of CSF on these markers of cerebral damage in preterm infants with PHH.&#xD;
