  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate new assessment tools and equipment and new ways of using existing&#xD;
      tools and equipment in the NIH Clinical Center s Rehabilitation Medicine Department in order&#xD;
      to maximize patients function. The Department assesses and treats NIH patients with chronic&#xD;
      pain, problems in walking or getting around, activities of daily living, performing tasks&#xD;
      needed for jobs or hobbies, communicating and chewing and swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults of all ages with disabilities and healthy normal volunteers may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following kinds of assessments are evaluated in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of Impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impairments are problems such as loss of movement, weakness or loss of sensation. Assessments&#xD;
      may include measurements of range of motion, strength, sensation, pain, joint stability or&#xD;
      mobility, joint angles, limb and girth, gait, exercise tolerance, stamina, or ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging of muscle and swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of Function and Performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional and performance assessments look at how well subjects perform actions, such as&#xD;
      walking or getting around, dressing, or preparing meals. They may include evaluations of&#xD;
      activities of daily living, leisure activities, fatigue, vocational activity, school&#xD;
      activity, coping skills, and quality of life. The assessments may be done by questionnaires&#xD;
      or interviews and by watching subjects perform the activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of Treatment Techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment techniques are assessed by evaluating methods and equipment used to treat patients&#xD;
      with impairments or problems with function. They may evaluate, for example, the use of heat,&#xD;
      cold, strengthening exercises, fitness exercises, TENS units, splinting and orthotics, or&#xD;
      shoe modifications.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the protocol is to provide framework in which clinicians in the Department&#xD;
      of Rehabilitation Medicine (RMD) can serve the clinical needs of patients and the intramural&#xD;
      clinical research needs of NIH investigators by maintaining state of the art expertise in the&#xD;
      functional assessment of persons with disabilities and investigating new equipment,&#xD;
      methodologies and/or techniques for functional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study a total of 500 healthy volunteers and 500 subjects with disabilities,&#xD;
      including those enrolled in NIH intramural research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of individual projects designed designed by RMD staff including one or&#xD;
      more of the associate investigators. The individual projects will be relatively small and&#xD;
      designed to test the reliability, reproducibility, efficiency, feasibility, sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, tolerability, validity and/or precision of physical medicine and rehabilitation&#xD;
      assessment equipment, devices and clinical evaluations of impairment, disability, and/or&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific outcome measure(s) will be chosen to meet the goals of the individual project&#xD;
      and will generally include one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Subjective assessment by the participant of the test, device, or evaluation based on&#xD;
      written evaluation tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Comparisons to established evaluations or equipment designed to assess similar areas of&#xD;
      function, including concurrent validity analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Subjective assessment by clinicians using the test, device or evaluation, based on&#xD;
      written evaluation tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Feasibility assessments, including the time required for participants to perform tests,&#xD;
      time for clinicians to evaluate the results of the tests, and/or prepare reports of the&#xD;
      results of tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Assessments of reliability and/or stability of the technique used, including statistical&#xD;
      tests of coefficients of variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Assessments of tolerance of tests, including measures such as vital signs or elements of&#xD;
      a physical examination.&#xD;
