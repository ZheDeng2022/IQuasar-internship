  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the activity of oral Pancrecarb® (a&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme preparation which contains proteins that help to digest food), administered&#xD;
      by mouth as a capsule filled with specially coated granules in patients taking exogenous&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme therapy. Specific enzymes activities will be determined from samples of&#xD;
      stomach and intestinal fluids after a standard liquid meal.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioavailability of oral Pancrecarb® (exogenous&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme administered orally as a capsule filled with enteric coated granules)&#xD;
      compared to placebo control in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. Lipase, amylase and&#xD;
      protease activities will be determined from stomach and duodenal aspirates after standard&#xD;
      meal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pancreatic insufficiency will be recruited as the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo an initial screening phase and will provide a stool sample to&#xD;
      confirm pancreatic exocrine insufficiency based on a spot fecal elastase-1 of &lt; 75 mcg/g&#xD;
      stool. Within one month after the screening phase, subjects meeting inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be scheduled to arrive in the GCRC by 7pm. If the subject is a female of child bearing age, a&#xD;
      serum pregnancy test will be checked. At 7am the subject will be escorted to fluoroscopy for&#xD;
      placement of an oro-enteric tube. Once the tip of the tube has been positioned in the&#xD;
      duodenum, the subject will be escorted back to the GCRC. Prior to administration of the&#xD;
      capsules and liquid diet, baseline gastric and duodenal secretions will be aspirated via the&#xD;
      oro-enteric tube by the investigators. Subjects will then receive 5 capsules of active drug&#xD;
      with a standard liquid Lundh diet of 360 mL over a 10 minute period, administered to simulate&#xD;
      a fed state. Then duodenal and gastric secretions will be aspirated from the tube over a&#xD;
      3-hour period. At the end of the 3 hours, the subject will be allowed to rest for 60 minutes.&#xD;
      The second phase will consist of 5 capsules of placebo again with a standard liquid Lundh&#xD;
      diet , and another 3-hour aspiration phase. After the second 3-hour aspiration period, the&#xD;
      balloon will be deflated and the tube will be removed. Subjects will be observed for 30&#xD;
      minutes and then discharged.&#xD;

    <description>Pre-treatment vs. post-treatment-&#xD;
In the first phase, before administration of the capsules and liquid diet, baseline gastric and duodenal secretions will be aspirated via the oro-enteric tube. Subjects will get 5 placebo capsules at Time=0 given orally with the liquid Lundh diet. Pancreato-biliary and duodenal secretions in the duodenal region will be aspirated continuously over the first 20 min. Gastric and duodenal fluids will be aspirated from 20-180 min at specified time points. Following a rest of 1 hour, the same process will be repeated with the drug capsules. At the end of the study the catheter will be removed and patient will be offered a meal.</description>
