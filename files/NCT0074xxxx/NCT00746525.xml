    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the benefits of combination motor learning training&#xD;
      and brain computer interface training for restoring arm function in people with stroke. Our&#xD;
      aim was to determine whether the surface-acquired brain signal (electroencephalography (EEG))&#xD;
      can feasibly be used as a neural feedback system to drive more normal motor function in&#xD;
      stroke survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The financial burden and human suffering are devastating after stroke due to the lack of&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols that can restore normal brain and motor function. Conventional&#xD;
      treatment does not restore normal motor function to many stroke survivors. The majority of&#xD;
      available treatments are directed at the peripheral nervous system (arms/legs). Since stroke&#xD;
      occurs in the brain and results in brain damage and dysfunction, a more direct approach may&#xD;
      be to re-train the brain by directly treating the activation of brain signals that control&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to determine if motor learning, functional electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (FES), and brain computer interface (BCI) training are beneficial for restoring&#xD;
      arm function in people who have had a stroke, and to determine if the surface-acquired brain&#xD;
      signal [electroencephalography (EEG)] can be re-trained to provide more normal motor function&#xD;
      in stroke survivors. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      motor learning tasks in stroke recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, scientists will use two different and complimentary brain signal training&#xD;
      components to restore more normal motor control of a motor task (elbow, wrist, or finger&#xD;
      movement task). Specifically targeting, invoking, and training the surface-acquired EEG brain&#xD;
      signal, and integrating brain signal training into motor learning training of upper limb&#xD;
      motor tasks, may result in greater motor restoration when compared to a comprehensive motor&#xD;
      learning intervention without EEG brain signal training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight people who had a stroke were enrolled in the experimental group. They received brain&#xD;
      signal training and comprehensive motor learning based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 5 healthy adults were enrolled in order to study their ability to acquire brain&#xD;
      signal control and the characteristics of their brain signal during the tasks that the stroke&#xD;
      participants attempted.&#xD;
