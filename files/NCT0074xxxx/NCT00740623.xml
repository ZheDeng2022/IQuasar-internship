  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      carisbamate as add-on therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), epilepsy afflicts more than 50 million&#xD;
      people worldwide. Older antiepileptic drugs are still commonly used, despite a diverse range&#xD;
      of side effects. New AEDs approved since the early 1990s have shown an improved tolerability&#xD;
      profile. Nonetheless, approximately 30% of patients, particularly those with partial onset&#xD;
      seizures, are not well controlled even on the newer treatments or they experience significant&#xD;
      side effects secondary to treatment. Therefore, the development of new drugs with&#xD;
      effectiveness or safety and tolerability advantages over currently marketed antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs is needed. This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind&#xD;
      (neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study medication),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. The study has 3 phases: an 8-week&#xD;
      pretreatment phase including screening and a baseline period, a 14-week double blind&#xD;
      treatment phase, including a 2-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period, and a&#xD;
      4 week posttreatment phase. During the 56-day baseline period, patients will be required to&#xD;
      have at least 6 partial onset seizures, no more than &gt;= 100 partial onset seizures per 28&#xD;
      days, and no seizure-free period for more than 3 weeks to be eligible to enter the&#xD;
      double-blind treatment phase of the study. During the double-blind treatment phase of study&#xD;
      CARISEPY3013, patients will be randomly assigned to receive 800 mg/day carisbamate, 1,200&#xD;
      mg/day carisbamate, or placebo for 14 weeks. The total duration of study CARISEPY3013 is&#xD;
      approximately 26 weeks for each subject. Patients who complete the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      phase will be eligible to enter the separate extension study CARISEPY3014. Safety assessments&#xD;
      include the monitoring of the frequency, severity, and timing of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory test results, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, physical and neurologic examinations, the Physician Withdrawal Checklist for&#xD;
      symptoms of withdrawal for those patients who taper and/or discontinue study drug, and&#xD;
      pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. Assessments of effectiveness include&#xD;
      seizure counts at every visit and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Patient Inventory&#xD;
      questionnaire. A Medical Resource utilization questionnaire will be used to obtain&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness information on carisbamate. The study hypothesis is that carisbamate is&#xD;
      superior to placebo as add-on therapy (i.e., in addition to the current antiepileptic drugs&#xD;
      that patients are taking) for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy. Carisbamate 800 mg/day, 1,200 mg/day, or placebo taken twice daily in 2 equally&#xD;
      divided doses, with or without food, and taken with noncarbonated water. A double-dummy&#xD;
      design will be used so that all patients will take the same number of active drug and placebo&#xD;
      tablets each day during the 14 weeks of the double blind treatment phase. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to take a stable dosage or dosages of up to 3 antiepileptic drugs that they are&#xD;
      already taking for their seizures during the entire study.&#xD;
