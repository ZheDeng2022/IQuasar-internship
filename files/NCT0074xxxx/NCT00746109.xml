  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial skin and soft tissue abscess are frequently managed by opening them up with a&#xD;
      procedure called &quot;incision and drainage&quot;. It is routine practice in the United States to&#xD;
      place packing material inside the abscess cavity after opening them up, in order to promote&#xD;
      better wound healing and limit abscess recurrence. However, this practice has never been&#xD;
      systematically studied or proven to decrease complications or improve healing. Patients with&#xD;
      wound packing usually return to the emergency room or practice setting for multiple &quot;wound&#xD;
      checks&quot; and dressing/packing changes which lead to missed days from work or school and&#xD;
      utilization of healthcare resources. This procedure can often be painful and may even require&#xD;
      conscious sedation (and the risks entailed) especially in children. With rates of superficial&#xD;
      skin and soft tissue abscesses on the rise, and emergency room resources being stretched, it&#xD;
      is important to determine whether packing wounds is necessary or even advantageous to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first to systematically evaluate the efficacy of wound packing after&#xD;
      superficial skin or soft tissue abscess incision and drainage in children. The investigators&#xD;
      will be evaluating wound healing, complications, recurrence and pain associated with packing&#xD;
      both short and long term. In addition, the investigators will also be evaluating the utility&#xD;
      of bedside point-of-care ultrasound use in predicting the presence of pus inside the abscess&#xD;
      cavity. This test may be useful to determine whether incision and drainage is necessary for&#xD;
      an individual who has a skin infection that is suspicious for an abscess.&#xD;
