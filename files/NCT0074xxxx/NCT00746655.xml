    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and toxicity of combining SBRT and&#xD;
      TACE for unresectable HCC and to evaluate the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL)&#xD;
      associated with combined therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are poor surgical candidates could potentially benefit from non-surgical&#xD;
      alternatives such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is an ideal approach to&#xD;
      minimize radiation exposure to the normal liver while maximizing the dose to the tumor.&#xD;
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the combined use of intra-arterial chemotherapy and&#xD;
      particulate arterial embolization. This technique is typically used to make unresectable&#xD;
      liver lesions amenable to resection, for palliation in cases of extra-hepatic spread or&#xD;
      recurrence, or for symptomatic relief. The combination of intraarterial chemotherapy with&#xD;
      vessel embolization makes logical sense since primary and secondary liver tumors derive up to&#xD;
      95% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, while the normal liver gains the majority&#xD;
      of its blood supply from the portal system. Thus, using transarterial chemoembolization it is&#xD;
      possible to achieve high intratumor drug concentrations followed by local ischemia, allowing&#xD;
      uninvolved liver to be spared. This study is to determine that these standard of care&#xD;
      therapies combined to improve the quality of life for the patient population.&#xD;

    <description>. Intra-arterial cisplatin treatment will be given at a dose of 125 mg/m2. After delivery of the drug(s) to the tumor, embolization will be accomplished with Embospheres (Biosphere Medical, Inc.,Rockland, MA, USA) until moderate to marked stasis of antegrade flow is seen in the artery.</description>
