    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to get information from volunteers without cancer and&#xD;
      patients with cancer who have received a new investigational study agent called, &quot;[F-18]&#xD;
      RGDK5,&quot; to evaluate biodistribution and dosimetry for the study agent and determine F-18&#xD;
      RGD-K5 uptake in angiogenic tumor. the system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [F-18]RGD-K5 is being investigated as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the detection and&#xD;
      localization of angiogenesis tissue or lesions supporting the application and role of&#xD;
      integrins in anti-angiogenic therapies to benefit patients with cancer and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain information on biodistribution of [F-18]RGD-K5, and to evaluate the PET images&#xD;
           with [F-18]RGD-K5 for resolution, signal to background ratio and for the detection and&#xD;
           localization of angiogenesis tissue. This Exploratory Investigational New Drug (EIND)&#xD;
           study is designed to obtain preliminary imaging and fundamental biodistribution,&#xD;
           metabolism and safety information to demonstrate early proof of concept. The information&#xD;
           collected under this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the&#xD;
           subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management for the subject.&#xD;
