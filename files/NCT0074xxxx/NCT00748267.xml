      RATIONALE: Hypnosis may be effective in reducing pain and other side effects in women&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well hypnosis works in reducing pain and other&#xD;
      side effects in women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the feasibility of hypnosis as a pre-operative intervention for the reduction of&#xD;
           surgical- and anesthesia-related symptoms in women undergoing lumpectomy with sentinel&#xD;
           node biopsy, mastectomy, or mastectomy with lymph node dissection for locally recurrent&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the physical symptoms (i.e., pain, nausea, and vomiting) and psychological&#xD;
           symptoms (i.e., anxiety and distress) of patients undergoing hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the length of stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit of patients undergoing&#xD;
           adjunct hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe patient satisfaction with the hypnosis experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect size and calculate the sample needed for a randomized clinical&#xD;
           trial using the results of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a scripted hypnotic intervention over 15 minutes within 1 hour&#xD;
      prior to their planned surgical procedure. Upon completion of the intervention, patients&#xD;
      proceed to the Preoperative Holding Area of the Surgery and Post Anesthesia Care Unit where&#xD;
      they receive the standard of care for lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy, mastectomy, or&#xD;
      mastectomy with lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of demographic information (i.e., age; gender; ethnicity;&#xD;
      marital/partnered status; spiritual practice; family members in the home; stress management&#xD;
      history; experience with the continuum of imagery/hypnosis practices; perceptions of&#xD;
      concentration abilities; and favorite aromas, colors, and scenes from nature) at the time of&#xD;
      consent using the Demographic Survey Questionnaire. They also undergo assessment of physical&#xD;
      and psychological symptoms (i.e., pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and generalized distress)&#xD;
      at baseline (immediately prior to hypnotic induction) and after the intervention (prior to&#xD;
      discharge from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit).&#xD;
