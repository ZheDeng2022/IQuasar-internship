  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, pharmacokinetic study investigating the bioavailability of flavonoids&#xD;
      and phenolic acids from cranberry juice cocktail and their breakdown products (in vivo&#xD;
      metabolites) in healthy, older adults. Our hypothesis is that the compounds will be poorly&#xD;
      but rapidly absorbed from the intestines and found in plasma and urine in extensively&#xD;
      metabolized forms. These compounds will be rapidly cleared from plasma. Substantial amounts&#xD;
      of unabsorbed compounds will be found in the stools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cranberries are a particularly rich source of phenolic acids and polyphenols, particularly&#xD;
      flavonoids. Among the 20 most commonly consumed fruits in the American diet, cranberries have&#xD;
      the highest total phenol content. Health benefits attributed to cranberries include the&#xD;
      prevention of urinary tract infections and stomach ulcers as well as improved oral hygiene.&#xD;
      These benefits appear to be due principally to the ability of cranberries to interfere with&#xD;
      the adhesion of some bacteria to select cell types and surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranberries and cranberry constituents, including several phenolic and polyphenolic&#xD;
      compounds, have also been shown to possess antibacterial, antiviral, anti-mutagenic,&#xD;
      anti-carcinogenic, anti-tumorigenic, anti-angiogenic, and antioxidant activities. Most of&#xD;
      this evidence is derived from in vitro studies and animal models. The limited number of human&#xD;
      studies available indicate these phytochemicals are bioavailable and bioactive. However, more&#xD;
      information is required on the bioavailability and metabolism of cranberry polyphenols, as&#xD;
      well as on the relationship between cranberry dose and duration of use, to better understand&#xD;
      their impact on risk factors for chronic diseases.&#xD;
