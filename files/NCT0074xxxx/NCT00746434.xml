  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this proof of concept study is to show the safety and efficacy of 0.5 % dermal&#xD;
      roflumilast cream in the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. This is a multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. 3-10 % of the body&#xD;
      surface area (BSA) should be covered with a mild to moderate form of plaque psoriasis. In a&#xD;
      4-week treatment period 76 mg cream is applied two times daily on up to 2% of the BSA. After&#xD;
      a screening phase, a washout phase of flexible duration (max 30 days, time depending upon&#xD;
      pre-medication), the 28 day treatment phase follows. As roflumilast is a potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory substance, a positive effect on this form of dermal disease is anticipated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (who is able to read, to write and to fully understand English language) has&#xD;
             been informed both verbally and in writing about the objectives of the clinical study,&#xD;
             the methods, the anticipated benefits and potential risks and the discomfort to which&#xD;
             he/she may be exposed, and has given written consent to participation in the study&#xD;
             prior to study start and any study-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patient of any ethnic origin, age 18 years or older presenting a&#xD;
             minimum of 3% to a maximum of 10% BSA affected by mild to moderate plaque psoriasis&#xD;
             proven by a dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 in severity score of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have at least one target lesion of at least 1% BSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be willing to wash out from current active therapy for at least 14 days&#xD;
             prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the Screening&#xD;
             and Baseline Visits and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control. A&#xD;
             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low&#xD;
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as&#xD;
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or&#xD;
             vasectomised partner&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis within&#xD;
             at least the past 3 month.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has a physical condition (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, tinea&#xD;
             corporis) which, in the Investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of plaque&#xD;
             psoriasis or which exposes the patient to an unacceptable risk by trial participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values and vital signs suggesting an unknown&#xD;
             underlying disease and requiring further clinical evaluation (as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received an investigational drug or an investigational device within 30&#xD;
             days prior to trial start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of allergic reactions to roflumilast or any inactive ingredients&#xD;
             of the trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has positive results in any of the virology tests of acute or chronic&#xD;
