  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy and capecitabine with or&#xD;
      without curcumin before surgery works in treating patients with rectal cancer. Drugs such as&#xD;
      curcumin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy with&#xD;
      radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal&#xD;
      tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy is more effective with or without curcumin when given before surgery in patients with&#xD;
      rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a combination of capecitabine and radiation therapy with or&#xD;
      without curcumin in locally advanced rectal cancer as assessed by pathological complete&#xD;
      response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine downstaging, local control, disease-free survival and overall survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine serum and rectal tumor tissue pharmacology of curcumin and its metabolites&#xD;
      in the above patients and its correlation with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify surrogate molecular markers for curcumin effects. IV. To correlate serum&#xD;
      cytokine levels with quality of life in patients receiving this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 fractions. Patients&#xD;
      also receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on the days of radiation therapy and&#xD;
      curcumin PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive capecitabine as in Arm I. Patients&#xD;
      also receive placebo PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;
