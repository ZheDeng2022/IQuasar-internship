    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of the epidural&#xD;
      injection procedure when combined with real-time multi-frequency bio-impedance measurements&#xD;
      that collect data on the electrical bioimpedance characteristics of living human tissue on&#xD;
      the path of the epidural needle.&#xD;

          5. Patients must be willing to participate in the study, and provide written informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during the&#xD;

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must be using a medically acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control throughout the study such as: bilateral tubal ligation or the use of either a&#xD;
             contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection, an intrauterine device, or an oral&#xD;
             contraceptive that has been taken for at least three months, which the subject agrees&#xD;
             to continue using during the study, or a double-barrier method which must consist of a&#xD;
             combination of any two of the following: diaphragm, cervical cap, condom or&#xD;
             spermicide.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Previous spinal surgery, or any additional surgical intervention in the level of&#xD;
             epidural injection other than elective standard pain relief treatment of Epidural&#xD;
             Steroid Injection.&#xD;

             if enrolled into the study i.e. known coagulopathy or recent use of anticoagulants or&#xD;
             anti aggregates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of fever, sepsis or infection near the point of insertion or an infection in&#xD;
             the bloodstream which may &quot;seed&quot; onto the catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with known Hypovolemia&#xD;
