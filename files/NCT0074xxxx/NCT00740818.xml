    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea, also known in the public realm as the dreaded painful period, is a common&#xD;
      condition plaguing millions of women. The familiar symptoms of dysmenorrhea include but are&#xD;
      not limited to muscle cramping of the lower abdominal muscles, mood swings, breast&#xD;
      tenderness, and heavy flow just to name a few. These common complaints can range from a minor&#xD;
      annoyance to debilitating. The allopathic model of medicine has offered up several solutions&#xD;
      to this problem most women face during their reproductive phase of life. However, even with&#xD;
      these options for menstrual discomfort relief, the problem still remains in overwhelming&#xD;
      numbers. The rationale of this study is to possibly provide another safer and more effective&#xD;
      treatment using protocols of chiropractic medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Merck, dysmenorrhea is simplified as pelvic pain during menses. This condition&#xD;
      can also be broken down into two forms-primary dysmenorrhea and secondary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
      Primary dysmenorrhea tends to begin in adolescence with the onset of menses. This form is&#xD;
      attributed to histological and hormonal changes to the female reproductive system. The&#xD;
      symptoms tend to subside with age and pregnancy. Secondary dysmenorrhea is seen to develop in&#xD;
      the adult female and is linked to structural anomalies of the pelvic region. Although both of&#xD;
      these cause discomfort to several women, the main focus of this study is on treatment of&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea as treatment of the secondary form involves addressing the underlying&#xD;
      structural dysfunction causing the symptoms. This is out of the scope of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment of dysmenorrhea involves a few different facets. The first approach is to&#xD;
      treat the symptoms of dysmenorrhea with the use of analgesics which is usually the most&#xD;
      popular and convenient option. These medications are over-the-counter and are often effective&#xD;
      treatment in mild cases. Another option commonly pursued in the medical realm is addressing&#xD;
      the hormonal imbalances involved in symptomatology. This is done by prescribing the use of&#xD;
      low dose oral contraceptives. This treatment is popular as it provides a convenient&#xD;
      preventative measure for pregnancy in addition to symptom relief in some cases. Surgery, an&#xD;
      extreme and last resort, involves anywhere from partial to a complete hysterectomy. With&#xD;
      partial hysterectomies, there is a higher risk that symptoms will still be present following&#xD;
      surgery. However, following a full hysterectomy the patient is subject to the adverse effects&#xD;
      of post menopause including but not limited to increased bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, the medical options can produce adverse&#xD;
      effects on the body. Chiropractic treatment offers a mode of care with limited risks and many&#xD;
      benefits to the patient. It is the goal of this study to aid in the support of this&#xD;
      statement. It has been documented that spinal manipulation using Flexion-Distraction&#xD;
      technique combined with Manual Trigger Point therapy has positive results with short-term&#xD;
      relief of symptomatology and disability related to chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which is&#xD;
      defined as noncyclic pain in the pelvis lasting longer than three months. Although this&#xD;
      condition is separate from dysmenorrhea it can provide some insight into symptomatology&#xD;
      affecting this region. The Toftness system has also demonstrated significant improvement in&#xD;
      subjects suffering from primary dysmenorrhea when compared to those subjects receiving sham&#xD;
      adjustments. Gauntt demonstrated the benefits of Logan Basic Technique and Soft Tissue&#xD;
      Manipulation in decreasing the symptoms of painful periods. The combination of these&#xD;
      treatments establishes &quot;great promise&quot; in intervention of dysmenorrhea. The goal of this new&#xD;
      study is to build on Gauntt's work by possibly duplicating these results. This study also&#xD;
      aims to explore the efficacy of utilizing auxiliary abdominal contacts in addition to the&#xD;
      Logan Basic Protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logan Basic Methods of adjusting addresses the correction of the base of the spine, the&#xD;
      sacrum. By contacting the sacrotuberous ligament on the side of the anteriorly and inferiorly&#xD;
      misaligned sacrum, the doctor corrects the said misalignment to help restore proper function&#xD;
      to the affected sacroiliac joint. Furthermore, correction of the foundation of the spine,&#xD;
      according to Logan Basic Methods, restores optimum function to the entire spine. To increase&#xD;
      the efficacy of this procedure, known as the apex contact, one can also utilize auxiliary&#xD;
      contacts. Auxiliary contacts are administered during the apex contact. Specifically,&#xD;
      auxiliary abdominal contacts address hollow organ spasms. This may be beneficial in&#xD;
      addressing the uterine muscle spasms commonly associated with menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logan Basic encompasses a low force adjusting protocol which can be helpful in treatment of&#xD;
      all types of patients. This technique is essentially safe for everyone with no known&#xD;
      contraindications. However, with any adjusting technique there are adverse reactions to&#xD;
      treatment, although usually minor. Patients can experience increased perspiration with their&#xD;
      first few adjustments. Following adjustments, the patient can experience pain associated with&#xD;
      muscle soreness, which can be treated with the use of cold compresses for twenty minutes on&#xD;
      then twenty minutes off for the first 48 hours after treatment. Muscle soreness usually&#xD;
      subsides within a day or two and its occurrence decreases with subsequent treatments. Some&#xD;
      patients may experience a toxic reaction to treatment that is described as nausea and/or&#xD;
      vomiting. This occurs in individuals with increased exposure to drugs and/or a poor diet.&#xD;
      However, it is believed that though this reaction has occurred, these patients were in need&#xD;
      of this intervention to eliminate toxins from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, a menstrual distress questionnaire will be utilized to objectively analyze&#xD;
      subjective complaints of subjects in this study. This method of analyzing symptoms has been&#xD;
      used in past studies including Snyder's study on the Toftness system and dysmenorrhea as well&#xD;
      as in Gauntt's study on Logan Basic, Soft Tissue Manipulation, and dysmenorrhea. Moos&#xD;
      provides an overview of the utilization of this questionnaire. It has been shown to be quite&#xD;
      useful in studies with menstrual distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the exploration of Logan Basic Methods and auxiliary abdominal contacts in the&#xD;
      treatment of dysmenorrhea, it is the hope of the investigators to provide some insight into&#xD;
      this common condition affecting and disabling women. This investigation aims to build on&#xD;
      previous studies showing the efficacy of chiropractic care in the treatment of menstrual&#xD;
      distress. Through investigation of primary dysmenorrhea, this study can hopefully assist in&#xD;
      opening the scientific community as well as the females of the current society to safer&#xD;
      options in treatment of this common condition.&#xD;
