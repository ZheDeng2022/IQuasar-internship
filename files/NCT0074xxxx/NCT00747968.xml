    <textblock>
      30 type 2 diabetic patients will be PET-scanned twice ( half of the patients heart-PET, half&#xD;
      of the patients CNS-PET) in random order with infusions of placebo or GLP-1-analogue during&#xD;
      hyperglycemic clamp to uncover the metabolic effects of GLP-1-analogues in perspectives of&#xD;
      intervention of macrovascular late diabetic pathology such as stroke and AMI. Earlier studies&#xD;
      have revealed tendencies towards steady glucose metabolism in the CNS despite fluctuations in&#xD;
      blood sugar when infusing native GLP-1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is epidemically increasing throughout the world. T2D is&#xD;
      frequently associated with multiple complications, where particularly the macrovascular&#xD;
      complications in the form of myocardial infarction with its possible complication of death or&#xD;
      heart failure, cerebral infarction and limb amputation are responsible for a vast increase in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. Apart from the individual burden on the&#xD;
      patient, T2D puts massive pressure on national health economies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that blood glucose lowering drugs, antihypertensive as well as lipid&#xD;
      lowering drugs all play a pivotal role in the treatment of the type 2 diabetic subjects.&#xD;
      Regarding glycemia, there are frequently side effects with the 'classic' drugs such as&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, weight gain, heart failure, and so forth. Another important caveat is that&#xD;
      employing the anti-hyperglycemic drugs either as monotherapy or in combination does not lower&#xD;
      blood glucose to the targets as defined by the ADA. In other words novel anti-diabetic drugs&#xD;
      are urgently required. However, the incretin concept has recently been inaugurated in the&#xD;
      pharmacological scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide-1-receptors (GLP-1R) are abundant on alpha- and beta-cells in the&#xD;
      pancreas, but are also present in the heart and CNS, especially in hypothalamic and&#xD;
      hippocampal regions. A wide range of extrapancreatic effects of GLP-1 have been observed such&#xD;
      as slowed gastric emptying and satiety-stimulating effects through hypothalamic mechanisms.&#xD;
      Recent studies have showed interesting results regarding protection of the heart during&#xD;
      ischemia, and protection of the brain in the acute phases of stroke have been proposed.&#xD;
      Over-all GLP-1 seems to display effects in heart, brain, vessels, kidneys, muscles and&#xD;
      liver(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, our group has in a very recent study been the first, by sophisticated&#xD;
      metabolic techniques, together with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), to demonstrate that&#xD;
      GLP-1 per se reduces cerebral glucose transport in total cerebral grey matter as well as&#xD;
      individual grey matter regions, thereby suggesting that GLP-1 may protect the brain by&#xD;
      limiting intracerebral glucose fluctuation when plasma glucose is increased. In other words,&#xD;
      GLP-1 regulates blood brain barrier (BBB) glucose transfer at normal glycemia and presumably&#xD;
      also during hyperglycemia(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is believed to have cardioprotective actions. A recent study has shown improved&#xD;
      preservation of cardiac function in patients with acute myocardial infarctions when&#xD;
      GLP-1-infusion is supplemented to conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment&#xD;
      alone. Ejection fraction was improved by 10 % in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients(15)&#xD;
      in the GLP-1 group. It has been shown in animal models by the same research-team that the&#xD;
      extend of myocardial injury is smaller during coronary occlusion when treated with GLP-1(16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) T2D is characterized by several hormonal and metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities such as dysfunction of insulin secretion, glucagon excess, impaired&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone with numerous documented effects on the glycemic response. It is&#xD;
      one of the most potent insulinotropic agents known and is secreted from L-cells in the gut&#xD;
      mucosa in response to food ingestion. Effects on the islet-cells are (I) Amplification of&#xD;
      glucose dependent stimulation of insulin secretion (II) Inhibition of glucagon secretion. In&#xD;
      animal and cellular studies GLP-1 stimulates β-cell neogenesis, growth and differentiation,&#xD;
      and in vitro inhibition of β-cell apoptosis is observed. Thus GLP-1 is also a β-cell growth&#xD;
      factor. For now, treatment with GLP-1 has seldom caused hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Based on the findings in the above-mentioned study, we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      GLP-1-analogue exenatide during hyperglycemia will protect the brain in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients from hyperglycemia by reducing blood-brain-barrier glucose transport and brain&#xD;
      glucose metabolism. We also hypothesize that exenatide in a similar fashion through reduction&#xD;
      of cardiac glucose uptake and metabolism will stabilize cardiac glucose fluctuation, which&#xD;
      theoretically should protect cardiac tissue from the toxicity of hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim With well established methodology, to compare the effect of the GLP-1-analogue exenatide&#xD;
      and placebo, respectively, on the consumption of glucose in the CNS and heart assessed by&#xD;
      uptake of 18-fluro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) monitored by PET-scan of type-2 diabetic patients&#xD;
      during hyperglycemic pituitary-pancreatic clamp in the perspective of future prevention of&#xD;
      macrovascular complications of diabetes and possibly other diseases such as Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and other neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project comprises two separate substudies focusing on the effects of exenatide in the CNS&#xD;
      and heart, respectively. Accordingly, each substudy will have its own primary endpoint: 1)&#xD;
      glucose-uptake in the brain and 2) glucose-uptake in the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized, double-blinded crossover design. Every participant will be CNS-PET-scanned&#xD;
      twice or heart-PET-scanned twice in random order with GLP-1 and placebo-infusions interrupted&#xD;
      by a 4 week wash-out period between study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed similarly to our previously conducted FDG/PET-study(21) and&#xD;
      pancreatic clamp as done by Nielsen et al.(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is a natural peptide hormone that is degraded by the enzyme DPPIV after few minutes in&#xD;
      the circulation. In this study we use the GLP-1 analogue exenatide that is a slower&#xD;
      degradable peptide due to resistance towards DPPIV. The remaining hormones utilized in this&#xD;
      study, are used as tools in the investigational design and will not be used as medical&#xD;
      compounds themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatostatin (Ferring) 300 μg/hour(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin Actrapid (NOVO Nordisk) 1,0 mU/kg/minute (0-60 min.)(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin Actrapid (NOVO Nordisk) 0,3 mU/kg/minute (60min - )(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucagon (NOVO Nordisk, Glucagen) 0.6 ng/kg/minute(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth hormone (NOVO Nordisk) 2 ng/kg/minute(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GLP-1-analogue, Exenatide (Eli Lilly/Amylin Pharmaceuticals) 0.066 pmol*kg-1*min-1 (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic and hyperglycemic clamp Somatostatin is administered to inhibit endogenous&#xD;
      production of GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone. Insulin, glucagon, and growth&#xD;
      hormone are administered to achieve basal hormone levels. 20% glucose is infused to achieve&#xD;
      hyperglycemic clamp with plasma glucose at 9 mM which is by experience the highest level of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia possible while still avoiding breakthrough of natural counterregulatory&#xD;
      hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Apart from its documented effect on glycemic control, GLP-1 has potential protective&#xD;
      impact in the heart and brain. Patients with type-2 diabetes carry a significantly increased&#xD;
      risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke that has not been substantially reduced by current&#xD;
      treatments. Preliminary data suggest that clinical use of GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogues can lead&#xD;
      to improved prophylaxis against late diabetic complications, which can be achieved in this&#xD;
      patient group in addition to improved glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe the current study will provide deeper insight into the extra-pancreatic effects of&#xD;
      GLP-1, with the particular aim to develop efficient prophylaxis against late diabetic&#xD;
      cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications, which outweighs the known adverse effects&#xD;
      of the elements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles described in the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration II and will not be initiated before acceptance is granted from the local Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent from participants is required before studies can be commenced, and all&#xD;
      participants are covered by insurance according to &quot;Bekendtgørelse af lov om&#xD;
      patientforsikring&quot; and &quot;Lov om erstatning for lægemiddelskader&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent All participants will receive written and oral information about the purpose&#xD;
      and the expected scientific value of the project as well as detailed description of all&#xD;
      procedures and risks involved. Specifically, the participant will be told that participation&#xD;
      is completely voluntary, and withdrawal is accepted at any stage during the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project coordinator, Dr. Chalotte Stecher, will provide oral information and hand out&#xD;
      written material including the general information brochure &quot;Before you decide…..&quot; (&quot;Før du&#xD;
      beslutter dig…&quot;). The participant is allowed an accompanying person for the duration of the&#xD;
      meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent is collected after a minimum of 24 hours for further consideration. Both the&#xD;
      responsible physician and the participant sign the consent, and the latter will be provided a&#xD;
      copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Source data (original documentation of clinical findings, printouts, lab&#xD;
      results, and other details necessary to completely reconstruct each study) are stored in case&#xD;
      report forms and a common database. All personal information is locked away and inaccessible&#xD;
      to all but the investigators. Screening ID, randomization ID, and initials in the database&#xD;
      identify participants. The initials will be erased from the database after completion of the&#xD;
      study to ensure anonymity. A separate chart containing screening ID, randomization ID,&#xD;
      initials, and personal data will be stored at another location to allow re-identification of&#xD;
      source data. Social security numbers (Danish: CPR-numbers) are present on electronical&#xD;
      charts, which are kept in the individual electronical patient charts on the hospital server.&#xD;
      This information will only be accessible to personnel in the study-group and not to doctors&#xD;
      treating the patients in any future hospitalization. Data will automatically be erased from&#xD;
      the server after 15 years. The study will be disclosed to the local Data Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial aspects Each participant will receive dkr 4.000 as compensation. Furthermore,&#xD;
      transport expenses will be reimbursed according to official rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicant will provide the needed work in accordance with present rules and contracts&#xD;
      concerning research fellows at Institute of Pharmacology, University of Aarhus and the&#xD;
      Research Unit, Department of Endocrinology (M), Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eli Lilly/Amylin Pharmaceuticals and relevant public foundations will be applied for&#xD;
      financial support for the present study.&#xD;
