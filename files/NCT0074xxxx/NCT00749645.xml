      Introduction: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a common rheumatic disease characterized by pain,&#xD;
      inflammation and reduction in joint function. Hands and feet are the most commonly affected&#xD;
      joints and pain is the cause that brings patients with RA to search for medical assistance.&#xD;
      Factors causing pain and the risk of physical incapacity are still poorly understood. Joint&#xD;
      pain in RA is, generally, a profound pain, focalized in the involved joint. Typically, pain&#xD;
      increases when joint moves and decreases when joint is at rest. But, in the advanced form of&#xD;
      the disease, pain can be persistent and some patients can feel night pain, or rigidity and&#xD;
      pain after a period of inactivity, that last more than 1 hour and decreases when some&#xD;
      activity is taken up again, i.e. rigidity and early morning pain. Clinically, these patients&#xD;
      present with symptoms such as localized sensibility on the joints, and slight edema of the&#xD;
      tissue, bone crepitating and heat on the outer joint. Muscular atrophy with or without&#xD;
      muscular spasm can be seen. In the advanced form of the disease, there is deformity and&#xD;
      complete loss of joint movement. Analgesic drugs, specially the non steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs play an essential role in the management of RA. These drugs&#xD;
      are not only effective in the rapid and sustained relief of pain, but at the same time they&#xD;
      can have an acceptable profile of safety and tolerability in medium and long term treatment.&#xD;
      However, there are cases of gastric intolerance and /or renal or hepatic dysfunction. The&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, is mainly due to&#xD;
      the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX), that is needed for the synthesis of&#xD;
      prostaglandins and thromboxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of FANG used in this clinical trial: FANG(30) is a product manufactured by&#xD;
      FARMINDUSTRIA S.A., Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Santiago, Chile, in the form of a common&#xD;
      medicine, according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Guidelines &amp; Requirements of the&#xD;
      Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP), from a standardized and patented extract of A.&#xD;
      paniculata, Nees (Acanthaceae), a medicinal plant native to India and China. Its chemical&#xD;
      composition and principal active compounds are bitter diterpenic lactones, specially&#xD;
      andrographolide, deoxy-andrographolide and neoandrographolide, in tablets weighting 100 mg&#xD;
      with a 30 % of the active principle. This plant is vastly distributed in the countries of&#xD;
      Southeast Asia and has been used as an official medicinal plant in China and India for&#xD;
      thousands of years. It still continues as a popular medicine for the treatment of different&#xD;
      diseases. Recently it has been demonstrated to possess anti tumoral5, anti-inflammatory6 and&#xD;
      antiviral7 effects. Andrographolide is particularly efficient in regulating the immune&#xD;
      response 5, 7. The molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the immunomodulating and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties of andrographolide, remain still unknown, however, recent in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo studies, indicate that andrographolide inhibits NFkappaB8. Specifically,&#xD;
      andrographolide in concentrations of 10 µM interferes with the DNA binding of NF-κB reducing&#xD;
      the expression of COX-2 in neutrophils induced with fMLP and PAF. Moreover, andrographolide&#xD;
      reduces the production of IFNγ and IL-2 in T cells stimulated with CON-A, without affecting&#xD;
      the cellular viability or inducing apoptosis. Also the apoptosis induced by corticosteroids&#xD;
      in thymocytes was reduced. Andrographolide and 14-deoxyandrographolide are able to inhibit&#xD;
      the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in T cells and neutrophils, respectively 9, 10. In inflammatory&#xD;
      processes, FANG has shown potent anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the production of&#xD;
      cytokines, derived from phospholipids, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that are the&#xD;
      &quot;fuel&quot; for chronic inflammation, explaining its capacity to reduce and control inflammation,&#xD;
      inflammatory pain and facilitate the induction of cellular repair. Clinical Evidence of some&#xD;
      effects of A. paniculata: During the last decades, A. paniculata has become popular in&#xD;
      Scandinavia for the treatment of common cold. Accumulated evidence indicates that it can&#xD;
      reduce the severity of this disease. Various clinical studies indicate that A. paniculata is&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of viral infections of the upper respiratory tract. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis in 2004 on 7 double blind controlled clinical trials that met the criteria and&#xD;
      scientific quality accepted for this meta design, including 896 participants, which evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy of A. paniculata for the treatment of acute respiratory infections11, indicates&#xD;
      in the combined results, that A. paniculata was more effective than the placebo in reducing&#xD;
      the symptoms of common cold. A. paniculata has also been compared to acetaminophen. In a&#xD;
      double blind randomized study with 152 patients with fever and pharyngeal congestion 12 high&#xD;
      doses of A. paniculata (6 g) reduced fever and sore throat in a similar manner to&#xD;
      acetaminophen, without significant secondary effects. In a double blind randomized trial,&#xD;
      against a placebo, with 107 patients, A. paniculata increased resistance to common cold 13,&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of colds by a factor of 2.1 times compared to the control group after&#xD;
      a 3 months treatment during winter season. Safety Parameters - Toxicity and Tolerability of&#xD;
      FANG: Acute and sub-chronic toxicity in rodents and pigs using an extract of A. paniculata&#xD;
      the component of FANG, performed at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Universidad&#xD;
      Austral de Chile according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Food Administration Agency&#xD;
      (FDA), showed the absence of adverse effects with doses &gt;20g/kg after 90 days of treatment.&#xD;
      Not genetic, or reproductive, immunological, neurological, hematological, metabolic,&#xD;
      histopathological toxicity were detected either. Also, in a Phase I clinical trial, where the&#xD;
      participants were monitored for liver, renal and hematological parameters, no clinical or&#xD;
      laboratory secondary effects were described 11, 13, 15. Bio safety studies in small children,&#xD;
      nursing mothers, patients with renal or hepatic damage have not been performed yet. On the&#xD;
      other hand, since A. paniculata can stimulate the contractibility of gall bladder. Therefore,&#xD;
      it should not be used without medical supervision or in patients with gall bladder pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of Study: To assess and measure the anti inflammatory efficacy of this test natural&#xD;
      product and contribute learning about some of the basic biological mechanisms by which&#xD;
      produces its effects, on adult patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis. Methodology: For&#xD;
      this purpose, there will be 2 groups of patients who will respectively receive at random, an&#xD;
      either inert substance known as placebo, and the other group that will receive the test&#xD;
      product in the form of coated tablets, three times every day, during the period of study that&#xD;
      will last 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of Study: National study in Chile with 2 centers, one in the city of Valdivia and one&#xD;
      in the city of Osorno with a number of 30 patients per centre and enrolled by their&#xD;
      respective rheumatologists. Population of Study: 60 adult individuals of both sexes diagnosed&#xD;
      with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis and undergoing standard treatment will be included.&#xD;
      Individuals with chronic or acute disease, smokers, alcoholics, diabetics, heart diseases,&#xD;
      lung diseases, neoplastic diseases, and individuals taken any other medicine will be&#xD;
      excluded. Product of Study: The experimental FANG (30) and the placebo tablets were&#xD;
      manufactured and stored as specified, and will be delivered and administered as proposed in&#xD;
      this protocol. Procedure: A total of approximately 30 individuals will be assigned to the&#xD;
      placebo group, and 30 to the FANG(30) group. During 14 weeks, each of them will daily take 3&#xD;
      tablets of the respective randomly assigned product. All volunteers will allow obtaining a&#xD;
      monthly blood sample by simple venipuncture from the superior arm at day 0, 30, 60, 90 and&#xD;
      120 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discomfort and derived risks of the study: Since the participants, will need to take tablets&#xD;
      of the product 3 times a day and submitted to the extraction of 4 blood samples during the&#xD;
      study period, these facts can represent in some cases, a physical and emotional discomfort,&#xD;
      depending of the customs and individual predisposition for this type of common medical&#xD;
      procedures. Adverse Effects: Andrographis paniculata extract is not toxic and the&#xD;
      manufactured product FANG(30) is prepared under GMP with pharmaceutical quality as requested&#xD;
      for this study. The product is well tolerated and no complications are reported in the vast&#xD;
      available information. However, as any natural and / or pharmaceutical product, in isolated&#xD;
      cases, there can be slight risks such as rushes, allergies to the active principles of the&#xD;
      plant, which anyhow, are reversible with the suspension of the intake of the product.&#xD;
      Moreover, if in one of the patients, an alteration is detected that could be dangerous or&#xD;
      inconvenient for his or her health condition; physicians will offer this patient to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study. In case of a severe alteration, the rheumatologist will withdraw the patient&#xD;
      from the study for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal expected results: At the end of the study period, participants receiving the active&#xD;
      product FANG (30) (Andrographis extract tablets), should show an improvement in their&#xD;
      symptoms. Moreover, participants that received placebo should not show any sign of change in&#xD;
      their symptoms. Any situation of health detected during the course of the study, related to&#xD;
      the analyzed parameters, or any other aspects of clinical significance, even not necessarily&#xD;
      included in this study, will be duly recorded and informed accordingly. If end results&#xD;
      demonstrate that FANG(30) in a particular case has proven to be beneficial, all participating&#xD;
      patients (even those having received a placebo) will be offered by their rheumatologists a&#xD;
      free treatment with this same medicine in a regular modality, for the next 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteering: Volunteers must be absolutely free to apply and participate, in order to be&#xD;
      included in this study, as for no reason whatsoever nobody can oblige a person to participate&#xD;
      under any condition or threat. Moreover, volunteers can abandon and not continue&#xD;
      participating in this study at any moment and without necessity of given explanations. This&#xD;
      event will not affect the relationships with treating physicians, neither with the personnel&#xD;
      of the hospital, or have any relation or influence with volunteer's future health care&#xD;
      requirements. Volunteers can, and must consult all doubts about the study in which they have&#xD;
      been invited to participate, before accepting and also during development of the study.&#xD;
      Insurance for the Study: Considering the previous experience with the drug, of being of free&#xD;
      sale in other countries; being approved by the Institute of Public Health in Chile,&#xD;
      authorized to be sold as a nutraceutical in the USA, no hiring of specific insurance for&#xD;
      special risks of this study has been considered. Moreover, this study has no special funds&#xD;
      for the payment of compensations for damages resulting from adverse effects to the test&#xD;
      medicine. Nevertheless, in case some event of this nature would happen, volunteers will be&#xD;
      assisted with all the procedures and therapies they require, and continue to be monitored by&#xD;
      a study physician for their care. In case of additional interventions needed, but not derived&#xD;
      directly from adverse effects of this study and not covered by regular health insurance&#xD;
      systems, these events will be also covered by the insurance policy of this study. This&#xD;
      insurance policy will be maintained current for up to 4 months after the completion of the&#xD;
      study. Responsible rheumatologists to inform volunteers on the study, to clarify doubts or&#xD;
      answering questions are Dr. Verónica I. Aguirre at Hospital de Valdivia and Dr. Sonia M.&#xD;
      Arriagada at Hospital de Osorno.&#xD;
