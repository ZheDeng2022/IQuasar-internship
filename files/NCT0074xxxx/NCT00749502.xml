    <textblock>
      This is a four-part dose-escalation and confirmation study in participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Part A is for dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-4827. Part B is a prostate/ovarian cancer cohort&#xD;
      expansion. Part C is for a cohort of participants with relapsed or refractory T-cell&#xD;
      prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Part D will be for a&#xD;
      cohort of participants with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC),&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, locally advanced or metastatic triple negative&#xD;
      or highly proliferative estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, or partially&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer. The study is also designed to find out whether&#xD;
      MK-4827 causes at least 50% inhibition of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP)&#xD;
      enzyme activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Part A, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed&#xD;
             metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor for which standard therapy does not exist&#xD;
             or the participants have refused standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Part B, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer for which standard therapy does not&#xD;
             exist or the participants have refused standard therapy or sporadic (not known to have&#xD;
             BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations) recurrent platinum resistant high grade serous ovarian,&#xD;
             primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Participants who progressed while&#xD;
             receiving a platinum-containing regimen are not eligible. Participants with ovarian&#xD;
             cancer must have at least one measurable lesion (at least 15 mm in one dimension) or a&#xD;
             cancer antigen (CA)-125 value twice the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Part B, participants must have archival tumor tissue available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Part C, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed&#xD;

             receiving alemtuzumab. Participants with CLL must have been refractory to or&#xD;
             progressed within 12 months following a fludarabine-containing regimen or have&#xD;

          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) and evidence of phosphate and tensin&#xD;
             homolog (PTEN) deficiency. Participants must have received at least 1 prior&#xD;
             5-fluoruracil (5-FU)-based combination chemotherapy regimen for mCRC, containing&#xD;
             oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Participants must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed persistent or recurrent endometrial&#xD;

             cancer. Participants who cannot receive platinum due to allergy or toxicity are&#xD;
             eligible. Participants with ovarian cancer may have received non-platinum containing&#xD;
             chemotherapy between their last platinum-containing regimen and enrolling in this&#xD;
             study. Participants must have measurable disease or an elevated CA-125 (at least 2&#xD;

             locally advanced disease must have recurrent or progressive disease that is not&#xD;
             suitable for treatment with curative intent. Participants with ER positive disease&#xD;
