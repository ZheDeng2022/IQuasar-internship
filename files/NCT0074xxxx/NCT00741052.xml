    <textblock>
      Cholera is an important diarrhoeal disease and an important cause of death, particularly&#xD;
      during epidemic outbreaks, in Bangladesh and many other developing countries. Used as an&#xD;
      adjunct to management of dehydration, antimicrobial therapy using an appropriate agent&#xD;
      reduces diarrhoea duration and stool volume in severe cholera by about half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usefulness of antimicrobials has, however, been greatly eroded by the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of resistant strains of V. cholerae O1. From October 2004 at the Matlab Hospital&#xD;
      and from December 2004 at the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR, B, V. cholerae strains became&#xD;
      increasingly resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin- two drugs used in the treatment of&#xD;
      severe cholera in adults and children respectively. Because of this high prevalence of&#xD;
      resistance we resorted in early 2005 to using ciprofloxacin for treatment against multi drug&#xD;
      resistant V. cholerae. Although all isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin when standard&#xD;
      thresholds for disc-diffusion or E-test were used, but majority of the strains demonstrated a&#xD;
      MIC value of 0.250 µg/ml, over hundred-folds greater than the V. cholerae strains tested in&#xD;
      earlier years, which generally had a MIC of &lt;0.003 µg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, double blind, controlled trial we will assess clinical and&#xD;
      bacteriological response to 12 hourly oral dose of ciprofloxacin for 3 days in which the&#xD;
      first two doses will be 1 g each and the later 4 doses will be 500 mg each, and compare them&#xD;
      with a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin. We are using azithromycin as the comparator drug&#xD;
      because current circulating V. cholerae isolates are susceptible (MIC ≤ 0.125 µg/ml) to this&#xD;
      azithromycin, and single-dose azithromycin has been evaluated earlier to be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of cholera.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cholera is caused by infection of the human intestine with Vibrio cholerae O1 or V. cholerae&#xD;
      O139. It is a major health problem in many developing countries including Bangladesh.1 The&#xD;
      importance of cholera as a worldwide public health problem is evident from the large number&#xD;
      of countries affected by cholera epidemics.2 Data of the Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance&#xD;
      system of the Dhaka Hospital demonstrated that V. cholera O1 was the most frequently isolated&#xD;
      pathogens (617/2,068 i.e. 30%) in patients attending the hospital with diarrhoeal illnesses&#xD;
      in 2006. By extrapolating the number of patients enrolled in the surveillance system we&#xD;
      estimate that over 30,000 out of the total 106,531 patients attending the hospital in 2006&#xD;
      had cholera- a huge number of patients indeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like other diarrhoeal illnesses, prevention and management of dehydration using appropriate&#xD;
      oral and/or intravenous fluids is the mainstay in the management of cholera, irrespective of&#xD;
      severity. However, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is a very useful adjunct therapy that&#xD;
      reduces the duration of diarrhoea, the volume of diarrhoeal stools (thus the amount of oral&#xD;
      and intravenous fluids), and also the duration of faecal excretion of the pathogen, V.&#xD;
      cholerae O1 and O139 by about 50%. 3-6 Based on these observations made in numerous clinical&#xD;
      trials, routine use of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy is recommended in the management&#xD;
      of severe cholera, both in adults and children. All three benefits, as described above, are&#xD;
      very important in resources-constraint settings where cholera is endemic and also during&#xD;
      epidemic outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nosocomial transmission of cholera has also been increasingly recognized as an important&#xD;
      problem,7 and reducing the duration of excretion of Vibrio cholerae in the stool associated&#xD;
      with appropriate antimicrobial therapy will presumably decrease the rate of nosocomial&#xD;
      infection. Lastly, by shortening the course of illness, patients and their families' can more&#xD;
      quickly return to their normal life, lessening their financial burden, which is of particular&#xD;
      relevance to socio-economically disadvantaged population who disproportionately share the&#xD;
      most of the disease burden from cholera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the time of the initial controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy for cholera, almost&#xD;
      four decades ago,3 a number of antimicrobial agents have been evaluated to be useful in the&#xD;
      treatment of cholera. Tetracycline, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, furazolidone and&#xD;
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have all been found to be effective in the treatment of cholera&#xD;
      when given in multiple doses for 3 days.8-14 Tetracycline and it's long-acting congener&#xD;
      doxycycline are also effective when administered in a single 1 or 2 g and 200 or 300 mg oral&#xD;
      doses respectively in adults.13, 14 Vomiting is a common problem in association with&#xD;
      doxycycline therapy and the problem is greater when doxycycline is used in 300 mg dose (39%)&#xD;
      compared to when 200 mg dose is used (30%); however, the therapeutic efficacy is better with&#xD;
      the higher dose (mean duration of diarrhoea were 32h vs. 40h respectively.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial resistance has now become an important problem in the clinical management of&#xD;
      cholera. For example, in 2006 virtually all of the 683 clinical strains of V. cholerae O1&#xD;
      isolated from patients attending the Dhaka Hospital were multiply drug resistant with 100%&#xD;
      resistance to ampicillin, furazolidone and co-trimoxazole, 83% to erythromycin and 85% to&#xD;
      tetracycline.15 All V. cholerae strains remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin by&#xD;
      disc-diffusion testing, but in E-test their MIC were noted to have increased from 0.002 µg/ml&#xD;
      during 1993-2003 to 0.250-0.380 µg/ml in 2006&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance of V. cholerae to commonly used drugs such as tetracycline, doxycycline,&#xD;
      furazolidone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have also been reported from Asia, Africa and&#xD;
      Latin America,17-20 In the early 1990's increasing prevalence of V. cholerae resistant to&#xD;
      antimicrobials commonly used in the treatment of cholera (tetracycline, ampicillin,&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole) prompted our group and others to conduct series of trials to identify newer&#xD;
      affective agents for treatment of cholera. We evaluated ciprofloxacin in both adult and&#xD;
      children infected with V. cholerae O1 and O139, and observed very good rates of both clinical&#xD;
      and bacteriological response when used in multiple doses or in a single dose administered&#xD;
      only once.11, 21, 22&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin, is a member of the class of drugs called fluoroquinolones, which act by&#xD;
      blocking the action of bacterial DNA gyrase.23 This enzyme, which is not present in human&#xD;
      cells, is responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA, an essential element for DNA&#xD;
      functions.24 Without the three-dimensional DNA structure the cell is unable to replicate, and&#xD;
      thus bacterial growth is rapidly halted. Ciprofloxacin is the most active of the fluorinated&#xD;
      4-quinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin) against bacterial diarrhoea pathogens&#xD;
      in-vitro as assessed by MIC. It has a relatively long serum half-life.25 Due to its multiple&#xD;
      mechanisms of excretion toxic levels of quinolones do not usually accumulate in the body.&#xD;
      Experience suggests that resistance against ciprofloxacin develops much more slowly than&#xD;
      against the older quinolone agent such as nalidixic acid, as the rate of spontaneous mutation&#xD;
      is much lower and multiple mutations are required to confer frank resistance.26, 27 Increases&#xD;
      in the MIC, however, can occur with single mutation, and this is the likely sequence that has&#xD;
      occurred among currently circulating V. cholerae isolates in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of resistance to other agents and susceptibility of the isolates to ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      in-vitro, disc diffusion tests, Dhaka and Matlab Hospitals of ICDDR, B changed their&#xD;
      treatment policy (early 2005) to single-dose ciprofloxacin therapy for treatment of cholera&#xD;
      irrespective of patients' age, except for cholera in pregnant women. However, experienced&#xD;
      physicians at the Dhaka Hospital quickly noted sub-optimal clinical response to ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      therapy- higher stool output and longer hospitalisation. A quick review of the clinical study&#xD;
      that we recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed these findings.28&#xD;
      In that study only 26 (27%) of 98 patients who were infected with V. cholerae O1 experienced&#xD;
      an optimal clinical response to single-dose ciprofloxacin, while only 10 (10%) of the 98&#xD;
      patients had a bacteriologic cure, as defined in the protocol. Eventual determination of MICs&#xD;
      of the V. cholerae strains from that study revealed that the inferior clinical and&#xD;
      bacteriological response to ciprofloxacin was associated with an increase in MIC values.29&#xD;
      Table 1 below shows the increase in ciprofloxacin MIC values that were observed during&#xD;
      1993-1994 when we first conducted clinical trials with ciprofloxacin to subsequent years&#xD;
      including in 2005 when ciprofloxacin was first introduced for routine use in the treatment of&#xD;
      cholera at the Dhaka Hospital. We can see, the median MICs has increased approximately one&#xD;
      hundred folds between 1993 and 2006.&#xD;
