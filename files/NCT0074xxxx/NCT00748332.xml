  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac cachexia, the main feature of undernutrition in chronic heart failure, usually&#xD;
      defined as a weight loss over 6% over 6 months, is a proven factor of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in this disease. Its pathophysiology is complex, but proinflammatory cytokines seem to play a&#xD;
      major role. Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, present in fish oil, have proven beneficial&#xD;
      in patients with coronary heart disease, due in part to their effects on membranes but also&#xD;
      due to their anti-inflammatory effects, with inhibition of TNF-α and interleukins 1 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase III randomized controlled double-blinded study is to assess the effects&#xD;
      of 8 weeks of a omega-3-enriched protein-energy supplement versus an iso-energetic&#xD;
      iso-nitrogenous supplement free of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiac cachexia. Thirty patients&#xD;
      will be included in each group. The main judgment criterion will be maximum aerobic capacity&#xD;
      (VO2 max), which best reflects aerobic capacity that correlates with muscle mass.&#xD;
      Anthropometric, biological (nutritional, inflammatory and involved in food intake control),&#xD;
      cardiac (functional) and quality of life will also be studied. All analyses will be performed&#xD;
      in intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a significantly higher improvement of VO2 max in the omega-3 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study could lead to therapeutic advances in a frequent and severe disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Undernutrition is frequent in chronic heart failure (approximately 40%). Cardiac cachexia,&#xD;
      main feature of this undernutrition, usually defined as a weight loss over 6% over 6 months,&#xD;
      is a proven factor of morbidity and mortality in this disease. Its pathophysiology is&#xD;
      complex, but proinflammatory cytokines seem to play a major role, thus appearing close to&#xD;
      cancer cachexia. A number of treatments have proven to be effective in preventing&#xD;
      undernutrition in chronic heart failure patients (ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics and&#xD;
      physical training). Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, present in fish oil, haven proven&#xD;
      beneficial in patients with coronary heart disease, due in part to their effects on membranes&#xD;
      but also due to their anti-inflammatory effects, with inhibition of TNF-α and interleukins 1&#xD;
      and 6. However, no study to this day has been conducted in human cardiac cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase III randomized controlled double-blinded study is to assess the effects&#xD;
      of 8 weeks of a omega-3-enriched protein-energy supplement versus an iso-energetic&#xD;
      iso-nitrogenous supplement free of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiac cachexia. Thirty patients&#xD;
      will be included in each group. The main judgment criterion will be maximum aerobic capacity&#xD;
      (VO2 max), which best reflects aerobic capacity that correlates with muscle mass.&#xD;
      Anthropometric, biological (nutritional, inflammatory and involved in food intake control),&#xD;
      cardiac (functional) and quality of life will also be studied. All analyses will be performed&#xD;
      in intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect a significantly higher improvement of VO2 max in the omega-3 group. This study&#xD;
      could lead to therapeutic advances in a frequent and severe disease.&#xD;
