      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of performing opt-out&#xD;
      rapid HIV screening in an urban, inner-city emergency department, as well as to evaluate its&#xD;
      clinical efficiency, cost effectiveness, and patient and staff satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 40,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United States. Although&#xD;
      significant effort has been devoted to improving identification of patients with undiagnosed&#xD;
      HIV infection, this rate has changed very little in the last decade and new infections appear&#xD;
      to be increasing most in non-traditional risk groups, including racial and ethnic minorities.&#xD;
      Most persons infected with HIV still do not get tested until late in their disease courses,&#xD;
      primarily due to its long asymptomatic period and their relatively poor access to routine&#xD;
      medical care. Over 100 million people visit emergency departments (EDs) annually, and the ED&#xD;
      commonly serves as a patient's only source for medical care, and thus the only potential&#xD;
      opportunity to receive HIV counseling, testing, and referral (CTR). Also, patients who are&#xD;
      most likely to use the ED as their only source of care are often those for whom the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic is spreading most. The primary objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness, clinical efficiency, cost effectiveness, and patient-staff&#xD;
      satisfaction with performing routine voluntary opt-out rapid HIV CTR in a high-volume urban&#xD;
      ED, when compared to a targeted rapid HIV CTR program in the same setting. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of the proposed investigations is that opt-out rapid HIV CTR is associated with a&#xD;
      higher rate of overall testing, identification of patients infected with HIV, identification&#xD;
      of patients infected with HIV earlier in their disease courses, and successful linkage into&#xD;
      medical and preventative care for those patients who test positive for HIV infection. The&#xD;
      secondary hypotheses are that opt-out rapid HIV CTR: (1) is not associated with increased ED&#xD;
      processes of care, defined by patient waiting times, length of stays, the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who leave before completing their evaluations, and an overcrowding index; and (2) is&#xD;
      cost-effective. The tertiary hypotheses are that opt-out rapid HIV CTR is associated with a&#xD;
      higher level of patient and ED staff satisfaction. To address these hypotheses, we will&#xD;
      perform a prospective quasi-experimental equivalent time-samples clinical trial in which&#xD;
      consecutive patients who present to the ED during interventional periods will be offered&#xD;
      opt-out rapid HIV CTR as part of their visits, and during the control periods, patients will&#xD;
      be targeted by physicians for rapid HIV CTR using a previously developed and validated CTR&#xD;
      model. The results obtained from this study will improve our understanding of how best to&#xD;
      identify patients with HIV infection in ED, and whether opt-out rapid HIV CTR is an effective&#xD;
      means to achieve the CDC's goals of identifying more asymptomatic HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      earlier in their disease courses.&#xD;
