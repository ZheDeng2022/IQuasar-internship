      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and decitabine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether carboplatin is more effective with or without decitabine in treating&#xD;
      patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying carboplatin and decitabine to see how&#xD;
      well they work compared with carboplatin alone in treating patients with progressive,&#xD;
      advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the response rate in patients with progressive, advanced ovarian epithelial&#xD;
           cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer who have methylated hMLH1&#xD;
           DNA in plasma treated with carboplatin with vs without decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the response rate in all patients (regardless of methylation status) treated&#xD;
           with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with&#xD;
           these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of combining decitabine with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the relationship between peak plasma levels of decitabine and global or CpG&#xD;
           island specific methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the relationship between global and gene specific methylation in peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the methylation status of genes associated with drug resistance detected in&#xD;
           plasma DNA with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the sensitivity and specificity of methylation of genes associated with&#xD;
           drug resistance detected in plasma DNA as a predictor of methylation status in tumor&#xD;
           cells isolated from ascites or tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study methylation and expression of genes in tumor cells isolated from ascites or&#xD;
           tumor biopsy before and after treatment with decitabine and/or carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate any correlation between methylation and expression of genes in surrogate&#xD;
           tissues, body fluids, or tumor cells and response or progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine markers of cell death in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the methylation in tumor taken at the time of presentation vs at the time of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior first-line&#xD;
      treatment (platinum alone vs platinum and taxane vs platinum and other combination), WHO&#xD;
      performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), measurable disease criteria (RECIST criteria vs CA-125&#xD;
      criteria vs both), participating center, and the number of prior platinum-based regimens (1&#xD;
      vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive decitabine IV over 6 hours on day 1 and carboplatin IV over&#xD;
           30-60 minutes on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacodynamic studies. Samples&#xD;
      are assessed for methylation of hMLH1 by methylation-specific PCR; global DNA methylation by&#xD;
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ; methylation of the MAGE-1A gene promoter by&#xD;
      methylation-specific PCR or bisulfite pyrosequencing; and markers of apoptosis by ELISA.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic studies of decitabine are also performed using blood samples from patients&#xD;
      randomized to arm II. Ascitic fluid and/or tumor tissue samples may also be collected for&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 2 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
