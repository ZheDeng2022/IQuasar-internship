  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This follow-up protocol is designed to evaluate participants who have previously been&#xD;
      lymphoma patients treated on approved clinical studies of the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to accrue up to 800 volunteers who are interested in&#xD;
      participating in NIA research studies as part of follow-up for previous cancer treatment at&#xD;
      NIH. Participants will be asked to answer questions regarding their general health status,&#xD;
      diagnoses, and admissions to hospital, and to provide possible documentation. They may be&#xD;
      asked to come to the NIA Clinical Research Unit at Harbor Hospital to participate in a&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation. They will have the opportunity to obtain additional information about&#xD;
      studies in which they may wish to participate and to discuss eligibility issues with NIA&#xD;
      staff members. Any identified clinical problems in need of care will also be discussed.&#xD;
      Volunteers may be referred, with their permission, to their private medical doctor for&#xD;
      follow-up. They may be re-evaluated within a year for further follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up evaluation may include history and physical, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      questionnaire, MRI or CT.&#xD;
