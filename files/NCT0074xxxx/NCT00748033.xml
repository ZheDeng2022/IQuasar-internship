  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the subject's perception (separately for each&#xD;
      randomized catheter) of practicing catheterization when using catheters with sodium chloride&#xD;
      in wetting solution (using two different activation times) with a standard reference&#xD;
      catheter. The hypothesis is that the subjects' perception of catheterization is the same or&#xD;
      more positive when using the test catheters compared to the reference catheter.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, single-blind, cross-over, single-centre, study in&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will first be catheterized with a reference catheter, which is proven to be well&#xD;
      tolerated by most subjects. This catheter will be used as a reference catheter to be compared&#xD;
      with the randomized catheters. One more reason for this first test is to withdraw subjects&#xD;
      who cannot tolerate catheterizations. Subjects will qualify for the randomized part of the&#xD;
      study only if the first catheterization could be performed without significant discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subject is randomized he will be catheterized with two urinary catheters in a&#xD;
      randomized order during one day. The activation times for the wetting solution will be 5&#xD;
      seconds and 24 (Â± 2h) hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each catheterization, the friction at withdrawal will be measured for the catheter&#xD;
      using a Tension Test System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be blinded. 25 healthy volunteers will be recruited from a single centre in&#xD;
      Sweden.&#xD;

The perception was measured on a scale from 1 (=very negative compared to the reference catheter) to 5 (=very positive compared to the reference catheter) and a 3 indicating that the perception was the same for the test catheter as for the reference catheter. Before doing any statistics all answers were reduced by 3 resulting in values from -2 (=very negative compared to the reference catheter) to +2 (=very positive compared to the reference catheter) and a 0 indicating that the perception was the same for the test catheter as for the reference catheter.</description>

        <title>Subjects' Perception at Insertion of Test Catheter Activated for 5 Seconds, Compared to Reference.</title>
        <description>The assessment was made in relation to the reference catheter, and the question to the subject was 'How do you experience this procedure/catheterization in comparison with the baseline procedure/catheterization regarding insertion?'.</description>
        <time_frame>A minimum of two hours elapsed between the catheterizations and each catherization lasted for 3 minutes. The subjects were catheterized three times during one day.</time_frame>
        <population>The study was analysed using a per protocol approach only. One subject (Subject ID 125) was catheterized with the reference catheter and the catheter activated 24 hours, but not with the catheter activated 5 seconds. After discussions it has, however, been decided to use all available data. In conclusion all subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria were included in the Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set.</population>

        <title>Subjects' Perception at Withdrawal of Test Catheter Activated for 24 Hours, Compared to Reference.</title>
        <description>The assessment was made in relation to the reference catheter, and the question to the subject was 'How do you experience this procedure/catheterization in comparison with the baseline procedure/catheterization regarding withdrawal?'.</description>
        <time_frame>A minimum of two hours elapsed between the catheterizations and each catherization lasted for 3 minutes. The subjects were catheterized three times during one day.</time_frame>
        <population>The study was analysed using a per protocol approach only. One subject (Subject ID 125) was catheterized with the reference catheter and the catheter activated 24 hours, but not with the catheter activated 5 seconds. After discussions it has, however, been decided to use all available data. In conclusion all subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria were included in the Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set.</population>

        <description>The subjects perception of the catheterization will be classified as very negative, slightly negative, same, slightly positive or very positive.&#xD;
The mean perception of the 5s and the 24h catheter is calculated for each subject.&#xD;
The perception was measured on a scale from 1 (=very negative compared to the reference catheter) to 5 (=very positive compared to the reference catheter) and a 3 indicating that the perception was the same for the test catheter as for the reference catheter. Before doing any statistics all answers were reduced by 3 resulting in values from -2 (=very negative compared to the reference catheter) to +2 (=very positive compared to the reference catheter) and a 0 indicating that the perception was the same for the test catheter as for the reference catheter.</description>

      <time_frame>Each subjects visited the clinic during one day. The subjects were catheterized for 3 minutes with each catheter. All subjects were catheterized with 3 catheters each, except one subject, who discontinued after test catheter 1 and was therefore only catheterized twice. At least 2 hours elapsed between each catheterization.</time_frame>
