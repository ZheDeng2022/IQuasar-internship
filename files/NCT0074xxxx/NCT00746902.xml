  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the links between blood pressure (BP), overweight&#xD;
      or obesity, and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), by studying a large cohort of subjects suffering&#xD;
      from refractory hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare plasmatic leptin levels in patients suffering from refractory hypertension&#xD;
           depending on whether or not they experience SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain what determines the difference in plasmatic leptin concentrations in&#xD;
           patients suffering from refractory hypertension depending on whether or not they&#xD;
           experience SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterise BP readings (from clinical and ambulatory (ABPM) measurements) in&#xD;
           patients suffering from refractory hypertension depending on whether or not they&#xD;
           experience SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterise metabolic parameters (lipids, glycaemia, adiponectin) and sympathetic&#xD;
           nervous system effectors (adrenaline, noradrenaline and metanephrines) in patients&#xD;
           suffering from refractory hypertension depending on whether or not they experience SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterise BP readings, metabolic parameters and sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
           effectors in patients suffering from refractory hypertension according to the severity&#xD;
           of the SAS (in those who experience this problem).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study, in patients with both SAS and refractory hypertension, the impact of nasal&#xD;
           continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on BP readings, metabolic&#xD;
           parameters and sympathetic nervous system effectors, by comparing those who are&#xD;
           compliant with the CPAP regimen with those who are non-compliant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of factors predispose subjects to both hypertension and SAS, including&#xD;
      overweight/obesity and hyperinsulinism. The pathogenesis of concomitant overweight/obesity&#xD;
      and hypertension is multifactorial. There is an independent relationship between the degree&#xD;
      of insulin resistance and the severity of SAS. A number of studies have suggested that&#xD;
      hormones secreted by adipose tissue are involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and&#xD;
      SAS, and overweight/obesity has been shown to be associated with elevated leptin levels&#xD;
      coupled with reduced adiponectin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leptin is produced in adipose tissue and its levels rise with overweight/obesity due to&#xD;
      peripheral resistance to its action. A number of studies have detected high leptinemia in&#xD;
      both hypertensives and people suffering from SAS. Leptin may activate the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system and promote SAS-related hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adiponectin which is also produced in adipose tissue has beneficial activities, notably on&#xD;
      atherogenesis. A relationship between hypertension and adiponectin has yet to be&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike leptin, adiponectin levels do not seem to be elevated in patients with SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of treatment, a number of studies have shown that CPAP has a positive effect on BP&#xD;
      readings. Although this effect is modest, it is greater in subjects with SAS and rises with&#xD;
      the severity of this condition. The effects of CPAP on plasmatic leptin and adiponectin&#xD;
      levels are as yet unknown.&#xD;
