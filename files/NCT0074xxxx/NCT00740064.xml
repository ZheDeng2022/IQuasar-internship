      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Raltegravir and Epzicom over 48 weeks in ART-naive&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, pilot study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
           safety, and tolerability of RTG BID and ABC/3TC QD. A total of 30 subjects will be&#xD;
           enrolled at 3 U.S. sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study includes a 30-day screening period, a treatment period (baseline through week&#xD;
           48), and a follow-up visit, 2 to 4 weeks after the last study visit, as needed to&#xD;
           resolve any ongoing AEs or to confirm virologic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virologic failure (VF) is defined as having either virologic non-response or virologic&#xD;
      rebound. Virologic failure is confirmed by having 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels taken&#xD;
      at least 2 weeks apart according to the following definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  virologic rebound is defined as HIV-1 RNA level ≥400 copies/mL after initial response of&#xD;
           HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL or &gt;1 log10 copies/mL increase above nadir;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  virologic non-response is defined as HIV-1 RNA &gt;400 copies/mL at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be discontinued from the study if virologic failure is confirmed. When a&#xD;
           subject is suspected to have virologic failure, a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA must be&#xD;
           performed at an unscheduled visit between 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the initial&#xD;
           assessment, and a plasma sample collected for resistance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who experience symptoms consistent with a clinically suspected ABC HSR must&#xD;
           permanently discontinue ABC/3TC, and will be allowed to substitute study-provided&#xD;
           fixed-dose combination ZDV/3TC 150/300 mg (COMBIVIR®) BID for ABC/3TC and remain in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
