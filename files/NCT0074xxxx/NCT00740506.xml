      This study, conducted at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA, will determine if having&#xD;
      vaginal intercourse in the last weeks of pregnancy decreases the risk of having a prolonged&#xD;
      pregnancy. Pregnancies that continue beyond the due date may increase health risks for the&#xD;
      mother and the baby. Although some believe that vaginal intercourse can help start labor in&#xD;
      the last weeks of pregnancy, there is not proof that it works. Some studies showed that&#xD;
      sexual intercourse helped and some that pregnancy lasted even longer for couples having sex.&#xD;
      In addition to exploring the effect of sexual intercourse on time to delivery, this study&#xD;
      will collect information that can be used in the future to predict when labor will naturally&#xD;
      start and the risk for overdue pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women 18 years of age and older in their first pregnancy who are carrying a single fetus with&#xD;
      gestational age before 38 plus 6 weeks may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be&#xD;
      living with their partner in a stable relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to have sexual intercourse about three times per week. They complete a&#xD;
      diary in which they record the times they have intercourse and how they are feeling daily.&#xD;
      The diaries are submitted by mail each week or at the doctor's or midwife's visit until&#xD;
      delivery. The women have a pelvic exam and ultrasound and complete questionnaires about&#xD;
      problems during pregnancy, overall well-being, attitude toward induction of labor, physical&#xD;
      activity, body image during pregnancy, stress and social support, habits at home, and&#xD;
      environmental conditions, such as weather.&#xD;

      Risks of maternal and neonatal complications, even fetal death, increase with prolonged&#xD;
      gestation. Recent studies suggest that the risks may start to increase even before 40 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation, which challenges the current paradigm of induction after 41 weeks. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings seem to suggest that induction before 40 weeks may actually reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. However, induction in women with an unripe cervix has a high risk of&#xD;
      failed induction and cesarean delivery. Cervical ripening at hospital prior to induction is&#xD;
      also associated with substantial costs and inconvenience to the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal intercourse in late pregnancy has long been known to women to accelerate the onset of&#xD;
      labor. It is recommended by many physicians and nurses to prevent prolonged pregnancy.&#xD;
      However, scientific evidence to support this common practice is scarce and inconsistent. We&#xD;
      propose a prospective observational study to assess the effects of frequent intercourse on&#xD;
      the timing of delivery in term pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 510 nulliparous women with low risk pregnancies will be recruited during their&#xD;
      antenatal visit after 36 plus 6 and before 39 plus 0 weeks of gestation at the Naval Medical&#xD;
      Center San Diego. Subjects who have had infrequent intercourse (less than once per week)&#xD;
      during the last four weeks before their visit will be asked to abstain from intercourse for&#xD;
      the duration of pregnancy (or use condoms) (we expect to recruit 255 women in this subgroup).&#xD;
      Subjects having vaginal intercourse more than once per week during the last four weeks will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain or increase their frequency of intercourse up to three times a week (we&#xD;
      expect to recruit 255 women for this subgroup). Women will be asked to record physical&#xD;
      conditions and vaginal intercourse in a diary until delivery. An ultrasound will assess fetal&#xD;
      biometry and cervical length and volume. A pelvic exam will calculate Bishop Score. Obstetric&#xD;
      information will be extracted from medical records after birth. Time to delivery and rate of&#xD;
      cesarean delivery will be compared between the women without sex and women with frequent sex.&#xD;
      The effects of intercourse at term on time to delivery and cesarean delivery may have&#xD;
      important clinical implications.&#xD;
