  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a neuroendocrine tumor registry. A registry is a&#xD;
      collection of information. To create this registry, the investigators would like to get&#xD;
      information, blood and tumor samples from people with neuroendocrine tumors. By collecting&#xD;
      this information and material, the investigators are hoping to learn more about the genetic&#xD;
      causes of neuroendocrine tumors. All of this will help us to better understand neuroendocrine&#xD;
      cancer, so the investigators can find better ways to treat and diagnose this disease. DNA&#xD;
      will be taken from the blood samples and will be used in future studies. This will be an&#xD;
      important resource from which the investigators can study genes that may be related to a&#xD;
      higher risk of neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected will include medical information, family history of cancer and your&#xD;
      answers to questions about how the cancer affects quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will complete an epidemiology study questionnaire as well as a quality of life questionnaire. They will also be asked to donate blood samples. We will request participation in a tissue repository consisting of fresh frozen or paraffin embedded tissue. The repository will be of serum, plasma and tumor tissue. Follow-up will occur on patients every 6 months for the first year after consent and then annually.</description>

      All participants will be invited to provide a DNA (blood sample) and tissue sample for the&#xD;
      purposes of developing a tissue repository. Blood samples will be collected. Expected accrual&#xD;
      is 150 patients per year. Patients who donate blood and/or tissue samples are considered&#xD;
      evaluable for protocol; however, it is preferred that both are obtained.&#xD;
