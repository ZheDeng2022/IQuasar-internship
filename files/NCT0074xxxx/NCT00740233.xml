      The investigators are inviting people with fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis, chronic&#xD;
      pain, and other chronic and recurring conditions to sign up and participate in a year-long&#xD;
      Internet-based survey to study the effectiveness of alternative medicine and the interactions&#xD;
      among stress and coping, pain, and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey is called PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary,&#xD;
      Alternative, and Integrative Medicine. PROCAIM was developed under a grant to UCLA&#xD;
      researchers from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a web-based study composed of surveys that will recur at intervals over 1 year!&#xD;

      PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary, Alternative, and&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine, was developed to collect and manage longitudinal patient data and&#xD;
      implement patient-based outcomes assessment protocols at clinical sites around the country&#xD;
      that offer various forms of CAM as well as clinics that provide the combination of&#xD;
      conventional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies. PROCAIM is currently&#xD;
      being used for a 12 month longitudinal survey to evaluate interactions among stress,&#xD;
      symptoms, severity, and general well-being among people with fibromyalgia, IBS, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue, and other chronic pain conditions, and the frequency and impact of co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions among users of complementary and alternative medicines.&#xD;
