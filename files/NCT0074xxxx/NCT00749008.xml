      The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive value of generalized movements in&#xD;
      preterm and term infants who are at risk for development of cerebral palsy. The investigators&#xD;
      will identify at-risk infants and observe their generalized movements, conduct a two year&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up, and interpret the predictive value of the investigators assessments&#xD;
      based on the diagnosis of cerebral palsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is considered a clinical syndrome caused by a preceding brain injury&#xD;
      early in brain development that results in static neurological deficits. These deficits&#xD;
      usually involve the somatomotor system manifesting as hemi-, di- or quadriplegia. Cerebral&#xD;
      palsy can also manifest as hypertonicity and contractures, sensory deficits, hearing and&#xD;
      visual difficulties, feeding problems and global developmental delay and almost always&#xD;
      coincides with chronic lung disease. The most common causes of cerebral palsy are&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, periventricular leukomalacia or intraventricular and/or&#xD;
      parenchymal hemorrhage that occurs in the first year of life. Hypoxic brain injury as a&#xD;
      result of poor oxygen delivery often occurs in the perinatal period but can also be caused by&#xD;
      pulmonary dysfunction. Thus, pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia,&#xD;
      pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome can lead to hypoxic brain injury and consequent CP. Less common etiologies&#xD;
      are genetic disorders, infections and intrapartum injuries. Current treatments of CP are&#xD;
      targeted to maintaining function, relieving contractures, improving nutrition and providing&#xD;
      developmental supportive care, but to date there is no cure or preventive guideline.&#xD;
      Moreover, supportive measures and family counseling is delayed since CP can be diagnosed only&#xD;
      at the age of 18-24 months. As a result, interventions that may aid in limiting CP effects&#xD;
      are delayed due to the lack of a predictive diagnostic assessment during the first six months&#xD;
      of life. Head ultrasound, EEG and functional MRI have been tested for their predictive value&#xD;
      before the actual diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The low sensitivity of these studies shows&#xD;
      that they are not useful as screening tools. Heinz Prechtl, an Austrian neurologist,&#xD;
      developed a clinical assessment method to study the spontaneous movements of preterm and term&#xD;
      infants. Monitoring of cramped synchronized generalized movements and fidgety movements has&#xD;
      resulted in 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity in predicting cerebral palsy in many&#xD;
      studies. A meta-analysis of predictive tools for cerebral palsy identified Prechtl's method&#xD;
      as superior to head ultrasound or MRI. These studies have not been repeated in the USA. Our&#xD;
      aim is to assess the predictive value of Prechtl's method in Hawaii, in preterm and term&#xD;
      infants with and without lung disease, who are at risk for development of cerebral palsy. We&#xD;
      will compare the incidence of pulmonary diseases and cerebral palsy and observe any&#xD;
      relationship between the development of lung disease and brain injury. We will identify at&#xD;
      risk infants and observe their generalized movements according to Prechtl's assessment. We&#xD;
      will conduct a 2-year longitudinal follow up of our patients and interpret the predictive&#xD;
      value of our assessment based on the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. We will compare the&#xD;
      sensitivity and positive predictive value of head ultrasound and the assessment of&#xD;
      generalized movements. It is hoped that this assessment will allow us to start supportive&#xD;
      measures at an earlier stage of life, thus improving the outcome of children with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy.&#xD;
