      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the entry IPSS inclusion criteria at Week 0 will be randomized and&#xD;
      enroll in the double-blind treatment period. Participants will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      treatment arms and will receive two 6-month courses of study drug administered on Days 0 and&#xD;
      14 of each 6-month course. Treatment arms include: ozarelix 30mg + 15mg, ozarelix 15mg + 15mg&#xD;
      or placebo + placebo. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at defined intervals&#xD;
      throughout the study. At Week 52 all participants on study will be eligible to receive&#xD;
      ozarelix for two additional courses in the open-label treatment period.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Score at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS is a validated self-administered index for grading benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related signs and symptoms. It consists of a set of seven questions. A total score of 1-7 indicates mild disease, 8-19 moderate disease and 20-35 severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline IPSS (Including Sub-scores) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) consists of 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms and 1 question concerning quality of life (QoL) with total score and subscores (voiding, storage and QoL). 1) Voiding- The subscale voiding score is the sum of the responses to 4 voiding symptoms questions (incomplete emptying, intermittency, weak stream, and straining). 2) Storage- The subscale storage score is the sum of the responses to 3 storage symptoms questions (frequency, urgency, and nocturia). Voiding and Storage: the lowest and highest possible scores range from 0 to 15 (mildly symptomatic to severely symptomatic). Voiding and Storage: each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. And 3) QoL assessment was a single question asking the participant how he would feel about tolerating his current level of symptoms for the rest of his life. The lowest and highest possible score ranges from 0 to 6 (very pleased to terrible).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII) Score at Week 14 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 14 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>BPH Impact Index (BII) is used to assess the impact of BPH on various aspects of health. This 4 question self administered index uses a scoring range from 0 (best) to 13 (worst).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Global Assessment Question (LUTS-GAQ) Response at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The self administered LUTS GAQ is a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response to a question asking whether overall improvement in LUTS will be observed during the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Maximum Urine Flow (Qmax) at Week 14 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Qmax was measured by free flow uroflowmetry. Qmax is defined as the peak urine flow rate (measured in milliliter (mL)/second using a standard calibrated flowmeter). For a Qmax to be considered valid, the voided volume had to be at least 125 mL. The uroflowmeter is to be calibrated weekly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-EF) Score at Week 14 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF-EF is defined as the sum of the scores for Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF questionnaire. This recall instrument is self-administered by the participant. Individual questions are graded from 1 to 5 with a maximum total score of 30. Lower IIEFEF scores represent diminished erectile function. Men with a score of ≥ 26 are interpreted as having normal erectile function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline International Prostate Symptom Score - Quality of Life (IPSS-QOL) at Week 14 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS QOL is a disease-specific quality of life question, referred to as IPSS Question 8. Participants with an IPSS QOL of &lt;3 at screening will be excluded from this study. The rating is as follows: 0=delighted, 1=pleased, 2=mostly satisfied, 3=mixed, 4=mostly dissatisfied, 5=unhappy, 6=terrible.</description>
