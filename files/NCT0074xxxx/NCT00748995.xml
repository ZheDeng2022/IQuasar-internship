      This is a research study examining health effects of the Iraq War, especially those effects&#xD;
      involving mental health. This study is a follow-up to the Neurocognition Deployment Health&#xD;
      Study (NDHS), also called &quot;Prospective Assessment of Neurocognition in Future Gulf-deployed&#xD;
      and Gulf-nondeployed Military Personnel: A Pilot Study.&quot; The specific purpose of this&#xD;
      research study is to find out more about the longer lasting effects of war on mood and stress&#xD;
      symptoms, thinking and reaction skills, and different aspects of day to day life, such as&#xD;
      work and daily activities. Survey and test results from previous participation in the NDHS&#xD;
      will be compared to the new information that will be obtained from participants as part of&#xD;
      this study. The investigators expect that a total of about 817 military personnel and&#xD;
      military Veterans will participate in the study. There are two parts to this study: (1)&#xD;
      mail/internet/phone survey and (2) in-person assessment. The investigators will invite all&#xD;
      NDHS participants who deployed to Iraq to participate in the survey component. The survey&#xD;
      component of the study involves being interviewed by phone about mood and stress symptoms and&#xD;
      head injuries and completing written survey questions by either mail or on the internet that&#xD;
      address basic personal history (such as age, military status, gender, combat injury history),&#xD;
      mood, stress symptoms, and stressful experiences. The phone interview will take about 2 to&#xD;
      2.5 hours to complete. The questionnaire part will take about 20 to 30 minutes to complete,&#xD;
      and can be completed either by mailing back completed questionnaires or by internet using a&#xD;
      private, individual log-in/password combination. The investigators will invite approximately&#xD;
      200 selected at random from the larger group of survey responders to take part in the&#xD;
      in-person assessment. The in-person assessment involves taking a small subset of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tasks. The tasks will be given on a computer or using paper and pencil.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires about work, daily activities, and&#xD;
      health history, as well as basic health measures such as height, weight, blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, and waist size. Potential participants will be given the option of completing the&#xD;
      in-person assessment at one of the two study sites (Seattle or Boston), or in a private&#xD;
      setting in their community (e.g., a hotel small conference room). Altogether, this part of&#xD;
      the study will take about 120 minutes to 140 minutes to complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of August 2007, approximately 1.5 million U.S. service members had been deployed to either&#xD;
      Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF) or Afghanistan (Operating Enduring Freedom, OEF). The&#xD;
      sacrifices of these service members include &gt;3500 fatalities and &gt;35,000 injuries resulting&#xD;
      in medical air transports. Medical sequelae, such as those involving traumatic amputations&#xD;
      and traumatic brain injury, have been common. Contemporary military operations have also been&#xD;
      linked to significant adverse mental health consequences. In particular, recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that both overt psychiatric symptoms and other functionally-relevant problems, such&#xD;
      as attention and memory impairment, occur. These adverse mental health consequences, already&#xD;
      observed in the immediate aftermath of war, could constitute a significant public health&#xD;
      problem if prevalent and persistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) study #566 proposes an observational&#xD;
      cohort design to examine war-related mental health dysfunction beyond the immediate aftermath&#xD;
      of war. The proposed work builds on a unique data set available from the Neurocognition&#xD;
      Deployment Health Study (NDHS), an interagency collaboration between the Department of&#xD;
      Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Initiated in April 2003, with an&#xD;
      initial enrollment of 1595 participants, the NDHS has focused on short-term mental health&#xD;
      outcomes of OIF deployment. To date, the NDHS is the only deployment health study of U.S.&#xD;
      troops that includes both prospectively-gathered pre-deployment (baseline) and&#xD;
      post-deployment (within 90 days after return from the war) data, as well as objective,&#xD;
      performance-based measures of mental functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work would collect new &quot;long-term follow-up&quot; data 3 to 5 years after NDHS&#xD;
      participants returned from their initial deployment to Iraq. The newly acquired data from the&#xD;
      proposed work will be analyzed with data available from the previous waves of the NDHS. The&#xD;
      two primary objectives of CSP #566 are to: (1) determine the prevalence and course of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Iraq War Veterans 3-5 years following return from&#xD;
      their Iraq War deployment; and (2) assess the persistence of previously observed&#xD;
      neuropsychological changes (in attention, verbal learning, visual memory, and reaction time)&#xD;
      following war-zone participation and their relationships to the subsequent development of&#xD;
      PTSD as the end-point. The second primary objective also evaluates traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI) as a possible neural risk factor for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two secondary objectives are to: (1) examine the association of risk and resilience&#xD;
      factors, including the impact of war zone stressors, with the outcomes of PTSD, major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD), and panic disorder; and (2) determine whether changes in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms or neuropsychological function are associated with subsequent day-to-day&#xD;
      functioning, including health-related functional activities and occupational functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study includes two hierarchical participant sampling frames: (1) a &quot;full sample&quot;&#xD;
      (N=817) for examination of PTSD and related outcomes; and (2) a &quot;neuropsychological&#xD;
      subsample&quot; (N=200) for examination of neuropsychological and functional outcomes. Both&#xD;
      samples are drawn from the anticipated 1149 participants from the original NDHS cohort who&#xD;
      deployed to Iraq and consented to be contacted for future research. The &quot;full sample&quot;&#xD;
      component includes clinician-administered structured psychiatric phone interviews to&#xD;
      determine clinically significant cases of PTSD, major depressive disorder, and panic&#xD;
      disorder; a mail questionnaire survey will provide assessment of posttraumatic stress (PTS)&#xD;
      symptom severity. The &quot;neuropsychological sample&quot; component includes in-person&#xD;
      performance-based assessment of neuropsychological outcomes, shown previously to be affected&#xD;
      by deployment to Iraq. In addition, participants in the neuropsychological sample will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires relevant to health-related functional impact and occupational&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of the study is 5.5 years, including a 6 month start-up period, 42&#xD;
      months to locate, contact, and complete assessments on participants, 6 months to lock and&#xD;
      close the database, and 12 months to complete the primary and secondary analyses. The&#xD;
      attributes of the established study population, in combination with the scope of the proposed&#xD;
      work, offer a unique opportunity to answer scientific questions with direct relevance to&#xD;
      healthcare policy for returning OIF Veterans. Specifically, this study can 1) identify&#xD;
      quantifiable and objective measures associated with subsequent outcome and functioning, 2)&#xD;
      determine early potentially modifiable factors that may be used to promote resilience, 3)&#xD;
      optimize treatment &quot;windows,&quot; and 4) help project future resource allocation based on the&#xD;
      frequency and impact of the mental health problems identified.&#xD;
