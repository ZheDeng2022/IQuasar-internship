      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of children to an experimental&#xD;
      malaria vaccine called AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) + CPG 7909. Malaria is an&#xD;
      infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that is spread by&#xD;
      certain kinds of mosquitoes. It affects at least 300 million people worldwide each year, with&#xD;
      more than 1 million deaths, mostly among children less than 5 years of age in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Malaria is the leading cause of death and illness among the general population of&#xD;
      Mali in West Africa. Increasing drug resistance to P. falciparum and widespread resistance of&#xD;
      mosquitoes to pesticides are reducing the ability to control the disease through these&#xD;
      strategies. AMA1 C1 is made from a synthetic protein similar to a P. falciparum protein. It&#xD;
      is combined with Alhydrogel and CPG 7909, substances added to vaccines to make them work&#xD;
      better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 1 and 4 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali, and are in general good&#xD;
      health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections (shots) of either AMA1-C1 or a&#xD;
      control rabies inactivated vaccine called Imovax® (Registered Trademark). The shots are given&#xD;
      in the thigh muscle on study days 0, 56 and 180. After each shot, participants are observed&#xD;
      in the clinic for 30 minutes. They return to the clinic for a physical examination six or&#xD;
      seven times between each shot and then four more times over a 9-month period after the last&#xD;
      shot. Blood samples are drawn at several of these visits to check for side effects of the&#xD;
      vaccine and to measure the response to it. The total duration of the study is 21 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is responsible for at least 300 million acute&#xD;
      cases of malaria each year, with more than 1 million deaths. Approximately 90 percent of&#xD;
      these deaths, the majority in children under 5 years of age, occur in Africa due to infection&#xD;
      with Plasmodium falciparum. Morbidity and mortality caused by malaria also has significant&#xD;
      direct and indirect costs on the economic development of the endemic countries. It is&#xD;
      estimated that malaria accounts for 40 percent of public health expenditures, more than 30&#xD;
      percent of inpatient admissions, and approximately 50 percent of outpatient visits in some&#xD;
      African countries. These factors, as well as growing drug resistance of the parasite,&#xD;
      widespread resistance of mosquitoes to insecticide, and increased human travel necessitate&#xD;
      the need for new approaches to malaria control and eradication. A vaccine that could reduce&#xD;
      both mortality and morbidity secondary to Plasmodium falciparum infection would be a valuable&#xD;
      resource in the fight against this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over time, people living in endemic areas develop natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      as a result of repeated infection. Consequently, children who survive to 7 to 10 years of age&#xD;
      rarely succumb to life-threatening disease despite frequent infection. This acquired immunity&#xD;
      is mediated in part by blood-stage parasite-specific antibodies. Thus, parasite proteins&#xD;
      expressed during the blood-stage have been proposed to be good candidates for inclusion in a&#xD;
      vaccine. The purpose of a blood-stage vaccine is to elicit immune responses that either&#xD;
      destroy the parasite in the blood stream or inhibit the parasite from infecting red blood&#xD;
      cells, thus reducing or preventing complications of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens have been identified as promising&#xD;
      blood-stage vaccine candidates, including Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1). The precise role&#xD;
      of AMA1 in the parasite is unknown; however, it is critical in the erythrocyte invasion&#xD;
      process across divergent Plasmodium species and for blood-stage multiplication of the&#xD;
      parasite. Recent analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum proteome detected expression of AMA1&#xD;
      in the sporozoite stage and suggests an additional role for AMA1 during the liver-stage&#xD;
      invasion. Therefore, an immune response against AMA1 may have an effect on liver-stage&#xD;
      parasites as well as having an impact on blood-stage parasites, thus protecting the host by&#xD;
      multiple immune mechanisms. Human and animal anti-AMA1 antibodies inhibit merozoite invasion&#xD;
      in vitro and correlate with protection against parasite challenge in animal models. T-cells&#xD;
      specific for Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 have also been demonstrated in individuals living in&#xD;
      endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 68 known amino acid polymorphisms of AMA1 have been demonstrated, and animal studies&#xD;
      have shown that the polymorphisms in AMA1 are not immunologically silent. The combination of&#xD;
      two or more divergent AMA1 sequences within a single vaccine formulation may reduce evasion&#xD;
      of the host immune response by some Plasmodium falciparum field isolates.&#xD;
