  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      bioequivalence and safety of Hospira Glucagon for Injection and GlucaGen® in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypoglycemia, low blood sugar&#xD;
      levels, in patients with diabetes. It primarily functions as a counter-regulatory hormone by&#xD;
      opposing the actions of insulin to maintain blood glucose levels. A major problem for&#xD;
      diabetic patients with hypoglycemia is the development of defective counter regulatory&#xD;
      responses including reduced or absent glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. Mayne Glucagon for&#xD;
      Injection has been developed as an alternative to currently marketed products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of exogenous glucagon i.e., not produced in the body, has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of low blood sugar in patients with diabetes. Mayne has developed&#xD;
      a product, Glucagon for Injection, which is an alternative to currently marketed products.&#xD;
      The only difference is the source of the active ingredient. The formulation, routes of&#xD;
      administration, dosage regimen and indications of Mayne Glucagon for Injection are identical&#xD;
      to those currently registered for the marketed product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 28 healthy volunteers will be recruited into this study at one investigational&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

             females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of ≥ 500 mL in the previous 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to Glucagon and/or any excipients&#xD;

             over-the-counter medicines within 5 days of dosing except those deemed by the&#xD;
             investigator not to interfere with the outcome of the study. Vitamins, minerals and&#xD;
             nutritional supplements may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives will be permitted.&#xD;
