    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      quetiapine and valproate used as monotherapy in the treatment of mania in patients&#xD;
      hospitalised for an acute manic episode. After given of informed consent and undergoing&#xD;
      screening procedures, the patients will be randomised into quetiapine or valproate group on&#xD;
      Day 1. The efficacy of study treatment on symptoms of mania will be assessed at Day 28.&#xD;
      Patients will not permitted to use any psychoactive or antipsychotic medications throughout&#xD;
      the study period other than those expressly permitted by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each centre, the same individual will administer a specific psychiatric assessment for a&#xD;
      patient at all study visits in order to reduce variability in rating scale scoring. Before&#xD;
      the initiation of the study, a consistency assessment will be done among the investigators&#xD;
      who conduct the scale assessment in each centre.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for using the quetiapine to treat patients with acute mania is multifold. A&#xD;
      potential major advantage for quetiapine is its demonstrated tolerability. Because of the low&#xD;
      incidence of EPS, quetiapine should be better tolerated than other antipsychotic medications&#xD;
      in this sensitive patient population. The limited potential for weight gain and prolactin&#xD;
      elevation may promote long-term treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of quetiapine alone or adjunctive with mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      mania in patients with bipolar disorder has been confirmed through 4 phase III clinical&#xD;
      trials (8,9). Based on the results of these clinical trials, the use of Seroquel in the acute&#xD;
      mania of bipolar disorder has been approved in US, UK and other major markets in Europe.&#xD;
      Quetiapine is also been recommended as alternative therapy for acute mania treatment in the&#xD;
      practice guideline (10). The present study is to assess the effectiveness of quetiapine and&#xD;
      valproate in the treatment of Chinese patients with acute mania over a treatment period of 4&#xD;
      weeks. Primary objective The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of quetiapine fumarate used as monotherapy in the treatment of symptoms of acute mania in&#xD;
      patients with bipolar disorder, by evaluation of the change from baseline in YMRS total score&#xD;
      at Day 28 (LOCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat symptoms in patients with&#xD;
           acute mania by evaluation of YMRS/CGI response rate at Day 28 (LOCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to improve clinical status in&#xD;
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in CGI-S score at Day 28&#xD;
           (LOCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat depressive symptoms in&#xD;
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in MADRS total score at&#xD;
           Day 28 (LOCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat psychotic symptoms in&#xD;
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in PANSS total score at&#xD;
           Day 28 (LOCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety and tolerability of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat symptoms in&#xD;
           patients with acute mania&#xD;
