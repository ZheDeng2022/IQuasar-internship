  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a French multicenter double blind randomized controlled trial, the main objective is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that, after 6 months of oral anticoagulation for a first episode of idiopathic&#xD;
      proximal deep vein thrombosis, 18 months of warfarin therapy is associated with a lower&#xD;
      cumulative risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding in comparison with that on 18 months of&#xD;
      placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to determine the risk of recurrent VTE after 6&#xD;
      months of warfarin therapy and the presence or the absence of residual lung scan perfusion&#xD;
      defect and the persistence or not of elevated D-dimer test; and (2), to determine the impact&#xD;
      of extended duration of anticoagulation on the risk of VTE after stopping anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy on a follow-up of 2 years.&#xD;

      Rational: After 3 or 6 months of oral anticoagulation for an episode of acute venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of recurrent VTE is high (10 to 15% per year) in comparison&#xD;
      with a low risk of recurrence if VTE was provoked by a major transient risk factor such as&#xD;
      recent surgery (3% per year) independently of the initial presentation (deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      or pulmonary embolism). After a first episode of idiopathic VTE, 3 months of anticoagulation&#xD;
      is associated with a very high risk of recurrence (27% per year); however, the benefit-risk&#xD;
      of extended duration of anticoagulation (1 to 2 years) remains uncertain, mainly in relation&#xD;
      with an increased risk of anticoagulant related bleeding. Therefore, the last ACCP conference&#xD;
      group recommended 6 months of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of idiopathic&#xD;
      VTE. However, this recommendation is likely to be inadequate for at least two main reasons:&#xD;
      (1) no studies compared 2 years to 6 months of anticoagulation after idiopathic VTE; and (2),&#xD;
      if the frequency of recurrent VTE is similar after deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, however, the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE is higher after pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      (12%) than after deep vein thrombosis (5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective : the main objective is to demonstrate that, after 6 months of oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      for a first episode of idiopathic proximal deep vein thrombosis, 18 months of warfarin&#xD;
      therapy is associated with a lower cumulative risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding in&#xD;
      comparison with that on 18 months of placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to determine&#xD;
      the risk of recurrent VTE after 6 months of warfarin therapy and the presence or the absence&#xD;
      of residual lung scan perfusion defect and the persistence or not of elevated D-dimer test;&#xD;
      and (2), to determine the impact of extended duration of anticoagulation on the risk of VTE&#xD;
      after stopping anticoagulant therapy on a follow-up of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method : French multicenter double blind randomized controlled trial. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and deep vein thrombosis diagnostic criteria have been defined. After completing 6&#xD;
      months of oral anticoagulation, a leg ultrasound and D-dimer testing are performed; the&#xD;
      investigators and the patients will be unaware of the results of these tests. Then, patients&#xD;
      are randomized to receive 18 months of warfarin therapy or 18 months of placebo (the dose of&#xD;
      placebo will be adapted according to false computer generated INR). The investigators, the&#xD;
      radiologists and the patients are blinded of the treatment allocation. The project has been&#xD;
      accepted by national ethical committee and written consent will be obtained from all included&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required number of patients: the expected cumulative frequency of recurrent VTE and major&#xD;
      bleeding over 18 months is 4.5% while on warfarin therapy and 16% while on placebo. For a α&#xD;
      risk of 5% (to falsely conclude to a true difference) and a β risk of 10% (to falsely&#xD;
      conclude to an absence of difference), 178 patients per group should be included. As 5% of&#xD;
      patients are expected to be loss, a total of 374 patients is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: about 50 patients per year are hospitalized in our department of medicine in&#xD;
      Brest for an acute episode of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis. Four additional centers will&#xD;
      participate to the study and have a similar recruitment: HEGP (Pr Meyer, Dr Sanchez), CHU&#xD;
      Antoine Béclère (Dr Parent, Pr Simmoneau), CHU Saint Etienne (Pr Mismetti, Pr Décousus), CHU&#xD;
      Grenoble (Pr Pison, Pr Carpentier). The study will be coordinated by the Clinical Center of&#xD;
      Investigation of Brest Hospital; &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; INR will be generated by the clinic of&#xD;
      anticoagulant of &quot;Ile de France&quot; (Dr Cambus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical implications: the first consequence of the study is to demonstrate that 6 months of&#xD;
      warfarin therapy is inadequate and should be continued for at least 18 additional months&#xD;
      after a first episode of idiopathic proximal deep vein thrombosis. This study has also the&#xD;
      potential to confirm or not the contribution of ultrasound of lower limb and D-dimer testing&#xD;
      to appreciate the risk of recurrent VTE after stopping anticoagulant therapy. Lastly, the&#xD;
      medical economical impact of such therapeutic management will be evaluated.&#xD;
