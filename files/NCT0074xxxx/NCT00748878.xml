      Platelet transfusions are routinely administered during neonatal ECMO, with an average of 1.3&#xD;
      platelet transfusions per day being administered while a patient is undergoing ECMO&#xD;
      treatment. The cause of thrombocytopenia during ECMO largely involves platelet adherence to&#xD;
      the oxygenator membrane. Platelet transfusions carry risks such as infections with bacteria&#xD;
      or yeast, and development or worsening of pulmonary hypertension. It is likely that if fewer&#xD;
      platelet transfusions can be administered during the ECMO run, the cumulative adverse effects&#xD;
      of platelet transfusions would diminish and patient outcomes improve. In order to better&#xD;
      understand platelet function during ECMO, the investigators plan to serially determine the&#xD;
      circulating platelet mass, plasma platelet factor 4 concentration, megakaryocyte mass&#xD;
      (estimated by plasma thrombopoietin concentration), and platelet function as quantified by&#xD;
      PFA100. Any patient on ECMO will be eligible for this pilot study of 5 patients. By&#xD;
      understanding changes in platelet function, we hope to design a future study that may modify&#xD;
      the frequency or need for platelet transfusions during ECMO.&#xD;

      Platelet transfusions are routinely administered during neonatal ECMO, with an average of 1.3&#xD;
      platelet transfusions per day being administered while a patient is undergoing ECMO&#xD;
      treatment.1 In general, a platelet transfusion is ordered for a patient on ECMO if the&#xD;
      platelet count falls below 100,000/uL in order to prevent generalized hemorrhaging.1,2 The&#xD;
      cause of thrombocytopenia during ECMO largely involves platelet adherence to the oxygenator&#xD;
      membrane,3 but other mechanisms are also likely to be involved.4 Platelet transfusions carry&#xD;
      risks as well as benefits.5 Infections with bacteria or yeast are the most commonly reported&#xD;
      complications of platelet transfusions,6,7 but with multiple platelet transfusions the&#xD;
      development or worsening of pulmonary hypertension may be another common adverse effect.8,9&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension can be the result of administering biologically active&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory proteins (known to be present in platelet transfusions) into the venous&#xD;
      circulation. Of note, the first capillary bed encountered will be within the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that if fewer platelet transfusions could safely be administered during the ECMO&#xD;
      run, the cumulative adverse effects of platelet transfusions would diminish and thereby&#xD;
      patient outcomes might improve.&#xD;
