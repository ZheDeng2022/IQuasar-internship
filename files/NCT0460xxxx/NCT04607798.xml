  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the use of multi-polar radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electro-magnetic&#xD;
      fields (PEMF) energies for the treatment of symptoms related to genitourinary syndrome of&#xD;
      menopause (GSM)/vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). All subjects will receive a total of three&#xD;
      internal treatments at four week intervals. Subjects will be followed up at one and four&#xD;
      months after treatment is complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Largely observed in the post-menopausal population, a significant subset of pre-menopausal&#xD;
      and peri-menopausal women are also affected by symptoms associated with GSM, the etiology&#xD;
      being similar in that there is an interruption in normal estrogen production resulting in a&#xD;
      hypoestrogenic state. Symptoms related to GSM include vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication,&#xD;
      decreased vaginal elasticity, irritation and discomfort of the vaginal and vulvar tissues in&#xD;
      general that can affect sexual health. Traditional treatments, such as hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy (HRT), are often the treatment of choice however come with potential risks and many&#xD;
      women are not suitable candidates, or have contraindications to its use. Development of new&#xD;
      technologies to address these concerns is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RF energy-based treatment for symptoms of GSM has been used with success to promote&#xD;
      elasticity restoration and improve moisture of the vaginal mucosa, and is well established in&#xD;
      literature for the treatment of facial and neck laxity, stress urinary incontinence and skin&#xD;
      tightening of tissue. Several studies show favorable results with improvement of vaginal&#xD;
      laxity and sexual function with RF treatment. The addition of pulsed electromagnetic field&#xD;
      (PEMF) energy to multi-polar RF therapy has also been shown to enhance the results of the RF&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RF therapy has already been reported to be successful in treatment of symptoms related to&#xD;
      elasticity restoration and improve moisture of the vaginal mucosa. This study will&#xD;
      investigate whether adding PEMF to RF therapy is safe and efficacious for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptoms related to GSM and sexual health.&#xD;
