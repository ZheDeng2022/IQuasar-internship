    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study on high risk patients due to frailty and comorbidity who&#xD;
      have early stage colon cancer (UICC 1). We will use a novel resection technique with expected&#xD;
      less risk of complications called the Combined Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS).&#xD;
      After the histopathologic evaluation. Patients will be placed in either low risk or high risk&#xD;
      group. Depending on this, they will be followed for 3 years or referred to standard resection&#xD;

&#xD;
      Background Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in Europe and the third most&#xD;
      common cancer worldwide. The introduction of screening programs for colorectal cancer has&#xD;
      resulted in an increased detection and incidence of early cancers (T1-T2). Early cancers are&#xD;
      seen in 54% of the patients in the screening programs compared with 25 % of symptomatic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality rates following elective colorectal surgery range between 2.5-6% and increase for&#xD;
      the elderly and frail patient regardless of T-stage. Nationwide morbidity rates are 16%, with&#xD;
      approximately half of these patients requiring re-operation. The elderly patients have&#xD;
      decreased 1-year survival leading to decreased cancer specific survival. Postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity leads to decreased 3 year disease free survival and overall 5-year survival&#xD;
      regardless of recurrence. Further, postoperative altered bowel function, chronic pain, and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life affect many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous different scoring systems exist to assess patient frailty. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      regardless which definition of frailty is used, the patients have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      adverse outcomes. Performance Status (PS) is a simple and easy to use scoring system to&#xD;
      assess frailty. Data from DCCG has shown that performance status is independently associated&#xD;
      with postoperative complications and death following surgery for colorectal cancer and that&#xD;
      there is a &quot;dose-response&quot; relationship with increased performance score leading to higher&#xD;
      1-year mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk for lymph node metastases is 8.6 % and 22 % for T1 and T2 colon cancer respectively&#xD;
      and is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. These&#xD;
      histopathologic high-risk features include low tumor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion&#xD;
      and high grade tumor budding. The presence of these features is independently related to&#xD;
      increased risk of lymph node metastasis. If a T1 or T2 tumor has no high risk features, the&#xD;
      risk of lymph node metastasis has been reported to be 1,2% and 3,8%respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) annual report in 2017, there was 253&#xD;
      T1 and 325 T2 colon cancers. Out of these there were 84,3% and 82,9% N0 respectively. This&#xD;
      indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer (ie. T1 and T2) have no&#xD;
      benefit of additional oncological resection besides tumor excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low risk of lymph node metastases in early colon cancer, and the substantial risk&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality, local excision of the tumor could be an option in selected high&#xD;
      risk patients (with subsequent bowel resection if final pathological evaluation shows&#xD;
      presence of high-risk histopathological characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Combined Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) is a novel hybrid procedure that&#xD;
      enables large local excisions of the colon without segmental resection. It is used in some&#xD;
      centers for local resections of large benign polyps not resectable by advanced endoscopic&#xD;
      techniques alone such as Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CELS procedure Combined Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgery covers a variety of endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures with simultaneous laparoscopic view and laparoscopic procedures with simultaneous&#xD;
      endoscopic view. In our study we focus exclusively on laparoscopic resection guided by&#xD;
      endoscopic view - an excision biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main surgical advantage in this procedure is the ability to view the colon intra- and&#xD;
      extraluminally simultaneously. The laparoscopic approach enables manipulation and&#xD;
      mobilization of the colon, while the endoscopic view secures that the resection is complete&#xD;
      and not overlapping the ileac valve or creating stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the traditional segmental oncological colon resection, the CELS resection is a&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedure and assumed leading to a reduced surgical stress response. A RCT&#xD;
      has compared CELS with right sided hemicolectomy and shown, shorter operating time, less&#xD;
      intravenous fluid treatment, faster time to pass stool and shorter length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CELS procedure has been evaluated both in retrospective and prospective randomized trials&#xD;
      in patients with benign lesions not suitable for endoscopic resection, and is shown to be a&#xD;
      safe procedure with comparable complication rates, but shorter convalescence and lower cost.&#xD;
      The question is if the CELS procedure is a safe resection in the malignant tumor, as in the&#xD;
      benign tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to show if the CELS can be used for patients diagnosed with an&#xD;
      early colon cancer and in high risk of operative morbidity and mortality after conventional&#xD;
      resection due to comorbidity and frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The primary aim of this study is to assess feasibility and safety in high risk patients&#xD;
      treated with CELS resection with early colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a non-randomized prospective feasibility study conducted at the Department of&#xD;
      Surgery, Zealand University Hospital, Herlev University Hospital, Hvidovre University&#xD;
      Hospital and Bispebjerg University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected and stored online at easytrial.net and physically at the&#xD;
      Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power analysis We plan to include 25 high risk patients with early colon cancer&#xD;
      in the study. Based on data from DCCG concerning clinical tumor stage and comorbidity&#xD;
      assessments, we expect 150 eligible patients a year in the described region of Denmark. The&#xD;
      feasibility in the study requires that we include patients with different tumor locations&#xD;
      throughout the colon. We believe that this will be obtained with 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has started 1/3 2020 and is expected to end on the 28/2 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has been referred to the surgical department after a colonoscopy has revealed a&#xD;
      lesion in the colon not suitable for local endoscopic treatment and is either with endoscopic&#xD;
      suspicion of being a cancer or there is a histological diagnosis. Usual staging will be&#xD;
      performed with contrast enhanced CT scan of the thorax and abdomen. The patient will&#xD;
      discussed at a MDT (Multidisciplinary Team) conference, prior to the first outpatient visit.&#xD;
      The MDT will finally decide if the patient is a candidate for CELS resection. The patients&#xD;
      that are included at Herlev, Hvidovre and Bispebjerg University Hospitals are reassessed at&#xD;
      the MDT conference at Køge. Here it will finally be decided if the patient is suited for CELS&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient meets the inclusion criteria, the patient is informed of the clinical trial&#xD;
      orally and with written information by a medical assistant or consultant. The patient is&#xD;
      booked and prepared for the procedure decided at the ambulatory visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will afterwards be contacted by one of the principal investigators and given more&#xD;
      detailed information. The informed consent is signed by the patient as described under&#xD;
      &quot;guidelines for obtaining well informed consent&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient does not wish to participate, the patient is booked for the standard procedure&#xD;
      at the regional hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CELS procedure After introduction of general anesthesia, an orogastric tube and a foley&#xD;
      catheter is placed. After introduction of the colonic endoscope, the abdomen is draped in&#xD;
      sterile fashion. Then an umbilical camera port is inserted and additional ports are placed&#xD;
      according to the location of the tumor. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis is administered&#xD;
      intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor is identified by the endoscopist. A 60mm. endo-GIA is inserted and the tumor is&#xD;
      resected and placed in a bag intraabdominally and removed trough the umbilical port. The&#xD;
      resection is evaluated intra- and extraluminally to ensure sufficiency and hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscope is retracted with simultaneous desufflation. The additional laparoscopic&#xD;
      ports are removed and the incisions closed while hemostasis is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation, the patient is referred to the surgical ward in an enhanced recovery&#xD;
      setting. The patient is discharged following assessment by colorectal surgeon typically the&#xD;
      same or next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is referred to the surgical outpatient unit to receive the pathological&#xD;
      assessment of the tumor and to inform of and schedule the further treatment or follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 and 90 days, the patient will be contacted by telephone by the principal&#xD;
      investigator for a follow up interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological assessment After the CELS resection, the tumor is sent as a malignant tumor&#xD;
      specimen without conservation and as a whole resection to the Department of Pathology,&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital Roskilde. Here it is cast as a whole specimen and cut into&#xD;
      relevant slides and these are evaluated. The procedure for the pathological preparation and&#xD;
      assessment is already implemented in the clinics standard operating procedure. After the&#xD;
      assessment of the tumor, the tumor is defined as &quot;high-risk&quot; or &quot;low risk&quot;. This defines the&#xD;
      further follow up and treatment of the patient. (For details see &quot;Patient flow chart&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When we have included all 25 patients, the slides of the tumors are scanned and sent as&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymized photos to the Department of Pathology, Leeds University for reassessment by&#xD;
      Professor Philip Quirke and Dr. Scarlet Brockmoeller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological assessment is hereby evaluated as &quot;consensus&quot;. The department of Pathology,&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital Roskilde will have the final decision in case there is not&#xD;
      consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CELS patients with low risk histopathology will follow a watchful waiting (WW) program&#xD;
      consisting of colonoscopy after 3 and 12 months, CT scans at 6, 12 and 36 months and blood&#xD;
      sampling for circulating tumor cell DNA (CT-DNA) after 3, 6, 12 and 36 months. This is more&#xD;
      intense than the follow up program for locally resected malignant polyps. After 1 year, the&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be after every 5 years until the patient reaches 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CELS patients with high risk histopathology will be referred to standard resection and&#xD;
      subsequently placed in the regular control group for colonic cancer defined by DCCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical and practical experiences The surgical department at Zealand University Hospital&#xD;
      Køge, performs CELS procedures on a regularly monthly basis on benign lesions. At the moment&#xD;
      more than 70 CELS procedures have been performed at the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department has over 2 years of experience with assessment of CELS operability in&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and side effects The literature concerning CELS for benign lesions show a general&#xD;
      complications risk of approximately 5%. This covers both medical and surgical complications.&#xD;
      The most frequent complication is pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Of the surgical&#xD;
      complications, wound/port site infection is the most frequent. Bleeding from intestinal&#xD;
      resection or skin incisions and stapling insufficiency leading to intraabdominal abscess&#xD;
      formation has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CELS procedure is regarded as a safe and low risk procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety issues With regard to the benign lesions, the literature has reported 0-13% risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence. No study has reported the recurrence for malignant resection with CELS&#xD;
      technique. The safety of the oncological resection is of great importance in this study.&#xD;
      Prior to the study an independent safety committee is formed by 2 external surgeons and 1&#xD;
      external pathologist. Every patient with a R1/R2 section or a severe complication&#xD;
      (Clavian-Dindo≥3b) is evaluated in the committee with regard to discussion of terminating the&#xD;
      study. The pathologist will review the specimen as a second opinion. The surgeons will&#xD;
      evaluate the basis for decision of CELS resection, surgical procedure and postoperative&#xD;
      treatment to ensure proper treatment. The evaluations are coordinated by the primary&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 4 patients have a R1/R2 resection, the study will automatically be terminated or&#xD;
      if we experience more than 3 local recurrences with adenocarcinoma the study will be&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives If this study proves that CELS is a safe and feasible treatment, the next study&#xD;
      will be a randomized controlled trial to prove its efficacy in high risk patients. It could&#xD;
      be the future treatment of patients with high risk morbidity and early colon cancer following&#xD;
      the principles of personalized surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of the results Results will be presented at major endoscopy and surgery&#xD;
      meetings and at national and international relevant congresses. The study results will be&#xD;
      submitted for publication in international peer reviewed scientific journals with Morten&#xD;
      Hartwig as the first author. All co-authors will adhere to the Vancouver rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects The study is approved by the National Committee on Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      (Den Nationale Videnskabsetiske Komité) (SJ-795) and reported to the Data Protection Agency&#xD;
      (Datatilsynet). The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Research subjects will&#xD;
      have to give informed consent, based on written and oral information before inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be informed about any side-effects, risks or unplanned events that&#xD;
      might occur during the implementation of the study. The minimal risks will be outweighed by&#xD;
      the potential implications for future patient care. The study will be carried out with&#xD;
      respect to the mental and physical integrity of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines in obtaining informed consent from participants Well informed signed consent from&#xD;
      the research subjects is an essential criterion for inclusion in the trial. Both written and&#xD;
      oral information will be provided to each candidate to the study by either the chief&#xD;
      investigator or other health care persons that are qualified in explaining the project in&#xD;
      detail. The patient will be made aware of the possibility of a second person (e.g. caregiver,&#xD;
      relative) to be present at the interview. The interview will take place in a private room in&#xD;
      order to provide an uninterrupted communication. The detailed information on the project will&#xD;
      be covered, in oral and written form, at the interview, including an easy-to-read&#xD;
      presentation of the project with its predictable risks and side-effects, expected outcomes&#xD;
      and benefits for the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be entitled to some reflection time before giving consent (24-48 hours),&#xD;
      taking care that the time limit stipulated will not interfere with the routine clinical&#xD;
      investigations and treatments of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsors The research project is initiated by, Ismail Gögenur, MD, DMSc. The study will be&#xD;
      funded through local and national funds.&#xD;
