  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Confinement disrupts social habits, the absence of professional activity or teleworking&#xD;
      creates the possibility for individuals to work and/or sleep at times that are most&#xD;
      convenient for them. Investigators hypothesize that subjects with a history of obesity will&#xD;
      tend, during confinement, to return to their spontaneous chronotype. The evolution of&#xD;
      chronotypes between the pre-confinement period and during confinement will allow to measure&#xD;
      the percentage of subjects who are not usually living according to their spontaneous&#xD;
      chronotype, due to social constraints. Finally, we wish to retrospectively question the&#xD;
      subjects on the impact of confinement on their eating habits, physical activity, mood,&#xD;
      employment, and so on.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep patterns, evaluated in hunter-gatherer populations, show that without artificial&#xD;
      interference, sleep is of course concomitant with the decrease in luminosity, but is also&#xD;
      regulated by the outside temperature. Light pollution from night lighting and artificially&#xD;
      regulated temperature contribute to distancing us from these physiological signals. In&#xD;
      addition, the leisure activities linked to the screens encourage a voluntary restriction of&#xD;
      sleep manifested by a later bedtime, whereas social constraints always impose the time of&#xD;
      getting up. Sleep debt accumulates during the week and compensates for non-working days&#xD;
      inducing a social jet lag of small amplitude, but repeated each week. Subjects who&#xD;
      spontaneously or habitually develop a late chronotype (i.e. a propensity to be a &quot;late&#xD;
      sleeper, late riser&quot;) are the most exposed to this social jetlag between days worked when the&#xD;
      sleep debt accumulates and days off when the sleep debt compensates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been widely demonstrated that a short sleep duration promotes weight gain. Subjects&#xD;
      with a late chronotype associate a short sleep duration on days when they work and a&#xD;
      significant social jetlag on days when they do not work. This late chronotype is associated&#xD;
      with unfavourable eating behaviour and more emotional eating and constitutes a risk of&#xD;
      developing metabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confinement disrupts social habits: lack of work activity or teleworking creates the&#xD;
      possibility for individuals to work and/or sleep at times that are most convenient for them.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that subjects with a history of obesity will have tended, during&#xD;
      confinement, to return to their spontaneous chronotype. The evolution of chronotypes between&#xD;
      the pre-confinement period and during confinement will allow to measure the percentage of&#xD;
      subjects who are not usually living according to their spontaneous chronotype, due to social&#xD;
      constraints. Finally, we wish to retrospectively question the subjects on the impact of&#xD;
      confinement on their eating habits, physical activity, mood and employment.&#xD;
