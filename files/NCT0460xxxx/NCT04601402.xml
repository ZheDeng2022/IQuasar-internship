      This is a phase I/Ib, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, biological and clinical activities of GEN-001&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on at least&#xD;
      two lines of approved therapy for their histological subtypes which includes an anti-PD-1 or&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 based therapy (as mono or combination), when administered as combined with&#xD;
