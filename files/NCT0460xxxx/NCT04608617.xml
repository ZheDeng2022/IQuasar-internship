  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Viz LVO in hospital systems with&#xD;
      non-interventional and interventional (spoke and hub) stroke centers on the timing and&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke indicated for mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized observational study of acute ischemic stroke patients&#xD;
      whose CTA scans are analyzed by Viz LVO to support clinicians in making stroke triage&#xD;
      decisions,. The study results will be compared to a cohort from enrolling centers prior to&#xD;
      Viz LVO implementation that will serve as a historical control. Data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from the time of presentation through 90 days post discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients undergoing imaging for a suspected LVO acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      The post-Viz LVO intervention group will consist of patients who either presented to or&#xD;
      underwent transfer to an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, following&#xD;
      image analysis by Viz LVO. Data will be collected retrospectively on consecutive patients&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria from the date of implementation up to 5 years post&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of patients who either presented to or underwent transfer to&#xD;
      an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, for evaluation prior to the&#xD;
      implementation of Viz LVO. Data will be collected on consecutive patients from one day prior&#xD;
      to implementation, back as far as 2 years prior to implementation&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5. A separate category of 6 is usually added for patients who expire. A score of 0 is a patient with no residual symptoms. Scores increase with severity to 5 which equals severe disability.</description>

    <measure>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>On date of discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored on a 3- to 5-point scale, with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. Scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Viz LVO (De Novo Number DEN170073)</intervention_name>
    <description>Viz LVO is a notification-only, parallel workflow tool for use by hospital networks and trained clinicians to identify and communicate images of specific patients to a specialist, independent of standard of care workflow.&#xD;
Viz LVO uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze images for findings suggestive of a pre-specified clinical condition and to notify an appropriate medical specialist of these findings in parallel to standard of care image interpretation. Identification of suspected findings is not for diagnostic use beyond notification. Specifically, the device analyzes CT angiogram images of the brain acquired in the acute setting and sends notifications to a neurovascular specialist that a suspected large vessel occlusion has been identified and recommends review of those images. Images can be previewed through a mobile application.</description>
