  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past thirty years, risk of road traffic accidents has decreased but remains high and&#xD;
      accounts for 44% of fatal work-related accidents for commuting and mission-related accidents.&#xD;
      The aims of this study were to estimate the overall incidence of commuting accidents for&#xD;
      non-physician professionals in a major university hospital and by gender and different&#xD;
      professional categories, and to assess its evolution over a 5-year period. A descriptive&#xD;
      analysis was performed on 390 commuting accidents from 2012 to 2016 extracted from the&#xD;
      university hospital's occupational health service.&#xD;

    <description>Incidence of commuting accidents according to sex, occupational categories and year of accident.&#xD;
The evolution of the number of accidents over the years was assessed by the Cochran-Armitage ChiÂ² trend test. Crude Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for the association of commuting accident with respectively sex, occupational categories and years were estimated on log-binomial regression using the using the GENMOD procedure in the SAS statistical package (version 9.4) with the DIST=BINOMIAL and LINK=LOG options.</description>
