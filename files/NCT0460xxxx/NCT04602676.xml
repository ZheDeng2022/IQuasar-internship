      This is a randomized crossover study, where clinicians will be randomized to periods where&#xD;
      they will use a rehydration calculator application with or without the Diarrheal Etiology&#xD;
      Prediction (DEP) algorithm. The crossover will include a washout period to reduce carryover&#xD;
      effect. The study will be conducted over a 9-week period. The Investigators will use a random&#xD;
      number generator to randomize clinicians to DEP (use of the etiology calculator) or control&#xD;
      arm (use of a previously-tested rehydration calculator) within site for the first 4 weeks.&#xD;
      After the first 4 weeks, there will be 1-week washout period without decision support, after&#xD;
      which each clinician will cross-over to the other arm for the next 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will enroll diarrhea-treating clinicians who treat children presenting with&#xD;
      acute diarrhea at sites in Bangladesh and Mali. Utah investigators will only analyze&#xD;
      de-identified data provided by our collaborators in Bangladesh and Mali.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide,&#xD;
      with an estimated one billion cases and 500,000 deaths annually. While the majority of deaths&#xD;
      due to diarrhoea occur in lower-income countries, infectious diarrhoea remains a significant&#xD;
      problem in high-income countries. Aside from the immediate morbidity, potential long-term&#xD;
      sequelae of diarrhoea in children in low-resource settings include malnutrition, growth&#xD;
      faltering, and deficits in cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the cornerstone of diarrhoeal disease management in children is rehydration, a number&#xD;
      of other management decisions, including the use of antibiotics and laboratory testing, may&#xD;
      impact the course of disease. Overuse of antibiotics may cause side-effects and lead to&#xD;
      increased antimicrobial resistance in the community. Underuse of antimicrobials for some&#xD;
      bacterial and protozoal pathogens may lead to prolonged duration of illness and facilitate&#xD;
      transmission. This can result in increased days of school or parental work missed, and among&#xD;
      malnourished children in resource-poor settings, potential for growth faltering or death.&#xD;
      Overuse of laboratory testing may have financial impact on both the patient and the&#xD;
      healthcare system, and underuse may delay appropriate therapy or prevent recognition of&#xD;
      outbreaks. Thus, accurate and cost-effective determination of diarrhoea etiology is important&#xD;
      for proper case management in children and for public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) help clinicians interpret clinical information and can&#xD;
      improve decision making. A recent systematic review showed that out of 137 studies of&#xD;
      conditions for which clinical prediction rules have been developed for children only 2 were&#xD;
      for diarrhoea, both of which are for the assessment of dehydration. Similarly, the majority&#xD;
      of available guidelines for pediatric diarrhoea are focused on the route, timing, and choice&#xD;
      of fluids for rehydration. A few studies in the past 30 years studied the use of clinical&#xD;
      predictors to estimate the probability of a bacterial cause of diarrhoea. However, these&#xD;
      studies were limited by low rates of pathogen identification, small sample sizes, use of a&#xD;
      single study site, and suboptimal prediction performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of guidelines and effective clinical predictors, decisions for use of&#xD;
      antibiotics and laboratory testing are mostly empiric in nature, based on a number of &quot;rules&#xD;
      of thumb&quot; for which evidence is scant. Unfortunately, physician judgment does very poorly to&#xD;
      predict both need for antibiotics and correct type of testing. A recent study of children&#xD;
      presenting to Kenyan hospitals with diarrhoea showed that reliance on dysentery as a proxy&#xD;
      for Shigella infection led to the failure to diagnose Shigellosis in nearly 90% of cases.&#xD;
      Better tools for decision making and evidence-based guidelines regarding use of antibiotics&#xD;
      and laboratory testing in children with diarrhoea are clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of decisions for use of antibiotics in diarrhoeal illnesses are made&#xD;
      empirically. In lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to cost constraints,&#xD;
      etiological diagnosis is rarely made, and a large number (up to 70%) of patients with acute&#xD;
      diarrhoea are prescribed antibiotics. However, in contrast to high resource settings,&#xD;
      bacterial pathogens may be very common in low resource settings. In the multicenter Global&#xD;
      Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) study, the investigators found that detection of Shigella&#xD;
      ranged from 16-78% of children with dysentery and 2-43% of children with watery diarrhoea. In&#xD;
      both high and low resource settings, inappropriate use of antimicrobials leads to unnecessary&#xD;
      toxicity for the individual, increased costs and an increase in antibiotic resistance in the&#xD;
      community. Thus, methods for guiding appropriate use of antibiotics for pediatric diarrhoea&#xD;
      in both high- and low-resource settings are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are decision-making rubrics that help clinicians estimate&#xD;
      the likelihood of a patient outcome. A number of prominent prediction scores have been widely&#xD;
      adopted for clinical use. Examples include the CHADS2 score for stroke risk in patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, the TIMI score for mortality in patients with NSTEMI, and the CURB-65&#xD;
      Score for mortality in community-acquired pneumonia. Clinical prediction rules integrated&#xD;
      into clinical decision-making have the ability to direct clinicians towards more&#xD;
      evidence-based behaviors, resulting in improved care and reduction of costs. CPRs can also&#xD;
      reduce antimicrobial usage, as shown by the use of scores for strep pharyngitis, and linking&#xD;
      CPRs with testing guidance may further reduce antimicrobial usage. Thus, clinical prediction&#xD;
      rules have the potential to help healthcare workers worldwide address clinical uncertainty&#xD;
      and provide improved care for children with diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently use data from GEMS to derive a viral etiology prediction rule&#xD;
      with an internal cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 0.85. The&#xD;
      investigators used a post-test odds formulation method, which takes into account odds from&#xD;
      multiple models or tests. First, using data from GEMS, the investigators trained a logistic&#xD;
      regression model with viral etiology as dependent variable using the five most predictive&#xD;
      clinical variables as independent variables. The investigators then trained models with the&#xD;
      same viral etiology response using both local climate and recent clinical trends as&#xD;
      independent variables. For each model, odds of viral etiology versus other known aetiologies&#xD;
      are generated by estimating the conditional distribution of training predictions using kernel&#xD;
      density estimates. The odds generated for each model are multiplied along with a pre-test&#xD;
      odds to determine an overall odds of a viral etiology. The investigators have now transferred&#xD;
      the calculation of this prediction rule into a smart-phone application, called the Diarrheal&#xD;
      Etiology Prediction (DEP) algorithm. The investigators have used TAC data from the VIDA&#xD;
      (Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa) study to externally validate the DEP algorithm's&#xD;
      ability to predict viral etiology of diarrhea. In this application, our objective is to&#xD;
      determine the acceptability and use of the DEP among clinicians caring for children with&#xD;
      diarrhea.&#xD;
