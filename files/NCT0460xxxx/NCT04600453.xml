  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hospitalized elderly patient is conditioned by a series of circumstances unrelated to the&#xD;
      pathological process itself that caused hospital admission and that usually worsen the&#xD;
      results of hospitalization. In fact, the implementation of care models different from the&#xD;
      traditional ones has shown a clear benefit in the functional results of these patients in the&#xD;
      short and medium term. However, the components of these models that explain these better&#xD;
      results have not been differentially evaluated. Some examples of these circumstances are the&#xD;
      usual orders of absolute rest without any objective criteria for patients who are able to&#xD;
      wander, the perpetuation of continuous fluid therapy, physical and chemical restraints,&#xD;
      unnecessary permanent probes, etc. On numerous occasions, hospitalized elderly patients spend&#xD;
      most of their time in bed, reaching even more than 83% of bedridden compared to 4% of those&#xD;
      who stand up or are walking. The average time that a geriatric patient walks during their&#xD;
      hospitalization ranges from 7 to 43 minutes/day. This population, by having their functional&#xD;
      and physiological reserve reduced, are more vulnerable to the effects, for example, of&#xD;
      bedridden, which range from functional loss or cognitive impairment, to longer stays,&#xD;
      mortality and institutionalization, worse emotional situation, delirium, deconditioning,&#xD;
      aspirations, pressure ulcers, and falls, decreased caloric intake, social isolation, poorer&#xD;
      quality of life, and greater use of health-related resources. This study is a multicenter&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to be conducted in the acute care for elderly (ACE) units of three&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals in Spain - Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN), Hospital Central de la&#xD;
      Cruz Roja de Madrid (HCCRM) and Complejo Hospitalario Universitario of Albacete (CHUA). After&#xD;
      randomization, the research team (physiotherapist, sport science specialist and geriatrician)&#xD;
      will together perform the baseline measurement and follow-up visits of functional,&#xD;
      pharmacological, comorbidity and cognitive assessment, as well as of mobility and strength&#xD;
      evaluations. The intervention will consist of a multicomponent exercise training programme,&#xD;
      which will be composed of supervised progressive resistance exercise training,&#xD;
      balance-training and walking for 4 consecutive days. During the training period, patients&#xD;
      will be trained in 20 min sessions twice a day (morning and evening).&#xD;

    <description>The functional capacity of participants will be evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 12 points (best) which includes balance, gait and rising from a chair test. Standing balance test consists in the ability to maintain the standing position for 10s with three different foot position: parallel, semi-tandem and tandem. Walking speed measure, the time needed to progress for 4 linear meters with patient's usual speed, assigning a different score according to speed. Chair sit-to-stand assesses the ability to stand from a chair 5 consecutive times without using arms. The SPPB test has been shown to be a valid instrument for screening frailty and predicting disability, institutionalization and mortality.</description>

    <description>- Changes in the quality of life measured by the Spanish version40 of the questionnaire EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)41. It is an instrument measures 5 dimensions health status: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated according to the following levels: a) no problems; b) some problems; c) extreme problems. Besides, it contain visual analogy scale to quantify perceived health of 0 (worst health state imaginable) to 100 (best health state imaginable).</description>

    <description>Multicomponent exercise group (intervention): The intervention will consist of a multicomponent exercise training programme24, which will be composed of supervised progressive resistance exercise training, balance-training and walking for 4 consecutive days. During the training period, patients will be trained in 20 min sessions twice a day (morning and evening).&#xD;
The supervised multicomponent exercise training programme will be comprised of upper and lower body strengthening exercises, tailored to the individual's functional capacity, using weight machines and aiming for 2-3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at an intensity of 40-60 % of 1RMcombined with balance and gait retraining exercises that progressed in difficulty and functional exercises, such as rises from a chair. The second part of the session will consist of functional exercises such as knee extension and flexion, hip abduction, balance movements, and daily walking in the hospital.</description>
