      Patients hospitalized at the clinic Cecil who need telemetry will be monitored for 48 hours&#xD;
      with the SmartCardia system in addition to conventional monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias, are often&#xD;
      asymptomatic and sometimes associated with an adverse event, such as a stroke or syncope.&#xD;
      Telemetry monitoring in hospitals, 24 hours a day, is the most used method for detecting&#xD;
      these cardiac arrhythmias, especially after major surgery or cardiac surgery. Currently this&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring is ensured by a system called telemetry, a kind of box connected to 4&#xD;
      electrodes stuck on the patient's chest. Information is continuously transmitted to a screen&#xD;
      located in the nurses' room, which is supposed to watch the screen continuously. There are&#xD;
      also alarms that can be triggered when an arrhythmia occurs. In practice, it is found that&#xD;
      very often the electrodes are disconnected for practical reasons (patient going to the toilet&#xD;
      for example) or accidentally. The alarms are not always observed because they very often&#xD;
      sound badly. In addition, 24-hour telemetric monitoring sometimes fails to detect the culprit&#xD;
      arrhythmia. Event monitoring significantly increases performance of the system. It has&#xD;
      recently been shown that the ZIO patch (iRhythm Technologies Ltd.), a wireless&#xD;
      electrocardiography allows te detection of arrhythmias in children, confirming the usefulness&#xD;
      of such devices in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Investigational product and indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartCardia patch (SmartCardia, EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale Lausanne) Innovation&#xD;
      Park, Lausanne, Switzerland) is a lightweight wireless ECG device (Figure 1) mounted on a&#xD;
      patch with waterproof properties. The device is completely wireless and has no external&#xD;
      connection wires. It allows patients to go about their daily activities with minimal&#xD;
      disruption. The SmartCardia system allows in hospital patients monitoring, and corresponds to&#xD;
      telemetry, functioning as 24 hour cardiac monitoring. The device is placed on the upper left&#xD;
      part of the patient's chest (Figure 2). The patch can wirelessly communicate the data to a&#xD;
      screen that will display it live. In addition, this data will be stored in the recording&#xD;
      device and in the cloud. Once monitoring is complete, the data remains stored in the cloud&#xD;
      and is available to physicians. During the recording, at any time, the doctor can be&#xD;
      connected and interrogate the device in order to visualise the arrhythmias of his patient.&#xD;
      The first studies using this device in the clinic have recently been published with very&#xD;
      encouraging results. The device is classified in category A (Swiss government office decision&#xD;
      attached). Previous trials with this device have shown its clinical usefulness in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and in daily practice. The device is actually proposed and used by many&#xD;
      cardiologists as an alternative to the conventional Holter monitoring system. The goal of the&#xD;
      present trial is mainly to confirm tha ability of this device to be used as a telemetry&#xD;
      system on the ward in order to overpass the inconvenience of the actual system related to&#xD;
      permanent cable connections with the risk of disconnexion and lost of monitoring. This trial&#xD;
      is mainly a confirmation of that the device is a valuable option for telemetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used for this trial is the one certified by Swissmedics with UE (Union Européenne)&#xD;
      certification&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Pre-clinical evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of using such a type of monitoring are obvious. The patient is autonomous in his&#xD;
      movements. The risks associated with disconnection are nonexistent. In addition, the doctor&#xD;
      can consult the patient's data directly at any time. Finally, the data are stored in the&#xD;
      cloud and archiving is made easier. The only risk associated with this system is an allergy&#xD;
      to the adhesive patch. In view of the potential benefits expected from the use of this&#xD;
      system, it is easy to understand that the study is justified. It should be kept in mind that&#xD;
      the conventional system also has limits essentially linked to the risk of cable&#xD;
      disconnection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk linked to a bad registration of the SmartCardia system which would generate an&#xD;
      incorrect treatment does not exist, because the clinical decision will be taken by the doctor&#xD;
      and based only on the data provided by conventional monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous trials have shown the accuracy and advantages of this new wireless recorder. The&#xD;
      system is already used in the daily practice in several countries as an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Explanation for choice of comparator&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new system will be used in parallel with the conventional monitoring system. It is&#xD;
      obvious that the conventional monitoring system should be used as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Risks/Benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks related to the use of this new device as therapeutic decision will be&#xD;
      based only the recording of the conventional system. Benefits could be expected in the future&#xD;
      since wireless system are preferred by the patients as demonstrated in previous trials&#xD;
      comparing Holter monitoring and the SmartCardia device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Justification of choice of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients after cardiac surgery are usually monitored for a few days when they are back to the&#xD;
      ward. It is obvious that they are the cohort of choice for such monitoring since they require&#xD;
      it anyway.&#xD;
