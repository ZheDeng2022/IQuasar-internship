      Based on client needs and technological requirements, a wearable sensor device was designed&#xD;
      and developed using principles of 'social innovation' design. The device underwent multiple&#xD;
      iterations in product design and engineering based on user-feedback and then following&#xD;
      pre-clinical testing, a techno-feasibility study and clinical trial were undertaken in a&#xD;
      tertiary-care, teaching hospital in Bangalore, India. Clinical trial phases I and IIa&#xD;
      {studies/pilot studies designed to demonstrate clinical efficacy or biological activity&#xD;
      ('proof of concept' studies)} for evaluation of safety and efficacy were undertaken in the&#xD;
      following sequence: first with healthy adult volunteers; then healthy mothers; healthy&#xD;
      babies; stable babies in the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and then a baby with&#xD;
      morbidities. Time-stamped skin temperatures obtained at 5-minute intervals over a 1-hour&#xD;
      period from the device secured on upper arms of mothers and abdomen of neonates were compared&#xD;
      against readings from thermometers used routinely in clinical practice, radiant warmer and&#xD;
      multimodal sensor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study setting: St John's Medical College Hospital, Bangalore, a 1300-bedded, tertiary-care&#xD;
      hospital with 2500 deliveries per annum and a Level-3 nursery that takes care of 1000&#xD;
      neonates (inborn: outborn ratio = 2:1) in the neonatal care intensive unit (NICU) annually,&#xD;
      one-third of whom are low birth weight and one-fifth are preterm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of site of temperature measurement in adult and newborn: In the adult, the upper arm&#xD;
      was selected for continuous monitoring. While in the newborn abdominal skin temperature was&#xD;
      selected. In addition to being close to the liver, a metabolically-active organ facilitating&#xD;
      a measurement close to the core temperature, it is also a non-invasive method that is steady,&#xD;
      continuous, easy-to-use and comfortable for the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation Pathway: The USAID 2006 Innovation Pathway model was adopted and it incorporated&#xD;
      four steps from research to field implementation - (1) priority-setting phase and product&#xD;
      design (2) product development and proof-of-concept (3) product introduction and (4) field&#xD;
      implementation.As part of step 1, the sub-steps of (a) problem identification (epidemiologic/&#xD;
      technological/ social/ financial, etc), (b) critical review of temperature measurement&#xD;
      devices and other issues (temperature sensors or thermistors, core body temperature&#xD;
      measurement issues, etc), and (c) determination of niche of this device vis-à-vis other&#xD;
      devices through horizon scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic burden of chief causes of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity were&#xD;
      reviewed as a first step.A technological review revealed that the device to be strapped-on to&#xD;
      the mother or newborn for vital sign detection had to be a medical-grade device with&#xD;
      extremely high safety profile. Further, it had to remain functional in situations such as&#xD;
      soiling or wetting by the newborn, and also continue to work in different areas with varying&#xD;
      population densities as well as buildings. Several devices such as the ThermoSpot®, a&#xD;
      temperature sensor tag and remote infrared-based instruments were evaluated. Social review&#xD;
      revealed that a sensor being continually strapped on to the body for long periods was not&#xD;
      dissimilar to that of talismans strapped around the arms of adults or around the necks/waists&#xD;
      of children and might therefore not be too disagreeable to families. A financial review&#xD;
      revealed that for the device to be used widely, especially by low-income populations, it&#xD;
      would have to be a low-cost device. Implementation review focused on possible uptake and&#xD;
      utilization of such a device in rural, urban and slum communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual framework: The conceptual framework for remote monitoring consisted of five&#xD;
      components: (1) a low-cost, wearable sensor tag; (2) a gateway device acting as an&#xD;
      ultra-low-power 'real-time' communication link; (3) piggy-backing on a commercial cellular&#xD;
      communication network; (4) smart data analytics system; and (5) feedback loop to the&#xD;
      care-giver or frontline health worker. This framework was to be ideated, designed, prototyped&#xD;
      and developed into a Class A medical device with lowest risk level as per Medical Device&#xD;
      Regulatory Authority of India bearing in mind that the end-product should enable tenets of&#xD;
      good Quality of Care (QoC) namely effectiveness, timeliness, safety, people-centeredness and&#xD;
      equity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirements for components Two key requirements for the 'on-body' sensor were safety and&#xD;
      accuracy. Given the fragility of the newborn skin, the device had to be hypoallergenic,&#xD;
      burst/leak proof, cause minimal infections, and dissipate minimal heat or ultra-low power,&#xD;
      non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. nThe adhesive used to secure the device to the skin&#xD;
      should similarly cause minimal 'medical adhesive-related skin injury' (MARSI), allergy or&#xD;
      infections. Device accuracy was targeted to be +/-0.2°C in in-vitro conditions and +/-0.5°C&#xD;
      in actual clinical practice. Other mechanical requirements for the device were: long&#xD;
      battery-life up to 28 days (with sampling frequency of 5 minutes); robustness (without any&#xD;
      malfunction on coming into contact with body fluids like sweat, blood, urine, faeces, etc);at&#xD;
      least 'ingress protection class 67' (dust-proof and water-proof); human-centric and aesthetic&#xD;
      design for non-intrusiveness over prolonged use; and ability to withstand mild shock or&#xD;
      vibration; and that the device should not get re-set accidentally. There was also a&#xD;
      requirement for the device to store data locally and communicate with a gateway device for&#xD;
      onward transmission of data via the configured cellular network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product design and engineering: Based on the clinical requirements, a preliminary design was&#xD;
      constituted and subsequent design choices underwent multiple iterations driven by&#xD;
      technological capabilities and user reviews. The wearable sensor enclosures were&#xD;
      pebble-shaped or coin-stack shaped with all the electronics embedded inside. A battery of&#xD;
      tests (both mechanical and electrical) were undertaken to confirm device performance,&#xD;
      robustness, and reliability. After several rounds of pre-testing, design optimization was&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prototype and Implementation: The details of the prototype sensor device are given elsewhere.&#xD;
      Briefly, the sensor hardware platform, developed using a multi-layer printed circuit board,&#xD;
      consisted of a microcontroller (MCU) with integrated Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE), a 12-bit&#xD;
      ADC {Analog to Digital Converter} (CC2540 from Texas Instruments), a NICU-grade temperature&#xD;
      sensor with its analog front-end circuit, status LEDs {Light Emitting Diode}, power supply&#xD;
      and RF {Radio-Frequency} balun {a electrical device that converts between a balanced and&#xD;
      imbalanced signal} transmits filter and antenna for wireless communication over 2.4 GHz&#xD;
      {gigahertz} ISM {Industrial Scientific and Medical} band. High-precision MF51E NTC {high&#xD;
      precision negative temperature coefficient} thermistors were used for extremely accurate&#xD;
      temperature measurements. An embedded Inverted F-antenna (IFA) with higher efficiency, longer&#xD;
      range and a wider bandwidth than a chip antenna was used. It also had a very low tolerance&#xD;
      resistor enabling a low power consumption during both active (150μA) as well as sleep (1μA)&#xD;
      modes. The sensor hardware was programmable as per requirements. A 3-volt coin battery&#xD;
      powered the device. A baby-friendly enclosure was made from medical-grade hypoallergenic&#xD;
      plastics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensor communicated with a gateway device (a smartphone or a Raspberry pi) that could&#xD;
      subsequently relay the temperature data over a secured internet backbone provided by GPRS&#xD;
      {General Packet Radio Service}/Wi-fi on to a centralized database for storage (web figure 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases of device testing: The planned phases of device testing were pre-clinical testing (in&#xD;
      June 2013) and clinical trial phases I&amp; IIa {studies/pilot studies designed to demonstrate&#xD;
      clinical efficacy or biological activity ('proof of concept' studies)} for evaluation of&#xD;
      safety and efficacy in the following sequence: healthy adult volunteers (May 2014); healthy&#xD;
      mothers (Jan-Feb 2015); healthy babies (Feb 2015); stable babies in the NICU (Feb-Mar 2015)&#xD;
      and babies with morbidities such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (Mar 2015). The results&#xD;
      of the pre-clinical testing in the laboratory setting were published earlier. Briefly, the&#xD;
      response time of the sensor device to attain thermal equilibrium with the surroundings was 4&#xD;
      minutes compared to 3 minutes observed with a precision-grade digital thermometer used as a&#xD;
      reference standard. In terms of accuracy, the error was calculated to be within 0.1°C of the&#xD;
      reference standard while using water-baths in the temperature range of 25°C to 40°C. The&#xD;
      details of the clinical phase of testing are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven free-living healthy adult volunteers (males = 2; females = 5), with no known&#xD;
      morbidities, were the first phase participants over a 7-day period. All of them had the&#xD;
      devices strapped with an arm band secured with Velcro® tape on to their left upper arms and&#xD;
      were invited to contribute at least a minimum of 24 hours of observations accumulated from&#xD;
      over one or more days and report any adverse events or side-effects they experienced. In&#xD;
      parallel, they also noted down timed axillary temperature readings (at least 5 times in a&#xD;
      24-hour window) using a digital thermometer for paired comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing in healthy postnatal mothers (n=11) was first carried out amongst those with well&#xD;
      babies in the postnatal ward and then amongst mothers (n=7) with neonates admitted in the&#xD;
      NICU. The devices were secured on to their upper arms with arm band secured with Velcro®&#xD;
      tape. Paired readings taken every 5 minutes over a 1-hour period with an axillary digital&#xD;
      thermometer were compared against the readings of the sensor with its time stamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing among neonates was carried out in three different phases in all of which the devices&#xD;
      were secured with cotton and micropore adhesive to the upper epigastrium. In the first phase,&#xD;
      well-babies (n=3) in their early neonatal periods in the postnatal ward had their axillary&#xD;
      temperature readings taken every 5 minutes over a 1-hour period with a digital thermometer&#xD;
      and compared against the sensor readings. In the second phase, sick but stable neonates&#xD;
      (n=10) from the NICU were recruited. They were under the radiant warmer with the temperature&#xD;
      probe fixed on to the upper abdomen beside the sensor device and so the readings taken every&#xD;
      5 minutes over a 1-hour period from the warmer panel were compared against the sensor&#xD;
      readings. But since all these babies had their temperatures maintained within a narrow normal&#xD;
      range under the radiant warmer, we included one sick infant with hypoxic ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HIE) due to birth asphyxia and who was on treatment with therapeutic&#xD;
      whole-body cooling. This facilitated comparison of readings in the range of 33° to 34°C&#xD;
      during the cooling and re-warming phases of the treatment. The radiant warmer probe readings&#xD;
      taken every 5 minutes over a 1-hour period from the warmer panel were compared against the&#xD;
      sensor readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Safety: An adverse event reporting and resolution protocol for the wearable&#xD;
      sensor devices was instituted. This enabled capture of the number and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events as well as the individual clinical management as also feedback for changes into device&#xD;
      design. Adverse events to be recorded were: dermatitis, infection, thermal injury, radiation&#xD;
      injury, device leak/burst and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy: Of the device was estimated by comparing temperatures recorded by the device&#xD;
      against other measurements routinely used in clinical practice. For mothers and well-babies&#xD;
      in postnatal wards, the comparisons were between the device temperatures versus axillary&#xD;
      temperatures read from a digital thermometer (once readings stabilized after the beep -&#xD;
      usually after 3 minutes); for newborns in NICU, the comparisons were between the time-stamped&#xD;
      device temperatures versus skin probe temperatures obtained from the control panels of&#xD;
      calibrated radiant warmers (Phoenix Medical Systems Private Limited, Chennai, India or Zeal&#xD;
      Medical Ltd, Mumbai, India).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Mean [+/-Standard deviation (S.D.)] was calculated for the paired sets&#xD;
      of readings noted in mothers and newborns and the mean differences were obtained. Paired&#xD;
      t-test was used for testing of significance between two different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the St John's Institutional Ethics&#xD;
      Review Board (IERB #59/2011 dated 15 Mar 2011&amp;# 125/2014 dated 16 Aug 2014). The clinical&#xD;
      trial was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2015/05/005779).&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from all participants/care-givers.&#xD;
