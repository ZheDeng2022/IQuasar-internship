  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-three, fibromyalgia syndrome participants were randomized to receive either: 1)&#xD;
      probiotic 4×1010 CFUs per day 2) 10 g dose prebiotic (inulin) per day or 3) placebo for 8 wk.&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Visual Analogical Pain Scale (VAS), Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and&#xD;
      quality of life (SF-36) were measured during the baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks intervention&#xD;
      phases. Finally, the adverse effects will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) form is a evaluate the functional status of the patients. In this scale, 10 different features are measured: physical function, well-being, not being able to go to work, difficulty at work, pain, fatigue, morning fatigue, stiffness, anxiety and depression. The scale is scored range 0-100. Low scores indicated recovery except for the feeling of well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS was used to question the severity of the whole body pain in patients. On a 10 cm long line, &quot;0&quot; score indicates no pain, while &quot;10&quot; score indicates the most severe pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms are assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which includes 21 questions with four possible answers sorted according to symptom severity. A score of 0-3 is given for each question, and the total score from the scale is ranked between 0-63. If the score increases, it indicates that the severity of depressive symptoms increases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety levels were measured with the 21-item Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Participants were asked to report the intensity and frequency of their feeling of anxiety using a Likert-like scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (it bothered me a lot). If the total score increases, it increases the tendency of the individual to anxiety</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI) is used as a subjective measure of sleep quality and disturbances of the patient's sleep. The PSQI is a 19-item self-reported questionnaire grouped into seven score components (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction). The PSQI assess behavior using Likert scales from 0 to 3, and five questions rated by the bed partner, if applicable. The PSQI yields a score from 0 (good quality) to 21 (poor quality). Global Scores &gt;5 indicate significant sleep complaints. Those with a score of ≤5 is classified as good sleepers</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 can be used for many purposes, consists of 36 questions, determines the health status of the healthy individuals or patients. The 36 multi-item scale of the short form SF-36 covers 8 aspects of physical and mental health: (1) Physical functioning (PF); (2) Role physical (RF); (3). Bodily pain (BP); (4) General health (GH); (5) Vitality (VT); (6) Social functioning (SF); (7) Role emotional (RE); (8) Mental health (MH). Domains 1 to 4 of the questionnaire deal with physical aspects, while domains 5 to 8 measure psychological features.
