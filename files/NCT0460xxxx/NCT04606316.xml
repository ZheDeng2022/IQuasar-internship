  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial is studying the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab and surgery when used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (IV solution with no medicine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C (optional sub-study)&#xD;

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits. It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 study groups participating in this study and each group receives different study&#xD;
      drugs. After screening, participants will be randomized into one of three study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one of the following study treatments prior to undergoing surgery&#xD;
      for tumor removal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B receives nivolumab plus placebo-ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C receives two placebo infusions, placebo-nivolumab plus placebo-ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the participant nor the research doctor will know which study drugs the participant&#xD;
      will receive prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recovering from surgery, participants will receive doses of study medication based on&#xD;
      the study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 3 doses followed by&#xD;
           nivolumab every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B receives nivolumab every four weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by&#xD;
           nivolumab every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of nivolumab or&#xD;
      ipilimumab for your specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (types of human protein) that work to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is trying to have the body's own immune system work against tumor cells.&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been used in other research studies, and information from those&#xD;
      other research studies suggest these drugs may help to stop glioblastoma cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects also have the option of undergoing 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C PET scans. This consists of one&#xD;
      infusion with 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C followed by a PET scan prior to starting study treatment and&#xD;
      another infusion with PET scan about 3 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;

             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.,&#xD;
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had&#xD;
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment if she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable&#xD;

             and for 5 months after study discontinuation. Highly effective contraception is&#xD;
             defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True Abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when&#xD;
                  the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment (as described above).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male Partner Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the&#xD;
                  vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives (including any registered and marketed&#xD;
                       contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent&#xD;
                       - including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects should agree to use adequate method of contraception starting with the&#xD;
             first dose of study therapy through 7 months after the last dose of therapy.&#xD;

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Examples&#xD;
             include but are not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of&#xD;
             the trial, starting with the screening visit through 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             trial treatment. It is unknown whether nivolumab and/or ipilimumab is excreted in&#xD;
             human milk or may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Since many drugs are&#xD;
             excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in&#xD;
             the nursing infant or fetus, these subjects are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or&#xD;
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-Associated Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including&#xD;
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study therapy products.&#xD;
