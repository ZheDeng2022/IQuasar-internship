  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study conducted at 13 sites in 3 countries (Singapore, New Zealand,&#xD;
      and the United Kingdom). Approximately 360 patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI)&#xD;
      will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 ratio to receive AZD5718 125 mg or placebo for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PASSIVATE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial that investigates&#xD;
      how 12 months of treatment with AZD5718 modifies coronary plaque volume. Patients with recent&#xD;
      STEMI or NSTEMI will receive an additional oral dose of AZD5718 (or placebo) once daily to&#xD;
      standard clinical care for 12 months. The primary hypothesis being tested in PASSIVATE is&#xD;
      that 12 months of treatment with AZD5718 attenuates the progression of non-calcified plaque&#xD;
      (NCP) volume on serial computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who gave consent (within 30 days after their index event) will undergo a CTCA scan&#xD;
      and start treatment (AZD5718 or Placebo). The treatment duration will be 12 months. During&#xD;
      the treatment period, patients will come to the clinic for follow-ups. At 12 months (end&#xD;
      treatment), the patients will undergo their 2nd CTCA scan. A follow-up visit will be&#xD;
      performed 4 weeks after the last dose in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
