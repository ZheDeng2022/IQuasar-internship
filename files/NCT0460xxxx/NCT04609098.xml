  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the gametocytocidal and transmission reducing activity&#xD;
      of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) with and without various low doses of tafenoquine (TQ;&#xD;
      1.66mg/kg, 0.83mg/kg, or 0.415mg/kg). Outcome measures will include infectivity to mosquitoes&#xD;
      at 2 and 7 days after treatment, gametocyte density throughout follow-up, and safety measures&#xD;
      including haemoglobin density.&#xD;
