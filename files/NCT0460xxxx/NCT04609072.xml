      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most cancers develop over long periods of time. Many things can affect how cancer develops&#xD;
      and changes. Researchers want to use new technology and methods to study the things that can&#xD;
      affect cancer risk. They will collect information from people over many years and use this&#xD;
      information to build a state-of-the-art research resource to better understand the causes of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study and better understand what causes cancer and to find new ways to prevent or treat&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 40-65 who get their health care from a partner health care system and do not have&#xD;
      a previous or current cancer diagnosis (an exception is that people with non-melanoma skin&#xD;
      cancer may join).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will create an account on the MyConnect app using their phone number or email&#xD;
      address. They will share their name, date of birth, address, and other contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they join, participants will complete four online surveys. The surveys will ask about&#xD;
      their health, habits, family, home, and work. They will be contacted about completing other&#xD;
      surveys at least once a year. Participants will donate biological specimens, which are&#xD;
      samples of things like blood, urine, and saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will share their health and medical records. They may donate unused specimens&#xD;
      that are collected at clinical visits, like tissue, stool, or blood. They may also mail in&#xD;
      samples taken at home. Participants may share information from personal health trackers, like&#xD;
      wearable devices or apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted via email, telephone, text message, postal mail, health care&#xD;
      system patient portal, or notifications on the MyConnect app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connect participants will be part of the study throughout their lives. Participants can leave&#xD;
      the study at any time.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connect is an observational cohort study that will prospectively collect exposure information&#xD;
      and biospecimens and follow participants for cancer and other endpoints. Participants will be&#xD;
      free of cancer at study invitation. Because most cancers develop over long periods of time&#xD;
      and biological, behavioral and environmental factors can influence cancer development and&#xD;
      change over time, participants will be asked to provide repeated exposure information and&#xD;
      biological specimens. The study protocol takes advantage of developments in digital&#xD;
      technologies as well as exposure and biomarker assessment tools to investigate suspected and&#xD;
      emerging factors that can influence cancer development. The study data system will be built&#xD;
      within an efficient, flexible and integrated cloud-hosted infrastructure that leverages&#xD;
      modern interoperability standards in order to be an accessible research resource for current&#xD;
      and future generations of scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to build a prospective cohort in the US using new technologies and&#xD;
      methods to provide a diverse and comprehensive research resource for the scientific community&#xD;
      to study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      cancer etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      precursor to tumor transformation&#xD;
&#xD;
      cancer risk assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      early detection of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      second cancer development and survivorship after a cancer diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to provide this rich database and biorepository for general&#xD;
      research use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are the continuum of cancer incidence, progression, and survival.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are numerous and could include methodological research, human biology,&#xD;
      ancestry, evolution or health-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least to 200,000 adults aged 40 to 65 years, no personal history of invasive cancer, and&#xD;
      patients or members of participating integrated health care systems are eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine US integrated healthcare systems will host enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will last at least five years. Participants will be followed for life. Analysis&#xD;
      of the data is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the baseline study activities will take participants approximately four hours.&#xD;
      Subsequent activities are expected to take one to four hours.&#xD;
