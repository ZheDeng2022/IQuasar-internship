      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Rybelsus® works in people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and to see if Rybelsus® can lower their blood sugar levels. Participants will get&#xD;
      Rybelsus® as prescribed to them by the study doctor. The study will last for about 8-10&#xD;
      months. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how they take their&#xD;
      Rybelsus® tablets. Participants will complete this questionnaire during their normally&#xD;
      scheduled visit with the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires about their diabetes treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will complete these during their normally scheduled visits with the study&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
