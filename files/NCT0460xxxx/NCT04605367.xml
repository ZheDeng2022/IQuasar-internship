  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific background and rationale: Motor sequence learning (MSL) is composed of three&#xD;
      phases: initial acquisition or rapid learning occurs during the first practice session,&#xD;
      characterized by a rapid increase in motor performance; consolidation comes next, in the&#xD;
      following hours, with a stabilization or even an increase in performance without additional&#xD;
      practice; finally, slow learning allows long-term memorization of the skills acquired after&#xD;
      several practice sessions. Motor sequence learning is an essential ability at any age but is&#xD;
      altered with aging. Furthermore, the repetition of movements required for MSL may be tiring&#xD;
      for the most vulnerable individuals. There is thus a need to develop the use of alternative&#xD;
      and effective methods of MSL in the elderly. Mental practice (MP) based on motor imagery (MI)&#xD;
      and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) are such innovative methods that&#xD;
      have shown a positive impact on MSL in older adults. On the one hand, motor imagery training&#xD;
      relates to mentally practicing movements without actual execution. This method has been shown&#xD;
      to advantageously complement or even replace physical practice. Nevertheless, for fine and&#xD;
      gross motor skills, the association MP/physical practice (PP) has been little studied in&#xD;
      healthy elderly subjects. On the other hand, tDCS is a safe and noninvasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      method used to modulate cortical excitability and enhance neuroplasticity. It has been shown&#xD;
      that an anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) immediately after the acquisition&#xD;
      of a sequence of finger movements (manual task) enhanced consolidation in healthy elderly&#xD;
      people. These effects have, however, never been tested for more ecological sequential tasks&#xD;
      involving the whole body (body task).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The main aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a-tDCS on the consolidation&#xD;
      of complex manual and body tasks, after MP alone, PP alone, and MP + PP in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to test the effects of MP alone, PP alone and MP + PP in the acquisition&#xD;
      of these complex manual and body tasks, in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third aim is to test the evolution of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity between rest&#xD;
      and motor imagery of these tasks, and, for motor imagery, before and after training.&#xD;

    <description>EEG recording will be made for 3 min at rest and during 6 blocks of 30s of MP. EEG recording will be performed using the Starstim 8 (Neuroelectrics, Barcelona, Spain). Starstim is a wireless neurostimulator system allows both the delivery of a tDCS (or sham stimulation) and the recording of EEG activity at 500 Hz. EEG signals will be recorded from 6 Ag/AgCl electrodes. Following the spatial configuration of the international 10-20 system, the electrodes will be placed over the frontal, somatosensory and motor areas: frontocentral (FC2, FC6), central (CZ, C2) and central-parietal (CP2, CP6). After the EEG signal processing, the power of the Mu and Beta rhythm will be extracted.</description>

After this training, they will perform the post-test. And immediately after the post-test, they will receive the real anodal stimulation. The intensity of the current will gradually increase for 30s until it reaches 1mA, will remain constant for 15min, then will gradually decrease for 30s until 0mA is reached. The current density during stimulation will be 0.04 mA/cm². For the manual task the anode will be centered above C4 (according to the international 10-20 EEG system) that is located near the hand area of M1. The cathode will be placed on the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the trained hand (Fp1). For the body task, the anode will be placed in the center of the cortex (Cz) and the cathode will be placed at the medial supraorbital region (Fpz).</description>
