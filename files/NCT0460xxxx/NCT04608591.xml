      -  This study is aimed at identifying patients at high risk for Venous Thrombo-Embolism&#xD;
           (VTE) (clots in the veins of legs or clots in the lungs) who have lower limb injuries&#xD;
           treated with immobilisation of the lower limb. The study aims to identify high risk&#xD;
           patients, who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis (blood thinning medication) to prevent&#xD;
           such clots forming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To do this we will collect data on 3500 patients who present with lower limb injury&#xD;
           requiring immobilisation to the Emergency Departments of the six hospitals named.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will assess their risk factors for venous thrombosis at the time of presentation and&#xD;
           contact them at twelve weeks to assess if they have had a VTE in order to develop a risk&#xD;
           scoring system which can be used to predict the likelihood of VTE development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This risk scoring system can then be used to identify high risk patients who may benefit&#xD;
           from thromboprophylaxis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, there is wide variation in the provision of venous thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
      prophylaxis for patients who suffer lower limb trauma and require lower limb immobilisation.&#xD;
      Current United Kingdom guidelines recommend assessing competing risks of VTE and bleeding&#xD;
      followed by shared decision-making with the patient on prescription of pharmacological&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis (VTE thromboprophylaxis). However, current American College of Chest&#xD;
      Physicians (ACCP) guidelines do not recommend VTE thromboprophylaxis for this group. The&#xD;
      largest study carried out to date, the Prevention of Thrombosis after Lower Leg Plaster Cast&#xD;
      (POT-CAST) randomised controlled trial 1 identified a very low rate of VTE (1.8%) in the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm. This study concluded that thromboprophylaxis was not justified for&#xD;
      patients with lower limb trauma who required lower limb immobilisation. However, it&#xD;
      recommended that further studies are required to see if it is possible to identify a high&#xD;
      risk cohort of patients who may benefit from VTE thromboprophylaxis. No large prospective&#xD;
      study has been published to date to assess if it is possible to identify this high risk&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis&#xD;
      (MEGA) study was a case-control study designed to identify risk factors for a first VTE. A&#xD;
      sub-analysis of this study reviewed 230 patients who had lower limb trauma with cast&#xD;
      immobilisation who developed VTE. Based on this data a risk assessment score was derived&#xD;
      (termed &quot;L-TRiP&quot; [Leiden-Thrombosis Risk Prediction for patients with cast immobilization]&#xD;
      score) in order to identify high risk patients who may benefit from VTE prophylaxis. However,&#xD;
      this risk assessment tool has not been prospectively validated in a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have carried out a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a large scale, adequately&#xD;
      powered multi-centre study aimed at prospective identification of a high VTE-risk group of&#xD;
      patients. This study was presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis&#xD;
      meeting in Berlin in 2017.5 Utilizing data from this pilot study, we now aim to perform a&#xD;
      multi-centre study with sufficient power to determine whether it is feasible to identify a&#xD;
      high risk group of patients with lower limb trauma requiring immobilisation who will benefit&#xD;
      from thromboprophylaxis The POT-CAST study determined that the rate of venous&#xD;
      thrombo-embolism (VTE) in patients with lower limb trauma requiring a cast was 1.8%. This low&#xD;
      rate does not justify VTE prophylaxis for all patients who require a cast. However there may&#xD;
      be a high risk group with a rate of VTE high enough to suggest that consideration of VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis may be appropriate. This study will prospectively gather risk factor data on&#xD;
      patients at the time of initial presentation post trauma with follow up at 12 weeks to&#xD;
      identify those patients who have experienced a symptomatic VTE episode. This data will then&#xD;
      be used to identify a group with a high VTE risk which future studies can utilise to target&#xD;
      this high risk group to assess if VTE prophylaxis is of benefit.&#xD;
