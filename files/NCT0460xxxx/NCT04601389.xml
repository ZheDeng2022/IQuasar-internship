      An open-label, randomized, in parallel groups comparative study of pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety of GNR-044 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, Russian Federation)&#xD;
      and Xolair® (&quot;Novartis Pharma AG&quot;, Switzerland) after single subcutaneous administration in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers at 150 mg&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing incidence of bronchial asthma (BA) and other allergic diseases around&#xD;
      the world. Bronchial asthma suffers from 4 to 10% of the world population, in Russian&#xD;
      Federation, the incidence of BA across the adult population ranges from 2.2 to 5-7%, in the&#xD;
      child population is about 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe BA is associated not only with frequent hospitalizations and increased mortality but&#xD;
      also with high treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to it, there is a hot button issue of developing new drugs for treating patients not to be&#xD;
      achieved effectively with standard therapy. Considering the leading pathogenesis role of&#xD;
      IgE-mediated allergy, the use of drugs to block IgE makes it possible to control the disease&#xD;
      at the earliest allergic reaction phase of the development. It was shown that the IgE&#xD;
      elimination from the mast cells and basophils surface reduced the severity of acute allergic&#xD;
      reactions, reduced the allergen-induced late phase of the immune response and infiltration&#xD;
      with inflammatory cells. These anti-IgE antibodies effects have been shown in various&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these drugs is оmalizumab (Xolair®). The drug has been approved in various countries&#xD;
      across the world, including the United States and the European Union for the severe allergic&#xD;
      BA and chronic idiopathic urticaria treatment. In the Russian Federation, omalizumab was&#xD;
      registered in May 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug GNR-044 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, Russian Federation) is biosimilar to the original drug&#xD;
      Xolair®. This study is aimed to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug GNR-044&#xD;
      (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, Russian Federation) and the drug Xolair® in order to register of the drug&#xD;
      GNR-044 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, Russian Federation), a lyophilizate for subcutaneous administration,&#xD;
      in the Russian Federation.&#xD;
