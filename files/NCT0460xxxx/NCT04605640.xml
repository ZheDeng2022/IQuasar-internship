  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is to develop a weight loss and weight maintenance program through dietary&#xD;
      modifications for adults with obesity. Although scientific studies have shown the feasibility&#xD;
      of rapid and safe dietary weight loss and subsequent weight maintenance, no efficacious&#xD;
      dietary weight management program is widely available, and thus bariatric surgery remains the&#xD;
      most reliable approach for weight loss/management. Safe and effective dietary weight loss and&#xD;
      subsequent weight maintenance require flexible, individualized advice by an experienced&#xD;
      dietitian/nutritionist.&#xD;

    <description>During a 12-month period, participants will attend a total of 22 diet improvement sessions, each of which will last approximately 1 hour. Twelve sessions will be held in the first 5 months and will be focused on safe and efficient weight loss. The participants will learn to create a personalized weight loss diet from their kitchen based on their diet practice and food preference. The next 10 sessions will be held in the last 7 months and will be focused on weight maintenance and healthy eating. The participants will build skills to select foods and create meals that prevent them from overeating. Participants will be followed by daily self-weighing for 1 year after intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants attend group and individual dietary education sessions. Participants create a diet plan that satisfies their needs. Participants aim to lose 1 pound weekly until a BMI of 25 is reached. Participants are evaluated through daily self-weighing, dietary records, and food frequency questionnaires.</description>
