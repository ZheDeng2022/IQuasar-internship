  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory state characterized by a disturbance of&#xD;
      immunoregulatory mechanisms that leads to an amplified T helper &quot;Th-2&quot; response. Micro-RNAs&#xD;
      (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA molecules that post transcriptionally control gene&#xD;
      expression and can mediate allergic process. The aim of this study was to explore miRNA-155&#xD;
      change in response to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), probiotics and combined treatment with&#xD;
      SLIT and probiotics in AR children.&#xD;

    <description>Total Nasal Symptom Score was evaluated for the three groups at the start of the study and after 6 months. TNSS is the sum of scores for each of nasal obstruction, sneezing, nasal itching, and rhinorrhea at each time point, by means of a four-point scale (0-3) . TNSS is estimated by addition of the score for each of the symptoms to a total out of 12</description>
