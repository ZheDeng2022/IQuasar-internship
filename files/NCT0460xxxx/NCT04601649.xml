  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young Black MSM (YBMSM) are at critically high and disproportionate HIV risk. Reducing HIV&#xD;
      incidence rates among YBMSM will likely require increased adoption of additional strategies&#xD;
      such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is a FDA approved medication for HIV that also&#xD;
      prevents HIV transmission when taken appropriately. Interventions are needed to address&#xD;
      potential individual, social/cultural, and structural barriers to uptake and adherence of&#xD;
      PrEP among YBMSM to help curb HIV infections. Our preliminary research suggests that some&#xD;
      YBMSM feel concerned that PrEP is not effective or may be toxic, about being stigmatized for&#xD;
      having HIV if they take PrEP, as well as concerns about access and side effects. For YBMSM,&#xD;
      high levels of medical mistrust of HIV-related public health information and research may&#xD;
      also be barriers. Therefore, we propose &quot;PrEP-Talk&quot;, an intervention that will use a PrEP&#xD;
      Counselor (PC) who can provide information and guidance to YBMSM as they weigh their options&#xD;
      regarding HIV risk along with the inclusion of a close friend (CF) to support PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence. In order to address these critical and timely issues, we developed the following&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and manualize &quot;PrEP-Talk,&quot; which aims to increase PrEP uptake and adherence&#xD;
           among YBMSM. This will be done through qualitative formative research (3 focus groups&#xD;
           with 12-18 YBMSM and CF dyads, N=24-36); partnering with a community advisory board&#xD;
           (comprised of individuals knowledgeable about HIV work with YBMSM); and field tests of&#xD;
           the intervention with 5 YBMSM and CF dyads (N=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine feasibility, acceptability and indicators of preliminary efficacy of &quot;PrEP-Talk&quot;&#xD;
           on PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. This will be accomplished through a pilot&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 dyads (YBMSM and CFs) in the intervention and&#xD;
           30 YBMSM in the control (N=90). We will conduct assessments at baseline, 3-months and&#xD;
           6-months post-baseline. We will also assess PrEP uptake supportive communication at each&#xD;
           intervention session and collect urine samples to measure a biomarker of PrEP uptake&#xD;
           (initial adherence) from all YBMSM who report use of PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is significant because our intervention may increase PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence, which may help to reduce HIV incidence among YBMSM. If the proposed intervention&#xD;
      shows promise, we will prepare to undertake a full-scale R01-funded RCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) face a disproportionate burden of HIV&#xD;
      infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for protecting individuals&#xD;
      from HIV infection. However, uptake has been relatively slow among YBMSM (5-10%). 8 There is&#xD;
      an urgent need to develop and test interventions to increase PrEP uptake with YBMSM, which is&#xD;
      consistent with NIH priorities to examine the use of biomedical interventions for HIV&#xD;
      prevention with high risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior research indicates that many YBMSM are considering using PrEP, but they are&#xD;
      skeptical about taking a pill daily for HIV prevention. 5 YBMSM's willingness to use PrEP is&#xD;
      affected by many factors such as PrEP literacy, their own perceived low risk for HIV,&#xD;
      concerns about taking the pill and side effects, medical mistrust, concerns about cost, lack&#xD;
      of social support for using PrEP, and PrEP-related stigma. Consistent with our prior research&#xD;
      showing the powerful influence of close social network members on HIV-related health&#xD;
      behaviors, we have found that close friends of YBMSM can strongly influence YBMSM's'&#xD;
      motivation to use PrEP via conversations with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided by peer influence theory, a motivational interviewing (MI) approach and prior&#xD;
      research, the goal of the proposed research is to develop, manualize, and evaluate a&#xD;
      culturally-congruent intervention, &quot;PrEP-Talk,&quot; which aims to increase PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence among YBMSM. We propose that their close friends can apply positive peer influence&#xD;
      about taking PrEP. Our research is based on exploring how using MI with YBMSM and their close&#xD;
      friends may help to overcome barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed a dyad-level intervention concept for PrEP-Talk that involves three&#xD;
      interconnected components to increase PrEP uptake: 1) a &quot;PrEP Counselor&quot; (PC), in which&#xD;
      information and guidance will be provided to YBMSM and a Close Friend they select to help&#xD;
      address barriers to making an informed decision regarding PrEP uptake, (2) a Close Friend&#xD;
      (CF), defined as someone with whom the YBMSM has discussed sexual health topics in the past&#xD;
      year (but not had sex with in the past year), who is aware that he has sex with men, and who&#xD;
      agrees to support his PrEP uptake goals by engaging in dyad-level sessions about PrEP uptake&#xD;
      and adherence with their friend, and (3) training on PrEP supportive communication (PSC) in&#xD;
      every day conversations between YBMSM and CFs. PSC is talk between CFs that is well-informed&#xD;
      and non-judgmental about PrEP, in which YBMSM discuss the pros and cons of PrEP use, helping&#xD;
      YBMSM overcome barriers to uptake. All three components address the mechanisms of change&#xD;
      (barriers and facilitators such as PrEP-related stigma, medical mistrust, concerns about&#xD;
      cost, etc.) that are related to PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. Culturally congruent&#xD;
      referrals and linkages will also be provided. The proposed study is built on the scientific&#xD;
      premise that peers, especially close friends, have a strong influence on health behaviors,&#xD;
      through their communication about attitudes toward health topics such as PrEP uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research has shown that YBMSM's CFs are particularly helpful in facilitating decisions&#xD;
      about PrEP through providing supportive communication and that using MI can lead to increased&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among Black people living with HIV. 1, 4-7 In our&#xD;
      proposed intervention, the PC will work with the YBMSM and the CF as they grapple with&#xD;
      concerns about PrEP before they decide to access a clinic. Building on our prior research and&#xD;
      collaborations with key community stakeholders providing services to YBMSM and with research&#xD;
      experts, we will develop and pilot test &quot;PrEP-Talk,&quot; a brief 3-session, 4-week dyad-level&#xD;
      intervention, with up to 3 booster sessions on PrEP adherence for any dyad in which the YBMSM&#xD;
      index participant (IP) starts PrEP; the IP is the focus of the intervention. IPs randomized&#xD;
      to the control will receive regular care. We will accomplish our goal with the following&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and manualize &quot;PrEP-Talk,&quot; which aims to increase PrEP uptake and adherence&#xD;
           among YBMSM. This will be done through qualitative formative research (3 focus groups&#xD;
           with 12-18 YBMSM and CF dyads, N=24-36); partnering with our community advisory board&#xD;
           (CAB; comprised of individuals knowledgeable about HIV work with YBMSM); and field tests&#xD;
           of the intervention with 5 YBMSM and CF dyads (N=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine feasibility, acceptability and indicators of preliminary efficacy of &quot;PrEP-Talk&quot;&#xD;
           on PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. This will be accomplished through a&#xD;
           small-scale pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 dyads (YBMSM and CFs) in the&#xD;
           intervention and 30 dyads in the usual care control arm (N=120). We will conduct&#xD;
           assessments of all participants (IPs and CFs) at baseline, 3-months and 6-months&#xD;
           post-baseline. We will collect urine samples as a biomarker of PrEP uptake from all&#xD;
           YBMSM IPs who report use of PrEP in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intervention may increase PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM, thereby helping to&#xD;
      reduce HIV incidence and reducing a critical public health disparity. If the proposed&#xD;
      intervention shows trends for feasibility, acceptability and indicators of preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy for increasing PrEP uptake among YBMSM, we will pursue funding for a full-scale&#xD;
      R01-funded RCT.&#xD;
