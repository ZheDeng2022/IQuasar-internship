  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the potential for alleviation of existential distress through psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions, existential concerns and their impact on health care outcomes of patients and&#xD;
      caregivers have not yet been systematically studied. The aim of this longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      study is to investigate the frequency, longitudinal trajectory and predictive impact of&#xD;
      existential distress on patient- and caregiver-relevant end-of-life outcomes. Further, it&#xD;
      aims to determine the need for and utilization of psychosocial support in patients and&#xD;
      caregivers with regard to existential concerns.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to medical progress and an aging population, the number of patients and caregivers who&#xD;
      face the profound existential challenges of advanced incurable cancer is constantly growing.&#xD;
      Clinically significant existential distress may result from a fear of suffering and perceived&#xD;
      lack of control, fear and uncertainty about the end of life, feelings of burdensomeness or&#xD;
      insufficiency, grief about missed opportunities, and profound loneliness. Such distress may&#xD;
      have a unique and independent contribution to health care outcomes at the end of life.&#xD;
      Despite an increasing interest in existential and palliative care interventions that discuss&#xD;
      such issues openly, a lack of systematic quantitative data on existential distress and&#xD;
      specific support needs hampers clinicians to consequently detect and address existential&#xD;
      needs. This longitudinal study aims to 1) systematically investigate the frequency,&#xD;
      longitudinal trajectory and predictive impact of existential distress on patient- and&#xD;
      caregiver-relevant end-of-life outcomes and 2) determine patients' and caregivers' specific&#xD;
      need for and utilization of psychosocial support with respect to existential concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients diagnosed with advanced cancer and caregivers will be consecutively recruited&#xD;
      from outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities of the Univer-sity Cancer Center Hamburg&#xD;
      and affiliated clinics. Existential distress, end-of-life outcomes, and mental disorders in&#xD;
      1,000 participants (500 patients, 500 care-givers) will be assessed using self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires at five points of assessment over a period of 12 months and diagnostic&#xD;
      interviews (at baseline, after six months). To determine the prevalence of existential&#xD;
      distress, mental disorders and palliative care outcomes descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      calculated. Descriptive analyses will also be used to examine the need for and utilization of&#xD;
      psychosocial support. To investigate the predictive impact of existential distress and&#xD;
      patient- and caregiver-relevant end-of-life outcomes multiple linear and logistic regression&#xD;
      will be conducted. To analyze longitudinal trajectory of existential distress growth mixture&#xD;
      models will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shaping a clear and systematic knowledge about frequent and persistent existential concerns&#xD;
      that are most relevant to the risk for unfavorable end-of-life outcomes, results will&#xD;
      significantly contribute to the recognition and manage-ment of existential distress and&#xD;
      provide a valuable basis for the development of targeted interventions.&#xD;
