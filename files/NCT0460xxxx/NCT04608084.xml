      The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of topical administration&#xD;
      of autologous platelet rich plasma as monotherapy for the treatment of symptoms and clinical&#xD;
      signs in cases affected by moderate to severe forms of ocular surface disease&#xD;

      Background Ocular Surface Disease (OSD) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and&#xD;
      tears that produce symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with&#xD;
      potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear&#xD;
      film and inflammation of the ocular surface. The prevalence of Ocular surface disease&#xD;
      reported in the literature up to 30% of the elderly population. There are two main mechanisms&#xD;
      that explain this ocular surface dysfunction: aqueous deficiency and excessive evaporation of&#xD;
      the tear film. The aqueous deficient dry eye disease is characterized by an insufficient&#xD;
      volume of tears due to dysfunction of the lacrimal glands and obstruction of the lacrimal&#xD;
      ducts. This mechanism is also related to autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome,&#xD;
      Lupus, and Rheumatoid arthritis. Meibomian gland dysfunction, eyelid problems (infrequent&#xD;
      blinking, entropion, ectropion) are typical causes of evaporative dry eye. Poor tear film&#xD;
      quality is the result of tear hyperosmolarity and goblet cell mucin deficiency. Ocular&#xD;
      surface disease can also arise as iatrogenic complication after external or internal ocular&#xD;
      surgery, laser treatment, radiation, chemotherapy or ocular medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating ocular surface diseases can be challenging and treatment usually depends on the&#xD;
      underlining etiology and can be divided into medical treatment and surgical solutions. Non&#xD;
      preserved artificial tears are usually the first line treatment for OSD associated with&#xD;
      aqueous deficiency and anti-inflammatory drops like steroids, lifitegrast 5% (Xiidra-shire)&#xD;
      and cyclosporin 0.05% (Restasis - allergan) often accompanied for treating the underling&#xD;
      inflammatory process, However, none of these treatment includes essential tear components&#xD;
      such as growth factors, vitamins, and immunoglobulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoderivatives drops such as autologous serum (AS) have been recommended for the treatment&#xD;
      of several ocular surface disturbances, such as Sjögren's syndrome-related tear deficiency,&#xD;
      non-Sjögren's tear deficiency associated with graft-versus-host disease, neurotrophic&#xD;
      keratitis, persistent epithelial defects, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, as well as a&#xD;
      supportive measure in ocular surface reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich plasma (PRP) has been reported as successful treatments for moderate to severe&#xD;
      OSD caused by dry eye, presenting advantages over AS due to its richer concentration of&#xD;
      growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and other platelet derivatives. The high&#xD;
      concentration of platelets obtained through a relatively simple process, which requires&#xD;
      minimal manipulation and no addition of any other substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies have shown that these components help in the proliferation, migration, and&#xD;
      differentiation of corneal epithelial cells, which is beneficial for the required ocular&#xD;
      surface restoration in moderate to severe forms of OSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigated product Name Autologous Platelet rich plasma Indications Ocular surface diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation and handling&#xD;
&#xD;
      For preparation of autologous PRP eye drops, dedicated closed system &quot;ECLIPSE PRP PLATELET&#xD;
      PREPARATION SYSTEM&quot; which is health Canada approved, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      peripheral blood from participants own antecubital vein will be collected into 12 mL tube,&#xD;
      then it will be centrifuged at 580× g for 8 min at room temperature in an Eclipse System&#xD;
      centrifuge &quot;ECLIPSE EASY SPIN&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole column of PRP will be collected after centrifugation, avoiding the buffy coat that&#xD;
      contains the leukocytes, using a sterile 10ml syringe, then the product is divided into 10&#xD;
      vials of 1ml each through a closed system. The vials will be given to the patient in a sealed&#xD;
      box with ice packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Patient selection Inclusion criteria: Potential patients diagnosed with OSD will&#xD;
      be identified at Dr. Slomovic's Cornea clinic at Toronto Western Hospital. Patients will be&#xD;
      included when the fluorescein corne-conjunctival staining score is 5 or more as determined by&#xD;
      NEI/Industry Grading System17 and OSDI questionnaire score of 20 or more, after treatment&#xD;
      with non-preserved artificial tears 4/day for at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded when they are under the age of 18 years or incapacitated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If both eyes in one patient meet the inclusion criteria, the eye with higher corneal&#xD;
      fluorescein staining score will be enrolled and analyzed for the study (although both eyes&#xD;
      will be subject to treatment). If both eyes have the same score, the right eye will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, 100 participants will be enrolled. Main steps of the study&#xD;
      Step 1: Recruitment, consenting the participant Step 2: Baseline evaluation and PRP&#xD;
      preparation visit Step 3: Treatment effect monitoring visit, 6 weeks post treatment&#xD;
      initiation Step 4: Follow-up visit, 6 weeks post treatment completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, consenting the participant Following clinical evaluation, the ophthalmologist&#xD;
      decides if the patient meets the study criteria. If the prospective participant is eligible&#xD;
      and interested in the project, a qualified member of the team will explain the benefits and&#xD;
      risks of the trial and obtain informed consent, the patient will have the right to refuse&#xD;
      participating in the study and will have time to ask questions regarding the study. Patient&#xD;
      could advice his family and friends before signing the informed consent. patient will have no&#xD;
      time limit for signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, 6-week and 12 weeks assessment Prior to baseline assessment, informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks post finishing the treatment. The&#xD;
      following will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjective dry eye symptoms as assessed by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The noninvasive tear film break-up time (TFBUT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aqueous tear secretion as evaluated by Schirmer I test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Corneo-conjunctival staining scores graded by NEI/Industry Grading System after 1%&#xD;
           fluorescein dye staining&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tear film osmolarity with a lab-on-a-chip technique (TearLab; TearLab Corporation, San&#xD;
           Diego, CA, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Central corneal sensitivity test by Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-weeks visit, participant will be asked to answer a compliance questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The enrolled participants will commence topical application of autologous PRP drops&#xD;
      4 times per day for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of any other topical medications treating the patient ocular surface will not&#xD;
      be allowed during the study period.&#xD;
