  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iREACH is a five-year NIH funded study aimed at assessing and improving pediatric clinician&#xD;
      adherence to the 2017 NIAID Prevention of Peanut Allergy (PPA) Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iREACH has been developed as an electronic health record (EHR) integrated Clinical Decision&#xD;
      Support (CDS) tool together with educational modules on the PPA guidelines to assist&#xD;
      clinicians in implementing the 2017 NIAID PPA Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A practice-based, two-arm, cluster-randomized clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of iREACH in increasing pediatric clinician adherence to the PPA Guidelines and explore the&#xD;
      end-goal of reducing peanut allergy incidence by age 2.5 years in the intervention vs control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to: 1) provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of iREACH in&#xD;
      promoting clinical processes and outcomes related to the PPA Guidelines, 2) provide important&#xD;
      insight about practice-based implementation of PPA Guidelines by pediatric clinicians,&#xD;
      allergists and caregivers, and 3) facilitate rapid, widespread implementation of PPA&#xD;
      Guidelines and reduce peanut allergy incidence across the US.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 30 pediatric practice sites will be randomized to the iREACH intervention arm or&#xD;
      to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To determine the effectiveness of iREACH in increasing adherence to the PPA&#xD;
      Guidelines among pediatric clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective To determine the effectiveness of iREACH in decreasing the incidence of&#xD;
      peanut allergy by age 2.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine allergists' adherence to the PPA Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify common barriers/facilitators for PPA Guideline adherence among pediatric&#xD;
           clinicians and caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine caregiver adherence to the PPA Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric clinicians within each participating practice (nâ‰ˆ200 total) will be assigned to&#xD;
      the arm to which their practice is randomized. The trial will be conducted over an 18-month&#xD;
      period. During this time, approximately 500 high-risk infants and 10,000 low-risk infants are&#xD;
      expected to be seen for 4- and 6-month well child care visit (WCC). The primary outcome,&#xD;
      pediatric clinician adherence to the PPA Guidelines, will be assessed using EHR data for each&#xD;
      infant following the 6-month WCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the secondary outcome will be obtained by a combination of EHR data extracted after&#xD;
      the infant's 6-month WCC and data collected from caregivers. EHR data extraction will be&#xD;
      performed to obtain data from the infant's 9-, 12-, 15-, 18-, 24-month WCC and any sick&#xD;
      visits and allergist progress notes entered from 4-30 months of age. Caregivers' data will be&#xD;
      collected via surveys of caregivers of children seen for 4- or 6-month WCC visits during the&#xD;
      study period. Caregivers will be recruited and asked to provide informed consent at the time&#xD;
      of the child's first birthday and questions will be asked to determine the incidence of&#xD;
      peanut allergy. A follow-up survey will be sent to caregivers after the child's second&#xD;
      birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for exploratory outcomes will be obtained through EHR data extraction and surveys of&#xD;
      pediatric clinicians and the caregivers of infants seen for 4- or 6-month WCC. Pediatric&#xD;
      clinicians in the intervention arm will be asked to provide informed consent and will&#xD;
      complete three surveys over approximately 21 months. Pediatric clinicians in the control arm&#xD;
      will be asked to provide informed consent following completion of data collection for the&#xD;
      primary outcome and will complete one survey. Finally, caregivers, through the two surveys&#xD;
      conducted at the time of their child's first and second birthdays, will provide information&#xD;
      for exploratory outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the percentage of infants within each trial arm whose pediatric clinician adhered to the guidelines regarding peanut introduction assessed after completion of either a 4- or 6-month WCC. The primary endpoint concerns only the peanut introduction recommendation by the treating pediatric clinician and not additional behavior by the treating allergist or by caregivers. The primary endpoint will be measured separately by risk category as follows:&#xD;
% of infants at low risk for peanut allergy whose pediatric clinician adhered to the guidelines for that infant.&#xD;
% of infants at high risk for peanut allergy whose pediatric clinician adhered to the guidelines for that infant.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint is the incidence of peanut allergy by age 2.5 years and is assessed through a combination of parent survey data and extracted EHR data. Secondary endpoints will be measured separately by risk category as follows:&#xD;
% of infants at low risk for peanut allergy who developed peanut allergy by age 2.5.&#xD;
