  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial looks at how well a distress reduction intervention, called &quot;Being Present&quot;, works&#xD;
      to improve the quality of life of patients with BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms&#xD;
      (MPNs) or chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who are taking tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKIs) and their caregivers. Mindfulness meditation is the practice of repeatedly&#xD;
      bringing attention back to the immediate experience and may help people cope with various&#xD;
      types of illness, stress, and worry. This may help patients and caregivers to gradually learn&#xD;
      to disconnect from reacting to and dwelling on the past and future and instead fully&#xD;
      experiencing the present moment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To tailor the Being Present intervention to BCR-ABL-negative MPN and CP-CML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the feasibility of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program with&#xD;
      live webinars among BCR-ABL-negative MPN patients and their caregivers, and CP-CML patients&#xD;
      on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and CP-CML patients in treatment-free remission (TFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the acceptability of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program&#xD;
      with live webinars among BCR-ABL-negative MPN patients and their caregivers, CP-CML patients&#xD;
      on TKIs, CP-CML patients on TKIs, and CP-CML patients in TFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate for differences in the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week web-based&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation program with live webinars:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Based on demographic or clinicopathologic factors. Ib. In patients versus caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate for differences in the preliminary efficacy an 8-week web-based mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation program with live webinars:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Based on demographic or clinicopathologic factors. IIb. In BCR-ABL-negative patients&#xD;
      versus caregivers. IIc. In BCR-ABL-negative patient-caregiver pairs versus unpaired patients.&#xD;
      IId. Based on level of adherence to the practice instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and caregivers receive Being Present intervention consisting of online audio-based&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation exercise over 15 minutes at least 5 times per week, daily meditation&#xD;
      reminders, and online webinars over 30-60 minutes every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up at 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>This single-item inventory uses an analog graphic to allow patients to assess their overall distress with a score range of 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress). A score of 4 or higher to differentiate clinically significant distress. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS anxiety scale is a 8 item scale which measures a participants anxiety based on their response to anxiety related items. Each item response ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (always)Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results. Raw scores ranging from 8 - 40 are converted to scaled scores to determine a standardized anxiety score with higher scores indicating a greater anxiety. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 has been developed as a quantitative measure of health-related quality of life for use in clinical trials of cancer patients. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The MPN-SAF TSS is 10-item questionnaire is recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for the assessment of symptom burden at baseline and monitoring symptom status during the course of treatment with individual item scores ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). Total Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a greater number of symptoms and severity. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CML24 assessment consists of 24 items measuring the following aspects: Symptom Burden, Impact on Daily Life, Impact on Worry/Mood, Body Image Problems, Satisfaction with Care and Satisfaction with Social Life. This scale includes 24 items with responses ranging from a score of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The CQOLC is a self-administered scale specifically designed to evaluate cancer patient caregiver quality of life. This scale includes 35 items with responses ranging from a score of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total possible score is 140, with higher scores representing better quality of life. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ-SF assessment measures five facets of mindfulness: Observing, Describing, Acting with Awareness, Non-Judging of inner experience, and Non-Reactivity to inner experience. The score of each facet is computed by summing the 3 items assigned to the facet which asks the individual to rate which response represents your own opinion of what is generally true for you. Each statement (item) has scores ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true), for a total of 15 points per facet. Paired t-tests will compare validated survey results.</description>
