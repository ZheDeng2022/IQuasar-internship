  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators propose a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      varenicline added to group behavioral and texting support will be well tolerated and improve&#xD;
      vaping cessation rates over behavioral treatment alone in nicotine-dependent adolescents who&#xD;
      vape, do not smoke, and want to quit. To do so, the investigators propose to enroll 300&#xD;
      adolescents in Greater Boston meeting these criteria in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group, study of varenicline up to 1 mg bid for 12 weeks added to 12 weeks of group&#xD;
      behavioral and texting support specifically designed for teen vaping cessation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrollees will include 300 nicotine dependent adolescents in Greater Boston who vape, do not&#xD;
      smoke, and want to quit. The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      study of varenicline up to 1 mg bid for 12 weeks added to 12 weeks of group behavioral and&#xD;
      texting support specifically designed for teen vaping cessation. The study consists of one&#xD;
      enrollment visit, one baseline visit, twelve weekly group treatment sessions, and two&#xD;
      bi-monthly follow up visits at 14 and 16 weeks. At the enrollment visit, participants will&#xD;
      complete interviews, questionnaires and diagnostic assessments, as well as urine sample and&#xD;
      vitals. At the baseline visit, participants will complete several interviews, questionnaires,&#xD;
      provide a saliva sample for cotinine measurement, and be randomized to the varenicline&#xD;
      treatment group or placebo treatment group. Study staff will distribute varenicline or&#xD;
      identically appearing placebo with instructions on how to take the study medication at weeks&#xD;
      0, 2, 4 and 8. Participants will be instructed to all empty and unused study medication at&#xD;
      each study visit through Week 12. At the weekly treatment meetings, participants will&#xD;
      participate in cognitive behavioral therapy and complete questionnaires. Follow up visits&#xD;
      will consist of interviews, questionnaires and a saliva sample.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, in blocks of 6, to double-blind varenicline or identical placebo prepared by the MGH research pharmacy. Randomization will be computer generated by the MGH Biostatistics Center by personnel with no other interactions with study staff or participants and provided to the Research Pharmacy. The randomization code will be held in the MGH Biostatistics Center and MGH research pharmacy and available to study PI only in the case of urgent medical need. Assessments will be conducted by study staff blind to the study intervention. Treatment will be assigned according to study number, assigned sequentially to eligible participants.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nicotine withdrawal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms will be assessed using the Minnesota Withdrawal Scale (MNWS), a 9-item self-rated scale of urge to smoke (craving); depressed mood; irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; increased appetite; difficulty going to sleep; difficulty staying asleep, on an ordinal scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme). It will be administered at enrollment and each subsequent study visit.</description>

    <measure>Intensity of nicotine craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-week 12</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of nicotine craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week12</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of nicotine cravings will be assessed using the Questionnaire of Vaping Craving (QVC), a 10-item, valid and reliable measure of vaping craving that queries desire and intent to vape and anticipation of positive outcomes related to e-cigarette use, on an ordinal scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). It will be administered at enrollment and each subsequent study visit.</description>

    <measure>Severity of clinical symptoms (mood and anxiety)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-week 16</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ-D30), is a 30-item adaptation of the 96 item MASQ that is quick, valid and reliable assessment of depression and anxiety in adolescents, with answers on a ordinal scale from Not at all/slightly to Extremely. It will be administered at each study visit to follow participants' mood symptoms over time during the intervention and follow up.</description>
