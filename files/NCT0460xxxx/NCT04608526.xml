  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chewing, a movement that matures with experiences, has effects on the growth and development&#xD;
      of the stomatognathic system. Tooth decay, which is known to have effects on chewing, can&#xD;
      affect the jaw bone due to its indirect effect on the mechanical forces transmitted to the&#xD;
      jaw bone. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between dental caries and jaw&#xD;
      bone trabeculation during the growth and development processes in children by fractal&#xD;
      dimension analysis method. 40 patients with deep-dentin caries / apical rarefying osteitis on&#xD;
      the right or left side, 40 patients with deep-dentin caries / apical rarefying osteitis on&#xD;
      either the right and left sides and 40 patients without deep-dentin caries / apical rarefying&#xD;
      osteitis between 8-13 ages were randomly selected. Digital panoramic images of the selected&#xD;
      patients were analyzed with fractal dimension analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Digital panoramic radiographs of the patients included in the study were recorded in high resolution TIF (tagged image file) format to ensure standardization of the images and adjusted to 2836 x 1500 pixels. ImageJ version 1.53a, and bundled with 64-bit Java for Windows (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) were used for fractal analysis of the images.&#xD;
Fractal analysis on digital panoramic radiographs transferred to ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) program, 3 ROI (region of interest) areas of 15x15 pixels were determined for each patient with condyle, antegonial notch in the right and left hemimandible and in the center of the ramus.The number of frames containing the trabecular structure and the total number of frames were calculated for different dimensions. The values were transferred to the logarithmic scale and the slope of the curve fitting the points on the graph gave the result of the fractal measurement.</description>

    <description>Fractal dimension (FD) analysis, which can be measured in panoramic radiographs, is a technique that can be used to measure mandibular trabecular architecture and to determine early periodontal changes in alveolar bone. Fractal analysis method, which has become more and more popular in recent years; has features such as being easily accessible, not being affected by variables such as projection geometry and radiological density and providing objective data about trabecular structures. It can be measured in the patients' existing panoramic images and does not require extra imaging and material.</description>
