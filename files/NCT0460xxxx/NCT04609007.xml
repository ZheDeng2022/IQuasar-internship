      The current study is a pragmatic randomized pilot trial examining the feasibility and effects&#xD;
      of a brief therapist guided online self-help program based on Cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) . Participants will be randomized to either a treatment as usual condition (TAU) or to&#xD;
      TAU plus CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via the Swedish national gambling helpline. After assessment&#xD;
      for eligibility participants will be randomized, using block randomization to ensure balanced&#xD;
      groups, to either TAU or TAU+CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be measured; at baseline, weekly during the intervention (6 weeks),&#xD;
      immediately after the intervention and at 6 weeks after treatment termination. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be collected prior any data collection.&#xD;
