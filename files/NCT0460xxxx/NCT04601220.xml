  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-harm is when somebody hurts their body as a way of coping with difficult feelings.&#xD;
      Self-harm is becoming increasingly common in young people, particularly in adolescent&#xD;
      females. The rise in self-harm has been linked to increasing use of social media and internet&#xD;
      technology among young people. However, the evidence is limited to associations with poorer&#xD;
      mental health outcomes rather than identifying particular aspects of using these technologies&#xD;
      that can negatively impact on mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate how use of social media and smartphones may increase the risk&#xD;
      of self-harm in young people by exploring changes in usage in the time leading up to a&#xD;
      self-harm episode. The information from this study will be useful for understanding whether&#xD;
      there are certain behaviours that are likely to occur before a young person has an episode of&#xD;
      self-harm. This could be used to inform new strategies to identify and ensure support is&#xD;
      available to vulnerable young people. This could be by linking young people with crisis&#xD;
      support or empowering young people to make changes, manage their own risks and build&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve young people aged between 13-25 years old who have accessed mental&#xD;
      health services in London. Young people will be invited to provide a range of information&#xD;
      about their mental health and use of social media and smartphones that will be routinely&#xD;
      obtained over the course of a year.&#xD;
