      50 females will be included in this study. they will be divided into 2 groups (study group&#xD;
      which will include 25 postmenopausal females - and control group which will include&#xD;
      premenopausal females) For testing gustatory function, a whole mouth above threshold taste&#xD;
      test will be carried out in which a concentration of sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid&#xD;
      and quinine hydrochloride solutions were used for sweet, salty, sour and bitter types of&#xD;

      50 females will be included in this study. they will be divided into 2 groups (study group&#xD;
      which will include 25 postmenopausal females - and control group which will include&#xD;
      premenopausal females)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For testing gustatory function, a whole mouth above threshold taste test will be carried out&#xD;
      in which a concentration of sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride&#xD;
      solutions were used for sweet, salty, sour and bitter types of taste respectively . Five&#xD;
      concentration levels (in ½ log steps) of sodium chloride (0.01-1.0 mM), citric acid&#xD;
      (0.32-0.032 mol l-1), quinine hydrochloride (0.01- 1.0 mM) and sucrose (0.01-1.0 mM) will be&#xD;
      prepared in 5 ml samples. All the solutions will be made with distilled water. The intensity&#xD;
      threshold of taste perception of each solution will be determined by scoring the lowest&#xD;
      concentration as 5' and the highest concentration as 1'. The solutions will be given in&#xD;
      increasing concentrations. The patient then should identify the quality (salty, sour, sweet,&#xD;
      bitter or tasteless) and intensity of each test solution . Quality judgments for each&#xD;
      solution will be coded as correct, incorrect or tasteless by asking subjects to name the&#xD;
      taste they perceived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva will be collected in the morning between 9:00 am and 11:00 am. Patient will be&#xD;
      instructed to stop eating and drinking at least 2 h before sample collection. Chewing 1 g of&#xD;
      gum base will be used to stimulate salivary flow. The saliva that will be collected for the&#xD;
      first 2 min will be discarded, and then Stimulated whole saliva will be collected for the&#xD;
      next 10 min with the mechanical chewing stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two milliliters of Stimulated whole saliva from each participant will be collected and added&#xD;
      to RNA stabilizing solution and used for RNA extraction. The SWS samples will be centrifuged&#xD;
      at 10,000 g for 20 min at 48C to remove any cellular debris. The clarified supernatants will&#xD;
      be aliquoted and frozen at 70 C for analytic experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this is to determination of oral mucosal epithelial MUC1 expression level&#xD;
