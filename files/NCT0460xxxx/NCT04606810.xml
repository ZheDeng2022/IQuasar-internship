  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management is critical for patients with chronic conditions such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Such management requires that patients understand what to do to best manage their&#xD;
      condition. This study will use a randomized controlled study design to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      a new educational intervention consisting of an educational digital video disc (DVD) and a&#xD;
      self-management support session/teleconference with a multidisciplinary team of health care&#xD;
      providers for patients (n=150) with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) starting on or changing&#xD;
      biologic agents. This study aims to test whether this intervention improves behavioural&#xD;
      intentions, knowledge, and medication adherence three months post-intervention and whether&#xD;
      acquired knowledge is retained six months after the intervention. This project will allow to&#xD;
      quantify the impact of the educational intervention on patients' behavioural intentions in&#xD;
      practical situations using an existing validated questionnaire called BioSecure. The impact&#xD;
      of the educational intervention on disease-specific knowledge and on medication adherence&#xD;
      will be evaluated using validated questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine whether patients with active RA starting&#xD;
      or changing biological agents demonstrate better self-care safety skills in practical&#xD;
      situations using the BioSecure questionnaire three months after receiving a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      educational intervention, as compared to patients who received usual care. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives were to assess the impact of the educational intervention on behavioral intentions&#xD;
      and beliefs and adherence to RA medications in patients receiving the intervention compared&#xD;
      to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design This was a pilot, unblinded, randomized study. Participants in group 1 received&#xD;
      the usual care plus the multidisciplinary educational intervention at baseline. Participants&#xD;
      in group 2 first received usual care, and after 3 months were offered the intervention. The&#xD;
      patients' self-care safety skills was measured using the BioSecure questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      behavioral intentions and beliefs with respect to medications was assessed using structured&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 6 months. With the participant authorization, data on RA&#xD;
      medication adherence, i.e. biological agents and other non-biologic Disease-modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs (nbDMARDs) was obtained for the 3 months preceding enrollment and up to&#xD;
      6 months afterwards using their pharmacy records.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline knowledge on self-care safety skills at 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the knowledge on self-care safety skills, the BioSecure questionnaire was used. This 55-item questionnaire measures the self-care safety skills of patients treated by biologic agent by the use of both knowledge and coping items. This questionnaire mainly contains true or false questions to assess patient's knowledge. Each good answer is given one point. The sum of points is then transformed into a percentage. A value of 100% represents a patient with perfect knowledge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of behavioral intention</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of baseline behavioral intention at 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>According to published data on the Theory of Planned Behavior, a questionnaire to evaluate behavioral intention was developed, focussing on the appropriate or inappropriate intention to take an injection of a biologic agent while presenting symptoms of infection. It comprises 12 questions to be answered by the use of a 7-point Likert scale, from &quot;Completely disagree&quot; to &quot;Completely agree&quot;. High values correspond to good attitude, norm, control or intention. There were 2 questions on attitude, 6 questions on perceived norms, 2 questions on perceived behavioral control, 1 question on intention, and 1 question on past behavior. Intention was dichotomized for analysis purpose, with values 1 to 3 considered as health-promoting intentions, while values 4 to 7 were health-damaging intentions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of medication beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of baseline medication beliefs at 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>For medication beliefs, the Belief about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) was adapted from the literature to RA medication. This questionnaire consists of 18 questions to evaluate the four sub-scales of the BMQ, ie specific-necessity (5 questions), specific-concern (5 questions), general-harm (4 questions), and general-overuse (4 questions), to be completed by selecting one item among five choices from &quot;completely agree&quot; to &quot;completely disagree&quot;. The score of each subscale is the sum of its items, and thus has a maximum value of 25 or 20 points depending on its number of items. A high value corresponds to greater necessity, concern, harm or overuse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of medication adherence from 3 months before the study to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence was assessed using pharmacy records data. The proportion of adherence was calculated by dividing the quantity received by the quantity prescribed, separately for biologic agents and nbDMARDs, for each month starting 3 months before enrolment until 6 months after. For each time period (3 months before the study to baseline, baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months), the mean proportion of adherence per medication was then calculated taking the mean of all months included in each of the three periods. For each of these periods, the patient was considered to be adherent if the mean was equal to 100%. However, sensitivity analyses for adherence were also conducted using a threshold greater or equal to 80%, which is used in most clinical studies</description>

    <description>At randomization, participants in arm 1 received the educational DVD with the instruction to review its contents within the next two weeks. Between 2 and 4 weeks after randomization, reinforcement teleconferences were done in small groups of 10 participants maximum per session with every participant who mentioned having watched the DVD. Each participant attended only to one teleconference. Usual care consisted in regular follow-up with the treating rheumatologist and possibility of asking questions of the rheumatology nurse by phone.</description>
