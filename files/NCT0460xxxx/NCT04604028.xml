      Considering that lenalidomide and cyclophosphamide are found to have anti-tumor effects in&#xD;
      MALT lymphoma, the investigators speculated that combined lenalidomide and low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide can increase the overall response rate as well as dural time of tumor&#xD;
      remission, and avoid alternative treatments, including radiotherapy or chemotherapy-related&#xD;
      adverse effects in antibiotics-unresponsive, relapsed or refractory extranodal MALT lymphoma.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this proposal, the investigators will design a prospective phase II study to&#xD;
      evaluate the treatment efficacies of combination of oral lenalidomide and low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (LC: lenalidomide [Leavdo®] 15 mg daily, day 1 to day 21; cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      [Endoxan] 50 mg daily, day 1 to day 21; courses will be repeated every 28 days) in patients&#xD;
      with antibiotics-unresponsive, relapsed or refractory extranodal MALT lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [Background]: In addition to Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric marginal zone B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (named as MALT lymphoma) (Sci Rep.&#xD;
      2017;7(1):14333), the investigators recently demonstrated that first-line antibiotics&#xD;
      treatments can cure around 50% patients with stage IE/IIE1 extragastric MALT lymphoma (2018&#xD;
      ESMO poster discussion). However, the optimal management for antibiotics-unresponsive MALT&#xD;
      lymphomas is not clearly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Rationale]: The investigators previously reported that thalidomide resulted in an overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR, including complete remission [CR] and partial remission [PR]) of 50% in&#xD;
      10 patients with antibiotics-unresponsive or chemotherapy-resistant MALT lymphoma.&#xD;
      Lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory derivatives [IMiDs] of thalidomide) exhibits&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects and has been proved efficacies in the treatment&#xD;
      of multiple myeloma (MM). In the previous phase II study, single agent of lenalidomide&#xD;
      resulted in ORR of 61.1% in 18 patients with MALT lymphoma. In addition to kill lymphoma&#xD;
      cells, single low-dose cyclophosphamide, is an option for restoring immune response in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer. The investigators also showed that low-dose cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (50 mg daily for 21 days, every 28 days) alone resulted in the ORR of 44.4 % in 9 patients&#xD;
      with antibiotics-unresponsive MALT lymphoma. Previous studies also demonstrated that the&#xD;
      addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide can overcome lenalidomide resistance in patients with&#xD;
      MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Hypotheses]: Considering that lenalidomide and cyclophosphamide are found to have anti-tumor&#xD;
      effects in MALT lymphoma, the investigators speculated that combined lenalidomide and&#xD;
      low-dose cyclophosphamide can increase the ORR rate as well as dural time of tumor remission,&#xD;
      and avoid alternative treatments, including radiotherapy or chemotherapy-related adverse&#xD;
      effects in antibiotics-unresponsive, relapsed or refractory extranodal MALT lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Methods]: Therefore, in this proposal, the investigators will design a prospective phase II&#xD;
      study to evaluate the treatment efficacies of combination of oral lenalidomide and low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (LC: lenalidomide [Leavdo®] 15 mg daily, day 1 to day 21; cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      [Endoxan] 50 mg daily, day 1 to day 21; courses will be repeated every 28 days) in patients&#xD;
      with antibiotics-unresponsive, relapsed or refractory extranodal MALT lymphoma. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of this current study is ORR, and the second endpoint is adverse effect. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 21 patients with antibiotics-unresponsive, relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      MALT lymphoma based on the Simon minimax two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational studies, including predictive markers and immunological profiles&#xD;
      (BAFF-related canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling molecules, and immune-related&#xD;
      molecules markers) will be included in the second points. The investigators will further&#xD;
      assess immune-related molecules of nucleated cells of whole blood using flow cytometry, and&#xD;
      analyze serum BAFF and cytokines.&#xD;
