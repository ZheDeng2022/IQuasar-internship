  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/IIa clinical trial investigating the safety of a lentiviral epilepsy gene&#xD;
      therapy using an engineered potassium channel in patients with refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy affects about 1% of the population. One third of affected individuals continue to&#xD;
      have seizures despite optimal medication. The only realistic prospect of seizure freedom,&#xD;
      feasible in very few cases, is surgery to remove the brain area where seizures arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory neocortical epilepsy who are being evaluated for surgical resection&#xD;
      of the seizure focus will be invited to join the trial. The non-integrating lentiviral&#xD;
      vector, which has been engineered to deliver an engineered potassium channel, will be&#xD;
      administered via intracerebral infusion to the area scheduled for resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective in this study is to test the safety of the lentiviral gene therapy&#xD;
      treatment, including the surgical procedures required for vector administration. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will look at delayed onset adverse events and indicators of efficacy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SCREENING/PRE-CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female and male patients with drug-resistant refractory focal neocortical epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aged â‰¥ 18 years (no upper age limit but deemed medically fit for surgery with a life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 5 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Being considered for resective brain surgery (to remove the epileptogenic focus) based&#xD;
             on first-stage preoperative assessments carried out as part of routine clinical care&#xD;
             within 2 years of registration, showing: 3.1. Absence of vascular brain lesions or&#xD;
             vascular malformations and/or cancer in the resection area (as confirmed on MRI) 3.2.&#xD;
             Absence of active, untreated psychiatric disease in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             clinician (as confirmed by neuropsychiatric assessment) 3.3. Patient requires&#xD;
             second-stage investigations carried out as part of routine clinical care (intracranial&#xD;
             EEG) to further assess eligibility for resective brain surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             PRE-REGISTRATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Following consent, patients undergo intracranial EEG investigations, and only those&#xD;
             patients in whom the seizure focus can be identified and are deemed eligible for&#xD;
             resective brain surgery can continue to registration provided they continue to meet&#xD;
             all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Please note, we will attempt to recruit from&#xD;
             both sexes, but will give priority to patients where the focus is clear, and&#xD;
             accessible to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Deemed medically fit for anaesthesia and surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients of childbearing potential (WOCBP), or male patients with female&#xD;
             partners who are WOCBP or pregnant must agree to use highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception from the time consent is signed until three months after treatment. Men&#xD;
             (if applicable), must also advise their female partners regarding contraceptive&#xD;
             requirements as listed for female patients who are WOCBP or pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patients who are WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior&#xD;
             to being registered&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients will be asked about the donation of resected brain tissue for translational&#xD;
             work (only applicable if they later proceed with surgery) during informed consent, but&#xD;
             this is optional i.e. patients may still join the trial if they do not consent to the&#xD;
             donation of resected brain tissue for translational work&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able and willing to give written informed consent to join trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Failure to identify a single region of seizure onset in the neocortex with a surface&#xD;
             area of less than 16 cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Vascular brain lesions or vascular malformations in area of planned resection&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Allergies to excipients of gene therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient unlikely to cooperate with a 5-year follow-up; medical or psychological&#xD;
             condition at the discretion of the investigator which would not permit compliance with&#xD;
             the protocol or meaningful written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other known condition which is assessed as an intolerable risk by the investigator&#xD;
