  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot efficacy study is to examine the effects of EMG-biofeedback&#xD;
      (EMG-BF) on pain-related outcomes in Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG-BF facilitates neuromuscular retraining and muscle relaxation by using audio and visual&#xD;
      stimuli using an EMG surface electrode-based biosensor and a software installed on a tablet&#xD;
      or smart phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, we will recruit 80 patients with CLBP (for at least 6 months but no longer&#xD;
      than 10 years), aged 18-65 years old and with minimum score of &gt;3 on pain visual analog&#xD;
      scale. Patients with recent low back surgery, a comorbid chronic pain condition more painful&#xD;
      that CLBP, a non-mechanical contributing cause for lower back pain, implanted medical&#xD;
      devices, medical conditions known to influence quantitative sensory testing (QST) or the EMG&#xD;
      intervention, severe psychiatric disorders will be excluded from this study. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the JOGO Digital Therapeutics EMG Biofeedback device or&#xD;
      treatment as usual control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the intervention group will be asked to complete self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing demographics, pain intensity, negative affect, physical function,&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing and sleep, will undergo QST and will be asked to wear Actiwatches to&#xD;
      keep track of health behaviors, prior to and after completing the intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of 8 weekly sessions during which participants will be instructed on&#xD;
      how to use the device by a trained biofeedback instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will undergo sensory testing procedures at baseline and after 8&#xD;
      weeks but will receive no active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to examine the impact of EMG-BF on pain and QST and the impact of&#xD;
      EMG-BF on psychosocial function. We hypothesize that patients that will undergo the 8-week&#xD;
      EMG-BF will demonstrate reductions in pain, physical functioning, sleep, pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing, anxiety and depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback can be described as &quot;operant conditioning of physiological activity&quot;, by which&#xD;
      &quot;the patient learns to self-regulate his or her physiological processes with the help of&#xD;
      feedback information&quot;, and can comprise different sites, modalities, and procedures.&#xD;
      Biofeedback instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function,&#xD;
      breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature and rapidly and accurately provide feedback&#xD;
      information to the user. There are various aims biofeedback can target, e.g., developing more&#xD;
      awareness or control for physiological processes and thus, consciously reducing muscle&#xD;
      tension. Previous research has shown findings of higher baseline muscle activation and&#xD;
      abnormal EMG as a response to stress in chronic back pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using biofeedback for the treatment of chronic back pain have shown inconsistent&#xD;
      results and it is difficult to draw conclusions based on previous studies due to variability&#xD;
      in sample size and characteristics, biofeedback modality, treatment conditions, and control&#xD;
      groups. Thus, the effectiveness of biofeedback in reducing the symptomatology of back pain&#xD;
      patients remains unclear. The investigators therefore are planning to conduct this pilot&#xD;
      efficacy study, to examine the effects of EMG-biofeedback (EMG-BF) on pain-related outcomes&#xD;
      in a cohort of Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial has two study arms. Participants in the first arm will receive&#xD;
      the experimental condition (EMG-Bf) and those in the second will continue their usual care&#xD;
      and serve as a control group. Both groups will be asked to complete self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires before their first visit and after the last visit at 8 weeks. Further, both&#xD;
      groups will undergo Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) before their first visit and after the&#xD;
      last visit at 8 weeks. The specific aims of this study are to examine the impact of EMG-BF on&#xD;
      pain intensity and sensitivity and on physical functioning, sleep, pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. We will not modify pain medication regimens in any of the trial arms&#xD;
      and no pain medication prescriptions will be issued by the research team at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 2 in-person office visits separated by 8 weekly virtual therapy&#xD;
      sessions. During the in-person visits, participants will undergo sensory testing procedures&#xD;
      described below. On visit 1 a member of the research staff will train patients on the basic&#xD;
      functionality of the JOGO Digital Therapeutics EMG Biofeedback device. Virtual sessions 1-8&#xD;
      will be held via Partners Healthcare Secure Zoom. During these, participants will receive&#xD;
      guided EMG biofeedback intervention with a therapist and will be instructed to use the device&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home practice will be monitored via electronic practice logs recorded on REDcap. Patients&#xD;
      will be trained to relax their muscles under the guidance of a doctorate level therapist by&#xD;
      monitoring progress through virtual feedback in the form of graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual: Patients in this group will undergo sensory testing procedures described&#xD;
      below at baseline and after 8 weeks but will receive no active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG-Biofeedback EMG-BF facilitates neuromuscular retraining and muscle relaxation by using&#xD;
      audio and visual stimuli using an EMG surface electrode-based biosensor and a software&#xD;
      installed on a tablet or smart phone. During the 8 weekly sessions participants will be&#xD;
      instructed on how to use the device by a trained biofeedback instructor. Further, in each&#xD;
      session participants will have the opportunity to discuss possible&#xD;
      difficulties/obstacles/progress using the device. Each session will additionally include&#xD;
      relaxation techniques (such as Progressive Muscle Relaxation). Sessions are estimated to last&#xD;
      40-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) QST is a non-invasive method for measuring&#xD;
      pain sensitivity and pain modulation. Our QST testing protocol will measure mechanical pain&#xD;
      sensitivity (pain threshold). This protocol has been used in various studies the&#xD;
      investigators have conducted in the past. During the psychophysical testing procedures,&#xD;
      participants will be informed that they may terminate the procedure at any time. The&#xD;
      intensity of pain stimulation will be determined for each subject individually to minimize&#xD;
      potential for tissue damage. The methods used have been thoroughly tested and validated for&#xD;
      the study of experimental pain. All subjects will be examined during the study to document&#xD;
      the presence or absence of tissue injury at the sites of noxious stimulation. If there is any&#xD;
      evidence that the protocol causes more than minor, reversible bruising or sensitization, the&#xD;
      protocol will be amended to decrease the frequency and/or intensity of the noxious stimuli.&#xD;
      Outcome monitoring and adverse events will all be reported through appropriate channels of&#xD;
      the Human Studies Committee.&#xD;
