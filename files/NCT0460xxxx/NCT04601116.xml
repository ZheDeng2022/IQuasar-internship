  <brief_summary>

      Given the compelling evidence supporting a protective effect of statins on breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrence, calls for prospective clinical trials have been expressed. In this trial - the&#xD;
      MASTER trial - we hypothesize that the addition of statin treatment to the current breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment will improve the prognosis of women with early breast cancer. This trial is&#xD;
      designed as follows: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison&#xD;
      of standard (neo)adjuvant therapy plus placebo versus standard (neo)adjuvant therapy plus&#xD;
      atorvastatin in patients with early breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins are currently used to lower cholesterol levels and&#xD;
      prevent cardiovascular events. Statins have, however, received substantial scientific&#xD;
      attention as cancer-inhibiting drugs. Previous findings were recently supported in a&#xD;
      large-scaled study again demonstrating the beneficial effects of statins on breast cancer&#xD;
      outcome this time nested within a large, international, randomized clinical trial of modern&#xD;
      adjuvant cancer therapy. Given the compelling evidence supporting a protective effect of&#xD;
      statins on breast cancer recurrence, calls for prospective clinical trials have been&#xD;
      expressed. In this trial - the MASTER trial - we hypothesize that the addition of statin&#xD;
      treatment to the current breast cancer treatment will improve the prognosis of women with&#xD;
      early breast cancer. Thus, the primary objective of the MASTER trial is to determine the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of the statin - atorvastatin - as measured by invasive disease-free&#xD;
      survival among patients with primary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is nationwide throughout Denmark and a total of 3,360 women are to be included in&#xD;
      the trial. Women eligible for the trial have been diagnosed with an estrogen receptor&#xD;
      positive breast cancer and are candidates for systemic cancer therapy, either prior to or&#xD;
      following breast surgery. Upon eligibility and signed informed consent, trial participants&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to either standard treatment and atorvastatin 80 mg/day or&#xD;
      standard treatment and placebo. The randomization is blinded. The treatment with atorvastatin&#xD;
      or placebo will continue for two years unless side effects are experienced and further&#xD;
      treatment with atorvastatin or the placebo is deemed inadequate. The standard treatment will&#xD;
      of course continue as planned. The trial participants will follow the standard clinical&#xD;
      routines in terms of follow-up and in addition they are asked to fill in questionnaires, i.e.&#xD;
      regarding potential side effects or new events or diagnoses, up to ten years following&#xD;
      inclusion. Potential breast cancer recurrences are hereby identified and a follow-up of at&#xD;
      least 61/2 years will be required for the trial the demonstrate the estimated clinical&#xD;
      difference between the randomized groups of patients.&#xD;
