  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are an estimated 65,000 newly diagnosed cases of head and neck cancer each year in the&#xD;
      United States. The most common treatment for head and neck cancers is radiotherapy in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin chemotherapy. This treatment regimen is effective in killing the&#xD;
      tumor; however, the normal tissues that line the mouth and throat can sustain severe injury&#xD;
      from the radiation. Side-effects incurred during irradiation include: mucositis, xerostomia,&#xD;
      swelling, trouble swallowing, pain, infections, cavities, hair loss and reddening of the&#xD;
      skin. Some of these side effects can be so severe that patients require feeding tubes and&#xD;
      management of severe pain can lead to the premature halt of radiotherapy. There are currently&#xD;
      no effective radio-protectors used to ameliorate these severe side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioMimetix has developed small molecular weight superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, BMX-001,&#xD;
      that is a very potent radio-protector of head and neck tissues. In our first clinical trial&#xD;
      in a head and neck cancer patient cohort using this drug, we have early evidence that BMX-001&#xD;
      may protect against radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial to study the effects of&#xD;
      BMX-001 (14 mg/subject biw) + radiation therapy + cisplatin against placebo + radiation&#xD;
      therapy + cisplatin in prevention of acute and chronic mucositis and xerostomia.&#xD;

      This study will seek to confirm protection of normal tissues by assessing the incidence,&#xD;
      severity and duration of mucositis in a randomized, placebo controlled, Phase 2 clinical&#xD;
      trial of BMX-001 in combination with standard RT and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients (162 subjects, 1:1 randomization study drug: placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also confirm protection of normal tissues by assessing the acute and chronic&#xD;
      extent of xerostomia in the same trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>BMX-001</intervention_name>
    <description>BMX-001 consists of a porphyrin ring with pyridyl groups attached at each of the four methane bridge carbons. The nitrogen in the pyridyl ring is at the 2 position and has a side chain consisting of six carbons with an ether linkage. A manganese atom is chelated into the porphyrin ring and is the active center of the molecule. This molecule is an enzymatic scavenger of free radical species operating at close to diffusion-limited rates.</description>
