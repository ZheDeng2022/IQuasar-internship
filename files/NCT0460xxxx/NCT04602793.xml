  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation (LLA) commonly affects young and active people who have long life&#xD;
      expectancy. It is a major surgery causing many functional deficiencies which can reduce&#xD;
      overall health quality and physical condition of the wounded persons and necessitating a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme. High-frequency ultrasonography (US) is useful in&#xD;
      evaluating peripheral nerves because of it has many superiority to other techniques. The&#xD;
      advantages of US is; it has high resolution but no ionized radiation. It is possible to make&#xD;
      dynamic and real-time imaging. It was showed that US have the same specificity and more&#xD;
      sensitivity than magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in evaluating peripheral nerves. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the sciatic, tibial and peroneal nerves of traumatic lower-limb&#xD;
      amputees with the help of sonography and find the relationship between sonographic values and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of thirty-three participants (age range 18-65) who had lower extremity amputation due&#xD;
      to traumatic injury and were followed up in tertiary amputee clinic were included in this&#xD;
      cross-sectional trial. The study was conducted between April 2019 and April 2020.&#xD;
      Participants were totally volunteers and informed about the nature of the study. Written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained prior to assessment from all individuals. The study was&#xD;
      conducted by the latest version of the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki protocol.&#xD;
      All procedures were in consistency with the Helsinki Declarations of 1975. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the local ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had completed stump healing. Patients with any disease affecting the peripheral&#xD;
      nerves (eg, diabetes mellitus, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes, and exposure&#xD;
      to toxins) were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants including age, gender,&#xD;
      amputation findings (etiology, time since amputation, level, and side), prosthesis use&#xD;
      findings (time since prosthesis use, daily use time, type, type of liner, prosthetic foot&#xD;
      type), and functional K level of activity after amputation were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence, etiology, and duration of pain were questioned, and the intensity of pain was&#xD;
      assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs&#xD;
      (LANSS) was used to evaluate neuropathic pain for the residual limb. The patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the current prosthesis was evaluated numerically between 0 (not satisfied&#xD;
      at all) and 10 (completely satisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasonographic examinations were performed by a single physiatrist experienced in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal sonography. A 5-12 MHz linear transducer (Logic e portable; GE Healthcare,&#xD;
      China) was used. To optimize image quality, minimal pressure was applied to the transducer.&#xD;
      Each examination was performed bilaterally while patients were in the prone position. The&#xD;
      full course of the sciatic nerve (SN), tibial nerve (TN), and common peroneal nerve (CPN) was&#xD;
      assessed in a craniocaudal direction starting from the subgluteal fold to the popliteal&#xD;
      fossa. The probe was placed axially on the nerves (perpendicular to the nerve) and the&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured at the same level proximal to the bifurcation for the&#xD;
      SN (Figure 1), and at a point distal to the bifurcation of the SN for the TN and CPN (Figure&#xD;
      2). The values from the normal sides were accepted as controls. The presence of a neuroma was&#xD;
      also evaluated throughout the nerve, particularly at the distal ends.&#xD;
