      The study team will conduct a feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy trial&#xD;
      comparing Learn to Quit-HIV (n=30) to an app based on U.S. Clinical Practice Guidelines only&#xD;
      (NCI QuitGuide; n=30) among HIV-positive smokers. Both apps will be integrated with NRT and&#xD;
      ongoing HIV clinical care.&#xD;
