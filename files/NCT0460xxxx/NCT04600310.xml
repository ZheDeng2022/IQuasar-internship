    <textblock>
      Testing ULTRAPREP (consists of a clear bag sealed on one end with the other end enclosing the&#xD;
      patients extremity) for safety and efficacy to perform skin antisepsis outside the operating&#xD;
      room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if ULTRAPREP is equal to or better than the&#xD;
      conventional methods of preoperative skin antisepsis (the technique of cleansing the skin to&#xD;
      help prevent infection) in surgical cases. The study will also help determine if ULTRAPREP&#xD;
      will decrease the total amount of time in the operating room. The study will focus on whether&#xD;
      or not using ULTRAPREP provides better patient flow and patient safety while improving a&#xD;
      surgical staff's workload and workflow. The study includes 2 study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm #1: the conventional method (or standard of care) will use an accepted skin&#xD;
      disinfectant solution with ChloraPrep (70% isopropyl alcohol and 2% chlorhexidine). The&#xD;
      solution is &quot;painted&quot; on the patient's skin using a sponge on a stick. The application time&#xD;
      is with this method is 3 minutes plus 3 minutes for solution to evaporate. This is a&#xD;
      widely-accepted method used in ORs. The preparation process is performed by surgical staff in&#xD;
      the OR prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm #2: using ULTRAPREP bag containing ChloraPrep (70% isopropyl alcohol and 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine). The bag will be placed on the patient's lower extremity in the holding area.&#xD;
      The lower extremity will be scrubbed for 3 minutes. Once the patient is transferred to the&#xD;
      OR, the solution will be suctioned out of the bag and the bag removed from the lower&#xD;
      extremity to allow the solution to evaporate, this process take 3 minutes. the patient is&#xD;
      then draped for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 57 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile culture swabs will be taken from toenail beds and between toes or from fingernail&#xD;
      beds and between fingers, depending on surgery site. The cultures will be taken preoperative&#xD;
      before any disinfecting has begun and just before patient extremity is draped (after allowing&#xD;
      3 minutes for alcohol in disinfectant to evaporate). These sterile swabs will be taken to the&#xD;
      lab for aliquot culturing to yield 6 pitre dishes for each swab. The CFUs (colony forming&#xD;
      units) from each pitre dish will be counted and analyzed at 48 and 72 hours. A comparison&#xD;
      will be made using the cultures in Arm 1 and Arm 2 to determine if the parameters of the&#xD;
      study has been met.&#xD;

    <description>The preoperative preparation for the control group will use ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol) that will be applied to the skin using a sponge-on-a-stick method; this solution is widely recognized as optimal. After the alcohol-based solution has evaporated (no less than 3 minutes), the patient extremity is draped for surgery.</description>

    <description>ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol) will be poured into the ULTRAPREP bag which will be placed on the patient's extremity while in the holding area; it will be removed only after scrub time of 3 minutes is complete and the patient has been transferred to the OR, anesthetized, and positioned. The patient is draped only after the solution has evaporated (no less than 3 minutes).</description>
