    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, prospective, single-arm, open-Label, single-center study that to find out&#xD;
      (1)The effectiveness and safety of toripalimab combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as&#xD;
      a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced (stage IIB, IIIA, and resectable&#xD;
      stage IIIB) NSCLC, (2)The best treatment time for this combination of neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      before surgery, (3)The effectiveness and safety of combination of neoadjuvant therapy as&#xD;
      salvage neoadjuvant therapy after failure of neoadjuvant chemo-only for locally advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

If the patient is SD or PD, Toripalimab combined with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy in the third cycle will continue, and a total of 4 cycles can be carried out at most, and the therapeutic effect will be evaluated after each cycle of treatment. If the patient is PR or CR at any time during the treatment (after treatment in the third or fourth cycle), the surgical treatment will be entered. If PR or CR is still not reached after treatment in the fourth cycle, the endpoint of the trial will be reached, theobservation of the patient will be finished, and the subsequent treatment will be decided by the clinician.</description>
