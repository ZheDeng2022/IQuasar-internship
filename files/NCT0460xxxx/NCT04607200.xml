      This Phase 2, open-label study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of single-agent&#xD;
      AGEN2034 and combination AGEN2034 + AGEN1884 in patients with recurrent, inoperable or&#xD;
      metastatic AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts will be enrolled into 2 Parts of the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Qualifying patients that are checkpoint inhibitor naïve will be enrolled into&#xD;
           single-agent AGEN2034&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Qualifying patients that are inhibitor (PD-1/L1) resistant will be enrolled&#xD;
           into combination AGEN2034 + AGEN1884&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cohort 3: Qualifying patients that are checkpoint inhibitor naïve will be enrolled into&#xD;
      combination AGEN2034 + AGEN1884. Part 2 will begin enrollment after enrollment in Part 1 is&#xD;
      completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients will be treated with single-agent AGEN2034&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) and patients resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 (defined as prior progression on PD 1/PD-L1&#xD;
      treatment) will be treated with combination of AGEN2034+AGEN1884 (Cohort 2). Patients from&#xD;
      Cohort 1 who experience PD may be considered (as PD-1 resistant) for transition to Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the study will enroll checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients for treatment with&#xD;
      combination AGEN2034+AGEN1884 (Cohort 3). Part 2 will begin enrollment after enrollment in&#xD;
      Part 1 is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive study treatment for up to 2 years until confirmed disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient wishes to withdraw consent for any&#xD;
      reason. Patients will be followed for safety at 30 and 90 days, and for survival every 2&#xD;
      months for at least 12 months from their last dose of study treatment. Each treatment cycle&#xD;
      will be 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IRC will be established to adjudicate tumor response based on imaging studies,&#xD;
      photography, and clinical response. The primary endpoints will be based on the IRC assessment&#xD;
      of response per RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
