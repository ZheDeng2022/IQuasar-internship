    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial investigates how to personalize treatments (such as medications and/or&#xD;
      counseling) for quitting smoking based on the unique character traits of participants.&#xD;
      Nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and/or drugs such as varenicline and bupropion may&#xD;
      help participants quit smoking or change smoking behavior. This trial may also help doctors&#xD;
      individualize smoking cessation treatment for participants who do not quit smoking after the&#xD;
      first course of treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Production of precise, unbiased estimates of treatment effects for the constituent&#xD;
      therapies and rescue treatment pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Development of the predictive algorithm, using the same machine learning techniques&#xD;
      described in the preliminary data, to estimate the probabilities that an individual with a&#xD;
      given pattern of baseline covariates will successfully quit smoking at the six and twelve&#xD;
      week time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE I: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Participants receive varenicline orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) for 6 weeks&#xD;
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants who quit smoking continue treatment for&#xD;
      6 additional weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive&#xD;
      behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Participants receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) consisting of a patch,&#xD;
      lozenges, or gum daily for 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants who&#xD;
      quit smoking continue treatment for 6 additional weeks in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Participants also receive behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II: After 6 weeks, participants from Stage I who do not quit smoking are randomized to&#xD;
      1 of 5 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Participants continue to receive varenicline as in Group I or NRT as in Group II&#xD;
      for 6 weeks depending on which group they were assigned to. Participants also receive&#xD;
      behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP IV: Participants switch to a different therapy and receive varenicline as in Group I or&#xD;
      NRT as in Group II for 6 weeks depending on which group they were assigned to. Participants&#xD;
      also receive behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP V: Participants receive a higher dose and continue to receive varenicline as in Group I&#xD;
      or NRT as in Group II for 6 weeks depending on which group they were assigned to.&#xD;
      Participants also receive behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP VI: Participants continue to receive varenicline as in Group I or NRT as in Group II&#xD;
      for 6 weeks depending on which group they were assigned to. Participants also receive&#xD;
      bupropion hydrochloride (bupropion) PO daily for 6 weeks and behavioral smoking cessation&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP VII: Participants receive varenicline as in Group I and NRT as in Group II for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants also receive behavioral smoking cessation counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After starting study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
