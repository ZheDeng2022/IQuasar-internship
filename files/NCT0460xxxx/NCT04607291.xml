      This phase I study investigates how well a health service program called Witness CARES&#xD;
      Services works in increasing access and adherence to colorectal cancer screening in patients&#xD;
      who have not undergone a colorectal screening in the past year. Providing patients with&#xD;
      navigational and screening services via Witness CARES Services may improve access to and&#xD;
      adherence levels of colorectal screening.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test the feasibility of Witness CARES (WC) Services to achieve colorectal carcinoma (CRC)&#xD;
      screening for non-adherent Medicaid clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Develop an algorithm for predicting CRC screening outcomes following intervention&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not prepared for a colonoscopy or stool test receive educational materials,&#xD;
      messages, and videos electronically or by mail with information about colorectal screening&#xD;
      and are followed up by phone within 2 weeks. Patients desiring colonoscopy receive navigator&#xD;
      assistance with obtaining the screening (e.g.,determining gastrointestinal doctor, scheduling&#xD;
      appointment, prep materials and process, transportation, escort). Patients desiring a stool&#xD;
      test receive navigator assistance by facilitating fecal tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>A telephone assessment of 118 self reported questions will be conducted in order to assess what factors are associated with CRC screening.&#xD;
The outcome of interest is CRC screening (colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) test), which is treated as a binary outcome.&#xD;
The potential predictors include basic demographic characteristics as well as the survey sub-scales (based on the 118 self-reported questions).</description>

&#xD;
          -  Any participants from the lists of gaps in care clients from insurance or primary care&#xD;
