    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of pain avoidance&#xD;
      behavior among chronic pain patients, controlling for risk for opioid use disorder. Further,&#xD;
      traits and risk factors that contribute to pain avoidance behavior will be investigated. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained will broaden the current understanding of mechanisms involved in pain&#xD;
      avoidance behavior in chronic pain patients, and help devise novel interventions.&#xD;

      Overall Research Design. The overarching goal of this study is to gain mechanistic insights&#xD;
      into maladaptive pain avoidance behavior and risk factors that could provide a pathway for&#xD;
      OUD in chronic pain patients. We aim to explore the neurophysiological constructs (brain&#xD;
      oscillations) of the maladaptive pain avoidance behavior. Advancing this knowledge will open&#xD;
      new opportunities for future clinical interventions to prevent opioid addiction in chronic&#xD;
      pain patients. Aim-1 is based on a mechanistic framework termed predictive coding, and is&#xD;
      designed to elicit cue-pain associative learning impairments that form the basis for&#xD;
      maladaptive pain avoidance behavior in chronic pain patients. Aim-2 is designed to examine&#xD;
      the influence of OUD related personality traits and risk factors in moderating maladaptive&#xD;
      pain avoidance behavior. We strongly believe that aim-1 and 2 will aid the development of&#xD;
      future clinical paradigms for early identification of patients vulnerable to OUD, treatment&#xD;
      resistance and other psychodynamic factors that increase the risk for poor outcomes. Aim-3&#xD;
      further enhances the scope of the project by incorporating the study of brain oscillations&#xD;
      during pain avoidance behavior that could help the development of non-addictive&#xD;
      neuromodulation based interventions to promote extinction of learned maladaptive pain&#xD;
      avoidance behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects. The study will evaluate patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) who&#xD;
      present with central sensitization i.e. allodynia (pain response to a non-painful stimulus)&#xD;
      and/or hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain response to a nociceptive stimulus), and age/gender&#xD;
      matched healthy controls. The advantage of the CRPS model of chronic pain is that it is&#xD;
      common and a common cause of post-injury disability. Additionally, patients typically present&#xD;
      with an affected and non-affected extremity/site facilitating within-subject comparison.&#xD;
      Patients will be considered candidates after review of their history, neurological and&#xD;
      psychological pain assessment. Healthy controls will be recruited through fliers posted&#xD;
      throughout our campus and by referrals from other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size. Sample size is 30 patients and 30 age/gender-matched controls. The sample size&#xD;
      was chosen based on the recommended power size for cue-based pain modulation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. This cross-sectional study will present the participants with an instrumental&#xD;
      pain avoidance learning task, while we record continuous MEG brain signals, and other&#xD;
      autonomic measurements. All participants, upon initial screening and enrollment, will report&#xD;
      to our MEG facility on the day of testing. They will undergo: 1) training to understand the&#xD;
      task; 2) scalp measurements for head tracking inside the MEG scanner; and 3) actual testing&#xD;
      in the MEG. A T1-weighted MRI (for anatomical co-registration of MEG data) will be acquired&#xD;
      separately, if a suitable dataset is not already available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health History and clinical assessments. All patients will complete neuropsychological and&#xD;
      pain assessments to rate their current pain, disability, fear, anxiety, and depression using&#xD;
      standardized scales. In addition, we will administer Temperament and Character Inventory&#xD;
      (TCI) questionnaire to assess the traits for aim-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUD risk classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cleveland Clinic Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center (ADRC) staff has standard procedures to&#xD;
      determine the risk for OUD based on biological, psychiatric and social risk factors derived&#xD;
      from health history questionnaires. Each patient enrolled will get an ADRC assessment that&#xD;
      will include one of three determinations: &quot;Low Risk&quot;, &quot;At Risk&quot;, or &quot;Substance Use Disorder.&quot;&#xD;
      The risk for OUD will be used as a covariate in our analysis for all aims, as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of Drugs. We will convert all medicine dosages that patients currently take to that&#xD;
      of a representative medicine in class dosage (e.g. pain killers, antidepressants) and then&#xD;
      use that as a covariate in the analysis, as necessary, to examine drug effects on the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental pain avoidance task. The task will comprise 150 trials (3 runs of 50 trials),&#xD;
      during which subjects will select a visual cue (out of 2 choices) with the lowest probability&#xD;
      of receiving a painful stimulus. They start out by trial and error, but will soon learn to&#xD;
      associate a cue with higher probability of receiving a painful outcome and avoid the cue. At&#xD;
      least twice during the testing, the pain outcome contingencies of the cues will reverse and&#xD;
      the subjects will have to adjust accordingly. The probabilities (for receiving a painful&#xD;
      outcome) associated with each cue will be independent of one another and varied from trial to&#xD;
      trial probabilistically. Each trial starts with the presentation of the two options (circle&#xD;
      or square, randomly displayed to the left or right) for 1.8s, during which participants enter&#xD;
      their decision by pressing the left or right button of the response unit. Inactivity will&#xD;
      result in the computer randomly selecting a response. After a feedback period of 200ms and an&#xD;
      anticipatory period of 2s, the fixation point changes from a cross (+) to an asterisk (*)&#xD;
      displayed for 3s to mark the period during which participants could receive a painful or no&#xD;
      stimulus. Following a painful stimulus, participants will rate their pain by clicking on a&#xD;
      computerized visual analog scale (CoVAS, Medoc Inc.) presented on the screen. The next trial&#xD;
      starts after a jittered inter-trial interval of 3 - 5s. To minimize the effects of&#xD;
      sensitization/habituation, the painful stimulus will be delivered to a slightly different&#xD;
      location after each run. Participants will perform a limited practice session with visual&#xD;
      cues and pain outcome probability different from the test session. During practice, they will&#xD;
      be carefully instructed about all aspects of the experiment, except the actual probabilities&#xD;
      of pain. Patient's non-affected extremity will be tested before the affected extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental pain: For this proposal, a pneumatic pressure pain device (PPD) developed at the&#xD;
      University of Colorado (Wager lab) will be used. The PPD uses a pneumatic piston to deliver&#xD;
      pain stimuli, and can be adapted to deliver pain to any part of the body. We propose to use&#xD;
      either the thumb or the index finger. Prior to experimental task, participants will be tested&#xD;
      for threshold limits to identify pain stimuli intensity. We will use a stepwise procedure,&#xD;
      where pressure in the piston will be increased in steps of 1kg/cm (ramp and hold for 1s) from&#xD;
      lowest possible level to a level where participants pain perception is equal to 8 on a VAS&#xD;
      (0, no sensation; 10, worst possible pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiology/Neurophysiology. Our group has proven success in collecting pain&#xD;
      event-related electrophysiological recordings from patients, including&#xD;
      MEG/electroencephalography (MEEG). Here, we will be collecting these data while subjects&#xD;
      perform the task described above. Simultaneous measurement of scalp MEEG (2400 samples/sec)&#xD;
      will be performed in a magnetically shielded room (Imedco, Switzerland). The 306-channel MEG&#xD;
      system (Elekta, Finland) at Cleveland Clinic records both MEG and up to 128 channels of EEG.&#xD;
      For scalp EEG, international 10-10 electrode placement will be employed. The MEG system has&#xD;
      additional channels with appropriate gains for recording autonomic measures such as&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) and skin conductance responses (SCR) using MEG compatible Ag/AgCl&#xD;
      electrodes and standard procedures. SCR electrodes will be attached on the thenar and&#xD;
      hypothenar eminences on the same extremity where pain will be delievered. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a seated position. Prior to the experimental session, fiduciary points (nasion,&#xD;
      right and left auricular), along with head surface points and head position indicator (HPI)&#xD;
      locations will be tracked on subject's scalp using a Fastrack digitizer (Polhemus, USA) to&#xD;
      allow for anatomical co-registration with MRI. The HPI tracks the position and orientation of&#xD;
      the head to account for variance due to movement. Subjects will be monitored inside the MEG&#xD;
      suite using a surveillance camera. An intercom system allows for communication with the&#xD;
      subjects. An E-prime stimulus presentation system (Psychology Software Tools, USA) integrated&#xD;
      with state-of-the-art projector (Panasonic, Japan) will be used to provide cues. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo 3 - 5 mins of resting state MEEG measurements prior to the task.&#xD;
