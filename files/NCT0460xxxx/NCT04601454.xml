    <description>To characterize changes in overall (back and leg) pain intensity. Pain will be assessed using a VAS (0-10 cm) with 0 cm meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 cm meaning &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. Overall pain is defined as a combination of back and leg pain, but not pain from other body parts. Subjects will be asked to report their average pain intensity that is related to their SCS device treatment &quot;in the last 24 hours&quot; by marking a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Programming parameters: frequency in hertz (Hz)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize programming parameters associated with energy use. Subject's programmed frequency settings will be summarized. Programming parameters will be collected during the device trial and at the Device Implant, Device Activation, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-Month visits. Programming parameters will also be collected at unscheduled visits, as applicable.</description>

    <measure>Programming parameters: pulse width in microseconds (µs)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize programming parameters associated with energy use. Subject's programmed pulse width settings will be summarized. Programming parameters will be collected during the device trial and at the Device Implant, Device Activation, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-Month visits. Programming parameters will also be collected at unscheduled visits, as applicable.</description>

    <measure>Programming parameters: amplitude (intensity) in milliamp (mA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize programming parameters associated with energy use. Subject's programmed amplitude settings will be summarized. Programming parameters will be collected during the device trial and at the Device Implant, Device Activation, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-Month visits. Programming parameters will also be collected at unscheduled visits, as applicable.</description>
