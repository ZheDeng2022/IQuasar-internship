  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to assess the effects of electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR)-based decision support tools on primary care provider (PCP) decision-making around pain&#xD;
      treatment and opioid prescribing. The decision support tools are informed by principles of&#xD;
      &quot;behavioral economics,&quot; whereby clinicians are &quot;nudged,&quot; though never forced, towards&#xD;
      guideline-concordant care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the effects of these decision support tools for improving the quality of care for&#xD;
      pain treatment, the investigators will implement a pragmatic clinic-randomized trial across&#xD;
      the primary care clinics of Fairview Medical Group and University of Minnesota Physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parallel components. The decision support tools to be tested will differ&#xD;
      somewhat depending on whether a given patient is opioid-naïve, or whether a given patient is&#xD;
      a current opioid-user. Four sets of analyses will be conducted separately: one for the&#xD;
      opioid-naïve group using EHR data, one for the current opioid-user group using EHR data, one&#xD;
      at the PCP-level using web survey data, and one at the PCP-level using MN Prescription Drug&#xD;
      Monitoring Program (PDMP) data.&#xD;

    <description>Primary Care Providers (PCPs) will be sent alerts in the Electronic Health Record system when they initiate an opioid order for a patient who has not had an opioid prescription within the past six months. The alert provides guidance language about opioid prescribing and prompts the PCP to open the &quot;SmartSet&quot; to order non-opioid treatment alternatives. When the SmartSet is opened, PCPs can choose to click on a variety of treatment order options, including both non-opioid pharmacological options and non-pharmacological options.&#xD;
PCPs will also be sent alerts when they initiate an opioid order for a patient will a current opioid prescription. The alerts prompt PCPs to consider tapering the patient's opioid. The alert also displays the MME of the patient's current opioid prescription and automatically calculates what a 10% reduction in MME relative to the current prescription would be. The alert contains options to either cancel the refill order, or to continue with the order.</description>

    <description>During the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PMP) integration &amp; nudge intervention, Primary Care Providers (PCPs) will have integrated access to the PMP embedded within the EHR. All clinicians can already access the PMP to look up a patient's prior opioid prescriptions and prescription fills. However, this process involves signing in to the separate PMP website and can be complicated and time-consuming within typical clinical workflow. The integrated PMP tool makes it much easier and faster for a PCP to access the PMP information for a given patient.</description>
