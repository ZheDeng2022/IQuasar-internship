      In this 2 arm randomized trial, the investigators will compare the preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of a social incentive-based gamification intervention to increase physical activity relative&#xD;
      to a control arm among adults with stroke. All participants will use a Fitbit wearable device&#xD;
      to establish a baseline step count, select a step goal increase of 33% to 50% above their&#xD;
      baseline and then participate in an 8 week intervention. The gamification arm will be entered&#xD;
      into a game with points and levels designed using insights from behavioral economics. They&#xD;
      will be asked to select a social support partner who will receive weekly updates on their&#xD;
      progress in the game.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will wear the Fitbit device and record their daily step counts during the baseline and 8 week intervention period. Participants will have a weekly step goal they are encouraged to meet. Participants will engage in a social incentive-based gamification based on points and levels that leverages loss aversion, which has been demonstrated to motivate behavior change more effectively with losses than gains. Participants will receive daily feedback for the step counts and weekly feedback for levels. Participants will be asked to identify a support partner, who will receive weekly reports with the the participant's points and levels balance.</description>

    <description>Participants will select a step goal that is 33%, 40%, or 50% above their baseline step value. Participants in this group will participate in a game with points and levels to help motivate participants to meet their daily step goal. Additionally, all participants will identify a support partner to receive weekly updates on their performance and offer positive encouragement to help the participant meet their step goal.</description>
