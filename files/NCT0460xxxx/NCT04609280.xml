  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-randomized, therapeutic trial with the primary objective to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of reduced contralateral (C/L) elective nodal treatment volumes in preventing&#xD;
      C/L recurrences at 2 years in patients with p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma undergoing definitive or adjuvant RT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) or its surrogate marker p16, positive oropharyngeal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (p16+OPSCC) exhibit favorable overall survival (OS) rates of 70-100%&#xD;
      at 3 years. These outcomes are dependent on disease burden and patient characteristics and&#xD;
      independent of treatment modality. Significant treatment related side effects exist despite&#xD;
      advances in radiotherapy (RT) technology, surgical techniques, and supportive care. In&#xD;
      addition to common acute toxicities, the favorable OS of patients with p16+OPSCC potentially&#xD;
      places them at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent&#xD;
      current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such approach of limiting RT-induced toxicity is to decrease the amount of normal tissue&#xD;
      that receives radiation through judicious reduction of RT treatment volumes. Treatment of&#xD;
      elective nodal volumes increases dose to numerous organs at risk (OARs). Patients with&#xD;
      well-lateralized tonsil tumors and limited neck disease can effectively be treated with&#xD;
      ipsilateral nodal radiotherapy. However, based on recent phase III trials, contralateral&#xD;
      (C/L) elective nodal radiation is performed for the majority of patients with p16+OPSCC&#xD;
      increasing acute and long-term toxicities. Therefore, judicious data-driven approaches for&#xD;
      decreasing the number of elective ipsilateral and contralateral nodal levels treated is&#xD;
      necessary to limit RT-induced side effects. This protocol tests the hypothesis that treating&#xD;
      only the high-risk sub-volumes of levels II and III would be effective in maintaining&#xD;
      regional control in the elective neck while decreasing xerostomia (dry mouth) and dysphagia&#xD;
      (swallowing difficulties).&#xD;

             not from smears) is sufficient in the presence of clinical evidence of a primary tumor&#xD;
             in the oropharynx. Clinical evidence should be documented, may consist of palpation,&#xD;
             imaging, or endoscopic evaluation, and should be sufficient to estimate the size of&#xD;
             the primary (for T stage).&#xD;

             floor mouth, alveolar ridge, buccal or lip), nasopharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx?&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Does the patient have a carcinoma of the neck of unknown primary origin?&#xD;
