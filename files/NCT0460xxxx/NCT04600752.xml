  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Augmentin (ES)-600 is a high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 14:1 formulation that allows&#xD;
      administration at 90/6.4 milligrams (mg)/kilograms (kg)/day in two divided doses. Most&#xD;
      physicians in India use the standard Augmentin (amoxicillin:clavulanic acid 7:1) (45/6.4&#xD;
      mg/kg/day) formulation and double the dose to achieve higher dose of amoxicillin/clavulanic&#xD;
      acid at 90 mg/kg/day in pediatric acute otitis media (AOM) due to non-availability of&#xD;
      Augmentin (ES)-600. Using the 7:1 formulation causes unnecessary exposure to higher&#xD;
      proportionate dose of clavulanic acid (12.8 mg/kg/day) as a unit dose of 6.4 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      clavulanic acid is only required for efficacy against beta-lactamase producing AOM pathogens.&#xD;
      Hence, there is an unmet need for availability of Augmentin (ES)-600 in India. This is an&#xD;
      open label, single arm, multicenter, non-comparative study in participants aged 6 months to&#xD;
      12 years with AOM. It aims to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of Augmentin (ES)-600&#xD;
      administered in two divided doses, every 12 hours in pediatric population in India. AUGMENTIN&#xD;
