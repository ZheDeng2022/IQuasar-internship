  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Panaceo Micro Activation (PMA) -zeolite s a certified medical device throughout the&#xD;
      European Union and absorbs defined harmful substances (mainly heavy metals and ammonium ions)&#xD;
      in the gastrointestinal tract, while at the same time the alkaline ions contained in the&#xD;
      crystal lattice are released (Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+). Through a recent study the main-effect of&#xD;
      zeolite was defined (support/ strengthen the intestinal wall barrier) and as a side-effect&#xD;
      the measurement of the mineral metabolism was included, without documenting any significant&#xD;
      changes. Its potential in releasing minerals needs to be investigated further to broaden the&#xD;
      knowledge from previous study-outcomes as described. Broadening this knowledge through&#xD;
      measuring defined blood-parameters was the aim of this human trial.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ion-loaded natural PMA-zeolite do not act on the body as ion-robber in the digestive&#xD;
      tract. The naturally occurring zeolites absorb defined ions in accordance to their&#xD;
      selectivity alignment from their surroundings - e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract in the&#xD;
      case of the specific certified PMA-zeolite. At the same time the PMA-zeolite absorbs defined&#xD;
      harmful substances (mainly heavy metals and ammonium ions) in the gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
      while at the same time the alkaline ions contained in the crystal lattice are released (Mg2+,&#xD;
      Ca2+, K+, Na+). Loaded with harmful substances, the zeolite is then excreted through the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract without interfering with the body's metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detoxification potential of zeolite was shown in various studies and the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy is well documented. The measurement of the mineral metabolism was also included in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The knowledge about its potential in releasing minerals&#xD;
      needs however to be investigated further to broaden the knowledge from previous&#xD;
      study-outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/study-subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the effect of the PMA-zeolite supplementation through analysis of defined&#xD;
      blood-parameters before and after 28 days on two groups of 15 healthy volunteers (males and&#xD;
      females) divided in NAiVE (started intake at day 1) and CHRONIC user group (intake of&#xD;
      PMA-zeolite min. 28 before study-start).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the defined effect mechanism of PMA-zeolite absorbing harmful substances (contaminants&#xD;
      and heavy-metals) in the gastrointestinal tract and release of physiologically important&#xD;
      minerals at the same time our hypothesis/ evaluated effects were that the PMA-zeolite has no&#xD;
      negative impact on the mineral metabolism and might support. the natural body homeostasis,&#xD;
      the measurement of the detoxification ability through a heavy-metal panel and other defined&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this intervention is hypothesized to lead to improvement of the enumerated values&#xD;
      after an application after 28 days (NAiVE group).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The pilot-study evaluated the effect of the PMA-zeolite supplementation of 28 days (in accordance with the regulations of this medical device) on 2 groups of 15 subjects (males and females) all together. All subjects are healthy volunteers taking PMA-zeolite since years and the other one just started. No washout phase is planned, but if food-supplements are taken this will be protocolled. The diagnostics will be performed through the defined parameters at defined time-points.</intervention_model_description>
