    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a three-dummy randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of herb-partitioned moxibustion plus lifestyle modification treatment in patients&#xD;
      with simple obesity.&#xD;

      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted from November, 2018&#xD;
      to November, 2019 that includes 108 participants who have simple obesity and meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The participants will be randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: heat&#xD;
      application group, medicated plaster group, or herb-partitioned moxibustion group. Each&#xD;
      treatment will last 4 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the clinical effectiveness.The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures include participants'obesity-related indicators, the IWQOL-Lite&#xD;
      scale, and the syndrome score of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded during the intervention period.&#xD;

    <description>The clinical effectiveness of 4 weeks of (A)Heat application group, (B)Medicated plaster group, and (C)Herb-partitioned moxibustion group for the improvement of simple obesity will be assessed and determined by the clinical evaluation of nimodipine:&#xD;
Healing: The clinical symptoms disappear or almost disappear, and the syndrome score is reduced by ≥85 percent;&#xD;
Significant effect: The clinical symptoms are obviously improved, and the syndrome score is reduced by &lt;85 percent, but ≥50 percent;&#xD;
Effective: The clinical symptoms have improved, syndrome scores decreased by&lt;50 percent, but ≥30 percent;&#xD;
Invalid: The clinical symptoms were not improved, even worse, and the syndrome score was reduced by&lt;30 percent.&#xD;

The hot sticker will be placed on the patient's acupoints for about 2 hours. This treatment will be applied once every other day, 3 times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. The treatment will be delayed during the menstrual period.&#xD;
The following lifestyle modification are recommended to help to establish healthy habits:&#xD;
The proportion of three nutrients in total calories comprises of 55%-65% from carbohydrates, 20%-30% from oils and 15% from protein, and the energy of the whole day distributed to three meals will follow the proportion of 30% for breakfast, 40% for lunch and 30% for dinner. Meanwhile, low-to-moderate intensity physical activities will be instructed to them for at least 5 days per week continually, 30%-50% of the maximum heart rate reserve value will be required.</description>

Next, 10g of the kneaded medicine mud will be taked and applied to the bottom of the ordinary sticker. They will be placed on the patient's acupoints for about 2 hours. The sticker has the same shape as the hot sticker, but it does not have the effect of thermal stimulation and infrared radiation. This treatment will be applied once every other day, 3 times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. The treatment will be delayed during the menstrual period.&#xD;
