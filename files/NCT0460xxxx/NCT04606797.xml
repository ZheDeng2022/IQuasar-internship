    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of mailed distribution of free Nicotine Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy to smokers in rural regions. Telephone numbers will be randomly selected from across&#xD;
      Canada in order to recruit adult smokers interested in completing a smoking survey and&#xD;
      willing to be interviewed again in 6 months time. Study participants will be asked about&#xD;
      their smoking history and a hypothetical question: would they be interested in receiving the&#xD;
      nicotine patches if this were to be provided to them free of charge? Participants expressing&#xD;
      interest will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to actually receive a program of 5 weeks of the nicotine patch for free right&#xD;
      away and the other group will not be offered the free nicotine patches. The proportions of&#xD;
      smokers in the two groups who quit smoking by the 6-month interview will be compared.&#xD;
      Characteristics of the participants and the municipalities in which they live will be used to&#xD;
      explain why the nicotine patch intervention has a larger impact in some rural regions&#xD;
      compared to others&#xD;
&#xD;
      This projects seeks to determine the impact of mailed NRT intervention on increasing quit&#xD;
      rates in rural areas. In addition, it seeks to understand the social determinants of health&#xD;
      driving the large effects expected based on previous findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking is the most effective way of reducing the risk of cancer. One way of helping&#xD;
      people stop smoking is to provide them with free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT; e.g.,&#xD;
      nicotine patch), such as when NRT is sent to people by postal mail as part of a mass&#xD;
      distribution initiative. Our previous research indicated that the impact of the mailed NRT&#xD;
      intervention on increasing quit rates in rural areas may be substantial. The current research&#xD;
      project seeks to confirm this finding and to understand the social determinants of health&#xD;
      driving these anticipated large effects. This information is essential in order to target&#xD;
      limited health resources to regions that are most in need, and who are likely to experience&#xD;
      the greatest benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage recruitment process will be employed, in the context of a general population&#xD;
      survey with a 6-month follow-up. Random digit dialling of telephone numbers from rural&#xD;
      regions of Canada will identify households with adult (age 18 or over) smokers who smoke 10&#xD;
      or more cigarettes a day and who are willing to take part in a smoking study that involves&#xD;
      two interviews. Residence of participants in rural regions will be confirmed by postal code&#xD;
      matching. As part of the baseline survey, eligible subjects will be identified for the second&#xD;
      recruitment - randomization of smokers into experimental and control conditions to be offered&#xD;
      versus not offered Nicotine Patches. A randomized half of the eligible participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental condition and asked for their permission to have Nicotine&#xD;
      Patches sent to their home. The 6-month follow-up survey will be conducted 6-months after the&#xD;
      baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that participants receiving the NRT package will display&#xD;
      significantly greater quit rates (30 day abstinence) at 6-month follow-up as compared to&#xD;
      those not offered the NRT package.&#xD;
