      The aim of this retrospective study is to describe the real-world outcomes with the treatment&#xD;
      of adult patients with Dysport® injections for focal upper limb spasticity (ULS) and/or focal&#xD;
      lower limb spasticity (LLS) in NHS hospital settings in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients diagnosed with focal ULS and/or LLS for whom aboBoNT-A (Dysport®) was&#xD;
             prescribed in line with the SmPC (according to clinician judgement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients initiated on aboBoNT-A for focal ULS after the 31st January 2016 and/or for&#xD;
             focal LLS after the 06th December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving ≥1 injection(s) (i.e. ≥1 treatment cycle) of aboBoNT-A during the&#xD;
             observation period, in line with Dysport® Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged ≥18 years old at the time of the first aboBoNT-A injection for focal ULS&#xD;
             and/or LLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is naïve to treatment with any type of BoNT-A during the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             initiation of aboBoNT-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated at the participating centre for the duration of the observation&#xD;
             period, with data recorded in the medical records available for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an interval of &lt;12 weeks between aboBoNT-A treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are participating (or who have participated) in an interventional clinical&#xD;
             trial of an investigational medicinal product indicated for spasticity which may&#xD;
             influence and confound the real-world data collected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with aboBoNT-A off-license, this may include off-license indications,&#xD;
             muscles indicated for injection or dosing&#xD;
