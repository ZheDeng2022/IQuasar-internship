      The aim of this trial is to evaluate SHR3680 combined with Docetaxel to improve Metastatic&#xD;
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients whether the patient's Time to prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) progression is superior to SHR3680 or Docetaxel single drug.&#xD;

          5. Evidence of prostate cancer progression under the sustained therapy of LHRHA or&#xD;
             bilateral orchiectomy;&#xD;

             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
