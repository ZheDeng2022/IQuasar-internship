  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality after renal transplantation,&#xD;
      accounting for more than 30% of deaths. Elevated lipid levels (hyperlipidemia) are a frequent&#xD;
      finding following transplantation and the immunosuppressive medications play a central role&#xD;
      in the development or worsening of hyperlipidemia. In the general population, the correlation&#xD;
      between elevated serum cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease is well&#xD;
      established and the reduction in serum LDL cholesterol has proved to significantly reduce&#xD;
      both morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statin based drugs are the standard of care in the management of hyperlipidemia. Commonly&#xD;
      used statin-based drugs include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol, Lescol XL),&#xD;
      lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor), simvastatin&#xD;
      (Zocor), and pitavastatin (Livalo). These drugs have been proven to lower lipid levels as&#xD;
      well as cardiovascular risk. However, statin-based drugs also cause a variety of side&#xD;
      effects. While the most commonly encountered side effects are toxicity to the liver and&#xD;
      muscles, a few others have also been known to cause increased excretion of protein in the&#xD;
      urine and kidney failure. These side effects are also more common in a renal transplant&#xD;
      recipient due to the simultaneous administration of drugs that prevent rejection. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is an emergent need for newer drugs which are both efficient and safe especially in&#xD;
      this population PCSK-9 inhibitors (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kinase-9 inhibitors) are&#xD;
      a new class of drugs that are highly efficient in lowering lipid levels in the general&#xD;
      population. However, an exclusive trial involving kidney transplant recipients is yet to be&#xD;
      done. Through this study, we would like to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Evolocumab&#xD;
      (trade name: Repatha) which is a PCSK-9 inhibitor developed by Amgen, Inc in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The study would involve a total of 120 patients across 3 different hospitals in&#xD;
      Boston, Massachusetts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in renal transplant recipients (RTR).&#xD;
      44% of RTR have LDL-C greater than 100mg/dL, six months after transplant. The correlation&#xD;
      between the increase in serum LDL level and the increased risk of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. A reduction in LDL level is associated&#xD;
      with a decreased risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with ASCVD. Statins have been&#xD;
      the long-standing drug of choice in treating dyslipidemia. A single prospective randomized&#xD;
      trial known as the ALERT trial compared the benefits of statins to placebo in transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The original study consisted of 2000 RTR and an extension of this study evaluated&#xD;
      1652 patients and demonstrated a 21% reduction in major cardiac events (p=0.036) and a 29%&#xD;
      reduction in cardiac death or definite non-fatal myocardial infarction (p=0.014). Even though&#xD;
      statins decrease the probability of cardiovascular events there was no difference in graft&#xD;
      survival or mortality benefit in RTR. Another concerning factor for the use of statins is the&#xD;
      tolerability of these drugs. Statins have been associated with hepatotoxicity and&#xD;
      myotoxicity, the incidence of which is higher in RTR. This effect is dose-related and may be&#xD;
      precipitated by the administration of agents that inhibit cytochrome p450 isoenzymes such as&#xD;
      Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine which are the most commonly used immunosuppressants. Another&#xD;
      statin based drug (Fluvastatin) has been associated with proteinuria and renal failure. Hence&#xD;
      there is a need to explore novel treatment options in the management of dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      particularly in RTR. PCSK-9 inhibitors (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kinase-9 inhibitors)&#xD;
      have shown to decrease LDL levels by 60% in patients on statin therapy. However, these drugs&#xD;
      have been studied sparingly in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and have not yet&#xD;
      been analyzed in RTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 120 patients across 3 different hospitals. Two different but&#xD;
      equivalent drug dosing strategies are available. A 420mg monthly subcutaneous injection using&#xD;
      an on-body infusor (Repatha Pushtronex system) or a 140mg subcutaneous injection once every&#xD;
      two weeks using a prefilled auto-injector (Repatha SureClick). The choice of dosing strategy&#xD;
      will be based on patient preference. This study will be conducted over one year.&#xD;
