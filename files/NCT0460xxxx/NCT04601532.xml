  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an investigator initiated, single site, University of Pittsburgh, prospective,&#xD;
      parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing SynePure Wound Cleanser and Catasyn&#xD;
      Advanced Technology Hydrogel (intervention group) to the current gold standard treatment&#xD;
      Silvadene (control group). Both groups will receive the same care other than the treating&#xD;
      agent. Subjects will be recruited form the UPMC Mercy Burn Center adult patient pool who have&#xD;
      sustained superficial partial-thickness burn wounds that comprise less than or equal to 10%&#xD;
      of total body surface area (TBSA)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current effective dressings for burn wounds contain silver (nanoparticulate or ionic),&#xD;
      hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, sulfa agents, chlorhexidine, iodine or other dilute&#xD;
      antiseptics meant to provide some measure of antimicrobial protection. However, all of these&#xD;
      materials have some proven limitations in facilitating wound healing and also have notable&#xD;
      local and systemic adverse effects. None of the current clinical treatments enhance healing&#xD;
      and/or reduce scar formation. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of SynePure™ Wound Cleanser when used in combination with Catasyn™ Advanced&#xD;
      Technology Hydrogel for the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burn wounds.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS) is used to measure scar quality. It is composed of a patient reported section and an observer reported section (6 scored items each). Each section consists of items on a ten-step scale (1= as normal skin to 10=very different from normal skin/worst scar imaginable). A higher score indicates more symptoms/issues present; the lower the score the closer to normal skin. These are then summed together to make up the total score (maximum of 60 and minimum of 6 for each section).</description>

    <description>Vancouver Scar Scale Score: The VSS is a scale to assess the extent of scarring for a given wound by scoring the pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and height of the scar. Each domain is individually scored then the domains are summed to give a total score that range from zero (0) to 13 with zero (0) representing a 'normal' presentation. Validity and reliability of the scale have been documented and is commonly used in wound healing research.</description>

    <description>Topical management via dressings provide a barrier against microbial infection. The current gold standard for burn wound dressings is silver (nanoparticulate or ionic), and it has shown some efficacy in treating infections, but it does not demonstrate an ability to prevent infections and some treatment guidelines even recommend against its use. Although silver dressing is preferred for military use, a retrospective review spanning 10 years of use in military environments showed that silver was not more effective than other antimicrobial topical treatments, and a meta-analysis with over 2500 surgical patients found silver sulfadiazine was associated with increased infection rates and hospital length-of-stays were two days longer on average.</description>

    <description>Synedgen has developed Catasyn™ Advanced Technology Hydrogel and SynePure™ Wound Cleanser. These products are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) cleared wound care medical devices, formulated with a novel biocompatible chitosan derivative, poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine. SynePure™ Wound Cleanser is optimized for the cleansing and debridement of wounds and thermal injuries, and Catasyn™ Advanced Technology Hydrogel serves as a protective gel dressing. Together, these products reduce inflammation in wounds, aggregate bacteria and disrupt bacterial biofilms, and accelerate healing.</description>
