    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, single-dose safety study of&#xD;
      intratympanic FX-322 dosed in subjects with age-related sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study. The subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive one dose FX-322 (24) or placebo (6) and will return for safety,&#xD;
      otologic, and audiologic assessments at Days 30 and 90 after the study injection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has read and voluntarily signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) after all&#xD;
             questions have been answered and prior to any study-mandated procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adult aged 66-85 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented medical history consistent with age-related sensorineural hearing loss&#xD;
             (documented audiogram at least 6 months prior to screening required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A pure tone average of 26-70 dB at 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, and 4000Hz at Screening in&#xD;
             the ear to be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to communicate well with the Investigator and is willing to comply with and&#xD;
             complete all the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has previously participated in a FX-322 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any subject with a flat audiogram between 500Hz and 8000Hz at Screening in the study&#xD;
             ear. The difference in the range of threshold values across frequencies is â‰¤15 dB for&#xD;
             the definition of a flat audiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant abnormalities on safety laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Perforation of tympanic membrane or other tympanic membrane disorders that would&#xD;
             interfere with the delivery and safety assessment of an intratympanic medication or&#xD;
             reasonably be suspected to affect tympanic membrane healing after injection in study&#xD;
             ear. This includes a current tympanostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any conductive hearing loss of greater than 15 dB at a single frequency or greater&#xD;
             than 10 dB at two or more contiguous octave frequencies in the study ear at the&#xD;
             Screening visit or on the prior audiogram (if the Investigator feels there is not a&#xD;
             true conductive hearing loss, the Medical Monitor should be consulted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active chronic middle ear disease or a history of major middle ear surgery, as an&#xD;
             adult, in the ear to be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has had an intratympanic injection in either ear within 3 months of the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of clinically significant vestibular symptoms at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator. For example, BPPV may be considered acceptable whereas Meniere's would&#xD;
             not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of clinically significant systemic autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Exposure to another investigational drug within 28 days prior to injection of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of any active or chronic disease or condition that could interfere with, or&#xD;
             for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that&#xD;
             would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             following a detailed medical history, physical examination, and vital signs (systolic&#xD;
             and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or&#xD;
             post-menopausal) may not participate in the study if any of the following conditions&#xD;
             exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant or intend to become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nursing (lactating)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Does not agree to use adequate birth control methods for the duration of the&#xD;
                  study (adequate birth control methods are: hormonal- oral, implantable,&#xD;
                  transdermal or injectable contraceptives; mechanical- spermicide in conjunction&#xD;
                  with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm, IUD, or surgical sterilization of a&#xD;
                  partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: all female subjects of childbearing potential must consent to a urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test as described in the Schedule of Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any known factor, condition, or disease that, in the view of the Investigator, might&#xD;
             interfere with treatment compliance, study conduct or interpretation of the results&#xD;
             (e.g. previous high-dose aminoglycoside treatment).&#xD;
