    <time_frame>Up to 168 hours postdose or maximum of 504 hours for extended collection period postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Mass balance will be assessed by evaluating total radioactivity recovery and the percent of the radioactive dose excreted in the urine and feces. Mass balance will be calculated as a sum of the percent of the total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces plus any radioactivity dose lost due to emesis (if any occurred) relative to the administered radioactivity dose.</description>

    <description>ALXN2050 metabolic profiling in plasma, urine, and feces will be performed in samples containing sufficient amounts of radioactivity. The percent of dose represented by each of the metabolites will be calculated using the radioactivity concentration equivalent data combined with the metabolic profiling data. The percentage of each identified metabolite to total radioactivity in plasma will be estimated based on plasma metabolic profiling data.</description>

             12 months of dosing or is likely to receive radiation exposure or radioisotopes within&#xD;
             12 months of dosing such that participation in this study would increase their total&#xD;
             exposure beyond the recommended levels considered safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an&#xD;
