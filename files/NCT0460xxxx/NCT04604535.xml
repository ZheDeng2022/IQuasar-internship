  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised placebo controlled trial investigating the effects of dietary nitrate&#xD;
      supplementation on hypertension in pregnancy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced nitrate and nitrite concentrations have been found in women with preeclampsia (PE)&#xD;
      and studies have shown increased concentrations of an endogenously generated Nitric Oxide&#xD;
      Synthase inhibitor, amongst women with PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrate and nitrite are required to produce Nitric Oxide (NO). NO is released from the&#xD;
      endothelial lining of blood vessels, and acts to relax smooth muscle within the vasculature,&#xD;
      acting as a potent vasodilator. Reduced NO concentrations are hence thought to contribute&#xD;
      towards the systemic vascular constriction seen in PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both&#xD;
      maternal, fetal and neonatal health. Treatment options are limited in pregnancy and hence&#xD;
      alternative methods to improve blood pressure control should be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised placebo controlled double blinded trial we aim to assess the effect of&#xD;
      dietary nitrate supplementation on the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy and the subsequent&#xD;
      maternal, fetal-neonatal outcomes. The safety and acceptability of dietary nitrate&#xD;
      supplementation will also be confirmed in this study.&#xD;
