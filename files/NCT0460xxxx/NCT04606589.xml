  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neoGuard device is a 4-in-1 wearable vital signs monitor designed to continuously measure&#xD;
      temperature, pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) in&#xD;
      newborns. In this study, researchers will evaluate the feasibility of the neoGuard device at&#xD;
      two rural health facilities in Western Kenya and assess the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      technology in improving health outcomes for newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pre/post intervention study. The standard-of-care arm (n=223) will be enrolled&#xD;
      between 20 Oct - 20 Nov, 2020 and the neoGuard intervention arm (n=223) will be enrolled&#xD;
      between 1 - 31 Dec, 2020.&#xD;
