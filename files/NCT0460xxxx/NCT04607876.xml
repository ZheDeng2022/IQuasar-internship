  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors include hypertension as a key&#xD;
      risk factor, as well as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, diet, inactivity, family&#xD;
      history and age. These are highly prevalent in the US population with risk factor control far&#xD;
      from optimal.1-3 Hypertension affects approximately 30% of adults and the US Preventive&#xD;
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) supports population screening.4 Many individuals have multiple&#xD;
      risk factors, with declining rates of control with an increasing numbers of risk factors,5&#xD;
      but greater benefit through the control of multiple risk factors.6 Prior approaches to&#xD;
      primary and primordial ASCVD risk mitigation generally fail to target motivated populations&#xD;
      for identification and modification of risk factors. Data from the ongoing project C3FIT has&#xD;
      shown first-degree relatives of a stroke patient are such a highly motivated population,&#xD;
      having seen the end result of failed ASCVD risk control in their relative. Also, family&#xD;
      history of stroke or heart disease is an independent risk factor for ASCVD including stroke&#xD;
      and heart attack7-11 and there is a family risk-factor clustering putting this group at&#xD;
      higher risk.12-14 However, current clinical practice does not seize the opportunity to assess&#xD;
      and intervene on the family members of individuals with stroke or CAD despite their being&#xD;
      enriched with individuals at elevated risk and high motivation to reduce that risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Family at Risk (FAR) Trial targets this high-risk/high-motivation population of the&#xD;
      biological offspring and siblings of an index stroke patient. FAR will evaluate two&#xD;
      strategies for risk factor control: 1) FAR-Education/Coaching Arm (FAR-EC Arm): providing&#xD;
      education from the American Heart/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and coaching on risk&#xD;
      factor control, versus 2) FAR-Enhanced Intervention Arm (FAR-EI Arm): the education and&#xD;
      coaching strategy described above plus a combined virtual and in-person m-health management&#xD;
      strategy to modify ASCVD risk factors using HealthStream/Harmonize technology. This&#xD;
      supplemental management includes a home-based and family-focused participant-centric strategy&#xD;
      for identification of ASCVD risk factors, education tailored to participant needs, and&#xD;
      implementation of a technology-enabled m-health management strategy. This management&#xD;
      strategy, known as &quot;Harmonize&quot; was shown to efficiently manage risk factors in Project&#xD;
      Trident (Remote Patient Monitoring Pilot for High Risk Patients, IRB#: 2018-0063-HCP; Nov&#xD;
      2018 - Nov 2020) that aimed to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors in an eldery&#xD;
      (mean age = 79 years), racially mixed, primary prevention population (Pulicharam, publication&#xD;
      in process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption of research into a clinical environment depends not only on the efficacy of the&#xD;
      therapy, but the quality of the evidence supporting its utilization, and the acceptance of&#xD;
      the therapy to patients and caregivers. Major national groups have low level evidence&#xD;
      supporting real world approaches to management of these risk factors (USPSTF recommendations&#xD;
      &quot;Insufficient&quot; or &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot;). While specifically not developing a guideline, FAR seeks to&#xD;
      fill that gap with high quality research data that will inform guidelines and health system&#xD;
      approaches to primary prevention, and assess the acceptability of approaches to the affected&#xD;
      participant population; leading to dissemination of study results to a real-world setting. By&#xD;
      incorporating input from patients, physicians (internal medicine, primary care, and&#xD;
      neurology), nurses, and the AHA in the design, implementation, and dissemination of study&#xD;
      results, study investigators anticipate good acceptance of study results. FAR will inform key&#xD;
      stakeholders (stroke patients, their first-degree relatives, and the healthcare system)&#xD;
      regarding the prevalence and impact of family history as an ASCVD risk factor, and how best&#xD;
      to mitigate that risk. This effort will be conducted in two phases. During the feasibility&#xD;
      phase, the relatives of stroke patients will be assessed regarding their current level of&#xD;
      recognition of risk, their willingness to engage in risk measurement, the feasibility of&#xD;
      remote monitoring, educational and behavioral factors that would lead to behavior change.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, primary care physicians (PCPs) will be assessed regarding perceptions of care&#xD;
      gaps, feasibility of use of the chronic disease management technology,20 and design features&#xD;
      that might present issues; with development and testing of educational and motivational&#xD;
      materials and content. The full-study phase will consist of monitoring the longitudinal&#xD;
      thread of integration of the feasibility findings into the main project; initiating the final&#xD;
      protocol and assess outcomes; and, activating the Engagement Committee for input into&#xD;
      identified study issues.&#xD;
