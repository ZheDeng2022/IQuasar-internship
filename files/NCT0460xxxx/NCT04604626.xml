    <textblock>
      Hypothalamic obesity (HO) is defined as obesity secondary to functional or anatomical&#xD;
      alterations of the hypothalamus, the central organ of energy homeostasis. The causes of HO&#xD;
      are related either to hypothalamic lesions (eg craniopharyngioma) either to genetic diseases&#xD;
      (syndromic obesity such as Prader-Willi syndrome or monogenic non syndromic obesity such as&#xD;
      variants on leptin/melanocortin pathway). HO, which accounts for about 5 to 10% of obesity,&#xD;
      groups complex disorders characterized by severe obesity associated with eating disorders,&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral disorders, endocrine and metabolic alterations and sometimes a&#xD;
      visual deficit, with a major impact on quality of life, morbidity and mortality. There is&#xD;
      currently no specific treatment of HO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management is essentially behavioral, based on daily support of eating behavior and&#xD;
      physical activities. HO is characterized by an intense and almost permanent hunger; a satiety&#xD;
      disorder and an obsessive interest in food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education regarding food intake behavior of the caregivers and relateds is critical with&#xD;
      advices concerning the control of the access to food and the setting up of a precise food&#xD;
      frame on the quantities, with low energetic density, and schedules. HO are complex medical&#xD;
      situations, often refractory to current lifestyle therapies. However innovative therapies&#xD;
      with molecules targeting the hypothalamus are emerging. The investigator's main hypothesis is&#xD;
      that HO have alterations in eating behavior that can be improved by innovative treatments&#xD;
      such as, for example, molecule targeting the melanocortin pathway. The response to therapy&#xD;
      could depend on hypothalamic origin and especially on the genotype. ObeRar cohort aims to i)&#xD;
      improve early diagnosis of HO and ii) characterize the natural history of obesity and eating&#xD;
      disorders, the associated phenotypes and &quot;lifestyle&quot; profiles (physical activity, sleep,&#xD;
      nutrition) and cardio-metabolic and neuropsychological parameters. Defining profiles will&#xD;
      help personalize individual care management and target patients who can participate in&#xD;
      clinical trials with innovative therapeutics. ObeRar-cohort will thus improve the early&#xD;
      diagnosis, prognosis, medical management and innovative therapies of these particularly&#xD;
      severe forms of rare obesities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothalamic obesity (HO) is defined as a rare obesity secondary to impaired functioning of&#xD;
      the hypothalamus nuclei, the central organ of energy and weight homeostasis. Among the causes&#xD;
      of HO, there are those related to a hypothalamic lesion (lesional) such as craniopharyngioma&#xD;
      (CP) or inflammatory (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis etc ..) and those called genetic, with&#xD;
      variations in gene involved in the central regulation of energy homeostasis. The genetic&#xD;
      causes of obesity can be either &quot;monogenic&quot; by mutation of genes involved in the leptin /&#xD;
      melanocortin pathway, or &quot;syndromic&quot;, defined by the association of obesity and other&#xD;
      clinical signs (syndrome), especially neuropsychological traits, such as Prader-Willi&#xD;
      syndrome (PWS) or Bardet-Biedl syndrome. PWS, which has a frequency of 1/15000 births, is one&#xD;
      of the most well-known obesity-related syndromes. PWS is characterized by muscle hypotonia at&#xD;
      birth, severe hyperphagia and food impulsivity, dysmorphic features, and intellectual&#xD;
      disability with cognitive-behavioral abnormalities. Monogenic obesity involves rare clinical&#xD;
      situations with variants in one of the genes in the MC4R pathway, which plays a pivotal role&#xD;
      in the hypothalamic control of food intake and energy expenditure. To date, at least 10 genes&#xD;
      directly involved in or regulating the leptin/melanocortin pathway are known: leptin (LEP),&#xD;
      leptin receptor (LEPR), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), prohormone convertase 1 (PCSK1),&#xD;
      melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) and its regulator Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein&#xD;
      2 (MRAP2), single -minded homolog 1 (SIM1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),&#xD;
      neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) and more recently, adenylate cyclase 3&#xD;
      (ADCY3). It is of interest to mention that some genes involved in syndromic obesity, such as&#xD;
      PWS and BBS, are also involved in the MC4R pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although HO has various pathophysiological origins, there are common linked phenotypes with&#xD;
      the presence of severe obesity and abnormal food intake behovior, having a heavy impact on&#xD;
      the morbidity and mortality. Obesity is multifactorial, associated with an increase in energy&#xD;
      intake, a decrease in energy expenditure and an alteration of peripheral metabolism with&#xD;
      abnormal organ cross-talks. People with HO have often cognitive deficits, learning&#xD;
      difficulties and social skills disorders. These factors alter patients' quality of life. At&#xD;
      present, there is no specific treatment of HO. Drug treatments have been proposed such as&#xD;
      melatonin, somatostatin analogue or sympathomimetics but with limited effects on weight and&#xD;
      feeding behavior, resulting in no prescribing recommendations given the lack of randomized&#xD;
      studies with sufficient patient samples. Sibutramine tested in patients with lesional or&#xD;
      genetic HO was withdrawed from the market in France since 2010 for potentially deleterious&#xD;
      effects on the cardiovascular system. GLP 1 analogues are an interesting therapeutic approach&#xD;
      in patients with craniopharyngioma with some efficacy on weight, but are currently dedicated&#xD;
      for diabetic patients in France. Regarding bariatric surgery in rare and secondary obesities,&#xD;
      the French Haute Autorité de Santé recommends that &quot;the indication must be exceptional and&#xD;
      discussed on a case by case basis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So current management is essentially behavioral, based on daily support of eating behavior&#xD;
      and physical activity. Food management requires from a very young age and during the whole&#xD;
      life, a permanent food control, to fight against primary impulsivity of central origin, can&#xD;
      be a cause of frustration and behavioral disorders. Indeed, the hypothalamic impairment is&#xD;
      characterized by intense and permanent hunger, a lack of satiety and an obsession for food.&#xD;
      The affected patients are completely overwhelmed by this addictive behavior. It is extremely&#xD;
      difficult or impossible for the child as for the adult with this syndrome to control his&#xD;
      dietary intake. The caregivers and relateds must therefore control access to food at home and&#xD;
      abroad. This requires constant supervision. An early education of food in the family is&#xD;
      essential because today it there is no possible and sustainable autonomy regarding diet for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, if the global, specialized and multidisciplinary care is to be implemented as early as&#xD;
      possible, from early childhood, the development of new therapeutic strategies is essential&#xD;
      due to the severe and early obesity. In recent years, research in therapeutic innovation has&#xD;
      developed in an interesting way in genetic obesity, in particular by targeting the&#xD;
      melanocortin pathway. HO have various origins but have a common phenotype, that is the&#xD;
      presence of eating disorders with hyperphagia and food impulsivity. This is responsible for&#xD;
      weight gain which can lead to obesity, having a significant impact on the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. However, no precise data are available currently on the specific phenotype of each&#xD;
      origin, the genotype/phenotype correlation, and national medical history of OH throughout&#xD;
      life, from birth to adulthood, as well as the associated phenotypes, are still to be&#xD;
      precisely described.&#xD;
