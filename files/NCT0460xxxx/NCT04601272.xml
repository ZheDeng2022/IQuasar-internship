  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      Shared Decision Making Process scale in a sample of patients who have received a decision aid&#xD;
      about the decision to screen or not screen for breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer,&#xD;
      or lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study that will examine the performance of the Shared&#xD;
      Decision Making Process in a sample of patients who made a decision about cancer screening in&#xD;
      the last 2 years. Patients from 4 hospitals who have received a patient decision aid for&#xD;
      breast, colon, prostate, or lung cancer screening will be screened for eligibility. A random&#xD;
      sample of eligible patients will be sent a one-time survey. The survey asks patients about&#xD;
      their experiences talking with healthcare providers about the specific cancer screening&#xD;
      decision. The survey includes the Shared Decision Making Process scale, knowledge,&#xD;
      preferences, decisional conflict and decision regret. The study will obtain 400 completed&#xD;
      surveys, or 100 for each cancer topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample consists of patients who received a decision aid for cancer screening within the&#xD;
      last two years and meet specific qualifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted separately for each group, and results may be pooled. First,&#xD;
      study staff examine the descriptives for the Shared Decision Making Process items. Study&#xD;
      staff will also test several hypotheses to examine performance of the scores such as whether&#xD;
      higher shared decision making process scores are associated with less decisional conflict and&#xD;
      less regret.&#xD;
