    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group&#xD;
      study with an equal randomization among the Hemay005 high dose, lower dose and placebo&#xD;
      treatment groups. After subject randomization, each subject will enter an core-treatment&#xD;
      Phase for 12 weeks following an extended-treatment phase for another 12weeks and a follow up&#xD;
      phase for 4weeks.&#xD;

      this study is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group study to evaluate Hemay005 efficacy and safety of the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with Behçet Disease(BD). Around 252 subjects will be randomized into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole study will including 4 phases that a screening phase, core-treatment&#xD;
      phase(12weeks), extended-treatment phase (12weeks) and follow-up phase(4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: All subjects will undergo a screening period of up to 6 weeks prior to baseline&#xD;
      visit (visit 2, day of randomization, Day0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core treatment phase: eligible BD patients will randomly assigned to Hemay005 high-dose&#xD;
      group, Hemay005 low-dose group, placebo (core treatment phase) + Hemay005 high-dose group&#xD;
      (extended treatment phase), or placebo (core treatment phase) + Hemay005 low-dose group&#xD;
      (extended treatment phase). During the core-treatment period, hemay005 will be administered&#xD;
      twice daily for 12 weeks. The randomization was stratified to minimize the imbalance between&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended treatment phase: Subjects in the high-dose and low-dose groups during the extended&#xD;
      treatment period will still given the dose of core-treatment phase for 12 weeks. Subjects who&#xD;
      received placebo during the core treatment will assigned to either a high-dose group or a&#xD;
      low-dose group according the allocation at visit 2 until 12 weeks after. During this period,&#xD;
      the subject and investigator are remain blind at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase: Subjects in the study (also including those who withdraw from treatment for&#xD;
      any reason) will have another follow up for 4 weeks after the end of the last administration.&#xD;
