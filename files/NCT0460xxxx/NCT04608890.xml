  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities of the oculomotor system may represent an early sign of diabetic neuropathy and&#xD;
      are currently poorly studied. The investigators designed an eye-tracking-based test to&#xD;
      evaluate the oculomotor function in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used the SRLab -Tobii TX300 Eye trackerÂ®, an eye-tracking device, coupled&#xD;
      with a software that we developed to test abnormalities of the oculomotor system. The&#xD;
      software consists in a series of screens divided in 5 classes of parameters (Resistance,&#xD;
      Wideness, Pursuit, Velocity and Optokinetic Nystagmus [OKN]) to evaluate both smooth and&#xD;
      saccadic movement in different directions. 40 healthy volunteers and 40 patients with&#xD;
      long-standing type 1 diabetes will be enrolled to analyze the alterations in the oculomotor&#xD;
      system and function.&#xD;

      The study will enroll 40 healthy volunteers and 40 patients with long-standing type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. The aim of the study is to analyze alterations in the oculomotor system function as&#xD;
      an early sign of diabetic neuropathy. A novel eye-tracking-based test will be employed and 5&#xD;
      parameters will be analyzed through the use of a computer-based test which will record&#xD;
      timeframes of eye movements towards an object, type of eye movements, time between the first&#xD;
      eye movement, number of visualization required to recognize the object across the screen.&#xD;
      Each of these parameter will be employed to assess whether Resistance, Wideness, Pursuit,&#xD;
      Velocity of eye movements and movements related to the Optokinetic Nystagmus are altered in&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes as compared to non diabetic subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of parameters tested in the Resistance class changed in patients with type 1 diabetes as compared to healthy subjects. Resistance will be measured by using number of visualization required to recognize a target and time (seconds) required to recognize a target moving on the screen in different directions.
