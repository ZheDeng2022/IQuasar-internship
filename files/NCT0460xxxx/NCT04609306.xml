  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutibacterium acnes has been the focus of much recent shoulder literature, as it has been&#xD;
      found to be both a common cause of periprosthetic joint infection as well as a common&#xD;
      contaminant in shoulder surgery. Standard skin preparations have been found to be ineffective&#xD;
      at eradicating C. acnes colonization on the skin and deep dermis of patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery. Recent literature has shown that skin preparation with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution&#xD;
      is effective for decreasing the rate of cultures positive for C. acnes in both dermal and&#xD;
      deep cultures; however, a positive rate of 10%-17% has still been reported despite this skin&#xD;
      preparations. The current theory is that standard skin preparation does not remove C. acnes&#xD;
      from the deep dermis which subsequently contaminates the deep tissue. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      application of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the deep dermal layer immediately following the skin&#xD;
      incision will even further decrease the rate of C. acnes contamination during surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 50,000 people in the United States have shoulder replacement surgery each year. Of&#xD;
      these, it is reported that 0.4%-2.9% of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasties (aTSA) and&#xD;
      1-10% of reverse shoulder arthroplasties (rTSA) are complicated by periprosthetic joint&#xD;
      infection (PJI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutibacterium Acnes (C. acnes), an indolent organism found on the skin and in the sebaceous&#xD;
      glands around the shoulder and back, makes the diagnosis of shoulder PJI particularly&#xD;
      challenging. Multiple studies have shown that C. acnes can be isolated from deep cultures in&#xD;
      up to 40% of patients without prior surgery undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty,&#xD;
      although whether this indicates actual colonization of the joint or contamination is an area&#xD;
      of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent development in shoulder surgery is the use of hydrogen peroxide to decrease the C.&#xD;
      acnes load in the deep dermis sebaceous glands, with the hope that this will prevent&#xD;
      contamination of the joint during shoulder joint replacement surgery. Application of a widely&#xD;
      commercially-available 3% topical Hydrogen peroxide in water solution in vitro has been found&#xD;
      to completely eradicate C. acnes growth within 5 minutes and has been shown in clinical&#xD;
      trials when used as part of the skin preparation to decrease the rate of positive cultures&#xD;
      for C. acnes from 35% to 10% for deep cultures and from 34% to 17% for superficial dermal&#xD;
      cultures. While these results show marked improvement compared to standard skin preparations,&#xD;
      the 17% with positive dermal cultures is still concerning given the significant morbidity&#xD;
      associated with a PJI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an additional application of hydrogen peroxide to the dermis itself,&#xD;
      immediately following the skin incision, will be even more effective at eradicating this&#xD;
      potential source of contamination deep in the joint.&#xD;

    <description>Following our standard protocols for skin preparation (which includes an application of 3% H2O2, alcohol, and then Chloraprep in sequence) and draping (with Ioban applied over the skin), we will start the procedure as normal. The skin incision will be made in standard fashion, and the knife used will be removed from the surgical field. For the experimental cohort, a lap sponge soaked in 3% H2O2 will be applied to the incision and allowed to sit for 3 minutes. Following the 3 minutes, the sponge will be removed, the wound will be flushed with 100 mL of normal saline, and the exposed dermis will be swabbed and sent for culture. In the control cohort, the dermis will be swabbed and sent for culture immediately after the skin incision is made and the knife is removed from the field.</description>
