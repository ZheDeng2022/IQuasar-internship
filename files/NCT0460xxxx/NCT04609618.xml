    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) syndrome is a disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of&#xD;
      upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. OSA lead to desaturation and often lead to&#xD;
      an arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated features include loud snoring and fragmented non-refreshing sleep and have&#xD;
      profound impact on quality of life, on safety on the roads and at work, and on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for apnea remains a device consisting of a pump and nasal mask that&#xD;
      provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a pneumatic splint that&#xD;
      elevates and maintains a constant pressure along the upper airway during inspiration and&#xD;
      expiration that prevents airway collapse. The major disadvantage of CPAP is the relatively&#xD;
      low compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appscent developed a non-contact effortless bedside solution based on the following: odors&#xD;
      modify respiratory patterns during wake . Mildly trigeminal and pure olfactory odorants do&#xD;
      not arouse or wake. Odorants transiently presented during sleep induced a respiratory&#xD;
      rejection type response, this suggests that manipulating the respiratory system without&#xD;
      waking is viable .&#xD;
