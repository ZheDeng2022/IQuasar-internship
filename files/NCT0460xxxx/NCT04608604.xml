  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atypical parkinsonism often show gait and mobility impairment manifesting in&#xD;
      early disease stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain mobility and physical autonomy as long as possible for these patients,&#xD;
      we will examine the effect of two types of physiotherapy in patients with multiple system&#xD;
      atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear gaze palsy (PSP) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (IPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into an ambulant daily in-patient physiotherapy phase, followed by a&#xD;
      home-based training phase. At the beginning and the end of the study, the patients daily&#xD;
      activity will be recorded for one week using Physical Activity Monitoring (PAM) sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized-controlled study is to determine effective&#xD;
      physiotherapy in patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes in order to maintain mobility&#xD;
      for as long as possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease often show gait impairment and reduced mobility over the&#xD;
      disease course. Rare atypical forms of parkinsonism, like multiple system atrophy (MSA) or&#xD;
      progressive supranuclear gaze palsy (PSP) develop these features in early disease stages. The&#xD;
      reduced mobility and increased time spent in sitting or lying posture leads to loss of&#xD;
      physical independence and increased mortality. Since MSA and PSP can currently only be&#xD;
      treated symptomatically, a long lasting independence and mobility is therefore of great&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive effect has already been shown in a few studies on specific physiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), and some small studies also give us an&#xD;
      evidence that physiotherapy in atypical parkinsonism can improve mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mobility_APP study examines the effect of two types of physiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      MSA, PSP and IPD. The participants are initially assigned to a type of therapy and they learn&#xD;
      specific exercises with a physiotherapist every day for two weeks. These exercises will then&#xD;
      be continued independently at home for another five weeks. Regular checks in the study center&#xD;
      ensure a precise examination of the physical condition, quality of life and gait pattern. The&#xD;
      latter will be objectively analyzed with the help of sensors that are worn on the&#xD;
      participant's shoes. In addition, before the start and at the end of the study, the&#xD;
      participants are also monitored for one week at home using shoe sensors in order to reflect&#xD;
      the natural conditions of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study, neither the participant nor the study investigator knows what type&#xD;
      of therapy is being used in order to guarantee an unbiased analysis (double blinding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized-controlled study is to determine effective&#xD;
      physiotherapy in patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes in order to maintain mobility&#xD;
      for as long as possible. If the exercises learned during physiotherapy can be continued&#xD;
      regularly at home and can improve mobility, this means a big step towards autonomous therapy.&#xD;
      Frequent visits to therapists can be reduced and sufficient and effective independent therapy&#xD;
      can still be carried out during times of crisis or phases with increased motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is kindly supported by the Fund for the Promotion of Scientific Research (FWF).&#xD;
      Together with the German Research Foundation (DFG) and Swiss National Science Foundation&#xD;
      (SNF) in Switzerland this project can be carried out internationally in cooperation with&#xD;
      renowned centers for neurological and sensor-based research.&#xD;
