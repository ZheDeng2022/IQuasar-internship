  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common presentations to ED is chest pain, with the rapid rule out of heart&#xD;
      attacks in the emergency department being common place. This moves a new onus of&#xD;
      responsibility to the ED; the care of long term heart disease. A study conducted locally&#xD;
      demonstrated that patient's with a heart attack ruled out felt the 'what next' question is&#xD;
      not answered sufficiently at present. The strength of this opportunity is re-enforced by&#xD;
      studies suggesting that chest pain presents a teachable moment where patients are more&#xD;
      accepting of advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's overarching goal is to improve heart disease care (cardiovascular disease).The&#xD;
      early warning signs for heart disease can be detected and treated enabling patients to live&#xD;
      longer and healthier lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is where it is believed that the Emergency Department (ED) can improve, EDs already&#xD;
      collect the vast majority of data required to detect these early warning signs. In the United&#xD;
      Kingdom more than 23.8 million attendances were registered last year, and ED is currently&#xD;
      underusing a large amount of patient data of potentially great value to the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to explore the best way to use this long term heart disease prediction; how to&#xD;
      communicate it to patients, who prescribes the necessary medication, who issues lifestyle&#xD;
      advice, and who follows it up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to answer these questions with a series of semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. The study will comprise of initial semistructured interviews made up of emergency&#xD;
      medicine consultants, general practitioners, nurses, and patients. Then building on the&#xD;
      knowledge gained from the initial interviews it is planned to build a prototype care pathway&#xD;
      that will be explored in the second set of interviews.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genaral Practitioner / Emergency medicine consultant consultant /acute care nurse OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  emergency department patients with low risk chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These patients are deemed low risk by a predictive algorithm that was validated in more&#xD;
        than 10,000 and has subsequently been used in clinical practice safely in over 7,000&#xD;
        patients. Once deemed low risk they are then transferred to an ambulatory care unit where&#xD;
        they receive further assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participants can not attend at least one of the semi-structured interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not fluent in English language&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ambulatory ward patient's clinical condition has deteriorated or is severe to the&#xD;
             extent that participating in the research would (a) interfere in their clinical care,&#xD;
             or (b) that participating would be too strenuous. This will be judged by the nursing&#xD;
             staff on the ambulatory care unit, and the clinical academics interviewing the&#xD;
             patients.&#xD;
