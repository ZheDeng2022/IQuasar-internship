  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to adapt an innovative, validated emergency department (ED) CDS tool based on&#xD;
      consensus guidelines for pneumonia care (ePNa) to function in urgent care clinics (Instacares&#xD;
      at Intermountain) and combine it seamlessly with Stanford's CheXED artificial intelligence&#xD;
      model using an interoperable platform currently under development by Care Transformation&#xD;
      Information Services at Intermountain. We will then deploy it to one of two groups of&#xD;
      Instacares (randomly selected) using the CFIR framework for Implementation Science best&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians' ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and then choose the most appropriate&#xD;
      treatment options is enhanced by well-designed clinical decision support (CDS). Pneumonia CDS&#xD;
      has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high&#xD;
      pneumonia patient volumes also might benefit. The investigators propose to adapt an&#xD;
      innovative, validated emergency department (ED) CDS tool based on consensus guidelines for&#xD;
      pneumonia care (ePNa) and deploy it to urgent care centers (UCC) using the CFIR framework.&#xD;
      Electronic tools such as ePNa may become even more useful within UCCs as the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic evolves, since recommendations can be readily updated as better methods of diagnosis&#xD;
      and effective treatment develop. ePNa within the ED has already been adapted to recommend&#xD;
      SARS-coV-2 testing for patients with pneumonia and signs and symptoms characteristic of viral&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal supports four aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among &quot;super user&quot; clinicians&#xD;
           during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for more limited&#xD;
           patient data available in UCCs, calibration of severity measures for lower observed&#xD;
           mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms.&#xD;
           ePNa for UCC will incorporate Stanford University's artificial intelligence CheXED model&#xD;
           to provide electronic classification of chest images in &lt;10 seconds for elements of&#xD;
           pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and&#xD;
           pleural effusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using the CFIR framework, our prior ED implementation experience, a focus group of UCC&#xD;
           clinicians, semi-structured interviews, and direct observations of workflow including&#xD;
           ePNa guided transitions of care between clinicians, the investigators will identify&#xD;
           barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen&#xD;
           Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients -&#xD;
           the other a usual care control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Co-primary outcomes are a) accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis defined by compatible chief&#xD;
           complaint plus ≥ 1 pneumonia sign/symptom and radiographic confirmation will be ≥10%&#xD;
           higher in the ePNa cluster, and b) the percent of UCC pneumonia patients transferred to&#xD;
           an emergency department for further evaluation will decrease by ≥ 3% in the ePNa cluster&#xD;
           replaced by more direct hospital admissions or discharge home. Safety measures will be&#xD;
           unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on&#xD;
           this rigorous pilot study, the investigators anticipate a subsequent multi-system&#xD;
           cluster-randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology&#xD;
      are optimized in the clinical environment. The investigators will leverage experience in&#xD;
      innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at&#xD;
      Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal.&#xD;
