      The Xpert BC Monitor is an mRNA-based urinary marker test for BC surveillance which measures&#xD;
      the levels of five target mRNAs (ABL1, ANXA10, UPK1B, CRH and IGF2) from a voided urine&#xD;
      sample by real-time RT-PCR. The Xpert BC Monitor automates and integrates sample processing,&#xD;
      nucleic acid amplification, and the detection of target sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of Xpert BC monitor regarding its sensitivity and negative predictive value&#xD;
      was shown to be considerably high reaching 84% and 93%, respectively. Moreover, this high&#xD;
      sensitivity was maintained in low-grade (77%) and Ta tumors (82%). Xpert BC monitor is going&#xD;
      to gain now a wide popularity among practitioners in surveillance of NMIBC patients due to&#xD;
      its simplicity to do, reliability and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that; Xpert BC monitor may be a useful tool in evaluation of&#xD;
      patients, who are potentially candidates for repeat TURBT. It can refine the indications of&#xD;
      repeat biopsy by exclusion of cases with negative test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is a common cancer worldwide and one of the most expensive to manage.&#xD;
      This disease accounts for 6-8% of all male malignancies and 2-3% in women. Non muscle&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) represents about 70% to 80% of bladder cancer. Of these, 70 %&#xD;
      present as T1, 20 % as Ta, and 10 % as carcinoma in situ (CIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many NMIBCs are amenable to treatment with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)&#xD;
      alone. However, despite the therapeutic impact of TURBT, bladder cancer (BCa) recurrence rate&#xD;
      can be as high as 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant risk of residual tumor after initial TURBT of NMIBC lesion has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in many studies. Persistent disease after resection of T1G3 tumors has been&#xD;
      observed in nearly 33% to 53% of patients after TURB. Moreover, the tumor is often&#xD;
      understaged by initial resection, so the likelihood that a T1 tumor has been understaged and&#xD;
      muscle-invasive disease is detected by second resection ranges from 4% to 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of a Ta, T1 high-grade tumor and a T2 tumor is completely different, so correct&#xD;
      staging is therefore important. It has been demonstrated that a second TURBT in patients with&#xD;
      T1G3 tumor can increase recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second look TURBT is recommended in the following situations; 1- After incomplete initial&#xD;
      TURBT. 2- If there was no muscle in the specimen after initial resection. 3- In all T1&#xD;
      tumors. 4- In all G3 tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings lead to many studies which reported on the development of new methods to avoid&#xD;
      residual tumor at initial resection as narrow band imaging versus white light imaging.&#xD;
      However, such evolutions cannot omit the need for second resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its valuable role in completion the diagnosis and proper risk categorization of&#xD;
      NMIBC, Second look TURBT is still considered an accessory invasive procedure with more added&#xD;
      surgical risks of anesthetic and surgical complication as bleeding and perforation. In&#xD;
      addition, the cost issue of hospital stay and operating theatre is a major consideration.&#xD;
      Recent studies are searching for a less invasive tool that can replace or at least refine the&#xD;
      role of second look TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
