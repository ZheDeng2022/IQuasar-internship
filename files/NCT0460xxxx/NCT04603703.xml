      The objective of the study was to determine the effects of sacroiliac joint thrust&#xD;
      manipulation on pain, pain pressure threshold, piriformis length and straight leg raise, in&#xD;
      chronic piriformis syndrome.&#xD;

      In 2017, a systematic review was conducted to measure the effectiveness of physical therapy&#xD;
      approach for relieving the SIJ pain linked with PS. Participants were administered with&#xD;
      conservative physical therapy, Kinesiology taping and sacroiliac joint manipulation in group&#xD;
      A, group B and group C respectively. They have concluded that Sacroiliac joint manipulation&#xD;
      was more effective as compare to the rest of the physiotherapy approach in lowering the SIJ&#xD;
      pain associated with piriformis syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, an experimental study was conducted to compare the effects of nerve mobilization&#xD;
      technique with conventional physical therapy approach. Pre and post treatment data was taken&#xD;
      from the respective participants. The results of this study concluded that there is a&#xD;
      significant differences in the outcome measures of both groups and nerve MOBS were proven to&#xD;
      be more effective in relieving the sciatic nerve radiating pain associated with inflamed&#xD;
      piriformis muscle in PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in July, 2012 was conducted to compare the effects of two possible physical therapy&#xD;
      treatments in lowering the low back pain threshold associated with piriformis syndrome. These&#xD;
      two techniques were METs and SCS. Their results concluded that both Muscle energy technique&#xD;
      and Strain counter strain were proved to be equally effective in the management of functional&#xD;
      disability and pain in low back associated with chronic PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An RCT was conducted in 2011, to measure the effectiveness of two possible manipulation&#xD;
      methods which can be applied in patients with chronic piriformis syndrome. According to this&#xD;
      study, manipulating the of SIJ along with lumber manipulation is more effective as compare to&#xD;
      the SIJ manipulation alone to regain the total piriformis length for patients with Chronic&#xD;
      PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study was conducted by Gopal Nambi and colleagues in Saudi Arabia. It was concluded&#xD;
      that Program comprises of Post Isometric Relaxation is more effective as compare to&#xD;
      conservative physical therapy in alleviating the pain, improving hip ROM and functional&#xD;
      improvement in participants with PS.&#xD;
