  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the activity of the combination of savolitinib and osimertinib&#xD;
      against the combination of savolitinib with placebo to osimertinib in patients with Epidermal&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive and MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed following treatment with osimertinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance to EGFR-TKIs is a clinical problem. One of the mechanisms for resistance to&#xD;
      osimertinib is amplification of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates downstream&#xD;
      intracellular signalling independent of EGFR. This study will explore the individual&#xD;
      contribution of savolitinib to MET mediated osimertinib resistance, by assessing the response&#xD;
      to dual pathway blockade of EGFRm and MET to overcome MET mediated resistance to osimertinib&#xD;
      versus inhibition of the MET pathway alone by investigating the efficacy of savolitinib plus&#xD;
      osimertinib versus savolitinib plus placebo to osimertinib (hereafter referred to as placebo)&#xD;
      in patients with EGFRm+ and MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have&#xD;
      progressed following treatment with osimertinib. This is a multi centre, Phase II, double&#xD;
      blind, randomised study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to receive treatment with savolitinib once&#xD;
      daily plus osimertinib once daily or savolitinib once daily plus placebo. Randomisation will&#xD;
      be stratified according to the number ofprior lines of therapy (ie, osimertinib monotherapy&#xD;
      as first line or ≥ second line [which includes patients who received osimertinib monotherapy&#xD;
      before or after chemotherapy]). All patients confirmed as eligible will begin treatment on&#xD;
      Day 1 with savolitinib plus osimertinib or savolitinib plus placebo. Treatment will continue&#xD;
      once daily in 28 day cycles until either objective PD by RECIST 1.1 is assessed, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn, or another discontinuation criterion is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After progression, patients can be unblinded, and patients initially randomised to the&#xD;
      savolitinib plus placebo arm may cross-over to open-label savolitinib plus osimertinib&#xD;
      following investigator assessed objective PD to ensure that all patients enrolled may have&#xD;
      the opportunity to receive the combination of savolitinib plus osimertinib.&#xD;

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt; 470 msec for women and &gt; 450 msec for&#xD;
                  men at Screening, obtained from 3 ECGs using the screening clinic ECG machine&#xD;
                  derived QTcF value.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedures ≤ 28 days of beginning study intervention or minor surgical&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic&#xD;
             diseases, including renal transplant or active bleeding diatheses, which in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to enter the study or&#xD;
             which would jeopardise compliance with the CSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active HBV (positive HBsAg result) or HCV. Viral testing is not required for&#xD;
             assessment of eligibility for the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior or current treatment with a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI other than osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or current treatment with savolitinib or another MET inhibitor (for example,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received ≥ 4 lines of systemic therapy for NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anti cancer drugs for the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose&#xD;
             of study intervention) medications or herbal supplements known to be strong inducers&#xD;

             therapeutic range within 2 weeks of the first dose of study intervention (3 weeks for&#xD;
             St John's Wort) will be excluded. All patients must try to avoid concomitant use of&#xD;
             any medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known inducer&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study with a cytotoxic, investigational product, or&#xD;
             other anti cancer drug for the treatment of advanced NSCLC if received study&#xD;
