  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Toripalimab Injection (JS001) in patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic gastric or&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have failed at least 2 prior lines of therapy&#xD;
      and are positive for specific markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the requirements will be treated with Toripalimab injection 240 mg once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks (q3w) until disease progression based on imaging according to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria judged by the investigator, or intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent, or withdrawal of treatment judged by the investigator, or voluntarydiscontinuation&#xD;
      of treatment by the patient with CR of more than 6 months, or up to 2 years of treatment for&#xD;
      JS001, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the case that the patient shows disease progression on imaging according to RECIST 1.1,&#xD;
      as long as the investigator judges that the patient can still benefit from continued&#xD;
      medication, the treatment with Toripalimab Injection can be continued until the progression&#xD;
      on imaging assessed by the investigator for the second time. The clinical benefit is based on&#xD;
      the results of comprehensive assessment by the investigator in combination with imaging&#xD;
      findings and clinical condition when the patient has no intolerable toxicity or the symptoms&#xD;
      worsen due to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments are performed at screening (as the baseline), every 6 weeks from the first&#xD;
      dose in the first year, and every 9 weeks from the second year until radiologically&#xD;
      documented progressive disease (PD), or second disease progression judged by the investigator&#xD;
      (for patients with disease progression shown by first imaging, but who can continue treatment&#xD;
      judged by the investigator), or withdrawal of informed consent by the patient, or loss to&#xD;
      follow-up, or start of a new anti-tumor therapy, or the termination of the study. If a&#xD;
      patient withdraws from the study for reasons other than disease progression (including due to&#xD;
      the AE or because the treatment interval is beyond the window) and no disease progression&#xD;
      occurs at the time of withdrawal, radiographic assessments should be continued until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, or start of a new anti-tumor therapy. Patient medication management is&#xD;
      based on the investigator's tumor assessment.&#xD;
