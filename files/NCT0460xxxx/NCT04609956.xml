  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, the fear of the dental surgeon has been the main reason why a percentage of&#xD;
      the population avoids regular consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many techniques to manage anxiety (tell-show-do, positive reinforcement, live&#xD;
      modeling, etc). Now, virtual reality offers this possibility as a non-drug alternative&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have assessed the value of virtual reality in peroperative during an oral surgery&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is interesting to compare the immediate post-operative anxiety level between groups using&#xD;
      virtual reality headset (RV) versus standard protocol (hydroxyzine + music with headphones :&#xD;
      SMP)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is defined as a state of psychic disorder caused by fear of danger ; pain as an&#xD;
      unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Although pain and anxiety are subjective&#xD;
      sensations, oral cavity care is very much associated with these perceptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the fear of the oral health practitioner (dental surgeon, oral surgeon, maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgeon, etc.) is one of the main reasons why a large part of the population does not&#xD;
      consult. This real phobia installed in people's imaginary is partly explained by the fact&#xD;
      that the mouth is an intimate part of the body. Indeed, according to the Freudian theory,&#xD;
      discovery of body and sexuality begins with the oral stage with the oral and esophageal&#xD;
      sphere favored as an erogenous zone (supported by the motor activity of sucking). In this&#xD;
      way, the oral cavity is a place of love privacy and erotic intimacy, but also a means of&#xD;
      communication and a means of recognizing tastes. Regular consultation with a specialist is&#xD;
      consequently essential since good oral hygiene is a source of well-being (notions of&#xD;
      pleasure, satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral health practitioners have many solutions in order to reduce patients' apprehension of&#xD;
      anxiety and their painful perceptions. In addition to the psychological approach and&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (tell-show-do, adapt vocabulary, involve the patient in the&#xD;
      therapeutic project) ; medical means are available to the practitioner. According to the&#xD;
      therapeutic gradient: firstly use of anxiolytics (hydroxyzine) more or less associated with&#xD;
      music therapy or other methods of distraction, conscious sedation (Equimolar mixture of&#xD;
      Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide - EMONO) and as a last resort general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative non-drug technique has increased : the use of virtual reality (VR). This new&#xD;
      technology, recognized for its entertainment value (creation of virtual environments that&#xD;
      immerse people in a simulated world) has been extended to other fields including health,&#xD;
      particularly for pain and anxiety management.&#xD;
