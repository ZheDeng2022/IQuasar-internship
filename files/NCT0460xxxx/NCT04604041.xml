  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies reported consistent and substantial&#xD;
      impairments in the central nervous system (CNS) in multiple sclerosis (MS). Studies of&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system (PNS) function comprising electromyoneurography (EMNG) reported&#xD;
      impairments of the PNS in MS that were less pronounced and inconsistent. Neurophysiological&#xD;
      studies are generally small and cross-sectional and with the poor grouping of MS patients&#xD;
      according to MS type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate clinical, neurophysiological and immunological&#xD;
      markers prior to and after the initiation of medication treatment with corticosteroids in&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting MS patients. The results of the study may contribute to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and can provide guidance in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting MS.&#xD;

      The following techniques will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurophysiological testing will be performed with navigated transcranial magnetic&#xD;
           stimulation (nTMS) incorporating an individual MRI of each subject's brain performed on&#xD;
           1,5 MRI scanner using a series of neuropsychological protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyoneurography (EMNG) assessment of lower and upper extremities for motor and&#xD;
           sensory nerves;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological assessment will include the general questionnaire and battery of&#xD;
           cognitive and psychological tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunoassays on blood samples include testing with four antibodies to monocyte markers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examinations include neurological, biochemical, neuroradiological and&#xD;
           neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants with relapsing-remitting MS will be tested in 3 phases: before the intake of&#xD;
      steroids, 5 weeks after taking the steroids and 6 months after taking the steroids. In each&#xD;
      phase, the overall testings will be accomplished in three days.&#xD;

    <description>In the newly diagnosed patients with relapsing-remitting MS will be evaluated with neurophysiological (TMS, EMNG), immunological (flow cytometry, ELISA) and neuropsychological tests before including standard medication treatment and in monitoring phases (5 weeks and 6 months after starting of medication treatment). Standard clinical evaluation (neurological and biochemical) will also be made parallel to neurophysiological, immunological and neuropsychological testing. MRI of the subject's brain will be performed prior to onset of medication treatment. Clinical biochemical, TMS, immunological and neuropsychological examinations will be performed on a single day, while clinical neurological examination, MRI, and EMNG will be performed the day before.</description>
