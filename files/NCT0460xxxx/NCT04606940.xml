  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to study the kinetics of ctDNA levels after the first dose of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. This is&#xD;
      an important study to understand the optimal timing for ctDNA quantitation for future studies&#xD;
      in immunotherapy, though further validation would be needed in other tumor types. It may help&#xD;
      standardize the most relevant blood collection time points so that patients will not be&#xD;
      subjected to multiple blood draws at random time points in future liquid biopsy trials.&#xD;

    <measure>The change in kinetics of ctDNA changes in advanced/metastatic will be measured for HNSCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 antibody).</measure>

    <description>At each time-point, absolute ctDNA levels will be calculated from all test targets (including undetected targets).The change in ctDNA from baseline to every time-point is defined as the percentage change in absolute ctDNA levels in plasma at that end point since baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes in ctDNA levels will be measured. These value will help correlate with progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</measure>

    <measure>The optimal time-point will be measured to analyze ctDNA as a predictive marker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 antibody).</measure>

    <ipd_description>Targeted gene sequencing results, along with limited clinical information that does not identify the patient as an individual, such as age, partial date of birth (year, month), gender, cancer type, and pathology information related to the samples tested, and survival time may be shared with collaborating researchers.&#xD;
Data from this study can be shared through two types of databases: open-access or controlled-access. An open-access database is publicly accessible and contains limited clinical information and analyses of samples. A controlled-access database contains more detailed clinical information, such as relevant past medical history and the results of prior and ongoing cancer treatments, and analyses of samples, but is only accessible to researchers who sign agreements defining how data may be used. All data will be stripped of all personal identifying information.</ipd_description>
