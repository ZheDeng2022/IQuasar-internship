  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cardiac arrest is often preceeded by a varying period of physiological deterioration which&#xD;
      if acted upon may prevent the cardiac arrest. We aim to review patients presenting to the&#xD;
      ambulance service with cardiac arrest so see if they had contacted the ambulance service in&#xD;
      the preceeding 48 hrs to understand if warning symptoms were missed or not acted upon&#xD;
      appropriately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK ambulance services are called to attend 60,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA)&#xD;
      each year. Hospital studies have shown that many patients who suffer an in-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest (IHCA) have been deteriorating for the preceeding 48 hrs and suggest that many IHCA&#xD;
      are potentially avoidable if this deterioration is identified and actued on promptly. No&#xD;
      similar study has been performed to see if patients suffering OHCA have also presented with&#xD;
      warning signs in the preceeding 48 hrs that were overlooked.&#xD;
