  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates a type of cell, called abnormal clonogenic epithelial cells, in&#xD;
      patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome who have had an donor stem cell transplant or&#xD;
      a lung transplant. Learning more about clonogenic cells in these patients may help doctors to&#xD;
      detect signs of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome earlier in future patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize epithelial cell phenotypes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant&#xD;
      (allo-HCT) recipients at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and in lung transplant recipients&#xD;
      at Houston Methodist who have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples and 3 brushings of the airway during standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) bronchoscopy. After the bronchoscopy, patients undergo 2 nasal brushings (swabs).&#xD;
      Patients' medical records are also reviewed for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.&#xD;
