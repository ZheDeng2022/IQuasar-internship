  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the Healthy China 2030 Plan for further reducing maternal mortality ratio (MMR), and&#xD;
      increasing number of high-risk pregnancies in China, we aimed to develop a registry of&#xD;
      pregnant women based on hospital-based Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data in West China,&#xD;
      through integrating information technology and medical knowledge, by linking multi-resource&#xD;
      data covering information regarding the whole cycle from pregnancy registration till&#xD;
      delivery, and process of diagnosis, treatment and pregnancy outcomes, in order to provide&#xD;
      reliable, valuable and efficient data resources for researches about high-risk pregnancy&#xD;
      safety and MMR reduction in southwestern China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From January 29, 2014 to November 29, 2019, 64,468 pregnancies of 62,690 women were&#xD;
      registered around gestational 13th weeks in the hospital, collecting over 47 million records&#xD;
      (including repeated measurement data) from Health Information System (HIS), Laboratory&#xD;
      Information System (LIS), and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). After&#xD;
      excluding 3476 pregnancies lost to follow-up and 7325 newly-pregnancies with expected date of&#xD;
      delivery out of the study time, a total of 53,667 pregnancies about 51,964 women were finally&#xD;
      included in the registry, who had been followed up till the occurrence of at least one&#xD;
      outcome, including any pregnancy complication, abortion, stillbirth, induced labor, and live&#xD;
      birth between January 1, 2015 and November 30, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till now, through data linkage, data collection, cleaning and recoding, we have generated&#xD;
      more than 2100 structured variables regarding pre-pregnancy conditions, prenatal visit&#xD;
      records, hospitalized diagnosis, treatment and discharge outcomes. The diagnoses of pregnancy&#xD;
      complications, maternal and fetal outcomes, recorded by ICD-10 coding or free terms in&#xD;
      original fields, were uniformly encoded by the Classification and Codes of Diseases released&#xD;
      by Chinese National Standards Institute (GB/T14396-2016) and National Health Standard&#xD;
      Criteria for Birth Defects (WS 377.6-2013).&#xD;
