      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response in healthy HIV-exposed and uninfected&#xD;
      infants to the protein vaccine, CH505TF gp120, adjuvanted with GLA-SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 38 mother-infant pairs. To quantify the maternal HIV antibody&#xD;
      response, mothers will also be enrolled in the study but will not receive study product.&#xD;
      Infants will receive the CH505TF gp120 protein adjuvanted with GLA-SE at Weeks 0, 8, 16, 32,&#xD;
      and 54. The first dose will be given within the first five days of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three parts (Parts A, B, and C), and to ensure safety,&#xD;
      enrollment will proceed in stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (Initial Safety) will enroll first. 5 infants in Part A will receive a low dose of&#xD;
      protein with a low dose of adjuvant and 2 infants will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After safety review post first vaccination of infants in Part A, Part B will enroll. In Part&#xD;
      B (Safety Ramp-Up), 2 infants will receive a higher dose of protein with a higher dose of&#xD;
      adjuvant and 2 infants will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After safety review post first vaccination of infants in Part B, Part C will enroll. In Part&#xD;
      C (Immunogenicity), 5 infants will receive low dose protein with higher dose of adjuvant, 16&#xD;
      infants will receive a higher dose of protein with higher dose of adjuvant, and 6 infants&#xD;
      will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 14 scheduled clinic visits over 24.5 months. For infants, study visits may include&#xD;
      physical examinations, medical history, vaccine injections, HIV testing, and blood, cord&#xD;
      blood, and stool collection. For mothers, study visits may include medical history, physical&#xD;
      examinations, questionnaires, risk reduction counseling, and blood, breastmilk, and stool&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
