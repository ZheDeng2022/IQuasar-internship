  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication that occurs in 30-50% of&#xD;
      patients after cardiac surgery and increases morbidity and mortality and hospital length of&#xD;
      stay. During the perioperative period, the discontinuation of beta-blocker treatment is known&#xD;
      to be a risk factor for developing POAF in patient undergoing cardiac surgery. Early&#xD;
      beta-blocker reintroduction is associated with lower incidence of POAF. Unfortunately, side&#xD;
      effects of currently available beta-blockers (including esmolol), such as low blood pressure&#xD;
      and excessive bradycardia and/or their extended duration of action, limit their use in the&#xD;
      post-operative period especially for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Landiolol, an ultra-short acting injectable beta-blocker, offers the advantage of&#xD;
      significantly limiting low blood pressure events while increasing therapeutic efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of POAF in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. Landiolol, when used at low dose in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, has been showed to reduce the incidence of POAF with no increased&#xD;
      incidence of side effect as compared to standard of care. The limitation is that these&#xD;
      promising data come from single center studies with limited samples and conducted exclusively&#xD;
      in Japanese population. If landiolol is approved for use in the treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in non-Asian patients, there are no data on the prevention of POAF in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled phase III&#xD;
      trial is to confirm that landiolol postoperative infusion is associated with lower incidence&#xD;
      of POAF without excess of adverse events as compared to standard of care in a non-Asian&#xD;
      population after cardiac surgery with sternotomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group controlled, Landiolol vs&#xD;
      Placebo (saline), phase III trial assessing the efficacy and the safety of landiolol&#xD;
      postoperative treatment on POAF occurrence within 7 days of surgery in patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery with sternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Landiolol or Placebo&#xD;
      (saline). A stratification of the randomization is planned according to the hospital and the&#xD;
      age of the patient (65 ≤ age ≤ 70 and age &gt; 70).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preventive treatment is infused during at least the first 24 hours after surgery (in ICU)&#xD;
      to each patient included in the study until the optimal oral betablocker dose. Continuous&#xD;
      infusion of landiolol at 2 µg/kg/min (1.2 ml/h, for a 60 kg patient) in Landiolol group or&#xD;
      continuous infusion of saline (at 1.2 ml/h for a 60 kg patient) in Placebo group is&#xD;
      administrated until restoration of an effective oral beta-blocker treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is initiated after the surgery, on arrival at the ICU (Day-0) in the absence of a&#xD;
      contraindication. The target of continuous intravenous infusion of landiolol is 2 µg/kg/min&#xD;
      (1.2 ml/h for a 60 kg patient), or placebo (saline) at the same infusion rate as landiolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modalities for initiating the treatment are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No bolus is performed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous infusion starting at the lowest dosage (1 µg/kg/min),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing in increments every 10 to 15 minutes until 2 µg/kg/min by maintaining a MAP ≥&#xD;
           65 mmHg and HR ≥ 50/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relay with oral betablocker treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relay with oral betablocker treatment, bisoprolol (1.25 mg x 2/day) for initial&#xD;
      introduction (target HR &lt; 100/min) or with the patient's preoperative beta-blocker in case of&#xD;
      preoperative treatment, is resumed on Day-1 if possible or as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of landiolol can be reduced as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within the first hour after the first dose of the alternative medicinal product has been&#xD;
           administered, the infusion rate of landiolol should be reduced by one-half (e.g. from 2&#xD;
           to 1 µg/kg/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After administration of the second dose of the alternative medicinal product (12 hours&#xD;
           later), the patient's response should be supervised and if satisfactory control is&#xD;
           maintained for a least one hour, the landiolol infusion can be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal duration of continuous intravenous treatment before oral betablocker relay is 5 days,&#xD;
      exclusively administrated in ICU for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions for patient safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landiolol infusion should be decreased half and progressively re-increased every 15 min&#xD;
      by step of 0.5 µg/kg/min and/or discontinued temporarily or permanently in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bradycardia defined by HR &lt; 50 /mim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotension defined by SAP &lt; 90 mmHg or MAP &lt; 65 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrioventricular conduction treated by pacing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Norepinephrine increase &gt; 50% after introduction of landiolol infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of POAF event:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit from the usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous magnesium sulfate injection: 3 g over 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous or per os treatment with amiodarone depending on patient's condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intravenous: IV bolus of 300 mg over 1 hour; then IV infusion pump of 150-600 mg&#xD;
                per day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Per os: loading dose with 4-6 tablets of 200 mg; then 2 tablets per day during one&#xD;
                week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If AF persists, cardioversion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticoagulant therapy if required Treatment with landiolol or placebo is continued and&#xD;
           the infusion rate is adjusted if needed as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Continuous monitoring of heart rate is performed in ICU and POAF event &gt; 5&#xD;
      minutes and/or requiring medical treatment and/or cardioversion is recorded during the ICU&#xD;
      stay and reported.&#xD;
