    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing the pulmonary rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      first study group will receive VR therapy (VR group) as an addition to the traditional&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation. The second group (active control group) will receive Schultz&#xD;
      Autogenic Training as a standard supplement to the pulmonary treatment. The third group&#xD;
      (control group) will undergo only the traditional pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation leads to the improvement to the physical capacity and overall&#xD;
      fitness of the patients with COPD allowing restoration of independence in daily functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological support is required in order to reduce the negative psychological symptoms&#xD;
      related to both the pulmonary disease itself and the comorbidities. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators want to assess the effectiveness of the virtual reality (VR) therapy compared&#xD;
      to standard psychological support (Schultz Autogenic Training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to using head mounted display (VR goggles 2018) and the phenomenon of total immersion&#xD;
      VR therapy allows to completely separate the patient from the hospital environment, provides&#xD;
      an intense visual, auditory and kinesthetic stimulation. Depending on the stage of therapy it&#xD;
      can have a calming and mood-improving effect or, in another part of the therapy, it can&#xD;
      motivate the patient to the rehabilitation process. The additional aim of the VR therapy is&#xD;
      to help the patients regain their emotional balance, let them recognize their psychological&#xD;
      resources and trigger the natural recovery mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The evaluation of the influence of VR therapy on the depressive symptoms, the anxiety&#xD;
           level and the stress level of the patients undergoing the pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The comparison of the influence of the VR therapy and Schultz Autogenic Training on the&#xD;
           pulmonary rehabilitation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The evaluation of the pulmonary therapy improvements in patients with and without&#xD;
           depressive, anxiety or stress symptoms.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen-item scale scoring from 0 to 3 for each item. The first seven items relate to anxiety (HADS-A), and the remaining seven items relate to depression (HADS-D). The global scoring ranges from 0 to 42 with a cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety and 8/21 for depression. The higher the score, the greater anxiety or depression symptoms. HADS will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) is a 27-item scale scoring from 1 to 5 for each item. 21 items examine the level of stress in the area of emotional tension, external stress and intrapsychic stress, and 6 items refer to the lie scale. The global scoring for perception of stress ranges from 21 to 105 with a cut-off point of 60 for high level of perceived stress. The higher the score, the greater the sense of stress. PSQ will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test measures the distance a patient is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a firm, flat surface. The aim is for the patient to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The patient is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spirometry Test</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Forced expiratory volume for 1 second (FEV1%pred.) will be analysed as part of the lung function test. The patient is asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible, preferably at least 6 seconds. It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation, in particular when assessing possible upper airway obstruction. The predicted values will be calculated based on age, weight, and height.</description>

    <description>8 sessions of VR therapy (each of them 20 minutes long). As a virtual reality source, VR Tier One device (StolgrafÂ®) were used. Thanks to using head mounted display and the phenomenon of total immersion VR therapy provides an intense visual, auditory and kinesthetic stimulation. It can have a calming and mood-improving effect or help the patients recognize their psychological resources and motivate to the rehabilitation process. In the virtual therapeutic garden there are a rich set of symbols and metaphors based on Ericksonian Psychotherapy approach. The most important is the Garden of Revival which symbolizes the patient's health. It used to be full of life and energy, now it is neglected, requires work to be revived. In the therapeutic process day by day, the therapist tells the patient a symbolic story about his/her situation.&#xD;
By performing tasks in the virtual garden, the patient becomes an active participant of the therapeutic process and sees the effects his/her work.</description>
