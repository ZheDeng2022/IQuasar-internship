  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-labelled investigation to assess&#xD;
      performance and safety of Orkla Corn Plaster in subject with corns. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      there is an improvement in the size of corns at day 28 compared to baseline.&#xD;
