      This study will explore whether a relationship exists between insulin and leptin resistance,&#xD;
      sweet taste responsiveness, and adiposity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to healthy weight peers, some reports have shown that they are less sensitive to, or&#xD;
      perceptive of, sucrose solutions and sweet foods, whereas others have observed the opposite&#xD;
      pattern of findings or no difference at all. Among those seeking weight loss treatment, one&#xD;
      investigation found perception and preferences for sweet taste remained unchanged after&#xD;
      weight loss, and another observed a decreased ability to distinguish sweet taste from other&#xD;
      taste solutions. Given these discrepancies in the literature, the proposed study will explore&#xD;
      whether a relationship exists between insulin and leptin resistance, sweet taste&#xD;
      responsiveness, and adiposity.&#xD;
