      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and outcomes between&#xD;
      current evidence based clinical care and use of personalized blood flow restriction training&#xD;
      in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia (&quot;tennis elbow&quot;).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Lateral Epicondylalgia, or &quot;tennis elbow&quot;, has been shown to affect up to 3% of&#xD;
      the population and is a common musculoskeletal condition which also affects military service&#xD;
      members. This study will compare clinical effectiveness of two treatment programs in&#xD;
      individuals with lateral elbow pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants, between the ages of 18-65, presenting to the NMCSD or NHCP&#xD;
      Occupational or Physical Therapy Clinics with complaint of lateral elbow pain will be&#xD;
      eligible for consideration to participate in this research. Patients that meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and elect to participate in the study will be randomized to either (1) a&#xD;
      standardized, evidence based rehabilitation program or (2) an exercise volume matched group&#xD;
      using personalized blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entry to the program subjects will complete measurements of height, body weight,&#xD;
      physical activity level (Marx Activity Scale), annotation of their dominant upper extremity&#xD;
      (UE), the patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire, Numerical Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NPRS), Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System version 1.2- Global&#xD;
      Health (PROMIS scale v1.2- Global Health), and grip strength using the JAMAR dynamometer. At&#xD;
      the end of each treatment session subjects will complete the Numerical Pain Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) and the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale (OMNI-RES) rating of perceived exertion (RPE)&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard rehabilitation group will perform active wrist extension, forearm supination,&#xD;
      and gripping. These exercises may include isometric, concentric, or eccentric forms of&#xD;
      strengthening contingent upon clinical decision making. Specifics of exercise performance (to&#xD;
      include magnitude of resistance and volume of exercise) will be documented in the treatment&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Delphi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS) will be utilized for the BFR exercises. The&#xD;
      Delphi PTS measures an individual's personalized tourniquet pressure (PTP) using doppler&#xD;
      technology similar to a blood pressure cuff. In the BFR exercise condition, subjects will&#xD;
      perform a 30-15-15-15 repetition progression of 1-3 exercises as selected by the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided in-clinic treatment for a maximum of 12 sessions, one to three&#xD;
      treatment sessions weekly, and may be discharged prior to that based upon shared decision&#xD;
      making between the participant and therapist. The NPRS, grip strength, PROMIS scale v1.2-&#xD;
      Global Health, and PRTEE will be completed at the last clinical appointment, as well as three&#xD;
      and six-week, and three and six month follow up appointments. Twelve months following&#xD;
      completion of occupational/physical therapy clinical care participants will be contacted and&#xD;
      asked to complete a verbal NPRS, PROMIS scale v1.2- Global Health and the PRTEE outcome&#xD;
      scale. Additionally, at 12 months following discharge from Physical or Occupational Therapy,&#xD;
      the participants' EMR will be reviewed for follow-up visits related to the same condition&#xD;
      (LET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: A mixed effects longitudinal model will be utilized to assess for differences&#xD;
      in the primary outcome measures (grip strength, NPRS, and PRTEE) between the time points of&#xD;
      intake, end of occupational/physical therapy treatment, and three and six months post&#xD;
      completion of treatment. Secondary analysis of change in OMNI-RES RPE and NPRS during the&#xD;
      course of treatment will also be analyzed with a mixed effects longitudinal model. Healthcare&#xD;
      provider(s) will be analyzed as a co-variate. Microsoft Excel and SPSS will function as the&#xD;
      main data analysis instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Implications: Results of this study are expected to guide clinician's selection of&#xD;
      rehabilitation techniques to improve outcomes (increase strength, improve function, and&#xD;
      decrease pain), improve mission readiness by earlier return to duty, reduce healthcare&#xD;
      service costs, and also reduce lost duty/work time.&#xD;

    <description>The Delphi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS) will be utilized for the BFR exercises. The external constriction device will be applied to the proximal aspect of an individual's limb to restrict the flow of blood into and out of the extremity at 50% of usual flow. Subjects will perform a 30-15-15-15 repetition progression of 1-3 exercises as selected by the therapist. The Delphi PTS cuff is inflated at the start of the exercise and remains inflated throughout the exercise. Once the participant has completed an exercise, the cuff is deflated for 1 minute and the same cycle is performed for each subsequent exercise.</description>
