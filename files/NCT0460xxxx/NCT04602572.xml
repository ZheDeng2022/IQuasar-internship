  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are among the major chronic disorders of the 21st century and one of&#xD;
      the fastest growing health problems worldwide. Obesity is accompanied by a state of low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation which may contribute to the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, hypertension, stroke, and certain cancers. Furthermore, obesity has been associated&#xD;
      with oral health problems as hyposalivation, dental caries and periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management and treatment of obesity is outlined in clinical guidelines from American&#xD;
      Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology and European&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Obesity. The cornerstone is life-style modification programs&#xD;
      aiming to reduce energy intake and increase physical activity, referred to as conservative&#xD;
      treatment. All patients must undergo a thorough systematic work-up. The work-up concludes in&#xD;
      a final multi-disciplinary meeting with a concrete individualized plan on how sustained&#xD;
      weight-loss is to be achieved; either by a non-surgical or a surgical approach (Bariatric&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is cited to be the sixth most prevalent chronic condition globally. The&#xD;
      mechanisms by which obesity affects the periodontal tissues is poorly understood, and the&#xD;
      understanding of the key role of adipocytes in the inflammatory response to infections is&#xD;
      crucial in comprehending how periodontal disease susceptibility may be modified in obese&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the present research project are to explore the association between&#xD;
      obesity and oral diseases and further, to assess how weight changes following non-surgical&#xD;
      and surgical interventions of obese patients may affect the cariological and periodontal&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four hundred patients referred to the Obesity Centre at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway&#xD;
      will consecutively be screened and invited to participate in this prospective cohort study.&#xD;
      At baseline, detailed medical and oral data will be obtained from health forms,&#xD;
      questionnaires, clinical examinations, and by consulting the patient's care team. Following&#xD;
      baseline examination, all patients will undergo a thorough systematic work-up consisting av&#xD;
      interviews and consultations concluding in a final multi-disciplinary individualized&#xD;
      non-surgical or surgical treatment plan on how sustained weight-loss can be achieved. New&#xD;
      sets of medical, oral, and molecular data will be collected at 3-, 12- and 18-month following&#xD;
      non-surgical/surgical interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management and treatment of obesity is outlined in clinical guidelines from American&#xD;
      Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE),&#xD;
      European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) and others. The cornerstone is&#xD;
      life-style modification programs aiming to reduce energy intake and increase physical&#xD;
      activity, often referred to as conservative treatment. In recent years, pharmacological&#xD;
      management to achieve weight loss is increasingly used as effective drugs become available.&#xD;
      Conservative treatment generally targets to induce long-term weight loss of 5-10%. The&#xD;
      obesity treatment has wider objectives than weight loss alone by also including treatment of&#xD;
      obesity-related comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea with the ultimate goals of improving quality of life, working ability&#xD;
      and reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is considered an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity. Consistent with international consensus gastrointestinal surgery might be&#xD;
      recommended for patients with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) as well as for those with BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 35 kg/m2 with significant comorbidities. The surgical procedures are usually performed&#xD;
      laparoscopically, and includes sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and&#xD;
      biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of bariatric surgeries include significant weight loss, improved and remission of&#xD;
      obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, and improved quality of&#xD;
      life. Gastro esophageal reflux and vomiting in addition to increased intake of food and&#xD;
      drinks have been reported as potential side effects. All these side effects are considered&#xD;
      risk factors for the occurrence of dental caries and dental erosion, which may lead to&#xD;
      decreased function and pain. Periodontitis is also reported to be more frequent in&#xD;
      individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery probably related to nutritional deficiency&#xD;
      secondary to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is a widespread chronic, inflammatory disease of the gingival tissues and&#xD;
      alveolar bone triggered by oral biofilms. Since 2010, periodontitis is cited to be the sixth&#xD;
      most prevalent chronic condition globally. The high prevalence of moderate/severe&#xD;
      periodontitis may be attributed to multiple factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and medical&#xD;
      care. Current knowledge recognizes adipose tissue as an endocrine organ in which adipocytes&#xD;
      play an important role as inflammatory modulators, producing anti- and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines which regulate oral and systemic inflammation. In obese individuals, an imbalance&#xD;
      may result in an increased expression of pro-inflammatory and reduction of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      adipokines, leading to the establishment of a chronic inflammatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available data on obesity and oral diseases as well as the influence of non-surgical and&#xD;
      surgical interventions on oral health are scarce, and several reports have published&#xD;
      conflicting and inconsistent results. The main objectives of the present research project are&#xD;
      to explore the association between obesity and oral diseases and assess how weight changes&#xD;
      following non-surgical and surgical interventions may affect the cariological and periodontal&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study protocols and tests. This cohort study will enroll patients in need for obesity&#xD;
      therapy at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. The study protocol and informed&#xD;
      consent, following the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, version 2008, has been submitted to the&#xD;
      Medical Research Ethics Committee, University of Bergen, Norway (reference 152810). Each&#xD;
      patient will read and sign the informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects. Patients referred to the Obesity Centre at Haukeland University Hospital will&#xD;
      consecutively be screened for eligibility from January 2021 through December 2021. Four&#xD;
      hundred patients will be invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. At&#xD;
      baseline, detailed medical and oral data will be obtained from health forms, questionnaires,&#xD;
      clinical examinations (including weight and height registrations), and by consulting the&#xD;
      patient's care team. Following baseline examination/registration, the patients will be&#xD;
      allocated either to non-surgical or surgical interventions according to established medical&#xD;
      guidelines. At 3-month control post-surgery, periodontal and cariological clinical data&#xD;
      together with local and systemic molecular data will be obtained from each patient. The&#xD;
      follow-up controls at 12 and 18 months will contain a complete set of data collection&#xD;
      including medical, dental, and molecular parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment. All patients will undergo a thorough systematic work-up. The first interview will&#xD;
      be conducted by a trained nurse. Data regarding social and occupational situation, social&#xD;
      network, daily activity levels, weight history, personal resources, and barriers to achieve&#xD;
      sustained weight loss will be collected. The second consultation will be done by a physician,&#xD;
      focusing on identifying and optimizing medical and psychiatric disorders. The third interview&#xD;
      will be done by clinical nutritionist to assess eating habits. If needed, the patient will&#xD;
      also be evaluated by a physiotherapist, psychologist and/or be referred to further&#xD;
      investigations at the respiratory, cardiac, and orthopedic departments. The work-up concludes&#xD;
      in a final multi-disciplinary meeting with a concrete individualized plan on how sustained&#xD;
      weight-loss is to be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgery group. In this group, included patients will be offered a standardized program&#xD;
      comprised of individual consultations by a trained nurse every 3 months over 2 years.&#xD;
      Furthermore, they will participate in a lifestyle course with 13 group sessions focusing on&#xD;
      healthy diet and activity based on the recommendations of the Norwegian Directorate of&#xD;
      Health. Other therapeutic options include pharmacotherapy to reduce weight (GLP1 analogues or&#xD;
      naltrekson/bupropion) as well as treatment of comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, sleep-apnea, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery group. After completing the systematic work-up and the lifestyle course, eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be offered bariatric surgery. The surgical procedure will be chosen at the&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion taking into consideration the target weight, comorbidities, risk of&#xD;
      complications, the patient's ability to cope with side effects and complications, and the&#xD;
      patient's motivation. Generally, sleeve gastrectomy has lower incidence of severe side&#xD;
      effects compared with gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) or mini-bypass but are less&#xD;
      effective in terms of weight loss and amelioration of obesity-related comorbidities. After&#xD;
      surgery, patients will be followed up at the outpatient clinic 2, 12, 24 months and 5 and 10&#xD;
      years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal diagnosis. Periodontitis will be diagnosed by using the criteria of World&#xD;
      Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking status. Smoking status will be registered as current, former, or never smoker.&#xD;
      Self-reported smoking experience will be calculated in pack years; the number of cigarettes&#xD;
      smoked daily multiplied by the number of years divided by 20 (a standard pack of cigarettes).&#xD;
      In addition, smoking status will be objectively validated by measuring cotinine levels in&#xD;
      serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical examination. Data about current medications, past medical history including&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, arterial hypertension, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and smoking habit&#xD;
      will be collected. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be measured by standard laboratory&#xD;
      methods, whereas high-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) will be determined in serum by&#xD;
      particle-enhanced immune-nephelometry (hsCRP kit, Dade Behring, Eschborn, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral radiographs, and clinical periodontal and cariological examination. Before clinical&#xD;
      examination, a full mouth series of intraoral radiographs will be taken. The following&#xD;
      periodontal parameters will be registered at baseline and at 3, 12 and 18 months: PD as the&#xD;
      distance in mm from the gingival margin to the probable base of the pocket at six sites; CAL&#xD;
      as the distance in mm from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the probable base of the&#xD;
      pocket at six sites (PCP, UNC 15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA); full mouth dental plaque&#xD;
      scores recorded as the percentage of tooth surfaces with visible plaque at the mesial,&#xD;
      distal, buccal and lingual surfaces following staining with disclosing solution; full mouth&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BoP) as the presence of bleeding after gentle probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full mouth cariological examination including dental caries and dental erosion will be&#xD;
      performed for the non-surgical and surgical group at baseline and at 12 and 18 months after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery (matching timepoints for both groups). This will include radiographs&#xD;
      (bitewings), intraoral photos and cast models made from tooth impressions. In combination&#xD;
      with established indexes, these data will provide reliable measurements of the cariological&#xD;
      disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid assessments and saliva analysis. Sample sites will be isolated with&#xD;
      cottons rolls, carefully cleaned for supragingival plaque and air-dried. A perio paper strip&#xD;
      will then be gently placed one to two mm into the entrance of the pocket and left in place&#xD;
      for 30 seconds. For quantitative measurements, the perio paper will be inserted into the&#xD;
      Periotron 8000® (Oraflow Inc, Smithtown, NY, USA), a previously calibrated instrument to&#xD;
      measure the volume of fluid collected. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and at 3, 12 and 18 months. Strips will be immediately inserted into&#xD;
      separate and dry microtubes, labelled, and stored at 80°C until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstimulated salivary samples (5 mL) will be collected from each patient between 8 am and 10&#xD;
      am. The patients will rinse their mouth with water 5 minutes before sample collection. The&#xD;
      first saliva expectoration will be discarded to avoid food and any other substances capable&#xD;
      of contaminating the sample to interfere with the results of the biochemical analyses. The&#xD;
      patients will also be instructed to refrain from brushing their teeth and eating or drinking&#xD;
      60 minutes before sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pH of both unstimulated and paraffin-stimulated saliva samples will be measured,&#xD;
      and a small aliquot of the stimulated saliva will be used to determine the buffer capacity.&#xD;
      Saliva samplings and qualitative and quantitative analyzes will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      at 3, 12 and, 18 months follow-ups for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire. At baseline, a questionnaire including 27 multiple-choice questions will be&#xD;
      distributed to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The sociodemographic data of the patients will be described using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. Age, BMI, medical and oral parameters, and the amount of analyzed&#xD;
      local and systemic biomarkers will be expressed as median and inter-quartile range (IQR). For&#xD;
      the cross-sectional analysis, linear regression models and logistic regression models will be&#xD;
      used to adjust for potential confounding factors. For analysis of differences over time&#xD;
      between groups (e.g. operated versus non-operated patients) generalized estimation equations&#xD;
      (linear and logistic models) will be performed, adjusting for potential confounding factors.&#xD;
      Furthermore, as a causal approach, homogenous groups will be compared using propensity&#xD;
      matched samples. The standard approach using regression models and the propensity score&#xD;
      matching will furthermore be compared with analysis using inverse probability weighted&#xD;
      models. Differences and changes will be considered significant with a two-sided p-value &lt;&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
