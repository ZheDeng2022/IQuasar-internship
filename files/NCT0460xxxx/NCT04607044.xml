    <measure>Survival Analysis of Implants at 3 years</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the pooled cumulative 3-year amputation (above or below the knee) rate of neuropathic patients implanted with SALVATION™ EXTERNAL FIXATION, SALVATION™ FUSION BOLTS AND BEAMS, SALVATION™ MIDFOOT NAIL, THE SALVATION™ 3DI PLATING SYSTEM, VALOR™ NAIL derived from a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to a performance goal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate improvements in patient-reported pain, function, and social interaction for quality of life from pre-op through each annual visit as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L and its component scores. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The health state preferences often represent national or regional values and can therefore differ between countries/regions. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the patient rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate improvements in patient-reported pain, function, and social interaction for quality of life from pre-op through each annual visit as assessed by the the FAAM and its component scores. The ADL and Sports subscales are scored separately. The scores for ADL can range from 0 to 84. The item score total is divided by the highest potential score. This value is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. A higher score represents a higher level of physical function. The scores for Sports subscale range from 0 to 32. The item score total is divided by the highest potential score. This value is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. A higher score represents a higher level of physical function.</description>
