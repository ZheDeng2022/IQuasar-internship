  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern that disproportionately&#xD;
      effects minorities and those with low-socioeconomic status, such as homeless women, creating&#xD;
      a critical health disparity. PTSD has been linked with dysregulated&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning and increased inflammation, which can lead&#xD;
      to long-term physical-health problems and PTSD-symptom maintenance, exacerbating disparities.&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based interventions, including Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), have&#xD;
      shown promise as a complementary tool for addressing PTSD in veterans and with low-income,&#xD;
      minority populations, but homeless women have not been examined adequately. MBSR may improve&#xD;
      PTSD symptomatology and help modulate the dysregulated stress response common in individuals&#xD;
      with PTSD, improving physical and mental health concurrently. This project is an open-label,&#xD;
      parallel, modified-cross over clinical trial of a modified-MBSR intervention to reduce PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms in homeless women and to explore physiological correlates of treatment-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participation in an MBSR-based intervention will be associated with clinically&#xD;
           significant reduction in PTSD (primary outcome), lower depression symptoms and greater&#xD;
           drug and alcohol abstinence (secondary outcomes) compared to participation in an&#xD;
           attention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to an attention control, participants in an MBSR-based intervention group will&#xD;
           demonstrate improvements in cortisol reactivity and lower inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, women will complete psychosocial assessments (e.g., depression, substance use,&#xD;
      trauma history) and participate in a brief stress task, providing salivary samples before and&#xD;
      after the task (which will be assayed for cortisol and C-reactive protein, a marker of&#xD;
      inflammation). Women will then participate in 1) a 9-session MBSR-based program that was&#xD;
      modified based on an initial qualitative component that involved a Community Advisory Board&#xD;
      and focus groups with women from the community (N=4 focus groups; 28 women total) or 2) a&#xD;
      nine-session health-promotion course (i.e., attention-control condition). Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments that include psychosocial and biological data will occur immediately after final&#xD;
      intervention session and again 6-months later. Clinically-meaningful improvements in PTSD&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (e.g., depression, substance use, inflammation,&#xD;
      cortisol reactivity) will be examined.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be recruited from two sites. To avoid contamination between subjects living at the sites, using a quasi-randomized method, all participants at each site will receive the same treatment per cohort. Sites will alternate between the assignment of treatment (modified-MBSR) or control (health promotion class) in sequential cohorts to account for between site differences.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Clinically significant improvement in Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms - PTS (i.e., decrease in symptoms), as measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM 5 (PCL-5) (DSM=Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders). The PCL-5 is a 20-item scale (range 0-80), with rating scale descriptions: 0 &quot;Not at all,&quot; 1 &quot;A little bit,&quot; 2 &quot;Moderately,&quot; 3 &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and 4 &quot;Extremely.&quot; Higher scores indicate more PTSD symptoms.</description>
