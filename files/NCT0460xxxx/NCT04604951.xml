      Recent findings have demonstrated that electrical stimulation to the spinal cord (i.e.&#xD;
      implanted electrodes) can significantly recover bladder, bowel, and sexual function after&#xD;
      injury. While promising, a major drawback is that individuals must undergo a highly invasive&#xD;
      and expensive surgical procedure to implant the stimulator on top of the spinal cord.&#xD;
      Moreover, the inability to re-position the implanted stimulator considerably limits the&#xD;
      flexibility of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators propose a comprehensive clinical study examining the&#xD;
      effects of TCSCS in promoting recovery of these crucial functions in individuals with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI). This non-invasive therapeutic modality uses electrodes applied over the&#xD;
      skin to deliver electrical stimulation. It is based on the same principles of ground-breaking&#xD;
      work from the investigator's group and others, showing that stimulation of the spinal cord&#xD;
      can promote motor and autonomic (cardiovascular, bladder, bowel) recovery in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For decades, clinicians and scientists have focused on finding a cure for paralysis. However,&#xD;
      research has shown that individuals with SCI more highly prioritize bladder, bowel and sexual&#xD;
      functioning over the ability to walk again. There is still a major lack of research towards&#xD;
      improving these critical components of autonomic recovery following SCI. This clinical study&#xD;
      examines the EFFECTS OF TRANSCUTANEOUS SPINAL CORD STIMULATION (TCSCS) in promoting recovery&#xD;
      of bladder, bowel and sexual functions in individuals with SCI. This NON-INVASIVE THERAPEUTIC&#xD;
      METHOD utilizes electrodes applied over the skin, and is based on ground-breaking work (from&#xD;
      the investigator's group and others), showing that spinal cord stimulation can promote motor&#xD;
      and autonomic recovery in individuals with chronic SCI. This study is a collaborative effort&#xD;
      between clinicians and scientists with expertise in: SCI care, rehabilitation, bladder,&#xD;
      bowel, cardiovascular and sexual functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be routinely monitored. Six weeks after completion of stimulation experiments,&#xD;
      bladder, bowel and sexual function will be reassessed to examine the longevity of&#xD;
      TCSCS-induced effects. TCSCS COULD OFFER A SIMPLE, COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO TREAT AUTONOMIC&#xD;
      DYSFUNCTIONS (i.e. urine and faecal incontinence, erectile difficulties etc.) that would&#xD;
      undoubtedly significantly improve overall health related quality of life for individuals with&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent findings have demonstrated that electrical stimulation to the spinal cord (i.e.&#xD;
      implanted electrodes) can significantly recover bladder, bowel, and sexual function after&#xD;
      injury. While promising, a major drawback is that individuals must undergo a highly invasive&#xD;
      and expensive surgical procedure to implant the stimulator on top of the spinal cord.&#xD;
      Moreover, the inability to re-position the implanted stimulator considerably limits the&#xD;
      flexibility of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators propose a comprehensive clinical study examining the&#xD;
      effects of TCSCS in promoting recovery of these crucial functions in individuals with SCI.&#xD;
      This non-invasive therapeutic modality uses electrodes applied over the skin to deliver&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. It is based on the same principles of ground-breaking work from the&#xD;
      investigator's group and others, showing that stimulation of the spinal cord can promote&#xD;
      motor and autonomic (cardiovascular, bladder, bowel) recovery in individuals with chronic&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical neuromodulation has recently emerged as a leader in potential therapies for&#xD;
      restoring voluntary control of functional movements in lower limbs after SCI. In addition to&#xD;
      functional motor recovery, numerous studies from the investigator's group and collaborators&#xD;
      have shown efficacy of both epidural stimulation (invasive) and non-invasive stimulation&#xD;
      (TCSCS) in restoring autonomic function. For example, in the investigators preliminary&#xD;
      examination of several individuals with SCI, the investigators have demonstrated that&#xD;
      epidural stimulation acutely restores cardiovascular control, improves lower urinary tract&#xD;
      (LUT) function and reduces time needed for bowel routine. These studies were highly&#xD;
      influential in developing stimulation protocols and establishing spinal cord stimulation as a&#xD;
      safe and effective therapy. The next logical step is to conduct a wider-scale clinical trial&#xD;
      for TCSCS as a novel, efficacious and inexpensive alternative therapy to epidural&#xD;
      stimulation. By uniting experts in the field of SCI, physical medicine/rehabilitation,&#xD;
      urology, colorectal health and sexual functioning, the investigators are well-equipped to&#xD;
      assess TCSCS as a novel means of improving recovery of LUT, bowel and sexual function. The&#xD;
      investigator's team has a strong history of collaborative research in these fields and&#xD;
      extensive experience in the evaluation of these three aspects of autonomic function using&#xD;
      physiological measures/clinical assessments in addition to well-validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that individuals with SCI who participate in this trial will&#xD;
      receive a therapeutic benefit in at least one of the multiple outcomes (i.e. LUT, bowel and&#xD;
      sexual function) and will also obtain greater insight into the nature of their current health&#xD;
      status in these areas post-SCI. This project will also have a high degree of impact on the&#xD;
      SCI-community by further developing TCSCS as a more accessible and inexpensive therapy for&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunctions. Ultimately the investigator's goal is to improve quality of life for&#xD;
      individuals with SCI, which the investigators anticipate in turn will decrease caregiver&#xD;
      burden and health care costs due to LUT, bowel and sexual issues associated with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals who sign the consent form will first undergo screening and initial&#xD;
      evaluations (total of 6 visits completed within 6 weeks) and then will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either a moderate TCSCS treatment group (2 days/week for a total of 12 treatment sessions)&#xD;
      or intense TCSCS treatment group (5days/week for a total of 30 treatment sessions) during the&#xD;
      6 weeks treatment period. After completion of total protocol, each participant will undergo 4&#xD;
      follow up assessments that will be completed within 12 weeks following the treatment.&#xD;
      Overall, the total duration of participation will be approximately 25 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Screening Approximately 1.5 hours After a participant has provided informed consent,&#xD;
      he/she will be assigned a unique study number will be invited for a screening assessment to&#xD;
      confirm study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Baseline Assessments Approximately 1 hour. All eligible participants will be guided&#xD;
      through a series of questionnaires on bladder function, bowel function, cardiovascular&#xD;
      function and sexual health (outcomes 6-10 below). Participants will also undergo baseline 24&#xD;
      hours ambulatory evaluation of cardiovascular functions (outcome 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 /Baseline EMG Mapping of Spinal Cord Segments with TCSCS Approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo baseline mapping using surface EMG and concentric needle EMG as per&#xD;
      an established protocol to record muscle activation during transcutaneous spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation (mapping) at different spinal cord levels and different intensity (outcome 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 4,5 and 6: Bladder and bowel function assessment procedures with and without&#xD;
      non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation Approximately 2.5 hours per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 4, 5, and 6 will include assessments of bladder function (urodynamics, outcome 3) and&#xD;
      bowel function (Anorectal Manometry, outcome 4). Bladder assessments will take place at the&#xD;
      Blusson Spinal Cord Centre and bowel assessments will take place at St. Paul's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of these 3 visits will differ randomly between individuals and will be one of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathway #1: you will start with Urodynamics, (UDS 1, Visit 4), followed by a second&#xD;
           session of Urodynamics (UDS 2, Visit 5), followed by bowel function assessments(Visit&#xD;
           6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathway#2: you will start bowel function assessments (Visit 4), followed by Urodynamics&#xD;
           (UDS 1, Visit 5), and a second session of Urodynamics (UDS 2, Visit 6)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 7-18 or 36: Long Term Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      Approximately 1.5 hours per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come to ICORD for TCSCS either 2 days/week (moderate treatment&#xD;
      group with total 12 treatment sessions) or 5 days/week (intense treatment group with total 30&#xD;
      treatment sessions) for 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assignment to either the&#xD;
      moderate or intense treatment groups. Whether a participant are assigned to the moderate or&#xD;
      intense group will be determined by chance (like the flip of a coin). Each TCSCS session will&#xD;
      last approximately 90 minutes. Stimulation will be applied for a total of 60 minutes in three&#xD;
      20-minute intervals with 2 minute breaks. Skin temperature, blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      will be monitored. Mid-way through the 6 weeks, participants will be set up with an&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure monitor to wear at home on the day of the participant's bowel&#xD;
      routine. We will also provide a diary for participants to log their activities while wearing&#xD;
      the blood pressure monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 19 or 37: Bladder assessment and SCI severity assessment - Approximately 3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 6 weeks of TCSCS, a third urodynamics assessment will be performed at the Blusson&#xD;
      Spinal cord centre, following the same procedure described above, both without and with&#xD;
      TCSCS. During this visit, a clinician will also perform a SCI severity assessment&#xD;
      (International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI)&#xD;
      exam).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 20 or 38: Immediate Follow up Telephone Questionnaires - Approximately 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 20 or 38 will take place by telephone or video conference call (considering the present&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic environment). Participants will be guided through the same series of&#xD;
      questionnaires as in visit 1 and 2, on bladder function, bowel function, cardiovascular&#xD;
      function and sexual health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 21-22 or 39-40: Long Term follow up Telephone Questionnaires and Semi Structured&#xD;
      Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1 hour (visit 21/39) and approximately 1.5 hours (visit 22/40)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits will take place over the telephone to evaluate existing and new adverse events&#xD;
      and concurrent treatments. During each of these follow-up phone Visits (39 and 40) at 6 and&#xD;
      12 weeks post completion of long term TCSCS, participants will be guided through the same&#xD;
      series of questionnaires on bladder function, bowel function, cardiovascular function and&#xD;
      sexual health described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 22 or visit 40, a sexual health clinician, with experience providing clinical&#xD;
      care to individuals with SCI, will also conduct a semi-structured qualitative interview&#xD;
      (outcome 11) during which they will ask participants questions about the following: sexual&#xD;
      history and current relationship status, level of sexual drive, ability to orgasm, barriers&#xD;
      to sexual activity, self-esteem, the use of performance enhancing aids, and the participant's&#xD;
      perceptions of the role of TCSCS on sexual functioning.&#xD;
