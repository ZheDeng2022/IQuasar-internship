      Introduction. Although ageing is a general phenomenon, a great inter individual variability&#xD;
      on the quality of ageing can be observed. This substantial heterogeneity may be partly&#xD;
      explained by extrinsic factors such as lifestyle, habits, physical activity, diet, which may&#xD;
      play an important role in the age-associated declines. The concept of frailty was introduced&#xD;
      to account for variability in the aging process. This clinical and biological syndrome&#xD;
      reflects a decrease in the physiological reserve, and leads to an insidious, precarious&#xD;
      equilibrium that can break down during a stressful life event. In older adults, frailty is&#xD;
      known to be associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as falls, fractures,&#xD;
      unplanned hospitalizations, and death. Several frailty domains may only be slightly altered,&#xD;
      so that early-stage frailty is not necessarily clinically visible. The most commonly used&#xD;
      operational definitions of frailty are based on two different conceptual frameworks. Fried's&#xD;
      rules-based criteria correspond to a physical phenotype, whereas the &quot;Rockwood accumulative&#xD;
      model&quot; defines frailty as the accumulation of multiple deficits. These tools were built for&#xD;
      individuals aged 65 and over. However, frailty can also be found in younger adults. Although&#xD;
      the early detection of frailty is potentially important (since the condition might be&#xD;
      reversible in its early stages), frailty has not been extensively investigated among&#xD;
      middle-aged individuals. Indeed, most of the literature studies have focused on older adults&#xD;
      or on a small number of frailty parameters the investigators hypothesized that the factors&#xD;
      determining the main ageing-related adverse events are already present in middle age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the SUCCEED cohort are therefore to 1/investigate the prevalence of&#xD;
      frailty parameters in community-dwelling individuals aged 50 and over, 2/ assess the&#xD;
      parameters' prognostic value for future adverse health events, 3/ investigate frailty&#xD;
      classifications in this population and assess the evolution of profiles over time Method. The&#xD;
      SUCCEED survey is a French retrospective and prospective cohort that includes&#xD;
      community-dwelling individuals aged 50 years or over consecutively attending an outpatient&#xD;
      clinic (&quot;successful ageing&quot;) in a geriatric teaching hospital in the Paris area, France.&#xD;
      Baseline parameters are collected using a self-administered questionnaire followed by an&#xD;
      interview, physical measurements, and performance tests conducted by trained nurses, and then&#xD;
      a standardized clinical evaluation by a geriatrician. This clinical assessment includes&#xD;
      evaluation of autonomy, cognition, mood, balance, mobility, muscle strength, nutrition,&#xD;
      comorbidities, continence, sensory functions, bone density, sleeping disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have attended the outpatient clinic from the 01/01/2010 to 14/01/2020 are&#xD;
      retrospectively included in the cohort, the other ones are prospectively included.&#xD;
