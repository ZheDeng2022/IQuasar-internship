    <textblock>
      Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a form of cognitive function that is known to be&#xD;
      directly associated with motor function. This hallmark motor skill enables humans to perform&#xD;
      multiple single movements in a specific sequential order and is involved in many of our daily&#xD;
      activities (e.g. reaching, dressing, typing). One promising tool that has been shown to&#xD;
      improve this type of learning in healthy young individuals, is transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS). This non-invasive brain stimulation technique entails the administration&#xD;
      of a weak electrical current at the scalp between two electrodes. To date, studies have&#xD;
      almost exclusively investigated effects of conventional tDCS. Recently, however, novel High&#xD;
      Definition (HD) tDCS devices have been commercialised. Whereas conventional tDCS uses two&#xD;
      rather large electrodes, likely including adjacent cortical areas in the stimulation, HD-tDCS&#xD;
      uses multiple smaller electrodes, allowing for stimulation of the targeted cortical region&#xD;
      with higher resolution/specificity. The aim of the present study is to confirm previous&#xD;
      findings suggesting beneficial effects of conventional tDCS, delivered over the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex (M1) in healthy young adults. Additionally, the investigators will be the first to&#xD;
      investigate potential effects of HD tDCS on IMSL in this population and to make a comparison&#xD;
      between these two devices. The investigators will determine immediate effects that may occur&#xD;
      concurrently with the application of tDCS but also short-term (five minutes post-tDCS) and&#xD;
      long-term (one week post-tDCS) consolidation effects, as previous studies suggest that tDCS&#xD;
      exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL in a consolidation phase rather than in an acquisition&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a single-blind, sham-controlled, counterbalanced study. For&#xD;
      the sequence-specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome), a mixed factorial repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA will be carried out with &quot;device&quot; (2 levels: conventional tDCS, HD tDCS) as&#xD;
      between-subjects factor and &quot;stimulation&quot; (2 levels: anodal, sham), &quot;blocks&quot; (2 levels:&#xD;
      random block, mean of adjacent blocks) and &quot;time&quot; (3 levels: during, post5min, post1week) as&#xD;
      within-subjects factors. Similarly, for general learning (secondary outcome), a mixed&#xD;
      factorial repeated measures ANOVA will be executed with &quot;device&quot; (2 levels: conventional&#xD;
      tDCS, HD tDCS) as between-subjects factor and &quot;stimulation&quot; (2 levels: anodal, sham),&#xD;
      &quot;blocks&quot; (7 levels: Blocks 1-6, Block 8) and &quot;time&quot; (3 levels: during, post5min, post1week)&#xD;
      as within-subjects factors. Participants are randomly assigned to either the conventional&#xD;
      tDCS group or the HD tDCS group by block randomization. All participants will receive both&#xD;
      anodal (real) and sham (placebo) tDCS in a random order. Counterbalancing will be done by an&#xD;
      independent investigator using Microsoft Excel®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy young adults will be recruited from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. There are no&#xD;
      restrictions or prohibitions for the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Conventional tDCS, a 1x1 Low Intensity Direct Current Stimulator (Soterix Medical&#xD;
      Inc, New York, USA) will be used to generate and deliver tDCS through a pair of identical&#xD;
      square rubber electrodes (size 35 cm2), placed in rectangular saline-soaked sponges. For the&#xD;
      stimulation of M1, electrodes will be placed over C3 or C4 according to the international&#xD;
      10-20 electroencephalogram system, matching with the M1 contralateral to the performing hand.&#xD;
      The reference electrode will be positioned on F1 or F2, ipsilateral to the performing hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current stimulation will be slowly ramped up from 0 milliampere (mA) to 2 mA in one&#xD;
      minute. For the anodal tDCS condition, this intensity will be maintained for the duration of&#xD;
      the SRT-task (approximately 20 minutes), which is well within evidence-based safety standards&#xD;
      for tDCS. This will result in a current density of 0,057 mA/cm2. For the sham tDCS condition&#xD;
      - unbeknown to the subject - stimulation will be gradually decreased towards 0 mA immediately&#xD;
      after the one-minute ramp-up. During the last block of the SRT-task, this gradual ramping-up&#xD;
      and -down of the current stimulation will be repeated to optimize the process of blinding of&#xD;
      participants. To control for blinding of the subjects, after the last session subjects will&#xD;
      be asked whether they were aware of the stimulation condition or not. Transient side-effects&#xD;
      will be inventoried by the experimenter during and two weeks after the tDCS protocol, and may&#xD;
      include a slight itching sensation under the electrode, redness of the skin under the&#xD;
      electrode, headache, nausea, fatigue or insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the High Definition tDCS, a 4x1 Multichannel Stimulation Adapter (Soterix Medical Inc,&#xD;
      New York, USA) will be used to deliver HD tDCS over M1. By connecting the conventional tDCS&#xD;
      device (described above) to this Multichannel Stimulation Adapter, the direct current is&#xD;
      delivered along the 4x1 HD tDCS configuration, allowing for neuromodulation restricted to the&#xD;
      desired area. In contrast to the relatively large sponge-electrodes used in conventional tDCS&#xD;
      montages (Figure 1A), stimulation via HD tDCS is delivered by means of one central&#xD;
      gel-electrode and four return-electrodes placed in plastic encasings embedded in an EEG cap&#xD;
      (Figure 1B). Set-up of the device will be done according to the extensive experimental&#xD;
      protocol provided by Villamar and colleagues (2013). For the stimulation of the left M1,&#xD;
      contralateral to the performing right hand, the anodal stimulation will be delivered via the&#xD;
      central electrode corresponding with C3 and held in place using the specially designed&#xD;
      synthetic cap to hold the HD-tDCS electrodes on the head. The return-electrodes are&#xD;
      positioned at Cz, F3, T7 and P3 (international 10-20 electroencephalogram system), see Figure&#xD;
      2. For the right M1, contralateral to the performing left hand, the central electrode will be&#xD;
      positioned at C4 with the return-electrodes at Cz, F4, T8 and P4. The stimulating (anodal)&#xD;
      direct current will be ramped up for 60 seconds to an intensity of 2 mA, and maintained for&#xD;
      the duration of the SRT-task (about 20 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Serial Reaction Time task (SRT-task) will be used to determine IMSL. The SRT- task will&#xD;
      be performed on a laptop using E-Prime® software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Participants will be asked to press the horizontally aligned&#xD;
      response keys C, V, B, N of a standard azerty keyboard for a leftmost, left, right, rightmost&#xD;
      target, respectively. Responses will be given with the index finger of the least affected&#xD;
      hand in the case of the persons with PD and with the dominant hand in the case of the healthy&#xD;
      controls. If both hands are equally affected in the persons with PD, the dominant hand will&#xD;
      be used as well. The response keys C, V, B and N will be the only visible keys, all other&#xD;
      keys will be covered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will take place at a laboratory of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) or in&#xD;
      a silent room at the participant's home, under supervision of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a screening session (T0), in which baseline demographic characteristics (gender,&#xD;
      age, dominant hand) will be collected. Participants will be assigned to either the&#xD;
      conventional tDCS group or the HD tDCS group and will be seen four times (T1-T4) over the&#xD;
      course of minimally five to maximally eleven weeks. All four sessions will start with a&#xD;
      practice SRT-task of one random block of 25 trials, followed by the actual experimental&#xD;
      SRT-task of eight blocks of 72 trials with a thirty second break between consecutive blocks.&#xD;
      In Blocks 1 through 6 and Block 8, the order of the target (i.e. black dot) locations will&#xD;
      follow a repeating sequence. This is unbeknown to the participant. The rationale is that&#xD;
      reaction times will decrease with repetition of the sequence throughout Blocks 1-6 and 8,&#xD;
      denoting a general training effect (secondary outcome measure). When the repeating sequence&#xD;
      suddenly changes to a random sequence in Block 7, reaction time will increase in Block 7 and&#xD;
      decrease once more in regularly sequenced Block 8, denoting a sequence-specific learning&#xD;
      effect (primary outcome measure). To control for possible carry-over effects, the SRT-task&#xD;
      will follow a different sequence in each stimulation condition (e.g. 132342134142 in T1-T2&#xD;
      and 243413241213 in T3-T4). To make sure IMSL is independent of a specific sequence, six&#xD;
      different, structurally identical, sequences of 12 elements long will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      between the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interventional session (T1) will be planned at least 1 week after the screening&#xD;
      session (T0) and will consist of active (anodal) tDCS or sham (placebo) tDCS administered&#xD;
      during the SRT-task. Five minutes post-tDCS, subjects will be asked to carry out a short,&#xD;
      three-block version of the SRT-task without application of tDCS to investigate potential&#xD;
      short-term consolidation effects: Blocks 1 and 3 following the same regular sequence as&#xD;
      earlier; Block 2 following a random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session (T2) will be planned one week later. During this one-week post-tDCS&#xD;
      session the same, full version of the SRT-task from one week earlier will be performed, this&#xD;
      time without the application of tDCS, to determine potential long-term consolidation effects.&#xD;
      After T2, a washout period of at least three weeks will be planned to control for carry-over&#xD;
      effects between the two stimulation conditions (active/sham tDCS). Cross-over will take place&#xD;
      and the same procedure with the opposite stimulation condition will be repeated during the&#xD;
      third (T3) interventional and fourth (T4) follow-up session. Half of participants in each&#xD;
      group will have received active tDCS during T1 and sham tDCS during T3, while the other half&#xD;
      of participants will have received these conditions in reversed and randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current stimulation will be slowly ramped up from 0 mA to 2 mA in one minute. For the&#xD;
      anodal tDCS condition, this intensity will be maintained for the duration of the SRT-task&#xD;
      (approximately 20 minutes), For the sham tDCS condition - unbeknown to the subject -&#xD;
      stimulation will be gradually decreased towards 0 mA immediately after the one-minute&#xD;
      ramp-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-SRT-task questionnaire will be completed after the last session (T4) to determine&#xD;
      whether participants became aware of the sequential nature of the task. If participants&#xD;
      indicate that they believe a specific sequence appeared, they will have to reproduce the&#xD;
      sequence of the last session as correct as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be carried out using International Business Machines (IBM)&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics version 26. The level of&#xD;
      significance will be set at α = 0.05. A trend towards significance will be defined as 0.05 ≤&#xD;
      α &lt; 0.10. Appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons will be made when necessary.&#xD;
      Cohen's f effect sizes will be reported, with values of .10, .25, and .40 representing small,&#xD;
      medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of null-effects, the investigators will conclude that there is no evidence of a&#xD;
      difference between conditions. However, the investigators will also calculate post-hoc Bayes&#xD;
      factors for each group (conventional tDCS, HD tDCS) to assess whether a lack of difference in&#xD;
      sequence learning between the anodal and sham stimulation conditions could be interpreted as&#xD;
      evidence for the absence of an effect of tDCS on sequence learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analyses, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons, will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate if the amount of IMSL correlates with demographical, variables (including&#xD;
      clinical subtypes of PD). If assumptions for parametrical testing are violated, the&#xD;
      non-parametric alternative Spearman's Rho will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the SRT-tasks during, at 5 minutes post and one week post sham tDCS will&#xD;
      serve as baseline measures to be compared with the outcomes following actual anodal tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the SRT-task performance will be based on median reaction time (RT) per block&#xD;
      instead of mean RT to minimize potential outlier effects. Practice trials, the first response&#xD;
      after each break, erroneous responses and responses following an error will be excluded from&#xD;
      the analyses. Median RTs per block will be analyzed to determine (1) a general learning&#xD;
      effect (secondary outcome measure) and (2) a sequence-specific learning effect (primary&#xD;
      outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General learning effects during and at one-week post-tDCS will be derived from a decline in&#xD;
      median RTs over the seven regularly sequenced blocks (i.e. Blocks 1-6 and Block 8). This will&#xD;
      not be applicable to the 5-minutes post-tDCS SRT-task as it is a short version with only&#xD;
      three blocks. A 2x2x2x7 repeated measures ANOVA will be carried out with device (conventional&#xD;
      tDCS, HD tDCS) as between-subjects factor and stimulation (active, sham), time (during,&#xD;
      post1week) and block (Blocks 1-6, Block 8) as within-subjects factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-specific learning effects during, 5 minutes and 1 week post-tDCS will be analyzed by&#xD;
      subtracting the mean of the median RTs of adjacent sequenced blocks (Blocks 6 and 8 during&#xD;
      stimulation and at one week post-tDCS; Blocks 1 and 3 at 5 minutes post-tDCS) from the median&#xD;
      RT of the random block (Block 7 during stimulation and at 1-week post-tDCS; Block 2 at&#xD;
      5-minutes post-tDCS). A 2x2x2x3 repeated measures ANOVA (or Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      tests as non-parametrical alternatives) will be carried out with device (conventional tDCS,&#xD;
      HD tDCS) as between-subjects factor and stimulation (active, sham), sequence (random block,&#xD;
      mean of adjacent sequenced blocks) and time (during, post5min, post1week) as within-subject&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case assumptions of sphericity are violated, Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt corrections&#xD;
      will be reported. Bonferroni-corrected t-tests will be implemented to further analyze&#xD;
      significant main and interaction effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Error percentages in the SRT-task are generally small and thus, because of a limited number&#xD;
      of observations, less sensitive to IMSL. The percentage erroneous reactions per block will be&#xD;
      calculated for both stimulation conditions (anodal, sham) and for the three measurements over&#xD;
      time (concurrent, post5minutes, post1week). The Shapiro-Wilk test of residuals will be&#xD;
      carried out to evaluate normality of distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequential score, as outcome measure for explicit knowledge, will be taken up as a&#xD;
      covariate in the analyses. An independent samples t-test (or non-parametrical alternative&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test) will be carried out to ascertain whether the sequential scores (x/12) of&#xD;
      the conventional tDCS group are different from the HD tDCS group.&#xD;
