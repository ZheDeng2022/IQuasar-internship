      This is a double-arm, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, the selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical&#xD;
      trials of similar foreign products. 120 patients will be enrolled for this trial. Primary&#xD;
      objective is to explore the safety.&#xD;
