  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present prospective cohort study (not randomized) analyses the value of screening and&#xD;
      treatment of SAHS in the management of patients with AF refractory to antiarrhythmics drugs,&#xD;
      potentially candidates for ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at low risk of suffering from SAHS will follow conventional management of their AF,&#xD;
      according to the usual criteria of the Arrhythmia Unit. Patients with high or intermediate&#xD;
      risk of SAHS, will undergo respiratory polygraphy. If the result is positive, they will be&#xD;
      treated as standard for this syndrome and their heart rate will be monitored for 3 months.&#xD;
      After this, the patient's arrhythmic load will be reevaluated differentiating patients into&#xD;
      two groups, those that must be ablated from those that have improved their condition and the&#xD;
      clinical criteria is no longer ablation but follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion will have a&#xD;
      Stop-Bang questionnaire to define the risk of having a SAHS The assessment of results&#xD;
      classifies people at high, intermediate or low risk of SAHS. Low-risk patients will follow&#xD;
      conventional management according to the usual criteria of the Arrhythmia Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high or intermediate-risk will be given a Kardia© recorder and they will be&#xD;
      instructed to obtain records of their cardiac rhythm every 5 days (at any time) and whenever&#xD;
      the symptoms are suggestived of arrhythmia. This allows estimating arrhythmic load baseline&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also will be given a 7-channel home respiratory polygraphy (with pulse oximetry&#xD;
      record, naso-buccal air flow through nasal cannula and thermistor, snoring, thoracoabdominal&#xD;
      movements and electrocardiogram). The day after conducting the home polygraphic record, the&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated in the Pneumology Outpatient Department, where risk factors,&#xD;
      symptoms and Epworth's sleepiness scale will be assessed, the results of the&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory polygraphic record, interpreted by Pneumology Service will be given , and&#xD;
      based on the above, the diagnosis of SAHS will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients diagnosed with SAHS will be treated in the Pneumology Service according to&#xD;
      usual practice (dietary hygienic measures, CPAP, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all this time, patients will continue using their rhythm recorders as previously. The&#xD;
      overall effect of SAHS treatment on AF recurrences (comparison of arrhythmic load in the&#xD;
      previous 3 months with that of the 3 months post-treatment) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of starting the treatment, a follow-up respiratory polygraphy will be carried&#xD;
      out, where the relationship between the changes in AHI and desaturation index as well as&#xD;
      changes in arrhythmic load will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the follow-up respiratory polygraphy is performed, the indication of AF ablation will be&#xD;
      reassessed. Patients who continue with symptomatic recurrences of AF refractory to&#xD;
      antiarrhythmics will undergo ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be analyzed that proportion of patients initially candidates for ablation cease to&#xD;
      fulfill conditions for this by a better control of recurrences and &quot;leave the waiting list&quot;.&#xD;
      Likewise, the results of the ablation of the cohort of patients diagnosed with SAHS and the&#xD;
      moderate or high-risk cohort of SAHS, but with negative polygraphy and diagnosis, will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arrhythmic load after AF ablation will be analysed, during the blinding period (3 months&#xD;
      post-ablation) and one year after the ablation. Patients will continue their SAHS treatment&#xD;
      according to the usual practice of the Pneumology Service.&#xD;
