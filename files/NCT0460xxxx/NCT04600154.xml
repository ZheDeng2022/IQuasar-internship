  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cachexia has been recognized as a direct cause of reduced quality of life complicating in&#xD;
      cancer patients. Patients with pancreatic cancer have the highest prevalence in developing&#xD;
      severe degrees of cachexia. Providing supportive therapies for these patients may provide a&#xD;
      lot of benefit on overarching quality of life and improve overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS-20 is indicated for treating the symptom of fatigue and loss of appetite induced by&#xD;
      chemotherapy in cancer patients. According to the result from pre-clinical study, MS-20 may&#xD;
      have potential to attenuate or suppress the resistant phenomena of chemotherapy via&#xD;
      alternating gut microbiota profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, MS-20 effects on on gut microbiota and risk/severity of cachexia will be&#xD;
      analyzed in pancreatic cancer patients who under combination therapy with chemotherapy and&#xD;
      MS-20.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated randomized trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of MS-20 on gut microbiota and risk/severity of cachexia in patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Approximately 40 subjects who meet the criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the study. The total of study comprises of a 28 days screening period,&#xD;
      a 12-week treatment period and a 8-week follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates should provide signed informed consent forms before starting any&#xD;
      screening activities. MS-20 or placebo will be orally administered twice per day in treatment&#xD;
      period. All medications (especially antibiotics) should be recorded and documented during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if any of the following conditions&#xD;
      occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects who experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) or intolerable adverse event&#xD;
           (AE), or laboratory safety assessments reveal clinically significant hematological or&#xD;
           biochemical changes from baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subject would like to withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time,&#xD;
           for any reason, without any influence on further treatment. (Patients who withdraw or&#xD;
           terminate early from study should proceed to EOT visit for safety evaluation.)&#xD;
