      This study will compare radial vs femoral access for angiography in adolescents.&#xD;
      Neuroangiography and neurointerventions are predominantly performed via femoral access, which&#xD;
      has several limitations and complications - pain and discomfort, arterial occlusion,&#xD;
      retroperitoneal hemorrhage, activity limitations, and increased admissions. Transradial&#xD;
      angiography has shown promise to circumvent these problems, but this has not been studied in&#xD;
      children, whose unique anatomical and physiological aspects require that this be evaluated&#xD;
      rigorously.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiography in interventional radiology is still most commonly performed through femoral&#xD;
      arterial access, wherein patients are committed to invasive procedures through access at&#xD;
      their groin, which entails anxiety, embarrassment, pain and discomfort, the inability to&#xD;
      resume normal activities for a week, serious complications like retroperitoneal hemorrhage,&#xD;
      and increased hospital admissions. Angiography through access at the wrist (transradial&#xD;
      angiography) has been shown with some recent data to circumvent these complications and, in&#xD;
      general, provide a more satisfactory and safe patient experience. Although transradial&#xD;
      angiography has been rapidly accepted by some operators, especially in Cardiology, the&#xD;
      absence of evidence for technical details and safety has resulted in much debate in the&#xD;
      literature and in recent conferences. Specifically, there is no literature reported in&#xD;
      children. The benefits of a method which would allow mobility immediately after the procedure&#xD;
      in children are self-evident - this would potentially result in less rebleeds, require little&#xD;
      or no sedation, allow sitting up and feeding, and allow parents to interact with their child&#xD;
      and feel more comfortable. On the flip side, the feasibility and potential complications in&#xD;
      children are unknown, and thus this technique cannot be integrated into clinical practice&#xD;
      without interrogating this. This should be ideally performed in a high volume pediatric&#xD;
      center with expertise in not only pediatric neuroangiography, but also for minimally invasive&#xD;
      arterial access with interventional radiology, to minimize complications. Given the size&#xD;
      consideration of arteries in children, we believe a good start point for this study would be&#xD;
      with adolescent children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator's objective is to provide the highest level of evidence (RCT data) for&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and technique of transradial angiography in adolescents, by comparing it&#xD;
      against the current gold standard, trans-femoral angiography. This will provide data for&#xD;
      subsequent practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in a tertiary pediatric institution, with collaboration between&#xD;
      interventional radiologists, neuroradiologists, pediatricians, neurosurgeons, technologists,&#xD;
      statisticians, research co-ordinators and imaging physicists. A large number of clinical&#xD;
      cases, established pipelines for clinical workflow and research collaborations and imaging&#xD;
      laboratories with personnel and students would enable us to successfully complete this&#xD;
      project in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroangiography and neurointerventions are predominantly performed via femoral access, which&#xD;
      has several limitations and complications - pain and discomfort, arterial occlusion,&#xD;
      retroperitoneal hemorrhage, activity limitations, and increased admissions. Transradial&#xD;
      angiography has shown promise to circumvent these problems, but this has not been studied in&#xD;
      children, whose unique anatomical and physiological aspects require that this be evaluated&#xD;
      rigorously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate procedural comfort and acceptance of transradial vs. transfemoral&#xD;
      neuroangiography in a cohort of randomized adolescent children. This will be performed using&#xD;
      patient self-reported pain and satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate procedural safety for transradial vs. transfemoral neuroangiography in a&#xD;
      cohort of adolescent children. This will be performed by comparing fluoroscopy time and dose,&#xD;
      procedural and long-term complication rates, study completeness and admission times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Children (8-18 years) scheduled for supra-aortic angiography will be approached to&#xD;
      participate. Inclusion cut-offs: radial artery ultrasound diameter &gt;20mm and positive Allen&#xD;
      test. For 95% power (primary aim), the Investigator will require a sample size of 56.&#xD;
      Neuroangiography will be performed as clinically indicated, with collection of demographics,&#xD;
      procedural details (screening time, radiation dose, completeness and complications) and&#xD;
      post-procedural details (visual analog pain scale, satisfaction score, complications). A Data&#xD;
      &amp; Safety Monitoring board will audit the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Self-reported scores will be compared between groups for procedural&#xD;
      acceptance; complications will be compared for procedural safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: 1) This study will provide the highest level evidence regarding role and safety&#xD;
      of transradial neuroangiography in children. 2) Subsequent development of practice guideline&#xD;
      recommendations for a standardized protocol for transradial angiography in children.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 8-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned cerebral or supra-aortic angiography for clinical reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive modified Allen's test using a pulse oximeter on the index finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Radial artery axial maximal diameter of &gt; 2.0 mm measured on a cross-sectional B-mode&#xD;
             ultrasound of the distal radial artery, 2-3 cm proximal to the radial styloid, at the&#xD;
             anticipated needle puncture site -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt;8 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Radial artery internal maximal of diameter 2.0 mm or less (measured on cross-sectional&#xD;
             ultrasound 2-3 cm proximal to the radial styloid at the planned puncture site) - these&#xD;
             patients would be converted to femoral access without radial artery puncture but would&#xD;
             be assessed in the radial artery group as part of an intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Conversion to intervention (as opposed to diagnostic cerebral angiogram) during the&#xD;
             procedure, as this will likely require a larger (femoral) access sheath; again such&#xD;
             patients will still be assessed as part of the intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Failed modified Allen's test with pulse oximetry&#xD;
