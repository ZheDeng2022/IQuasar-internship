      This clinical study is an open-label, multicenter, interventional, Phase 4 study to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in genomic alterations for 73 PC driver genes during apalutamide treatment in&#xD;
      patients with mCSPC. A total of 100 participants to be treated by apalutamide will be&#xD;
      registered in this study. All participants will undergo blood collection for ctDNA,&#xD;
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at pre- and&#xD;
      posttreatment of apalutamide.&#xD;

             therapy of stable disease or better, by investigator assessment of imaging and PSA.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant is of Japanese nationality.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant does not agree to assess ctDNA including 73 PC driver genes, SNPs, and HLA&#xD;
             typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received any prior therapy of abiraterone, docetaxel, enzalutamide,&#xD;
             apalutamide or darolutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to apalutamide or&#xD;
             its excipients (refer to the package insert).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has contraindications to the use of ADT based on routine treatment.&#xD;

             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., compromise&#xD;
             the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the evaluation of active&#xD;
             double cancer, etc.&#xD;
