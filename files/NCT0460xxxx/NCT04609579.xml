  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called SNX281 given by itself and in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma. The main goals of&#xD;
      this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of SNX281 that can be given to participants safely alone and&#xD;
           in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects and safety profile of SNX281 alone and in combination&#xD;
           with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about pharmacological characteristics of SNX281 alone and in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about effectiveness of SNX281 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SNX281 is a small molecule activator of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) protein,&#xD;
      with good drug-like properties. Activation of STING initiates the innate immune response and&#xD;
      enhances the adaptive immune response, which could potentially activate immune responses to&#xD;
      tumors and enhance the response to certain immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase I, first in human, open-label study of SNX281 conducted in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. The study will comprise of two treatment arms: one&#xD;
      evaluating SNX281 as a single-agent, and the other evaluating SNX281 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Each treatment arm is designed to include a dose escalation phase followed by&#xD;
      a dose expansion phase intended to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation phase of each treatment arm, successive cohorts of participants will&#xD;
      receive increasing doses of SNX281 designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      the dose with maximum pharmacologic activity, or the maximum feasible dose, as a single-agent&#xD;
      and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose expansion phases of each treatment arm will begin following the determination of an&#xD;
      MTD or alternative dose of SNX281 in each respective treatment arm. The single-agent&#xD;
      treatment arm of SNX281 is planned to evaluate at least 2 expansion cohorts in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      and colorectal carcinoma while the combination treatment arm of SNX281 and pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      planned to enroll subjects with advanced cancer who have relapsed on or have become&#xD;
      refractory to prior immune checkpoint therapy given in an indicated setting.&#xD;
