  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a positive mental health program for&#xD;
      adults, designated Mentis Plus+, in community. Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compared with the wait-list control group, the persons who join the experimental group&#xD;
           and participate in the Mentis Plus+, will have more positive mental health on the end of&#xD;
           the program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in the Mentis Plus+ participants, positive mental health will be increased at the end of&#xD;
           the program and at follow-up (three- six months later) and their psychological&#xD;
           vulnerability will reduce.&#xD;

    <measure>Positive Mental Health Questionnaire (PMHQ) - moment 1</measure>
    <time_frame>PMHQ will be applied in the baseline of the Mentis Plus+ Program, to both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The PMHQ consists of 39 items. In the PMHQ, values between 39 (minimum value) and 156 (maximum value) can be obtained, and higher the value obtained, lower the positive Mental Health level is. Therefore, we can categorize different levels of Positive Mental Health: High level or Flourishing (Results between 39-78), Intermediate level (Results between 79-117) and Low level or Languising (Results between 118-156).</description>

    <time_frame>PVS will be applied in the baseline of the Mentis Plus+ Program, to both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The PVS is a six-item scale. Each item is measured in a scale Frequency Likert five points (1-5), where a higher number corresponds to greater frequency (does not describe me at all = 1 to describes me very well = 5). Possible total scores range from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater psychological vulnerability.&#xD;

    <description>Mentis Plus+ Program was developed based in The Multifactorial Model of Positive Mental Health and its construction resulted from a systematic literature review and validation through focus group. The duration of the Mentis Plus+ program depends on the number of the six factors to be worked on. The Mentis Plus+ lasts at least 7 weeks (1 session per week, lasting 1 hour) and can work individually or in groups (2-12 people). There will be 2 initial sessions of 1 hour each and 3 sessions for each factor to work with duration of 1 hour. Still, a final session and a follow-up session (3-6 months after the program) will be held.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group were told they were on a waiting list for 3-6 months, as a minimum, before they integrate the Mentis Plus+ program. Given the preventive nature of this study, a waiting list control group won't bring risks or damages to participants</description>

    <description>Each factor can be considered a module, so it is a modular program. So, each module has 3 sessions to be carried out in full. It is a systematic program, so the order of the sessions is regulated by the letters A, B and C for each module. The modules to be worked on correspond to the &quot;low-level or languising&quot; factors identified after the application of the positive mental health questionnaire (PMHQ). After the application of the PMHQ, people are grouped with the same module to work.</description>
