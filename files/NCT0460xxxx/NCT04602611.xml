  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the impact of the Oncology Nurse Navigation&#xD;
      program on the frequency of Emergency Department, urgent care visits and inpatient hospital&#xD;
      admissions; and overall survival rate at 6 months. The investigators aim to understand if&#xD;
      prompt and effective coordination of care provided by Oncology Nurse Navigation (ONN) service&#xD;
      will reduce the number of avoidable, unplanned ED visits and hospitalizations, as well as&#xD;
      adding measurable value to cancer care, and improve patient overall survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled prospective trial evaluating the effectiveness of a nurse navigation&#xD;
      program for gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing oncological treatment. Upon accrual,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive standard of care plus ONN service (n = 107) or&#xD;
      standard of care only (without ONN service; n = 107). Patients in both arms will be assessed&#xD;
      for acute care utilization and overall survival (OS) rate at 6 months. Anticipated accrual&#xD;
      period will be 30 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Subjects can be enrolled within, but no later than 30 days after initiation&#xD;
