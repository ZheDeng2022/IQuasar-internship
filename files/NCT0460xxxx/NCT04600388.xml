    <textblock>
      Post-marketing, retrospective, observational survey study. Users (menstruating women only) of&#xD;
      Nerivio who have used Nerivio at least 4 times between October 2019 and December 2020 will be&#xD;
      contacted by email and/or through an app notification and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      5-minute online anonymous survey assessing satisfaction, effectiveness, and safety. Eligible&#xD;
      users will sign an informed consent form (the consent language will appear as the first page&#xD;
      of the survey, and participants will click either &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;disagree&quot; to the consent&#xD;
      statement; those who click &quot;agree&quot; will proceed to the survey, those who click &quot;disagree&quot;&#xD;
      will be brought to an exit page) and complete a survey asking about their satisfaction with&#xD;
      Nerivio and the effectiveness and safety of the device for acute treatment of menstrual&#xD;
      migraine. During the survey, participants will be screened to verify that they have menstrual&#xD;
      migraine (self-reported) and have used Nerivio to treat menstrual migraines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nerivio for the acute treatment of&#xD;
      menstrual migraine (pure menstrual migraine or menstrually-related migraine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 500 US-based adults aged 18-55 years old who have been prescribed the Nerivio device&#xD;
      and have used it at least 4 times between October 2019 and December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent must be obtained from the participant before any protocol-related activities&#xD;
      are performed. The consent language will appear as the first page of the survey, and&#xD;
      participants will click either &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;disagree&quot; to the consent statement; those who&#xD;
      click &quot;agree&quot; will proceed to the survey, those who click &quot;disagree&quot; will be brought to an&#xD;
      exit page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Users of Nerivio whose details are in the sponsor's database will be contacted by email&#xD;
      (provided by the patient during the sign-up process in the Nerivio app required to use the&#xD;
      device) and/or through an app notification and will be asked to complete a 5-minute online&#xD;
      survey assessing satisfaction, effectiveness, and safety. Participants will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form which will appear as the first page of the survey using open-ended questions,&#xD;
      multiple choice questions and Likert scales. Participants will be directed to provide honest&#xD;
      opinions regarding the device use for menstrual migraine. No additional information will be&#xD;
      collected, and no medical records will be used in this investigation.&#xD;
