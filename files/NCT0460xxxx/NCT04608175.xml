  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Fortunately,&#xD;
      survival has improved in recent years thanks to its early detection and curative treatments&#xD;
      such as mastectomy. However, this medical procedure is associated with a range of unwanted&#xD;
      effects such as postoperative pain and anxiety. Some studies have reported that acupuncture&#xD;
      could be an effective treatment to control these types of symptoms, although only few studies&#xD;
      have been conducted on women undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with blind assessors. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in the Breast Unit of Hospital Universitario Sagrado Corazon of Barcelona&#xD;
      (Spain). A sample of 40 women will be recruited and randomized to receive acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment in addition to standard care procedures, or standard care procedures alone. The&#xD;
      main outcome, pain, will be assessed after the surgical intervention and 4, 10 and 30 days&#xD;
      later using the numerical rating scale. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, use of&#xD;
      analgesics, nausea, adverse effects, and surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Acupuncture is a low-cost non-pharmacological strategy. This study will help to&#xD;
      clarify its possible role in controlling post-mastectomy adverse effects.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental group will receive the standard treatment administered in these cases (analgesic regimen and nursing care procedures), in addition to the following acupuncture therapy.&#xD;
In the first visit (preoperative), the anamnesis and energy diagnosis of each patient will be carried out following the practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to design a personalized treatment based on the patient's medical history. A treatment of approximately 10 to 12 acupuncture points will be designed considering the TCM diagnosis and medical history of each patient. Both TCM diagnosis and the points used will be reassessed in each session. The points belonging to the upper extremity of the affected breast will be treated on the contralateral side, taking care not to insert any needle in the limb on the affected side. No points in the operated region will be used.</description>
