      This is a prospective, single arm, single center clinical study to evaluate efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of a Supercritical CO2 viral-inactivated allogenic bone paste in cervical interbody&#xD;
      fusion. Patient eligible for 1- or 2-level ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion)&#xD;
      combined with bone graft after failure of well-conducted medical treatment will be screened&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical and lumbar fusion are often the best option for various degenerative conditions that&#xD;
      do not respond to conservative treatment. Historically, the reference technique for cervical&#xD;
      fusion was the use of iliac crest autogenic bone graft (ICBG). However, the use of ICBG has&#xD;
      several drawbacks, including the morbidity of the donor site, the increase in operating time&#xD;
      and the variable quality of autograft. Alternatives to ICBG for cervical fusion include the&#xD;
      use of allografts, graft extensions and osteobiological materials to improve fusion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single arm, single center clinical study to evaluate efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of a Supercritical CO2 viral-inactivated allogenic bone paste in cervical interbody&#xD;
      fusion. Patient eligible for 1- or 2-level ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion)&#xD;
      combined with bone graft after failure of well-conducted medical treatment will be screened&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed up postoperatively per standard of care at 3 months, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      and 24 months at the clinic. The following outcomes will be measured: overall success, Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index (NDI), VAS neck and arm pain, SF-12 health survey, major complications,&#xD;
      subsequent surgery rate, and fusion rate on radiological examinations. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is a FDA composite definition of success comprising clinical improvement and absence of major&#xD;
      complications and secondary surgery events.&#xD;
