  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates a new delivery method for the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9), a clinically accepted tool for diagnosing major depressive disorder. The new tool&#xD;
      records auditory responses to the assesment and the study will examine if the instrument is&#xD;
      effective at capturing participant depression levels. If proven effective, future studies may&#xD;
      investigate if the new format can be used to improve at home clinical care.&#xD;

      This study is an investigation of a new delivery system of the Patient Health Questionnaire -&#xD;
      9 (PHQ-9), a clinically accepted tool for diagnosing major depressive disorder. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to examine if the new delivery system of the PHQ-9 is effective at capturing&#xD;
      participant depression levels. The new version uses a Mirror device, which is similar to a&#xD;
      smart television with a mirror interface. The device records auditory responses to the PHQ-9&#xD;
      through Amazon Alexa. We will be comparing the responses from the Mirror device to those&#xD;
      given on the clinically established paper format. If proven effective at capturing depression&#xD;
      levels of patients, future studies may investigate if the new format can be used to improve&#xD;
      at home clinical care.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a repeated measure, mixed methods design (i.e., it will contain both qualitative and quantitative components). Newly admitted patients will be asked to complete the questionnaires (i.e., PHQ-9 and the UEQ) at two different time points (i.e., Baseline and 1-month follow-up). In order to reduce or control for order effects, the procedure will be counterbalanced.</intervention_model_description>
