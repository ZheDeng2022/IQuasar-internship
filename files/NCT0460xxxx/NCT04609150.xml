  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a disease that causes increased bone fragility which is often revealed or&#xD;
      complicated by vertebral fractures. Invasion of bone marrow by tumor plasma cells leads to&#xD;
      bone destruction and reduced fat fraction. The main objective is to assess the correlation&#xD;
      between vertebral bone marrow fat fraction and bone fragility represented by a severity score&#xD;
      of vertebral fractures. The secondary objective is to assess the correlation with clinical&#xD;
      and biological prognostic factors and scores..&#xD;

      Patients treated with vertebroplasty will be included during the period of the study,&#xD;
      retrospectively or prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mains collected data are represented by :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow fat fraction determined by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity score for vertebral fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical prognostic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological prognostic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinico-biological scores Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses will be&#xD;
           performed between the measured parameters.&#xD;
