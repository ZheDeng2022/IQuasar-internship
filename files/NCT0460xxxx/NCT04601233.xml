      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of testosterone treatment on erectile&#xD;
      function, fatigue, depression, cognitive function, quality of life, urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      pain, and damage to neurons in male Multiple Sclerosis patients with low testosterone, using&#xD;
      questionnaires, blood samples and a rectal exam in volunteers 55 years and older.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will be treated weekly with Xyosted 75 mg (given subcutaneously) for 3 months&#xD;
      during which they will have 3 study visits, 6 weeks apart. The Baseline visit will include&#xD;
      providing a blood sample, completing questionnaires, receiving training on the Xyosted&#xD;
      auto-injector, and undergoing a rectal exam for participants 55 years and older. Visits 2 and&#xD;
      3 will also include collecting a blood sample and completing questionnaires. At Visit 3, the&#xD;
      rectal exam for those age 55 years and older will be repeated.&#xD;
