      This study is a open-lable , single arm，single center, phase II clinical study. Target&#xD;
      population is patients with high-risk Soft tissue sarcoma. Study objective is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with Liposome doxorubicin and Ifosfamide&#xD;
      in study population in China. Camrelizumab is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
