  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year after cabozantinib initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is the time between treatment initiation and the date of death from any cause. For participants who are alive, their survival time will be censored at the last date that they were known to be alive if before 1 year.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve partial or complete response from the start of the study treatment. The ORR will be assessed by tumour response evaluation according to investigator assessment. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice by the physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR) at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BOR is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the disease progression/recurrence. The BOR will be assessed by tumour response evaluation according to investigator assessment. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice by the physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time elapsed from the date of first treatment intake to the date of documented progression reported by the investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression will be assessed by tumour response evaluation according to investigator assessment. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice as Progressive / not progressive disease by the physician.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL) change according to Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FKSI-19) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 15, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL change from baseline. The score will be evaluated with FKSI 19 questionnaires at the planned visits and at treatment discontinuation. The FKSI-19 is a disease-specific instrument that measures disease and treatment-related symptoms in 4 domains by using a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Higher scores represent better health. A negative change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 15, 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess pain according to the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire and analgesic consumption/duration and the time for improvement of symptomatology. BPI-SF has a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 indicating &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.</description>
