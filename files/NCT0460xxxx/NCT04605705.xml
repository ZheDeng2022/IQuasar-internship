      This prospective study will take place at Hotel Dieu de France hospital in Lebanon. One&#xD;
      hundred children undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease between May 2020 and&#xD;
      May 2021 will be included. After obtaining the informed consent of the parents, demographic&#xD;
      and surgical information will be collected. Serum creatinine, lactic acid, urinary neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin marker (NGAL), and oxygen (O2) saturation will be measured&#xD;
      before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pediatric NIRS sensor will be placed on the right side below the costo-vertebral angle&#xD;
      overlying the right kidney and continuous regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) will be recorded&#xD;
      every 5 to 10 minutes throughout the operation until 24 hours after surgery. The children&#xD;
      will be divided into 2 groups; 50 each. Grp 1: No clinical intervention was performed based&#xD;
      on NIRS values. Grp 2: several maneuvers are performed such as an increase in cardiac output,&#xD;
      temperature, hemoglobin to optimize the value of NIRS &gt; 80%. All patients will receive&#xD;
      standard standard care during the study period and continuous infusion of furosemide (0.5-1&#xD;
      mg / kg / 6 hours) within the first 24-48 hours postoperatively will be administered to all&#xD;
      patients. Creatinine and lactic acid will be measured immediately postoperatively and then&#xD;
      once a day until D2 and D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary NGAL marker will be dosed immediately postoperatively and then at 2h, 6h, 12h and&#xD;
      24h with hourly monitoring of diuresis and NIRS until 24h postoperatively.&#xD;

      This prospective study will take place at Hotel Dieu de France hospital in Lebanon. One&#xD;
      hundred children aged 16 and under, undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (CPB) for congenital heart diseases will be included between May 2020 and May 2021. The&#xD;
      surgeries to be included will be the tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great&#xD;
      arteries, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect and the atrioventricular canal&#xD;
      defect. Any premature under 35 weeks of gestation, the presence of a genetic disease, an&#xD;
      abnormal renal ultrasound, a preoperative renal failure with creatinine abnormal for age, or&#xD;
      repeated urinary tract infections will be excluded from the study. After obtaining the&#xD;
      informed consent of the parents, demographic information (age, weight, height, sex) will be&#xD;
      collected..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine, lactic acid, urinary NGAL marker, and O2 saturation will be measured before&#xD;
      the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pediatric NIRS sensor will be placed on the right side below the costo-vertebral angle&#xD;
      covering the right kidney and continuous rSO2 will be recorded every 5 to 10 minutes&#xD;
      throughout the operation as well as with each change of situation, then every hour in&#xD;
      pediatric resuscitation until 24 hours postoperatively. The children will be divided into 2&#xD;
      groups of 50 patients each; Grp 1: No clinical intervention will be performed based on the&#xD;
      NIRS and Grp 2: several maneuvers will be performed in case the NIRS values are below 50%,&#xD;
      such as an increase in cardiac output, temperature, hemoglobin to optimize the NIRS value by&#xD;
      up to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical information (cardiac pathology, surgical procedure, operating time, duration of CPB,&#xD;
      duration of aortic cross-clamping, duration of circulatory arrest, intraoperative&#xD;
      complications) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard standard care during the study period. Patients will&#xD;
      receive continuous infusion of furosemide (0.5-1 mg / kg / 6 hours) within the first 24-48&#xD;
      hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the need for catecholamines, the hemodynamic stability according to the&#xD;
      Vasoactive-Inotropic Score (VIS), the delay to extubation, the stay in intensive care, the&#xD;
      complications that occurred and the need for recourse to the dialysis will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine and lactic acid will be measured immediately postoperatively and then once a day&#xD;
      until D2 and D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary NGAL marker will be dosed immediately postoperatively and then at 2h, 6h, 12h and&#xD;
      24h with hourly monitoring of diuresis and NIRS until 24h postoperatively.&#xD;
