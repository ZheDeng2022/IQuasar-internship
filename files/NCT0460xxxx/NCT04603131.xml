    <textblock>
      Chikungunya vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine. There will be three study arms and&#xD;
      subjects will be vaccinated in a dose escalation manner.In each arm, vaccine will be&#xD;
      administered on Day 1, Day 29, and Day 57. Vaccine will be administered through intramuscular&#xD;
      route.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I study for assessing the safety, tolerance and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      3 escalated doses of the test vaccine, BBV87. The study design has four treatment groups - 3&#xD;
      test groups and a control placebo group with 15 subjects in each group. However, the groups&#xD;
      will be divided into three study arms: each arm will have 15 subjects of the test vaccine&#xD;
      group and 5 subjects of the placebo group. The randomization will be done in a way that&#xD;
      allots 5 subjects of the placebo group to each test dose group. All subjects will be screened&#xD;
      (via medical history, physical examination and laboratory investigations) to establish the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This includes negative antibodies, CHIKV IgG, by ELISA method. The test&#xD;
      vaccine and placebo will be administered as 3 doses at 28 days interval on day 1±2, 29±2, and&#xD;
      57±2. Vaccine administration will be performed as an in-patient procedure. Subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted in CPU 24 hrs prior to vaccine administration, and will be shifted to MICU for&#xD;
      vaccination and observed for 48 hrs; and will be discharged upon completion of all clinical&#xD;
      monitoring procedures. Laboratory and biochemical tests will be performed as part of clinical&#xD;
      monitoring before discharge, and 24 hrs after vaccine administration. Following vaccination,&#xD;
      all participants will be monitored throughout the study period for adverse events with daily&#xD;
      telephone contacts (for 7 days after each vaccine, and then weekly), interim clinic visits,&#xD;
      subject diary cards, and haematological &amp; biochemical laboratory tests.&#xD;
