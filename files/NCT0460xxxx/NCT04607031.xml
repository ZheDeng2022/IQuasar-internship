  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early outcome prediction after ischemic stroke (IS) is of great importance. Prognosis is&#xD;
      usually based on clinical variables and neuroradiological findings while serum biomarkers may&#xD;
      contribute to prognostic accuracy. Inflammatory biomarker Suppression of Tumorigenicity 2&#xD;
      (ST2) has been shown as promising in IMU outcome predicting. The relationship between ST2&#xD;
      serum values and IS severity is not fully clarified. The proposed hypothesis is that earlier&#xD;
      releasing and higher ST2 serum concentrations will be associated with a worse IS outcome. In&#xD;
      this prospective and observational study 20 patients with IS will be included and followed.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is functional outcome according to the modified Ranking scale at 90 days.&#xD;
      In case of hypothesis confirmation, theoretical contribution will be in a better&#xD;
      understanding of pathophysiological changes in acute phase of IS, while the clinical purpose&#xD;
      is to improve the prognostic procedure.&#xD;

      The following data will be collected for all participants: 1. concentration of ST2&#xD;
      biochemical markers, 2. concentration of routine biochemical and hematological tests, 3.&#xD;
      prognostic indices of PNI and GPS, 3. sex, 4. age, 5. body weight, 6. body visa, 7. body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), 8. NIHSS, 9. volume of brain infarction, 10. exact time of onset of symptoms,&#xD;
      11. smoking, 12. excessive alcohol drinking, 13. drug abuse, 14. arterial hypertension, 16.&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, 17. presence of cardiac valve, 18. dyslipidemia, 19. diabetes, 20.&#xD;
      coronary disease, 21. liver dysfunction, 22. renal dysfunction, 23. peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease, 24. pre-existing stroke / transient ischemic attack, 25. positive family history,&#xD;
      26. complication of IS, 27. etiology of IS according to TOAST (criteria Trial of Org 10172 in&#xD;
      Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria, 28. localization of MU according to OCSP (Oxfordshire&#xD;
      Community Stroke Project) projects. Procedures: Laboratory parameters will be measured at&#xD;
      seven time points, monitored once daily for six consecutive days, and will include: complete&#xD;
      blood count, glucose concentration, sodium, urea, creatinine, C - reactive protein, total and&#xD;
      direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, urate,&#xD;
      total protein, albumin, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase enzyme activities, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl&#xD;
      transpeptidase. The prognostic indices of PNI (formula that includes albumin and leukocyte&#xD;
      count) and GPS (formula that includes CRP and albumin) will be calculated. The size of the IS&#xD;
      will be analyzed on the basis of computed tomography (CT) of the brain and CT of the brain&#xD;
      volumetry according to Pullicino formulas, in patients who will undergo brain CT initially&#xD;
      and at least 20-24 hours apart. The IS classification will enforce the use of the TOAST and&#xD;
      OCSP criteria. The severity of IS will be clinically assessed using the NIHSS scale at&#xD;
      hospital admissions and during each subsequent point in the study timeline. Stroke outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed using mRS on day 6 and day 90 (+/- 7 days) with a comparison of disability&#xD;
      on the same rating scale before hospitalization. Sampling will be done during regular&#xD;
      business hours and on duty (0-24 hours). Blood will be drawn by the nurse / technician from&#xD;
      the ante-cubital vein according to EFML-COABIOCLI guidelines. From the remaining blood&#xD;
      samples routinely taken as part of the patient's regular treatment, concentrations of&#xD;
      biochemical markers will be determined. In addition, at those time points (up to 6) at which&#xD;
      blood is not excluded during laboratory processing for laboratory testing, this will be done&#xD;
      for the purposes of this research. The maximum amount of additionally excluded blood for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study will therefore be 48 mL. Analysis of routine laboratory parameters&#xD;
      will be performed immediately after sampling. Part of the serum will be stored at -20 ° C for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis of the concentration of the biochemical marker ST2. Laboratory parameters&#xD;
      will be determined by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method on an automatic analyzer.&#xD;
