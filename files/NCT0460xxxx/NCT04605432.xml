  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      background:The use of enhanced instruction can improve the efficiency of education for bowel&#xD;
      preparation regimens. Researchers hypothesized that face-to-face instruction and personalized&#xD;
      intervention for inpatient could improve successful bowel preparation rate and patient's&#xD;
      compliance with regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:This was an endoscopist-blind,randomized controlled trial. 320inpatients were&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 in one of the two study groups. The intervention group received face-to-face&#xD;
      instruction and personalized intervention for bowel preparation protocol, while control group&#xD;
      received the standard bowel preparation protocol. Patients'demographics, bowel preparation&#xD;
      quality, colonoscopy completion and attendance were recorded. Logistic regression was&#xD;
      performed to identify predictors of bowel preparation failure.&#xD;

    <description>On the day before colonoscopy, an experienced researcher would go to the ward to have a face-to-face conversation with the patient to know if patients have the risk factors for bowel preparation failure.&#xD;
The bowel preparation regimens for patients with risk factors would be optimized. In addition to drink single dose of 120g Polyethylene Glycol (PEG-4000) with 3L water 4-6 h before colonoscopy at a rate of 250 ml every 15 min, the patient also drink single dose of 60g Polyethylene Glycol (PEG-4000) with 1L water at 20:00- 21:00 hours on the day before the colonoscopy. Patients without risk factors drink single dose of 120g Polyethylene Glycol (PEG-4000) with 3L water 4-6 h before colonoscopy at a rate of 250 ml every 15 min.&#xD;
Patients would received a booklet to explain the details of diet restriction, preparation method and the pictures of bowel preparation of results.The researcher would give a detailed oral explanation of the booklet.</description>
