      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is one of the most important public health conditions worldwide. The morbidity can&#xD;
      largely reduce life expectancy. Bariatric surgery for severe obesity is an effective&#xD;
      treatment that results in the improvement and remission of many obesity-related&#xD;
      comorbidities, cardiovascular benefits, as well as sustained weight loss and improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life. Different surgical procedures for weight loss have been developed, with the&#xD;
      most common ones being sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). RYGB is&#xD;
      the most commonly used procedure for weight loss in Switzerland, even though in the last&#xD;
      decades there has been a global shift towards SG. Independently from the applied procedure,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery remains the most effective and durable intervention for obesity. Modern&#xD;
      bariatric surgery has an excellent safety profile, even though complications in the short and&#xD;
      long term have been reported. Extensive research also increased the understanding of the wide&#xD;
      range of mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of bariatric surgery. The relative&#xD;
      contributions of these mechanisms vary according to the chosen procedure, where altered&#xD;
      satiety and hunger are considered important factors after RYGB. Other mechanisms have also&#xD;
      been proposed, including changes in gut hormones, reduced appetite, increased satiation,&#xD;
      increased energy expenditure, alteration in the gut microbiota and bile acids levels and&#xD;
      composition, as well as changes in vagal nerve signalling. Changes in food preferences have&#xD;
      also been implicated as an important candidate mechanism as patients prefer low-sugar low-fat&#xD;
      food and report finding food, in general, less enjoyable after RYGB. Both humans and rats eat&#xD;
      less and display altered food preferences after RYGB, but the underlying behavioural&#xD;
      mechanism remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of public health policy in the treatment of obesity should be the development of&#xD;
      effective prevention and better therapies which would eliminate the need for surgery&#xD;
      altogether. Until then, bariatric surgery is safe, effective, affordable, and with large room&#xD;
      for improvement. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the physiological changes underlying&#xD;
      the improvement of the morbidity may help in developing new therapies. So far, direct&#xD;
      measurements of changes in food selection in humans after RYGB have been limited by the&#xD;
      unreliability of patients, which poses significant methodological and conceptual challenges&#xD;
      to researchers and study design . Self-monitoring requires time and effort, and many find&#xD;
      tracking of dietary intake tedious, which contributes to attrition . Direct measurements,&#xD;
      however, represent an essential component in the attempt to understand how RYGB alters eating&#xD;
      and food preferences, but laboratory settings preclude a real-life environment. Consequently,&#xD;
      obesity researchers have attempted to develop new easier tracking methods such as photography&#xD;
      of food items to monitor dietary intake both in the clinical setting and everyday life. These&#xD;
      new methods seem more effective compared to others. For instance, mobile phone applications&#xD;
      of photographic food recognition (PFR) such as SNAQ enable patients to record and submit&#xD;
      consumed food items, portion sizes and frequency of consumption during a pre-defined period.&#xD;
      However, this technology is still in its infancy and assessment procedures need to be&#xD;
      validated by trained professionals. The doubly labeled water (DLW) method has been proposed&#xD;
      as a gold standard to assess free-living total energy expenditure and can be used to monitor&#xD;
      the body composition (BC) and total energy expenditure (TEE) of an individual under&#xD;
      circumstances of energy balance based on dilution equations of the labelled isotopic elements&#xD;
      in the body . Direct segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (DSM-BIA) is&#xD;
      considered a practical, non-invasive, and relatively inexpensive method to quickly assess the&#xD;
      BC27 and the estimations of BC with DSM-BIA are reported to be consistent with those of the&#xD;
      DLW method also for obese patients. The joint measurement of TEE using the estimations of the&#xD;
      PFR and the DLW method would serve the validation of PFR for the measurement of TEE in&#xD;
      patients undergoing RYGB. PFR would become then a powerful tool for research and provide&#xD;
      useful information for the design of appropriate individualized obesity treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate changes in food preferences, total energy intake of&#xD;
      the three primary macronutrients and meal patterns between obese women (BMI ≥ 35) before and&#xD;
      after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and lean (BMI ≤ 25) and obese (BMI ≥ 35) controls by means of&#xD;
      PFR with the mobile application SNAQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-centre observational case-control prospective cohort study on female&#xD;
      human subjects with morbid obesity, living in Switzerland and undergoing RYGB (n=20), obese&#xD;
      controls (n=20), and lean controls (n=20) before, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and&#xD;
      beginning of the study respectively. The optimal number of participants included can be based&#xD;
      on power calculations with an equivalence design and on the hypothesis that patients will&#xD;
      have similar caloric intake to the lean control group one year after RYGB. The equivalent&#xD;
      caloric intake between the two groups is defined by an equivalence range of 210 kcal/day with&#xD;
      a SD of ±200 kcal. For achieving a power of 90% and a p=0.05 in order to exclude a difference&#xD;
      of means &gt; 210 kcal/day, n=20 participants are required per group . Patients are enrolled in&#xD;
      this study if (1) they are females aged ≥ 18 years, (2) have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35&#xD;
      kg/m2 without any previous bariatric surgery, (3) have a planned RYGB, (4) can move&#xD;
      autonomously, (5) have a basic technological knowledge, (6) are fluent in German, and (7) are&#xD;
      able to give their informed consent. Obese controls respect the same criteria, but have no&#xD;
      plan to undergo surgery, which makes this group very hard to recruit. Lean controls have BMI&#xD;
      ≤ 25 kg/m. The main purpose of the lean control group is to evaluate test stability over time&#xD;
      and across multiple retesting. Patients who conform to the recruitment criteria are enrolled&#xD;
      at the outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Zurich. Obese and healthy controls are&#xD;
      recruited by the study team. The study protocol is explained and written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of&#xD;
      the Canton of Zurich (BASEC-Nr. 2019-00952). TEE under free-living conditions is assessed&#xD;
      using the DLW method. On the day before measurement, BIA is performed. On the first day of&#xD;
      measurement, subjects perform urine collection at baseline and consume oral administration of&#xD;
      DLW. After DLW administration, subjects collect urine respectively 3 and 4 h after&#xD;
      administration and again after 7 days at the same time point of the second and third urine&#xD;
      sampling . Subjects are instructed not to change their lifestyle or medication during the&#xD;
      study period. Under free-living conditions for one week, overall dietary intake is registered&#xD;
      by the participants using a mobile app for the photo-recognition of food items. Participants&#xD;
      record their dietary intake over 7 days before, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of each patient will be organized as follows: time of the meal, total calories,&#xD;
      total carbohydrates, proteins and fat, food group. This result has to be summed up for the&#xD;
      final TEE calculation, in order to have the total amount of each variable per meal, per day&#xD;
      and per week. The PFR data will be compared with DWL-based TEE for validation of the dietary&#xD;
      assessment. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe demographic data, as well as to&#xD;
      present meal-related information over different time periods. Change over time and from&#xD;
      baseline will be assessed with ANOVA and t-tests, with correction for false discovery rates.&#xD;
      Each meal-related parameter will be correlated with each other and with the 1-year weight&#xD;
      loss, expressed as absolute total-body weight loss % excess BMI loss (% EBMIL). Explorative&#xD;
      models will be generated using logistic regression to map meal-related information and&#xD;
      optimal weight loss. All data will be analysed using RStudio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has several limitations associated with the methods and the participants.&#xD;
      First, the food data is self-recorded and prone to social desirability which may lead to&#xD;
      inaccurate data. Indeed, the food preferences could be changed during the week of recording&#xD;
      and some food items could may not be recorded. The database of food items and calories&#xD;
      embedded in the app also may not be as accurate as expected. To reduce this limitation, the&#xD;
      participants are asked to report any missing food items or incongruences reported by the app,&#xD;
      and feedbacks are discussed with the app developer. Dietary self-monitoring is a key&#xD;
      component in weight loss programs, and frequency of self-monitoring with a smartphone app is&#xD;
      strongly correlated with weight loss. However, lean and obese controls of this study are not&#xD;
      following any diet with the aim of weight loss and participants will record their food intake&#xD;
      for a period that should not be long enough to induce changes in habits. Recent studies that&#xD;
      attempted to validate the energy intake estimations by using PFR compared to the DLW method&#xD;
      with obese participants found that this method was not accurate in estimating energy intake&#xD;
      compared to DLW. However, in one case the TEE was measured in pregnant women who showed low&#xD;
      compliance for reporting frequent intake of small meals. In the other one, the TEE was&#xD;
      measured in minority preschool children whose intake was recorded by caregivers. Furthermore,&#xD;
      both studies were cross-sectional studies. It is also reported that participants who use&#xD;
      their own phones compared with participants who use borrowed phones capture more images and&#xD;
      have higher accuracy , therefore such variable should also be considered in the data&#xD;
      analysis. Technical problems with the phones may also be a source of underestimation.&#xD;
      Training of the participants, constant communication and technical support must be provided&#xD;
      in order to increase accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of the expected outcome for research or practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would provide for the first time a direct and precise measurement of dietary&#xD;
      intake in obese patients before and after RYGB. The direct PFR measurement with the mobile&#xD;
      application SNAQ, validated by means of the DLW method, will allow to compare the energy&#xD;
      intake of the three primary macronutrients per day (kcal/24h) and per meal (kcal/meal)&#xD;
      between RYGB patients and controls. Furthermore, it could produce more fundamental&#xD;
      information about human behaviour which will allow to translate for humans behavioural&#xD;
      changes previously reported in rats. It is expected that patients will postoperatively and&#xD;
      progressively adjust their relative caloric intake and food selection with a decrease of fat&#xD;
      and sugars and an increase in complex carbohydrates, while non-operated controls will exhibit&#xD;
      a stable, unaltered food selection and intake. The proposed research project is characterised&#xD;
      by conceptual and methodological innovation. Food preferences and relative macronutrient&#xD;
      intake within and between meals in patients after RYGB will be directly measured in a real&#xD;
      life setting with PFR. This approach will overcome or reduce many of the limitations reported&#xD;
      so far in the literature. If the expected outcome is confirmed, such a finding has the&#xD;
      potential to fundamentally change clinical practice as regards to current post-bariatric&#xD;
      nutritional counselling. Moreover, the results may also contribute to the development of less&#xD;
      invasive interventions in the treatment of obesity and would justify a neurogenetic approach&#xD;
      with animal models of obesity for mapping and studying neural circuits and linking specific&#xD;
      brain activities to specific behaviours involved in obesity, as specified by the BRAIN&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;
