  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is a common pathology which is treated by a multimodal approach. Those tumours&#xD;
      in the rectum that are locally advanced are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before&#xD;
      an operation. This aims to reduce the size of the tumour and increase the change of a&#xD;
      complete resection. The degree of shrinkage of a rectal cancer to pre-operative treatment is&#xD;
      influenced by the immune system. In some other cancers there is evidence that the bacteria&#xD;
      living in our mouth &amp; in the large bowel influence the way the body responds a cancer. In&#xD;
      this study patients with rectal cancer requiring radiotherapy before surgery will be asked to&#xD;
      give samples of saliva &amp; bowel motions before chemoradiotherapy &amp; again before surgery. These&#xD;
      samples will have the type and number of bacteria analysed, as well as levels of key&#xD;
      metabolic products of these bacteria. The results will be compared with the response, as&#xD;
      assessed by the pathologist using standard criteria, of the rectal to the radiotherapy.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic radiotherapy (VMAT) and chemotherapy are used in margin threatened rectal cancer to&#xD;
      reduce the cancer and achieve a clear circumferential resection margin (CRM), facilitating&#xD;
      potentially curative surgery. In 15 to 20% of cases, the pre-operative chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      potentially completely treats the cancer raising the possibility to avoid surgery altogether.&#xD;
      Increasing the number of patients who are able to be cured without surgery is a research&#xD;
      priority for the NCRI Colorectal Studies Group in UK. Other patients have some reduction in&#xD;
      the size of the malignancy (a partial response) and others have a minimal response to the&#xD;
      pre-operative therapy. As yet, it remains unclear as to the mechanism of response of the&#xD;
      cancer to neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding what biological factors influence response is important in order to improve the&#xD;
      outcomes in rectal cancer. There is evidence that the innate immune system has a role in the&#xD;
      degree of response. An increased degree of response (as measured by tumour regression&#xD;
      grading) is associated with an increased abundance of natural killer (NK) CD56+ve cells. In&#xD;
      mouse models the gut microbiome can modulate the tumour-immune microenvironment and T cell&#xD;
      responses in colonic cancer. In addition some bacteria that are associated with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, such as F. nucleatum, are indigenous to the human oral cavity, and evidence that&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer have a distinctive oral microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies are needed to investigate the role of the oral &amp; faecal microbiome in&#xD;
      response to pre-operative treatment. If there is evidence of an association, the challenge&#xD;
      will then be to explore if this can be modulated to increase response. Alternatively, the pre&#xD;
      treatment microbiota profile may be able to be used as a predictor of response to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability to patients in providing&#xD;
      faecal and saliva samples before cancer treatment. The investigators will also assess if&#xD;
      there are any potential links between host microbial flora and chemoradiotherapy response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a biopsy proven rectal adenocarcinoma have staging investigations, and these&#xD;
      are discussed at a Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Multi- Disciplinary Team (MDT). If the CRM is&#xD;
      threatened or involved then it would be standard practice to recommend pre-operative&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st step for eligible patients is allocation to a consultant colorectal surgeon, who will&#xD;
      meet the patient to confirm the standard plan for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd step is arranging an out-patient appointment to see a clinical oncologist. At this&#xD;
      appointment the rationale, practical aspects and potential side effects of pre-operative&#xD;
      therapy are discussed. In addition, the 3rd step, which is a discussion around the study&#xD;
      plan, to collect and analyse both oral &amp; faecal microbiota pre-pelvic treatment &amp; again&#xD;
      pre-surgery will be undertaken. A written patient information sheet is given to the patient&#xD;
      to consider at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic radiotherapy is given as an out-patient. The first step is contouring the relevant&#xD;
      anatomy, including tumour &amp; associated lymph nodes, as well as normal organs that we want to&#xD;
      limit the dose of radiation received. This contouring &amp; preparation of a radiotherapy plan&#xD;
      can take up to two weeks, so there is plenty of time for the 4th step, namely the patient&#xD;
      considering whether they wish to take part in the study. If the patient decides to enter the&#xD;
      study, they will sign &amp; date a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5 - For patients who decide to enter the study, the 5th step is arranging for collection&#xD;
      of both oral &amp; faecal samples for analysis before starting the pelvic radiotherapy (as an&#xD;
      out-patient). The oral sample will be collected in the radiotherapy department prior to the&#xD;
      first treatment, and the patient can choose to collect the faecal sample either at home or in&#xD;
      the clinic, both on the day they are due to start the radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient continues on the radiotherapy and on completion there is a deliberately a 7 to 8&#xD;
      week wait, to allow the treatment to have an effect on the tumour, as well as allowing for&#xD;
      any side effects to settle. After the treatment gap, the patient has another pelvic MRI scan,&#xD;
      reviewed at a CRC MDT, to assess if the CRM is now clear, allowing the patient to proceed to&#xD;
      potentially curative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 6 - For patients with a clear CRM a second set of oral &amp; faecal samples for analysis&#xD;
      will be collected the day prior to surgery. Again the patient has the option of collecting&#xD;
      the faecal donation at home, and bringing it with them, or in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 7 - The surgical specimen is collected from theatre &amp; brought directly to the pathology&#xD;
      department by a member of the biodepository staff, as per standard practice. The pathologist,&#xD;
      together with a member of the biodepository staff will collect samples from the lumen of the&#xD;
      specimen, from the tumour &amp; distant normal mucosa for microbiota &amp; metabolite analysis. The&#xD;
      tumour itself is assessed using a standardised approach, and any response graded using a&#xD;
      validated &amp; published system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 8 - Comparison of the results pre- post- pelvic radiotherapy microbiota &amp; metabolites,&#xD;
      and an initial comparison with the pathology response grading. As there is a 15-20%&#xD;
      possibility of a complete clinical response (cCR), these patients may wish to enter the&#xD;
      'active surveillance' programme. The faecal and oral microbiota of the cCR will also be&#xD;
      analysed during this study. The samples of those individuals who do not have a clear CRM and&#xD;
      do not progress to surgery will be analysed as a separate subgroup of the cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no requirement for additional clinic visits for any patients taking part in the&#xD;
      study. There will be additional time during the initial clinic visits, to discuss the study &amp;&#xD;
      answer any questions. Obtaining written consent will be timed with one of the visits for&#xD;
      radiotherapy planning &amp; preparation, and, as there is a 60 minute wait for oral contrast to&#xD;
      reach the small bowel during the first radiotherapy CT simulator visit, there will not be any&#xD;
      additional time waiting for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of all study samples will be coordinated with routine visits to hospital, to&#xD;
      ensure no additional visits would be required for a patient taking part in the study. A total&#xD;
      of 25 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
