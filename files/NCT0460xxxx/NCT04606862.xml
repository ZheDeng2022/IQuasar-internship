    <intervention_model_description>This is a pivotal medical device clinical trial comparing the clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients monitored with the MMS Software Device for the prediction and early detection of sepsis versus patients monitored with current standard sepsis scoring systems at participating clinical trial sites. This will be conducted through a non-randomized multi-center, non-blinded, clinical trial.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Morley Medical Sepsis (MMS) Software Device is a predictive analytics, stand-alone, cloud-based software system with no hardware components. The software acquires patient data from the electronic medical record, processes the data using unique artificial intelligence (AI) powered algorithms, and generates clinical decision support outputs that aid in the proactive delivery of customized and efficient care for patients. The software output is made available to the end users (trained medical professionals) via an intuitive user interface displayed on desktop computers or mobile communication devices such as laptops, smartphones or tablets.</description>
