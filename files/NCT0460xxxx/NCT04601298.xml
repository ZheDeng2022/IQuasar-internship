      Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with&#xD;
      Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and to assisted the&#xD;
      precision treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:A total of 290 patients who underwent thyroidectomies or thyroid lobectomies from&#xD;
      August 2015 to September 2020, following a diagnosis of Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) from&#xD;
      preoperative thyroid FNA were investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups: In order to investigate the clinopathologic characteristics, the patients, were&#xD;
      grouped according to Cytology,Gender, Tumor size.&#xD;
