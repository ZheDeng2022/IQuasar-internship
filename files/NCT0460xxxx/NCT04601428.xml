  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-arterial (IA) therapy is generally used to treat HCC tumors that are too extensive to&#xD;
      excise or treat with potentially curative local therapy. IA therapy takes advantage of the&#xD;
      fact that the blood supply of HCC comes predominantly from the hepatic artery compared with&#xD;
      the surrounding normal liver which is predominantly supplied by portal venous blood. The&#xD;
      intent is to deprive the HCC of its blood supply, leading to the death of the tumor.&#xD;
      Traditionally, various methods have been used to block the HCC blood supply, but improvements&#xD;
      are needed. This study will investigate a new agent designed in the laboratory to block only&#xD;
      tumor blood vessels, not blood vessels in the normal liver.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic testing was done to identify differences between HCC tumors and normal liver, and a&#xD;
      protein, PLVAP, was shown to be present on the blood vessels of HCC but not on the blood&#xD;
      vessels of normal liver. An antibody, CSR02, was made that recognizes PLVAP and then the Fab&#xD;
      portion of that antibody was combined with tissue factor, a normal human protein that&#xD;
      initiates the clotting cascade. The result is a manufactured (recombinant) protein called&#xD;
      CSR02-Fab-TF. Preclinical studies in a mouse model showed that infusion of an equivalent&#xD;
      mouse protein resulted in the necrosis (death) of a transplanted human HCC. The current study&#xD;
      is designed first, to identify a safe and optimal dose of CSR02-Fab-TF in patients , and then&#xD;
      second, to determine the response rate of HCC tumors to the IA administration of&#xD;
      CSR02-Fab-TF.&#xD;

Once an appropriate dose in established, an expansion phase will administer CSR02-Fab-TF to 16 additional subjects to estimate the response proportion in subjects with refractory HCC.</intervention_model_description>
