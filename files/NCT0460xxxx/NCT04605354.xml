      General Aims Aim 1: Epidemiological and clinical description of women that receive HIV care&#xD;
      in selected countries of Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Management of HIV infection during pregnancy in women from selected countries of Latin&#xD;
      America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras,&#xD;
      MeÃÅxico, Peru, Dominican, Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Relevance of this specific study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Latin American Workshop for HIV Studies (LAW-HIV) includes more than 70 clinical centers&#xD;
      belonging to 14 Spanish speaking countries from the region. It gathers aggregate information&#xD;
      form more than 116.000 people living with HIV under care, from which 25,802 are women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These numbers represent roughly a fifth of the total estimated female under care in these&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims from overall aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine at center, national and regional level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The age distribution of women under care for HIV infection as of December 31st, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women under care who are receiving ART as of December 31st, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The age distribution of women admitted to care for years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and&#xD;
           2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of admitted women that start ART during the first year after admission, by&#xD;
           year of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of selected type of drugs (for backbone and 3rd drug) used for the first cART,&#xD;
           by year of admission and age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency late and very late presenters (CD4) in women admitted according to year of&#xD;
           admission and age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women alive, retained to care, retained to ART, and with virologic&#xD;
           suppression at one year of follow up, from admissions occurred in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims from overall aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women with HIV diagnosis occurred as consequence of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Earliest CD4 level and viral load in pregnant women under care by HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women that suspend ART during pregnancy; frequency of each scheme of ART&#xD;
           used previous the conception; and change of scheme (3rd drug and backbone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women whose pregnancy ended in term, preterm or as abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women retained in control post pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fraction of women that suspended breastfeeding Data Collection &amp; Quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study that uses ecological data from (1) People living with HIV under care&#xD;
      at 31st December 2017, and (2) from yearly admissions to care occurred during 2013 - 2017,&#xD;
      from centers belonging to LAW-HIV. Data will be weighted by the expected population under&#xD;
      care in each country considering attributes of the centers (private/public). Weighted&#xD;
      outcomes at strata level from each center will be meta-analyzed considering three levels of&#xD;
      heterogeneity (stratum, center, and country) and modeled through multilevel regression models&#xD;
      to allow adjustment for covariables of the stratum. In the case of admissions to care, a time&#xD;
      series analysis will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and quality control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be carried out through a spreadsheet sent to centers that agree to&#xD;
      participate. Two different spreadsheets will be sent, one for each general aim of the study&#xD;
      (see the annex at the complete project). A quality check will be implemented at three stages:&#xD;
      (1) at the moment of receiving each spreadsheet back; (2) previous to analysis, where the&#xD;
      consistency of information across strata from different sections will be assessed; and (3)&#xD;
      identifying outlier values from outcomes at the centers level, using expert criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data information included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Center description (health care staff, ART &amp; labs (e.g. viral load determinations)&#xD;
           availability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic and clinical features of women under control and admitted (age, CD4, the&#xD;
           scheme of ART, retention to care, retention to ART, virologic suppression one year later&#xD;
           the admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical features of pregnant women under care infected by HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration: 18 months.&#xD;

        For the overall aim 1, the investigators expected to include information about 25,816 women&#xD;
        under care, and between 6,000 and 7,500 women admitted during 2013 - 2017 (depending on the&#xD;
        sub-analysis), from 14 countries and 79 centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the overall aim 2, the investigators expect to include aggregated information from&#xD;
        roughly 400 pregnant females, from at least ten countries. It is worth noticing that the&#xD;
        analytic unit corresponds to the information at the stratum level and depending on the&#xD;
        disposition of the information in the database, the total numbers of strata will vary&#xD;
        between approximately 400 to 8.000.&#xD;
