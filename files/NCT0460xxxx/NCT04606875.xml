  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Campbell Score is a blood based means of assessing molecules believed to be associated&#xD;
      with suicidal ideation and in some cases successful suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current clinical trial will assess the Campbell Score in 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 10 patients with no personal or family psychiatric history and no suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 10 patients with suicidal ideation (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item&#xD;
      &gt;2) and reported low acquired capability for suicide (Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale&#xD;
      &lt;20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: 10 patients with suicidal ideation (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item&#xD;
      &gt;2) and reported high acquired capability for suicide (Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale&#xD;
      &gt;60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to confirm efficacy of Campbell Score in identifying patients with&#xD;
      high suicidal ideation potential.&#xD;
