  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will explore effectiveness and safety using the combination therapy of&#xD;
      camrelizumab，apatinib and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma(RCC). Hypofractionation is a technique that delivers higher daily doses of&#xD;
      radiation over a shorter period of time.immunotherapy. hyperfractionated radiotherapy,&#xD;
      represented by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), can significantly improve the&#xD;
      radiotherapy sensitivity of RCC. This trial will also observe whether SBRT can bring about&#xD;
      immune effects and explore the group and individual indicators that affect the treatment&#xD;
      effect of RCC.&#xD;

      This trial is a prospective, single-center, observational clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      combination therapy of camrelizumab，apatinib and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with renal cell carcinoma(RCC). All enrolled patients will receive the following treatments:&#xD;
      camrelizumab 200mg every 2 weeks for 1 years combined with apatinib 250mg everyday until&#xD;
      disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision&#xD;
      to stop treatment. One week following completion of the second immunotherapy,&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy with marginal dose of 50Gy/2Gy/25f and tumor center dose of&#xD;
      local hyperfraction increase 24-32Gy/8-12Gy/3-4f will be performed 3-5 times. The routine&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be started at the same time as the third immunotherapy and 25 times routine&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be completed before the fifth or sixth immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment participants will be assessed for curative effects and the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be assessed at a clinic visit every 3&#xD;
      months to collect survival information and follow-up treatment information. The planned&#xD;
      sample size is 30 study participants.&#xD;
