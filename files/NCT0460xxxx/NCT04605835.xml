  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to develop proposals and recommendations for improving the&#xD;
      safety of urological examination of children with obstructive uropathy by using Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound. Based on the results of a comprehensive urological examination of 665 children&#xD;
      with congenital ureteral obstruction, a program for scoring the results of ultrasound&#xD;
      examination has been developed, which allows using the safest and most informative methods to&#xD;
      reliably determine the functional state of the renal parenchyma and the degree of urodynamic&#xD;
      disorders in children with obstructive uropathy.&#xD;

      Relevance. The prevalence of congenital diseases of the genitourinary system is 0.5-7.5 per&#xD;
      1000 newborns; The high prevalence reflects the medical and social significance of the&#xD;
      problem and determines the need to search for highly informative and safe diagnostic methods&#xD;
      for the child's body, providing timely treatment, restoration of the somatic and social&#xD;
      status of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose. Development of proposals and recommendations to improve the safety of urological&#xD;
      examination of children with obstructive uropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods. The study is based on the analysis of the results of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of 655 children with congenital obstruction of the upper urinary tract. The complex&#xD;
      of urological examination included clinical, laboratory, morphological, radiological,&#xD;
      ultrasound research methods.&#xD;
