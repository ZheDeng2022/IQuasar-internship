      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCM is a genetic heart disease. It can cause fatigue, chest pain, or even death. For more&#xD;
      than 50 years, a surgery called septal myectomy has been used to help people with this&#xD;
      disease. Dr. Andrew G. Morrow originated the surgery and performed it more than 200 times at&#xD;
      NIH starting in 1960. Researchers want to learn the long-term success of this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine long-term survival at least 35 years after surgical myectomy at NIH and examine&#xD;
      data for people who are confirmed to be deceased or alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who had surgical myectomy by Dr. Morrow from 1960 to 1983.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses images and data that were obtained in the past. Many of the participants are&#xD;
      deceased. Most of the others are no longer being followed at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records of people treated by Dr. Morrow were microfiched. These records can be&#xD;
      accessed at the NIH. The records will be searched for keywords to find participants for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants clinical data, such as lab testing and imaging, will be used. Other data&#xD;
      collected as part of the original study will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use participants name, date of birth, and Social Security number to learn if&#xD;
      they are alive or deceased. If they are deceased, researchers will try to find the age of&#xD;
      death. Online databases and search engines will also be used. Survival data will be compared&#xD;
      to data from the general U.S. population for the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in a database that is password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last about 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common autosomal dominant genetic heart&#xD;
      disease which may produce lifestyle limiting symptoms or even death. Medication can sometimes&#xD;
      be of benefit, but surgical intervention with septal myectomy has been an alternative&#xD;
      intervention. The experience with this surgery at NIH provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term success of this operation.Dr. Andrew G. Morrow was the originator of&#xD;
      this operation and performed over 200 septal myectomies at NIH starting in 1960. Reviewing&#xD;
      the results of his experience will provide important information regarding the benefits of&#xD;
      this intervention in these patients.&#xD;
