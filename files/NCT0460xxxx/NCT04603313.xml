    <textblock>
      The increase in bacterial resistance and the overuse of antibiotics have led health&#xD;
      authorities to propose incentives for the proper use of antibiotics. Among these measures,&#xD;
      the introduction of referring physicians for antibiotic therapy and tele-advisory devices for&#xD;
      infectious diseases have shown positive effects on antibiotic prescriptions in hospitals.&#xD;
      Today, an increase is observed in the consumption of antibiotics linked to ambulatory&#xD;
      prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the project is to deploy tele-advice devices for general practitioners and&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects on ambulatory antibiotic dispensing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIRBUS-ATB is a prospective, multi-center, population-based, interrupted time-series&#xD;
      observational study with a control group with 12 points before and 24 points after the&#xD;
      deployment of the intervention in voluntary territories.&#xD;

      1. Current knowledge on the problem&#xD;
&#xD;
           The increase in bacterial resistance and the overuse of antibiotics have led health&#xD;
           authorities to propose incentives for the proper use of antibiotics. Among these&#xD;
           measures are public awareness campaigns, the establishment of antibiotic reference&#xD;
           materials and the development of indicators of appropriate use in health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In response to these issues, the infectiology teams have developed cross-cutting&#xD;
           activities to improve antibiotic prescribing in their healthcare institutions: drafting&#xD;
           and implementing clinical practice recommendations; initial and continuing training of&#xD;
           prescribers in the proper use of antibiotics; evaluation of practices for the management&#xD;
           of infectious diseases; organization of collaborations with the CLIN, microbiology&#xD;
           laboratories and pharmacy; monitoring and analysis of antibiotic dispensing, monitoring&#xD;
           and analysis of bacterial resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some teams have set up prescription support systems to meet the growing demand from&#xD;
           non-infectious disease clinicians and to satisfy the criteria of the Composite Indicator&#xD;
           of Antibiotic Use (ICATB 2), which relates to &quot;access to antibiotic therapy advice&quot;. In&#xD;
           2000, the cross-disciplinary infectiology team at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital set&#xD;
           up a &quot;Mobile Infectiology Consultation (MIC)&quot; based on a cell phone medical service&#xD;
           available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This team carried out an analysis of all the&#xD;
           informal consultations treated by this &quot;hotline&quot; during 2008. 7863 advice was given&#xD;
           during the study period; 37.3% of them within the University Hospital Center to adapt or&#xD;
           start antibiotic therapy. This activity has developed significantly and is now well&#xD;
           established in France in the hospital environment. The Grenoble team conducted a new&#xD;
           evaluation in 2016 and recorded nearly 16,000 calls per year (publication in progress).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies of intra-hospital infectious disease teleadvisory services have shown that&#xD;
           compliance with infectious disease advice reduces the consumption of anti-infectives and&#xD;
           improves the prognosis of hospitalized patients. Thus Sellier et al reported the results&#xD;
           of a prospective study carried out on 621 patients benefiting from infectious disease&#xD;
           counseling. Adherence to the advice given was good 88.2% (548/621). When counseling was&#xD;
           followed clinical improvement at D3 was more frequent (60.7% versus 43.9%, p=0.01) and&#xD;
           the median duration of hospitalization was 3 days shorter (20 days versus 23, p=0.03).&#xD;
           Adherence to telephone advice was comparable to that of formal advice given during a&#xD;
           consultation, out of a series of 627 consecutive advice sessions reported by the same&#xD;
           team. These results are supported by other studies that highlight the positive impact of&#xD;
           informal consultation with infectious disease specialists on the management of&#xD;
           inpatients, particularly in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Between 2000 and 2004, the consumption of antibiotics decreased in France by 18.4%. Then&#xD;
           it went up and down between 2005 and 2008. Since 2010 there has been a recovery trend&#xD;
           that is confirmed every year (+5.9%). The growth in consumption appears to be much&#xD;
           higher for outpatient prescriptions than for hospital prescriptions (90% versus 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A more recent decree (2015), specifying the role of referring physicians as well as axis&#xD;
           3 of the report &quot;Saving antibiotics&quot; recommended developing infectious disease advice&#xD;
           for primary care physicians (general practitioners).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experiences concerning tele-advice to general practitioners are, however, rarer than&#xD;
           intra-hospital experiences and have been little studied. In Grenoble, the hotline was&#xD;
           opened from the outset to general practitioners and practitioners outside the university&#xD;
           hospital. More than half of the advice provided (56%) by this team concerned them.&#xD;
           Requests were more often handled by telephone when they came from general practitioners&#xD;
           (89% versus 46% for intra-hospital requests). The reasons for calling the hotline from&#xD;
           GPs were significantly different from those of hospital phisicians. Indeed, in this&#xD;
           study, intra-hospital requests concerned the management of osteoarticular (14%), skin&#xD;
           and soft tissue (9%), or pulmonary (11%) infections; whereas GPs were more often&#xD;
           concerned about long-term fevers or unexplained inflammatory syndromes (11%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Marquet et al. recently described the activity of Medqual, a network of 20 infectious&#xD;
           diseases specialists in the Pays de Loire region. During the 5 days studied, this&#xD;
           network had received 386 telephone calls, most of which (81%) came from physicians in&#xD;
           the same hospital. Of these, 7.7% were from other hospitals and 11.3% from private&#xD;
           practice. 6% of the calls resulted in formal consultations and 5.5% in hospitalizations.&#xD;
           68.7% of responses could be given by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bal et al questioned 284 general practitioners using an infectiology hotline. 97.9% of&#xD;
           them were satisfied with the hotline. They said they used this service to improve&#xD;
           patient care (96.5%) and appreciated the speed of access (86.3%). Their questions mainly&#xD;
           concerned antibiotic treatments (66.2%) but also diagnostic aids (46.5%) and requests&#xD;
           for consultations or hospitalizations (29.6%). The latter requests are particularly&#xD;
           important to optimize the patient's journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Teleconsulting in infectious diseases therefore seems to meet a need by allowing rapid&#xD;
           recourse to a physician specialized in infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of our project is to extend the teleconsulting activities for general&#xD;
           practitioners to new territories by teams of volunteer infectious disease specialists.&#xD;
           The investigators wish to evaluate the effects of this activity on the evolution of&#xD;
           antibiotic dispensing and on the prescribing practices of general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outpatient dispensing of antibiotics will be analyzed from the dispensing of drugs&#xD;
           registered by the Assurance Maladie, through the study of the general sample of&#xD;
           beneficiaries (EGB) at the 100th of the protected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advice for general medicine will be recorded on an ad hoc database, the AIRBUS database.&#xD;
           This system, which is independent of hospital information systems, should enable&#xD;
           referring infectious diseases specialists to record in real time their out-of-hospital&#xD;
           tele-advice activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The originality of the project lies first of all in the target of the intervention. Up&#xD;
           to now, the devices to assist in the prescription of antibiotics have been intended for&#xD;
           hospital services within the framework of referring physicians in antibiotic therapy and&#xD;
           mobile infectiology consultations. The deployment of tele-advisory devices in infectious&#xD;
           diseases to primary care medicine is an innovation whose usefulness has yet to be&#xD;
           demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The other element of originality lies in the choice of an objective judgment criterion:&#xD;
           the consumption of antibiotics on an outpatient basis. The investigators are aware that&#xD;
           the number of treatments for which specialized advice will be provided will be minimal&#xD;
           compared to the mass of antibiotic prescriptions in ambulatory medicine. However, the&#xD;
           investigators believe that the advice given by infectious diseases specialists will have&#xD;
           an educational effect likely to induce changes in practices and changes in dispensing by&#xD;
           halo effect. This is why the investigators suggest to collect the judgement criteria&#xD;
           over a long period (3 years) and to collect it in the same way in territories not&#xD;
           covered by a tele-advice system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This work will also make it possible to better understand the needs of general&#xD;
           practitioners in terms of assistance in the management of infectious pathologies and to&#xD;
           adapt the offer of continuing education in this specialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the implementation of teleconsulting devices by hospital specialists&#xD;
           constitutes a new model of relationship between professionals that could contribute to&#xD;
           improving collaboration between primary care medicine and hospital specialist medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
           It can be hypothesized that an infectious advice hotline for general practitioners could&#xD;
           have the same type of effects on the consumption of anti-infectives and the clinical&#xD;
           evolution of patients as intra-hospital advice. This is suggested, for example, by a&#xD;
           recent study by Meeker's team which describes the importance of behavioural&#xD;
           interventions on the quality of antibiotic prescriptions in general medicine. In&#xD;
           addition to the positive impact on patient care through real-time response and thus&#xD;
           immediate action on therapeutic decisions, this advice would allow additional 'hands-on'&#xD;
           training of the doctors involved in city infectiology and the correct use of&#xD;
           antibiotics, through advice given in concrete situations (halo effect). Its impact would&#xD;
           also be measurable on care trajectories (e.g. saving on medical consultations, avoiding&#xD;
           emergency visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
           If our hypotheses are confirmed, the infectious diseases tele-advice system could be&#xD;
           deployed in other French healthcare territories. In the long term, it is hoped that this&#xD;
           system will have a beneficial impact on the consumption of antibiotics and on the&#xD;
           development of bacterial resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research objectives and endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the effects of the deployment of an infectious disease tele-advice system&#xD;
           for general practitioners on the overall and class dispensing of antibiotics in&#xD;
           ambulatory medicine compared to the absence of specific intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To qualify the needs of general practitioners in infectiology for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To study the responses provided by the infectious disease referents (type of&#xD;
                response, time spent).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To study the compliance of general practitioners with this advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To study the impact of advice on the patient's care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To study the opinion of requesting GPs on the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study description&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective, multi-center, population-based, interrupted time-series&#xD;
           observational study with a control group with 12 points before and 24 points after the&#xD;
           deployment of the intervention in voluntary territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention consists of setting up in each voluntary center an infectious disease&#xD;
           tele-advice system available to general practitioners via a dedicated cell phone line.&#xD;
           GPs will receive information when the telecounseling system is set up in their practice&#xD;
           health territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary study population will consist of health insurance-registered systemic&#xD;
           antibiotic dispenses for patients present in the EGB for 36 months: 12 months prior to&#xD;
           deployment of the telecounseling devices and 24 months post-deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The experimental group will be made up of all metropolitan departments covered by&#xD;
                an infectious disease tele-advice system open to general practitioners; 13&#xD;
                metropolitan departments will be concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The control group will be made up of all the metropolitan departments not covered&#xD;
                by an infectious disease tele-advice system open to general practitioners; 82&#xD;
                departments will be involved. Few centers have set up a response system accessible&#xD;
                to general practitioners. For those centers that are available, the number of&#xD;
                notices is very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of planned observations to be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A study of ambulatory dispensing of systemic antibiotics recorded in the SNIIRAM&#xD;
           database in 2015 in the Rhône-Alpes region found a consumption of 64,165,140 Defined&#xD;
           Daily Doses (DDD) for 6,510,561 inhabitants, i.e. 27 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           By extrapolating these data to the Simplified General Sample of Beneficiaries (1/97th of&#xD;
           the SNIIRAM database) for metropolitan France, it can be estimated that the analysis&#xD;
           will cover 70 to 80 million DJD per year, i.e. 210 to 240 million DJD over 3 years. The&#xD;
           unit of analysis will be the consumption per month and per territory, i.e. 96x36 = 3456&#xD;
           units month-department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary population of the study will be constituted by the opinions requested by a&#xD;
           general practitioner from an infectiological tele-advice system. The opinions requested&#xD;
           during 12 months, from September 2018 to August 2019 will be recorded in the AIRBUS&#xD;
           database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of planned observations to be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on a study carried out in 2016 in 5 departments of the Rhône Alpes region, it can&#xD;
           be estimated that each center should give about 30 pieces of advice per month to the&#xD;
           general practitioners of their department. Therapeutic advice represents 40% of the&#xD;
           advice given to GPs. The investigators can estimate the total number of counsels&#xD;
           expected for the study at 4100 in one year, of which about 1500 will be followed up on&#xD;
           D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Infectiological warnings&#xD;
&#xD;
           All requests for infectiological opinions made by general practitioners will be recorded&#xD;
           in the AIRBUS database, a computer application developed on the Voozanoo platform&#xD;
           (Epiconcept) by the SPILF. The platform is accessible via the Internet and is authorized&#xD;
           to host medical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participating antibiotic referent will have an identifier and a personal code&#xD;
           allowing him/her to record his/her opinions and to access his/her own database. For each&#xD;
           request, the referring physician will record, with the agreement of the requesting&#xD;
           physician :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the name of the requesting general practitioner and his or her telephone number,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the reason for the appeal (advice for a patient, general question) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the characteristics of the patient (age, sex, diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the date and time of the call ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the identity of the sponsoring physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the modalities of the response (consultation, telephone, e-mail, other);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the notion of hospitalization following the notification (yes, no, in infectiology,&#xD;
                emergency, in another department);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the notion of carrying a multi-resistant bacterium (BMR);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the time spent for counseling (in minutes, including application filling);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the response given by the infectiologist (starting an anti-infectious treatment, no&#xD;
                modification of the current treatment, optimization of the treatment by oral relay&#xD;
                or de-escalation or shortening the duration or changing the dose, stopping the&#xD;
                antibiotic treatment, no treatment necessary, diagnostic assistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recording of opinions may be carried out by the participating physician or by a&#xD;
           clinical research assistant. The application will also be available on a tablet or&#xD;
           smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up of notifications at D7&#xD;
&#xD;
           For opinions involving therapeutic advice (initiation or modification of antibiotic&#xD;
           therapy) an ARC will contact the requesting GP 7 days (± 2 days) after the opinion.&#xD;
           During a telephone interview, he will collect the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the prescriptions made by the physician, in order to assess compliance with the&#xD;
                advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the evolution of the patient if the doctor has this information. This evolution&#xD;
                will be coded according to previously defined criteria (cure, decrease in fever,&#xD;
                decrease in the intensity of symptoms, decrease in a possible inflammatory&#xD;
                syndrome) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  basic information on the doctor's mode of activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the GP's opinion on the device (usefulness, satisfaction, influence on practices,&#xD;
                proposal(s) for improving the system) Responses will be collected on a 4-way Likert&#xD;
                scale. These follow-up data will be recorded in a computer application developed&#xD;
                for this purpose on the Voozanoo platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotic dispensing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotic dispenses will be tracked using monthly extractions from the SNIIRAM's&#xD;
           simplified EGB database (EGBs) provided by the National Institute of Health Data (INDS).&#xD;
           The extraction will concern 1/97th of all systemic antibiotic dispensations (oral or&#xD;
           injectable) registered by the health insurance (EGBs database) for 3 years. For each&#xD;
           dispensation the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the antibiotic, the quantity&#xD;
           dispensed, the date and place of dispensing and the identity of the prescriber will be&#xD;
           collected. These dispensations will be classified by month, department and therapeutic&#xD;
           class. The dispensations will be expressed in defined daily doses (DDD) in relation to&#xD;
           the number of inhabitants per department present in the EGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up of the dispensations will begin in the year preceding the intervention and&#xD;
           will continue during the study year and one year after, for a total of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed before the database is frozen,&#xD;
           reviewed by the coordinating investigator and an independent statistician. This plan&#xD;
           will outline the principles guiding the analysis, including :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The analysis sample and any subgroups ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the frequentist approach to the analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The statistical significance level and the level of confidence intervals ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The possible adjustment of the p-value to take into account the multiplicity of&#xD;
                tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The descriptive statistics used for the qualitative and quantitative variables; and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The possible transformations of the variables ;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variables created or recoded;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The association measures used;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The univariate and multivariate analysis strategy. The SAP will include an explicit&#xD;
                detailed description of the univariate and multivariate analyses presented in the&#xD;
                final statistical report (FSR). Unplanned analyses in the SAP, either exploratory&#xD;
                or confirmatory, are possible. They will appear as such in the FSR and manuscripts&#xD;
                submitted for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of the main judgment criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotic consumptions extracted from the SNIIRAM database will be analyzed with the&#xD;
           SAS software. They will be expressed in Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants&#xD;
           per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotic dispensations extracted from the EGBs database will be analyzed with SAS&#xD;
           software. They will be expressed in Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per&#xD;
           day. The data will be analyzed using interrupted time series [25]. The secular trend of&#xD;
           dispensing will be modeled before the intervention and then the modifications of this&#xD;
           trend will be compared between territories covered and not covered by the intervention&#xD;
           by a test of the first-order interaction between time and type of territory. Seasonality&#xD;
           will also be modelled using a 12-order moving average and the autocorrelation of&#xD;
           residuals using the ARIMA model. The investigators will use the Box jenkins approach and&#xD;
           in particular the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to develop the&#xD;
           ARIMA model. The analysis will cover all antibiotic dispensing and dispensing of the&#xD;
           major classes of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of notices&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical unit is the advice given by the infectiologist. The test sample will&#xD;
           consist of all the opinions included. A flow chart in accordance with the CONSORT/STROBE&#xD;
           transparency recommendations will present the number of test specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The characteristics of the opinions will be summarized by the usual descriptive&#xD;
           statistics: number and percentage for qualitative variables and mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation (or median and 25th-75th percentiles, in case of asymmetric distribution) for&#xD;
           continuous quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In univariate analysis, the characteristics of the opinions associated with compliance&#xD;
           will be analyzed using the Chi-square test, replaced by Fisher's exact probability in&#xD;
           case of expected numbers below 5, for the qualitative variables, and the Student test,&#xD;
           replaced by the non-parametric Wilcoxon test, in case of deviation from normality, for&#xD;
           the continuous quantitative variables. The investigators will identify characteristics&#xD;
           independently associated with compliance using a multivariate logistic regression model.&#xD;
           To prevent over-fitting of the model to the data, the covariates introduced in the&#xD;
           multivariate model will be selected a priori based on the literature and the team's&#xD;
           previous publications in the field. Because of the non-independence of opinions from the&#xD;
           same infectiologist, the investigators will use a two-level randomized model&#xD;
           (opinion/infectiologist). In a further analysis, the investigators will develop a&#xD;
           three-level model (opinion/infectiologist/institution). The adherence analysis will&#xD;
           include the complete observations for the dependent variable and the independent&#xD;
           covariates (casewise analysis). To ensure the robustness of the results, the&#xD;
           investigators will repeat this analysis using a multiple imputation method for missing&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The analysis of the other criteria will be exploratory. As such, no adjustments to the&#xD;
           degree of statistical significance will be made. Statistical comparisons will be&#xD;
           performed using the Student t test or the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for continuous&#xD;
           quantitative variables and using the Chi-square test or the Fischer's exact probability&#xD;
           for qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Point estimates will be framed by a 95% confidence interval. The statistical&#xD;
           significance level will be set at 5%, in bilateral situations. The analyses will be&#xD;
           performed with Stata SE software (version 15.0 or later, StataCorp, College Station, TX,&#xD;
           USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study does not involve direct action on patients; no nominative information will be&#xD;
           collected. The study involves prospective collection of data from healthcare&#xD;
           professionals: infectious disease physicians and general practitioners who are&#xD;
           applicants. It therefore complies with type 3 of the Jardé law: &quot;non-interventional&#xD;
           research that does not involve any risk or constraint, in which all acts are performed&#xD;
           and products are used in a usual manner&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An information sheet will be distributed to each physician who is a member of a&#xD;
           participating infectiology team and the physician's consent will be obtained in writing&#xD;
           at the opening of the center. Information will be given by telephone to each requesting&#xD;
           physician and his/her consent will be collected orally for the recording of the&#xD;
           notification data and for the follow-up of the notification at D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol and the information documents of the doctors will be submitted for opinion&#xD;
           to a committee for the protection of persons drawn by lot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of study processes and documents will be conducted by personnel designated by the&#xD;
      Direction de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation (DRCI) at Grenoble university hospital.&#xD;
