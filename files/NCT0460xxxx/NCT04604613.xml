  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether molecular testing can help to predict the risk of endometrial&#xD;
      cancer coming back (recurrence) after treatment in patients diagnosed with low risk&#xD;
      endometrial cancer and scheduled to have surgery to remove the uterus and/or cervix&#xD;
      (hysterectomy). Having sentinel lymph node mapping performed may help researchers to see if&#xD;
      the cancer has spread in patients with low risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Validate the use of a molecular panel of estrogen-induced genes to predict recurrence in&#xD;
      low risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Calculate the positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV)/sensitivity&#xD;
      (Sens)/specificity (Spec) of lymph node mapping to predict pelvic lymph node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate CA125 and HE4 levels with recurrence and to explore the use of other serum&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe patterns of recurrence in a low risk patient population. IV. Determine if&#xD;
      molecular panel can predict lymph node involvement in low risk endometrial cancer patients&#xD;
      who undergo pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare performance of molecular panel to the Mayo low risk criteria for prediction of&#xD;
      lymph node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Compare performance of molecular panel to the high intermediate risk criteria from&#xD;
      Gynecologic Oncology Group, trial 99 (GOG 99) for prediction of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine the feasibility of lymph node mapping in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine the morbidity and mortality of lymph node dissection and mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping. Patients may also undergo&#xD;
      bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at the direction of the treating physician. If peritoneal&#xD;
      disease or other contraindications to lymphatic mapping are detected at the time of surgery,&#xD;
      mapping and sentinel node biopsy are performed at the surgeon's discretion. At the time of&#xD;
      hysterectomy, patients undergo collection of tissue for molecular testing. Before and after&#xD;
      surgery, patients also undergo collection of blood samples for tumor marker analysis.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patterns of recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine which demographic and clinical traits are most associated with recurrence rate using proportional hazards models and with 2-year recurrence using logistic regression models. Will conduct univariate analyses using log-rank tests and Fisher's exact tests, in the case of categorical traits, and proportional hazards and logistic regression models, in the case of continuous traits. Will examine all traits for violations of the proportional hazards assumption (recurrence rate models), and will examine all continuous traits for functional form (recurrence and recurrence rate models). Will use the same methods to determine whether CA125 and HE4 is associated with recurrence and recurrence rate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predictive ability of molecular panel in lymph node involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will use Cartesian and Regression Tree Analysis and logistic regression to determine if the molecular panel can predict lymph node involvement. Will assess the use of the model by calculating sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Additionally, will examine how often the results of the molecular panel model concur with the Mayo low risk criteria for prediction of lymph node involvement. All agreement statistics will be presented with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>
