      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to compare the effect of BFR with LLRT versus neuromuscular&#xD;
      training on quadriceps muscle strength, knee joint function and proprioception accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with knee OA may have reduction of tolerance of the high-load programs which is&#xD;
      recommended for eliciting strength gains (Messier et al., 2013). Thus, for reducing disease&#xD;
      risk and enhancing physical function, there is a need for effectively strengthening the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle while limiting pain and adverse joint loading in people with knee OA (Segal&#xD;
      et al., 2015). Blood flow restriction (BFR) with low-load resistance training (LLRT) is an&#xD;
      alternative to traditional strength training that can be used in knee OA with minimal adverse&#xD;
      joint loading that is normally found in traditional strengthening programs(Pope et al.,&#xD;
      2013). It is attained through applying pressure externally with a pneumatic cuff or&#xD;
      tourniquet. The applied pressure occludes venous outflow while maintaining arterial inflow&#xD;
      with intent to promote blood pooling in the capillary beds of the limb muscles distal to the&#xD;
      tourniquet (Slysz et al., 2016). Kubota et al., (2008), showed that BFR can be applied during&#xD;
      periods of immobilization to decrease disuse muscle atrophy of limbs. Also it can be combined&#xD;
      with exercise which enhances muscular development. Resistance exercise appears to provide&#xD;
      great muscular gains when combined with BFR (Slysz et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will not be a significant difference between traditional training, BFR with LLRT&#xD;
           and neuromuscular training on improving quadriceps muscle strength using HHD in patients&#xD;
           with unilateral knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will not be a significant difference between traditional training, BFR with LLRT&#xD;
           and neuromuscular training on improving knee joint function on WOMAC questionnaire in&#xD;
           patients with unilateral knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will not be a significant difference between traditional training, BFR with LLRT&#xD;
           and neuromuscular training on improving knee joint proprioception in patients with&#xD;
           unilateral knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does blood flow restriction with low load resistance training and neuromuscular training have&#xD;
      a significant effect over traditional rehabilitation protocol (stretching and strengthening&#xD;
      for hip and knee muscles) on quadriceps muscle strength, knee joint function and&#xD;
      proprioception accuracy in patients with unilateral knee OA?&#xD;
