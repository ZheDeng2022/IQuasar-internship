      This individual-level randomized trial involves pregnant women followed for at least 6 months&#xD;
      after delivery, to compare the effects of providing two &quot;attention-control&quot; counseling&#xD;
      interventions designed to increase pregnant women's awareness of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the maternal health benefits of breastfeeding, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the health benefits of smoke-free homes&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct an individual-level randomized trial involving pregnant women&#xD;
      to compare the effects on infant feeding practices of providing pregnant women information&#xD;
      about the maternal health benefits of breastfeeding to usual prenatal counseling focused on&#xD;
      the infant health benefits of breastfeeding. Participants will be randomly allocated to one&#xD;
      of two equal sized groups by research assistants using a web-based random number generator&#xD;
      that conceals allocation. Participants will be recruited online via UC Davis' StudyPages&#xD;
      website. Screening will occur online at the participant's convenience. When screening&#xD;
      criteria have been met, the research coordinator will be notified, and initiate contact with&#xD;
      the participant by text and/or phone call to schedule a time to deliver the intervention. Due&#xD;
      to social distancing measures that have been put into place as a result of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, informed consent will be collected digitally using the Qualtrics platform after&#xD;
      potential participants complete a secondary screening survey. Consenting participants will&#xD;
      use Qualtrics to complete a baseline/enrollment survey and be randomized and then scheduled&#xD;
      for a time to receive their allocated counseling intervention using the Zoom platform.&#xD;
      Follow-up surveys will be distributed to participants at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the &quot;intervention group&quot; will receive information about the&#xD;
      maternal health benefits of breastfeeding from a research assistant who also will provide&#xD;
      information on resources designed to support prenatal and postpartum health, including&#xD;
      breastfeeding support groups. Participants will be presented with a series of images to look&#xD;
      at while listening to the scripted counseling, including an image developed in 2002 by the Ad&#xD;
      Council designed to convey a link between bottle-feeding and insulin use, as well as images&#xD;
      developed specifically for use when counseling women about the maternal benefits of&#xD;
      breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;attention control&quot; group will receive &quot;usual care&quot; from their prenatal care provider&#xD;
      that focuses on the infant health benefits of breastfeeding. To control for the potential&#xD;
      effects of receiving additional attention from a counselor, pregnant women enrolled in the&#xD;
      control arm of this study will receive information from a peer counselor on the health&#xD;
      benefits of &quot;smoke- and weed-free homes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will thoroughly train all research staff on the critical importance of&#xD;
      delivering only the allocated counseling intervention to each study participant. The&#xD;
      investigators will monitor intervention delivery by audio-recording staff interactions with&#xD;
      study participants, and providing prompt feedback to research staff, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Delivery: These scripted counseling interventions were designed to be understood&#xD;
      by those with no more than a fifth-grade education and to take less than 5 minutes to&#xD;
      deliver. All research staff will be trained by the PI to ensure they understand the&#xD;
      importance of maintaining the integrity of study group allocation and delivering only the&#xD;
      assigned scripted counseling. After receiving their allocated counseling, participants will&#xD;
      be emailed the images and script and encouraged to share this information with the people&#xD;
      they anticipate receiving postpartum support from.&#xD;
