  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is to develop a weight loss and weight maintenance program through dietary&#xD;
      modifications for adults with obesity. Although scientific studies have shown the feasibility&#xD;
      of rapid and safe dietary weight loss and subsequent weight maintenance, no efficacious&#xD;
      dietary weight management program is widely available, and thus bariatric surgery remains the&#xD;
      most reliable approach for weight loss/management. Safe and effective dietary weight loss and&#xD;
      subsequent weight maintenance require flexible, individualized advice by an experienced&#xD;
      dietitian/nutritionist.&#xD;

    <description>During a 12-month period, participants will attend a total of 22 diet improvement sessions, each of which will last approximately 1 hour. Twelve sessions will be held in the first 5 months and will be focused on safe and efficient weight loss. The participants will learn to create a personalized weight loss diet from their kitchen based on their diet practice and food preference. The next 10 sessions will be held in the last 7 months and will be focused on weight maintenance and healthy eating. The participants will build skills to select foods and create meals that prevent them from overeating.</description>

    <description>Participants attend group and individual dietary education sessions. Participants create a diet plan that satisfies their needs. Participants aim to lose 1 pound weekly until a BMI of 25 is reached. Participants are evaluated through daily self-weighing, dietary records, and food frequency questionnaires.</description>
