  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to validate an interactive, immersive spatial memory test from the laboratory&#xD;
      test. This VR-based working memory test (VRWMT) is a first-person, self-pacing game embedded&#xD;
      within a virtual reality environment, the program is easily implemented with minimal&#xD;
      instructions and no supervision that can be community-users friendly. It is specifically&#xD;
      designed to assess rapid spatial working memory - a common deficit in all NCD subtypes. Its&#xD;
      ability to detect pathological models of dementia, age-related deterioration, and hippocampal&#xD;
      dysfunction are well established in literature&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research aims to study the ability of VRWMT to discriminate between older adults&#xD;
      with known mild NCD, healthy age-matched older adults and participants with non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases and to predict their deterioration in cognitive function over a period of 12 months.&#xD;
      Moreover, this study is to characterize and evaluate any concurrent validity between&#xD;
      emergence of deterioration in the VRWMT and clinical tools of functional performance in older&#xD;
      adults. Additionally, the potential of inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation biomarkers to&#xD;
      increase our ability to detect early NCD risk over and above the predictive validity of the&#xD;
      VRWMT. The study findings will bring both social and clinical significance to ageing and NCD&#xD;
      research. The combination of behavioural and biomarkers of pathological significance offers&#xD;
      an innovative approach that potentially addresses the limitations intrinsic to either measure&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

    <description>The MoCA-HK is an examiner-rated cognitive screening test that evaluates visuospatial functions, naming, attention and working memory, language, abstraction, and orientation, commonly affected in NCD including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and vascular dementia. It is a validated tool for detecting cognitive impairment in Chinese Hong Kong population at early stages. It is a common tool in practical practice that can be under 15 minutes. MoCA scores range from 0 to 30. Subjects with a score of above 21 will be classified as &quot;healthy controls&quot;, while 21 or below will be included in the mild NCD group in the present study.</description>
