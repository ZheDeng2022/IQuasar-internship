    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy and safety of entrectinib with crizotinib in participants&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The participants will&#xD;
      self-administer oral entrectinib or crizotinib as described in the protocol and local&#xD;
      prescribing information. Treatments will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
