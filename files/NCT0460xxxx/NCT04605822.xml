  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare 2D- and 3D-imaging and routine clinical care in early melanoma&#xD;
      detection in a prospective large-scale real-world data set.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the accuracy of combining human and artificial intelligence with its&#xD;
      independent application in early melanoma detection. The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered&#xD;
      3D Total Body Photography (TBP) Vectra® WB360 system's utility and clinical performance in&#xD;
      detecting melanoma in the real-world setting will be compared to the gold standard with&#xD;
      clinical assessments by experienced dermatologists, to currently widespread used 2D imaging&#xD;
      tools (FotoFinder ATBM® Master) and to the Smartphone-based algorithm application (e.g.&#xD;
      SkinVision®). Here included are specific questions regarding the patients' subjective&#xD;
      experience, acceptance and evaluation of modern technological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the overall psychological burden and worry of melanoma risk or disease,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression will be compared in different groups of patients and psychological&#xD;
      support need and real uptake of support and its predictors will be investigated in all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome, the sensitivity of human and artificial intelligence in detecting melanoma, will be measured at every study visit in case of a suspected melanoma by analysing histopathology reports of all excised suspectable lesions. The diagnosis of melanoma will be confirmed by histology. The biopsied pigmented skin lesions will be categorized as benign (melanocytic nevi / dysplastic nevi) or malignant (melanoma).</description>

    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire widely used to detect anxiety and depression in physically ill patients and is validated for the German language. The questionnaire has two subscales (anxiety and depression) with seven items each and a total score for each subscale (values from 0-21). Subscale scores between 0-7 indicate normal anxiety and depression levels, scores between 8-10 indicate borderline levels of anxiety and depression, and scores between 11-21 indicate clinical levels of anxiety or depression</description>
