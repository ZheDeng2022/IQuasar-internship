  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery is currently the main treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer&#xD;
      (AEOC), and the complete disease removal (RT=0) or the achievement of an optimal residual&#xD;
      disease (RT &lt; 1 cm) remain the factors with the greatest prognostic impact, both in primary&#xD;
      debulking surgery (PDS) and interval debulking surgery (IDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the no residual disease (RT=0), several surgical manoeuvres are often needed both&#xD;
      at the upper and lower abdomen, including intestinal resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recto-sigmoid resection is certainly the most frequent of intestinal resections, and it is&#xD;
      also the one with the highest risk of complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albeit rare, anastomosis leakage (AL) is a life-threating condition and therefore it is the&#xD;
      most feared of intestinal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this large single-center retrospective study was to assess the AL rate in patients&#xD;
      subjected to colorectal resection and anastomosis during primary surgery (PDS or IDS) for&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer, in a third referral centre for gynecologic oncology with ESGO&#xD;
      certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we evaluated several possible pre/intra and post-operative risk factors for AL&#xD;
      in order to identify, at an early stage, the population at greatest risk, and attempt to&#xD;
      reduce the morbidity and mortality of this severe post-operative complication&#xD;

      The investigators performed a retrospective analysis of the pre-operative, intra-operative&#xD;
      and post-operative (surgical outcomes and early complications rate) characteristics, of a&#xD;
      series of patients undergoing primary surgery (PDS or IDS) for AEOC at&quot;Fondazione Policlinico&#xD;
      Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Department of&#xD;
      Gynecologic Oncology&quot; between December 2011 and October 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled population included all patients with histological diagnosis of epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cancer (FIGO stage IIB-IVB), judged suitable for surgery by&#xD;
      clinicians, and who underwent recto-sigmoid resection and anastomosis with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no evidence of colorectal involvement, and who therefore did not undergo&#xD;
      recto-sigmoid resection, or patients with end-colostomy or end-ileostomy were excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative clinical variables, surgical features and post-operative outcomes were&#xD;
      retrospectively retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several system scores, helpful in predicting operative risk, were used to classify patients'&#xD;
      physiological status, as the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, the Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS) and the Age-Adjusted Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index (ACCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an ASA score &gt; 2, ECOG-PS &gt;/= 2 and an ACCI &gt; 2 were considered at high risk of&#xD;
      post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative albumin level below 30 mg/dl and pre-operative hemoglobin values below 10.0&#xD;
      g/dl were indicative respectively of a severely poor nutritional status and moderate-severe&#xD;
      anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other demographic and surgical variables were recorded: age (&lt; 60 vs &gt;/= 60 year-old), body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) (divided into the following categories: underweight patients: BMI &lt;18,&#xD;
      normal weight-overweight: BMI 18-30 and obese patients with BMI &gt;/= 30), International&#xD;
      Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (FIGO stage 2014: &lt;/= IIIA vs IIIC-IVB),&#xD;
      smoking habit, Ca-125 tumor marker level at initial diagnosis (&lt; 1000 U/mL vs &gt;/= 1000 U/mL),&#xD;
      surgical timing (PDS vs IDS), Predictive Index Value (PIV) at initial diagnosis (&lt;/= 6 vs &gt;&#xD;
      6), presence of ascites (&lt; 500 mL vs &gt;/= 500 mL), Surgical Complexity Score (SCS) (SCS 1-2 vs&#xD;
      SCS 3), estimated blood loss (EBL) (EBL &lt; 500 vs &gt;/= 500 mL) , intra-operative transfusions,&#xD;
      additional surgical procedures performed and colorectal resection and anastomosis specific&#xD;
      characteristics. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) was used to&#xD;
      classify intra-operative complications (CTCAE 0-1 vs CTCAE &gt;/= 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suspicion of anastomotic leakage (AL), suggested by general clinical signs as abdominal&#xD;
      pain or distension, leukocytosis, fever, as well as more specific signs such as emission of&#xD;
      gas, pus, or feces via the drains, the laparotomy incision, or the vagina, was ascertained by&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) with rectal contrast enema or simple contrast enema radiography with&#xD;
      a water-soluble contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate diagnostic procedure was re-laparotomy with direct verification of AL and/or&#xD;
      fecal peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of primary diagnosis to the date of death&#xD;
      or to last follow-up visit for the patients still alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the study was to assess the anastomosis leakage rate in patients&#xD;
      subjected to colorectal resection and anastomosis during primary surgery (PDS or IDS) for&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer, in a third referral centre for gynecologic oncology with ESGO&#xD;
      certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the influence of several possible pre/intra and&#xD;
      post-operative risk factors on AL in order to identify, at an early stage, the population at&#xD;
      greatest risk.&#xD;
