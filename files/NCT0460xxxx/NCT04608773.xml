      To identify the effectiveness of two mouth sprays at relieving symptoms of xerostomia in&#xD;
      patients who have received radiation for carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess patient quality of life and mouth acidity following use of two mouth sprays meant&#xD;
      to relieve symptoms of xerostomia in patients who have received radiation for carcinoma of&#xD;
      the head and neck.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have observed that patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Head&#xD;
      and Neck Survivorship clinic with symptoms of radiation-induced xerostomia expressed verbal&#xD;
      preference for Biotene and Refresh mouth sprays (spray form of mouthwash) compared to other&#xD;
      oral products such as gel, toothpaste, and chewing gum. Investigators have designed this&#xD;
      study to specifically assess the effectiveness of mouth sprays on xerostomia in patients who&#xD;
      have completed radiation for head and neck carcinoma. While there have been clinical trials&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Biotene oral products for xerostomia, Refresh&#xD;
      mouthwash/mouth spray is a newer oral rinse formula that has not undergone any randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to evaluate its efficacy compared to other agents of its kind. The&#xD;
      investigators have put forward this randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      both sprays to each other and to water. Biotene spray is cleared by the FDA as a medical&#xD;
      device product. Currently, Refresh mouth spray falls under the FD&amp;C Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is preliminary data on the effectiveness of Biotene mouthwash for xerostomia in&#xD;
      patients who have had radiation of the head and neck. A phase II study of Biotene products&#xD;
      (mouthwash, chewing gum, and toothpaste) were effective at improving many symptoms of&#xD;
      post-irradiation xerostomia. Numerous other studies have shown that mouthwash and topical dry&#xD;
      mouth products improve xerostomia symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia, or mouth dryness, is a frequent side effect of head and neck cancer radiation&#xD;
      therapy, as the salivary glands are often damaged during therapy. Radiation therapy can be&#xD;
      successful in treating cancer, but post-irradiation xerostomia can cause oral discomfort as&#xD;
      well as issues with eating, speech, and oral hygiene, leading to significantly decreased&#xD;
      quality of life. While treatment of xerostomia has limited benefit, various mouthwashes have&#xD;
      led to major symptomatic improvement in some patients. This study will add to existing&#xD;
      literature by commenting on efficacy of a popular and established mouth spray used for&#xD;
      xerostomia as well as a new mouth spray that has not been compared to existing formulas. A&#xD;
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial evaluating these mouth sprays will add information&#xD;
      about value of both formulas for head and neck carcinoma survivors with radiation-induced&#xD;
      xerostomia.&#xD;
