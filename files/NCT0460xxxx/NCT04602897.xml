  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized controlled trial of 400 women who attended the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      Menoufia University Hospital for copper IUD insertion. The women were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      cough and control groups.The primary outcome measure was the level of pain experienced at&#xD;
      different steps of IUD insertion measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted this randomized controlled trial at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt, from May 2018 to March 2020. Our hospital research&#xD;
      ethics committee approved this study. We obtained informed consent from all participants&#xD;
      before initiating any study procedures. CONSORT guidelines were observed and completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recruited non pregnant women (aged 18-45 years) requesting copper T380A IUD insertion for&#xD;
      contraception. Eligible women had no prior vaginal delivery or pregnancy termination beyond&#xD;
      12 weeks, gestation (as patulous cervical os may affect VAS score), any previous deliveries&#xD;
      had been by cesarean section, they were immediately postmenstrual or 1 week after pregnancy&#xD;
      termination and they were willing to complete the study questionnaires. All women had to be&#xD;
      alert, oriented, and cooperative to respond easily to VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were current pregnancy, prior vaginal delivery, history of cervical&#xD;
      stenosis, current pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine anomalies, undiagnosed abnormal&#xD;
      uterine bleeding, fibroids distorting the uterine cavity, and patients using chronic NSAIDs&#xD;
      or on chronic pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to cough and control groups. A statistician not&#xD;
      directly involved in the study prepared a computer generated randomization list and placed&#xD;
      the allocation information in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened&#xD;
      according to the attendance of the subjects after signing the informed consent.&#xD;
