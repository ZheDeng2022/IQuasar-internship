      The goal of this study is to identify reliable markers of LRRK2 activity in human CSF.&#xD;

      Specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate each assay performance for its ability to detect LRRK2, its activity and/or the&#xD;
      detection and activity of the pathways it impacts using a variety of different approaches&#xD;
      (quantitative western blot, immunoassays and LC-MS). Assay performance will be assessed and&#xD;
      those demonstrating high sensitivity and consistency will be considered for further&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the ability of the assay or a combination of assays to differentiate pathogenic&#xD;
      LRRK2 variant manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, idiopathic PD and healthy&#xD;
      non-carriers.&#xD;
