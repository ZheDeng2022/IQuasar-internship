  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leading cause of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a solitary adenoma (89%). The&#xD;
      treatment of pHPT is generally surgical removal of the overactive parathyroid gland(s). Since&#xD;
      a solitary adenoma is the predominant cause, parathyroid surgery is preferably performed&#xD;
      through a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) in which only the suspected adenoma&#xD;
      causing the pHPT is resected in a focused manner. To facilitate the performance of a MIP,&#xD;
      accurate preoperative imaging is pivotal. This study aimed to analyze the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of 11C-choline PET/CT after prior negative or discordant first-line imaging in&#xD;
      patients with pHPT undergoing parathyroid surgery with an optimized imaging protocol.&#xD;

        This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients with biochemically proven&#xD;
        pHPT who underwent parathyroid surgery after localization by means of 11C-choline PET/CT&#xD;
        and negative or discordant first-line imaging in a teaching and tertiary referral hospital&#xD;
        in the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion were â‰¥18 years old, diagnosed with biochemically confirmed&#xD;
        pHPT, underwent a MIBI-SPECT/CT and/or cUS with negative or discordant results, and&#xD;
        underwent a 11C-choline PET/CT followed by parathyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were excluded if they were known to have a germline mutation predisposing for&#xD;
        familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH).&#xD;
