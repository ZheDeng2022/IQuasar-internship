    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the best dose and side effects of copper&#xD;
      (64Cu)-DOTA-pembrolizumab positron emission tomography (PET) for the study of PD1 expression.&#xD;
      64Cu is a radiotracer that binds to a molecule, PD1, that is found on immune cells that are&#xD;
      found in the tumor. PD1 is short for 'programmed cell death protein 1'. When&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab is injected into the patient's bloodstream, the 64Cu-pembrolizumab&#xD;
      travels throughout the body and sticks to any tumor that has PD1 positive immune cells.&#xD;
      Identifying the expression of PD1 in the tumor may help assess whether patients will respond&#xD;
      to immunotherapy, and may detect clusters of immune cells when they are still too small to be&#xD;
      detected by other Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved techniques.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability of unlabeled pembrolizumab followed by 64Cu-tetraxetan&#xD;
      (DOTA)-pembrolizumab positron emission tomography, at each dose level, by evaluation of&#xD;
      toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Generate initial estimates of the biodistribution of the 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab and the&#xD;
      preferred dose of cold antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the dose of pre-administered unlabeled pembrolizumab that improves image&#xD;
      quality by qualitative assessment by the radiologist of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the performance of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab in detecting tumor lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, and within 6 hours also&#xD;
      receive 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab via slow IV push over &gt; 1 minute on day 0. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo PET over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 days.&#xD;
