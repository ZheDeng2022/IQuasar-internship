  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients&#xD;
      with tension-type headaches: thrust Manipulation, electric dry Needling and exercise Vs.&#xD;
      non-thrust mobilization, soft-tissue mobilization, exercise and TENS. Physical therapists&#xD;
      commonly use all of these techniques to treat tension-type headaches. This study is&#xD;
      attempting to find out if one treatment strategy is more effective than the other.&#xD;

      Patient will tension-type headaches will be randomized to receive 2 sessions per week for 6&#xD;
      weeks (up to 8-12 sessions total) of either: 1. thrust Manipulation, electric dry Needling&#xD;
      and exercise or 2. non-thrust mobilization, soft-tissue mobilization, exercise and TENS&#xD;
