  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk of contrast-induced kidney injury is expected to be strongly correlated with exposure&#xD;
      time. Studies on the excretion of iodinated contrast material are few and have mostly been&#xD;
      carried out in patients with normal renal function. Although case wise reports of persistent&#xD;
      renograms have been published, it is not known how long contrast is retained before excretion&#xD;
      in patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2, nor which of these patients are most susceptible to&#xD;
      contrast retention. The current observational study aims to compare contrast elimination time&#xD;
      and % contrast excretion in patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2, to matched patients (for&#xD;
      age, sex and contrast procedure type) with eGFR 30-59 and eGFR &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73m2.&#xD;

      The primary aim of the current study is to determine contrast elimination time and % in three&#xD;
      groups of patients, (with severely reduced, moderate, and mildly reduced to normal renal&#xD;
      function). Secondary aims are to explore whether specific situations/characteristics result&#xD;
      in higher probability of delayed elimination of contrast, and whether there is a link between&#xD;
      elimination time and adverse post-contrast outcomes (post-contrast incidences of acute kidney&#xD;
      injury; post-contrast changes in eGFR within 5 days from baseline; 1-month post-contrast&#xD;
      change in eGFR; 1-month post-contrast incidences of eGFR decline &gt;=5 mL/min/1.73m2; 1-month&#xD;
      dialysis and mortality).&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>time to the first contrast-free urine sample from the time of intravascular iodinated contrast administration. Time to contrast-free urine will be compared between three groups of patients (with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2, eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2, and eGFR &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73m2).</description>

    <measure>% contrast elimination.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>percentage of total contrast administered excreted in urine within 5 days. Percentage contrast elimination will be compared between three groups of patients (with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2, eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2, and eGFR &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73m2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>contrast elimination versus adverse post-contrast outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The underlying hypothesis is that delayed elimination increases contrast toxicity which increases adverse event risk. This will be explored by comparing percentages with post-contrast adverse events (acute kidney injury; changes in eGFR; eGFR decline ≥5mL/min/1.73m2; dialysis; mortality; up to 1-month) in groups with and without delayed elimination, stratified by eGFR (&lt;30, 30-59, ≥60). Relevant patient and procedural characteristics will also be compared to identify potential predictors of delayed elimination.&#xD;
Contrast elimination times are unknown, therefore 'delayed' is defined as time to contrast-free urine exceeding patient group median value. In clinical practice, normal contrast elimination is assumed to be ≥24h. Therefore, 1. Normal (≤24h); 2. Delayed (24-48h); 3. Severely delayed (&gt;48h) elimination subgroups will also be compared. Subgroup cut-off values may be added at a later stage (e.g., in the event of many or no patients with elimination &gt;48h).</description>
