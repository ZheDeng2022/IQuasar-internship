  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics, probiotics and passive immunoprophylaxis are classes of dietary supplements that&#xD;
      are lawfully marketed in the US for maintenance of gut health (GH). This randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, clinical trial will evaluate three commercially available dietary supplement&#xD;
      products: (Bimuno, federally registered with the United States [US] Patent and Trademark&#xD;
      Office [®]), probiotic (Florastor®), and passive immunoprophylaxis (Travelan®) product, each&#xD;
      compared with placebo, to assess their ability to maintain normal gut function during travel.&#xD;
      The results of this clinical trial will be used to evaluate the use of dietary supplements to&#xD;
      maintain GH during deployment and travel and is not intended to support a marketing&#xD;
      application of any dietary supplement as a drug or biological product for human use.&#xD;

      Prebiotics, probiotics and passive immunoprophylaxis are classes of dietary supplements that&#xD;
      are lawfully marketed in the US for maintenance of gut health (GH). This randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, clinical trial will evaluate three commercially available dietary supplement&#xD;
      products: (Bimuno, federally registered with the United States [US] Patent and Trademark&#xD;
      Office [®]), probiotic (Florastor®), and passive immunoprophylaxis (Travelan®) product, each&#xD;
      compared with placebo, to assess their ability to maintain normal gut function during travel.&#xD;
      The results of this clinical trial will be used to evaluate the use of dietary supplements to&#xD;
      maintain GH during deployment and travel and is not intended to support a marketing&#xD;
      application of any dietary supplement as a drug or biological product for human use. This&#xD;
      study is a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial conducted&#xD;
      on travelers and deployed US and United Kingdom (UK) military personnel. The study will test&#xD;
      three dietary supplement products: Bimuno®, Florastor®, and Travelan®, each compared with&#xD;
      placebo for maintenance of GH during and immediately after travel. Enrollment of 1320&#xD;
      deployed military personnel or travelers will occur at sites within the Uniformed Services&#xD;
      University of the Health Sciences (USU) Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP)&#xD;
      network, the UK military, and at a civilian travel clinic in New York City over a 2-year&#xD;
      period. Subjects will be randomized to receive a masked regimen of Bimuno®, Florastor®,&#xD;
      Travelan®, or placebo taken as 1 sachet twice daily with meals. Chemoprophylaxis will be&#xD;
      started 3 days prior to arrival and maintained for a duration of 10 days during travel or&#xD;
      deployment. Stool smears collected during travel will be used for evaluating the microbiome&#xD;
      and for gut pathogen identification. A follow-up electronic survey completed at 3- and&#xD;
      6-months post-travel/deployment will assess and record whether there are known or unknown&#xD;
      diseases associated with GH deficits such as incident functional gastrointestinal disorders&#xD;
      (FGD) and reactive arthritis (ReA). Paired (pre and post-supplement administration) sera and&#xD;
      stool samples (pre- and post-supplement administration) will be collected for testing of&#xD;
      exploratory objectives. Primary Endpoint (Efficacy): The primary efficacy endpoint is the&#xD;
      combined endpoint of incidence of GH deficiencies (defined as 3 or more unformed stools in a&#xD;
      24-hour period) OR 2 or more unformed stools an d one or more associated symptoms (nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, bloody stool) in a 24-hour period OR antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      for diarrhea per subject report, focusing on a 10 day window of prophylaxis during travel.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint data will be obtained from review of the Travel Diary. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include an evaluation of compliance with each dietary supplement and&#xD;
      tolerability (e.g. taste, bloating, flatulence, etc.); these will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Travel Diary. Differences in GH associated enteropathogen distribution among the four&#xD;
      treatment groups will be determined by testing stool smears collected by subjects during a GH&#xD;
      deficit using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Risk of incident FGD and ReA in&#xD;
      subjects in the dietary supplement arms vs. placebo will be assessed using electronic surveys&#xD;
      administered 3- and 6- months following return from travel/deployment. Exploratory objectives&#xD;
      related to changes in the gut microbiome with dietary supplement use and proteomic signatures&#xD;
      of the host-pathogen interaction will be addressed contingent on the availability of&#xD;
      additional funding.&#xD;
