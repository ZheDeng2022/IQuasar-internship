      The Asthma Digital Study is a virtual, two-arm, randomized, controlled trial that will&#xD;
      investigate the impact of digital tools on asthma symptom control, exacerbation frequency,&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, and medical expenditures. Adults with asthma will be randomized to&#xD;
      the passive or active arm in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be sent two devices, at no cost-an Apple Watch and a Beddit Sleep&#xD;
      Monitor. These are publicly available, commercial devices that have not been modified for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be administered largely through a customized version of CareEvolution's&#xD;
      MyDataHelps app (the &quot;Study App&quot;). Access to the Study App will be provided to all&#xD;
      participants. It will be used to administer informed consent and electronic patient reported&#xD;
      outcome (ePRO) measures, and for other study purposes. Only active arm participants will have&#xD;
      access to Study App features designed to support asthma self-management. These features&#xD;
      include &quot;smart nudges&quot; based on device data, symptom and trigger tracking, evidence-based&#xD;
      education, summaries of health metrics gathered from the Apple Watch and Beddit Sleep&#xD;
      Monitor, in-app medication refill resources, as well as other resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is 2 years. Participants can keep using the Study App and devices after&#xD;
      Year 1, though this is not required. Primary analyses will utilize Year 1 data only. During&#xD;
      Year 2, data collection will continue where available, though fewer data will be collected&#xD;
      because use of digital tools is not required during Year 2, and health coverage changes may&#xD;
      cause loss of access to claims data.&#xD;

    <description>Passive arm participants will be sent two devices, at no cost-an Apple Watch and a Beddit Sleep Monitor. These are commercially available and have not been modified for this study. Participants will be asked to use these devices regularly throughout study Year 1. Participants can optionally continue to use devices during Year 2, if they have met requirements during Year 1 to keep study devices. To be eligible to keep devices, participants must meet pre-specified levels of adherence to study procedures.&#xD;
Access to the Study App will be provided to all participants. It will be used to administer informed consent and electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) measures, and for other study purposes. However, passive participants will not have access to the Study App features designed to support asthma self-management.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Active arm participants will be sent the same devices, also at no cost, and asked to use them in the same manner.&#xD;
Only the active arm will have access to Study App features for asthma self-management, including:&#xD;
&quot;Smart nudges&quot; that may promote proactive asthma self-management&#xD;
Asthma symptom and trigger tracking&#xD;
Evidence-based asthma education&#xD;
The ability to photograph and easily reference an asthma action plan from a healthcare provider.&#xD;
A 90-day summary of self-reported asthma symptoms/triggers and device-recorded heart rate and respiratory rate. This summary can be shared with providers.&#xD;
In-app viewing of active asthma medications, refills available, and phone numbers to call for refills (subject to prescription benefits).&#xD;
Active participants can, but are not required to, use the Study App in Year 2. Those who choose to may keep using study devices in Year 2, provided they meet requirements to keep devices. These requirements are the same for both arms.</description>
