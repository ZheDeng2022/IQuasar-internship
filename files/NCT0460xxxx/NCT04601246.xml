  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate women's experiences with pain management and perceived attitudes&#xD;
      regarding opioid use for postpartum pain management and examine differences by race/&#xD;
      ethnicity. Women will participate in in-depth qualitative interviews regarding their&#xD;
      postpartum pain experience after a cesarean delivery. In this cohort, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate how experiences of postpartum pain management and perceptions of provider attitudes&#xD;
      vary across self-identified race/ethnicity. When applicable, mixed methods integration of&#xD;
      patient-reported and clinical data from NNM2 will also allow exploration of patient factors&#xD;
      contributing to such variation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid misuse has been declared a national emergency in the United States. Although the&#xD;
      opioid epidemic has touched all communities, there is a differential impact based on race and&#xD;
      ethnicity. In particular, data has shown that individuals of minority race/ ethnicity are&#xD;
      less likely to receive an opioid for pain management than non- Hispanic white individuals. As&#xD;
      birth is the most common reason for hospitalization, women of reproductive age are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to opioid exposure and to experiencing disparities in pain&#xD;
      management. Indeed, our data have demonstrated the high frequency of inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      opioid use and wide variation in management of postpartum pain. Notably, data has shown that,&#xD;
      despite reporting higher levels of pain postpartum, minority race/ ethnicity women receive&#xD;
      less opioid treatment as inpatients and are less frequently prescribed an opioid upon&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Despite this plethora of quantitative data, few reports have explored&#xD;
      women's perspectives on the postpartum pain experience and disparities therein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a qualitative study of women's experience with pain management in&#xD;
      the postpartum period. This proposal aims to fill an unmet need for a systematic, in-depth,&#xD;
      and unbiased evaluation of women's postpartum pain experiences, with a focus on racial/&#xD;
      ethnic disparities. The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews on the postpartum pain&#xD;
      experience among low-income women who have undergone cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interview will be approximately 60 minutes long and will take place during the&#xD;
      postpartum hospitalization during days 1 through 4. All efforts will be made to interview the&#xD;
      participant at a time when she is comfortable, free of distraction, and not experiencing any&#xD;
      medical complications. Interviews will be conducted privately in the participant's hospital&#xD;
      room. All guests will be asked to leave the room for the interview and clinical interruptions&#xD;
      will be minimized. Interviewers will be trained in the confidential and sensitive conduct of&#xD;
      interviews about these topics. Interviews will be conducted by experienced research personnel&#xD;
      trained to perform in-depth, unbiased, professional interviews and who are fluent in English&#xD;
      and Spanish. The second interview will be by phone for 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge&#xD;
      that will last approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview topics will address identify themes related to autonomy, respect, cultural views on&#xD;
      pain management, feeling heard/valued, communication with care team, understanding pain&#xD;
      management options, medication administration timing, and perceptions of provider judgment&#xD;
      related to opioids. This interview will also ask participants to self-identify their race and&#xD;
      ethnicity. Interviews will be audio-recorded. After completion of the interviews, the digital&#xD;
      audio files will be professionally transcribed prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project takes an innovative approach in targeting health disparities in racial/ ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, who are disproportionately affected by maternal mortality and severe maternal&#xD;
      morbidity. Optimizing postpartum health, reducing opioid overuse, and reducing disparities in&#xD;
      care and outcomes are critical goals of major professional societies and the NICHD 2020&#xD;
      strategic plan. Understand the postpartum pain experience will inform future implementation&#xD;
      studies by providing an essential missing piece: women's voices and perspectives.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this work aims to identify root causes of racial/ ethnic disparities in&#xD;
      postpartum opioid use and pain management and allow a foundation from which to enact systems&#xD;
      and policies which guard against such disparities.&#xD;
