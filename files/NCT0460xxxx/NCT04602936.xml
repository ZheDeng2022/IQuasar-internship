  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the novel dopamine&#xD;
      and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) solriamfetol in the treatment of binge eating&#xD;
      disorder (BED).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-site, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose&#xD;
      study in which solriamfetol 37.5-150 mg/day will be administered for 12 weeks to 64&#xD;
      outpatient adults with BED by DSM-5 criteria. The study will have 3 phases: a 1-2 week&#xD;
      Screening phase to evaluate participant eligibility; a 12-week blinded Treatment phase during&#xD;
      which participants will receive solriamfetol or matching placebo; and a 1-week Treatment&#xD;
      Discontinuation phase. During the Treatment phase, participants will be evaluated weekly for&#xD;
      the first 4 weeks and then biweekly for the next 8 weeks. Solriamfetol will be started at&#xD;
      37.5 mg/day. After 1 week, study drug will be increased to 75 mg/day. If a participant&#xD;
      continues to have BED symptoms, study drug may be increased to a maximum of 150 mg/d by&#xD;
      Treatment week 6; after that, study drug dose will be held constant. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring the weekly frequency of binge-eating episode days with patient&#xD;
      take-home diaries. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECGs), adverse events, and suicidality will assess safety&#xD;

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity and Improvement scale (CGI-S, CGI-I) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity and improvement of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. On the CGI-S question, scores range from 1-7, with higher scores being worse (1 = normal, 7 = very severely ill). On the CGI-I questions, scores range from 1-8, with higher scores being worse (1 = no change, 7 = very much worse, 8 = not applicable).</description>

    <description>All medication will be 37.5 mg encapsulated soriamfetol tablets or matching encapsulated placebo tablets supplied in numbered containers for dispensing to patients. The minimum dose of solriamfetol during the trial will be 37.5 mg/day; the maximum dose will be 150 mg/day. At the Baseline Visit (Visit 0), participants will be instructed to take one capsule of solriamfetol 37.5 mg or matching placebo in the morning for the first 7 days. Thereafter, at Visit 1, solriamfetol or placebo will be increased to 75 mg/day, if tolerated. Beginning on day 15 (Visit 2), solriamfetol or placebo will be increased to 150 mg/day, if tolerated. Study medication dosage may be decreased, or a scheduled increase may not be made, because of side effects. Study medication will be administered as a single daily dose in the morning.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Criteria for entering this study will include all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of BED. These criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. Both of the following characterize a&#xD;
                  binge-eating episode: 1. Eating, in a discrete period (e.g., within 2 hours), an&#xD;
                  amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar&#xD;
                  period under similar conditions; and 2. A sense of lack of control over the&#xD;
                  eating (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much&#xD;
                  one is eating).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The binge-eating episodes are associated with at least three of the following:&#xD;
                  eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until uncomfortably full; eating&#xD;
                  large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of&#xD;
                  being embarrassed by how much one is eating; feeling disgusted with oneself,&#xD;
                  depressed, or feeling very guilty after overeating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Marked distress regarding binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least one day a week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The episodes of binge eating do not occur exclusively during the course of&#xD;
                  bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In addition, to ensure that BED is of at least moderate severity, participants will&#xD;
             report at least three binge-eating days per week during the 1 week prior to initiation&#xD;
             of study medication, prospectively documented in take-home binge diaries. A&#xD;
             binge-eating day (or binge day) is a day during which at least one binge-eating&#xD;
             episode occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men or women, through the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Women who are pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential who are not using&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive measures. The following are considered adequate methods of&#xD;
             birth control: 1. intrauterine device (IUD); 2. barrier protection; 3. a contraceptive&#xD;
             implantation system (Norplant); 4. oral contraceptive pills; 5. a surgically sterile&#xD;

             Watchers) intervention for BED that was begun within the 3 months before study entry.&#xD;
             Individuals beginning such treatment more than 3 months prior to study entry may be&#xD;
             enrolled as long as they to agree to not make any changes to the frequency or nature&#xD;
             of their treatment during the course of the drug trial.&#xD;

             dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Individuals with a history of any psychiatric disorder that might interfere with a&#xD;
             diagnostic assessment, treatment, or study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
