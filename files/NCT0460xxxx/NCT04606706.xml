      access it effectiveness among mother, infant and children (0-2 years old) to prevent stunting&#xD;
      in Kelantan, Malaysia. Besides, to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention in reducing&#xD;
      stress among pregnant and lactating women. The mobile health (mHealth) messaging&#xD;
      interventions will be delivered via a mobile app known as WhatsApp and by a phone call. There&#xD;
      will be a total of 50 messages for 6 months of intervention in which 2 messages will be&#xD;
      delivered per week (every Tuesday &amp; Thursday). The understanding of information will be&#xD;
      evaluated 2 times per month by a phone call. The type of messages that will be used are text&#xD;

&#xD;
      H) mHealth Mode of Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will be conducted by using a mobile phone. Thus, a &quot;call centre&quot; for this mobile&#xD;
      health intervention program will be set up in Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Health Campus.&#xD;

      disseminate through a mobile apps known as WhatsApp and by a phone call. There will be a&#xD;
      total of 50 messages for 6 months of intervention which are 2 messages per week (every&#xD;
      Tuesday &amp; Thursday). The understanding of information will be evaluate 2 times per month by a&#xD;
      phone call. The type of messages that will be used are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Text messages&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Voice messages&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Video/graphic messages&#xD;

      the subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from the health&#xD;
      clinics and will be referred to the call center of this study by a trained nutritionist. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study and the randomization process will be explained to the subjects by a&#xD;
      nutritionist during subjects recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
