      The investigators aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters and its associated factors in Taiwanese&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. We plan to recruit 150 healthy volunteers aged more than 20 years old.&#xD;
      The ONSD and its associated factors will be measured and recorded by ultrasound from&#xD;
      September 2020 to August 2021.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) had been considered as a&#xD;
      non-invasive way to distinguish the presence of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Besides&#xD;
      detecting elevated ICP in various neurological diseases, ONSD can also be applied to cardiac&#xD;
      arrest survivors as one of the prognostic factors. It is a simple, quick, repeatable&#xD;
      technique without the need of contrast medians. In order to make precise interpretations, the&#xD;
      database of the normal distribution of ONSD and its associated factors in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      is necessary. The majority of previous reports are from Western countries, and limited&#xD;
      reports of ONSD in the Asian population have high variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, collecting local data of ONSD in Taiwan is important. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters and its associated factors in Taiwanese&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The investigators planed to recruit 150 healthy volunteers aged more than&#xD;
      20 years old. The ONSD and its associated factors will be measured and recorded by ultrasound&#xD;
      from September 2020 to August 2021.&#xD;
