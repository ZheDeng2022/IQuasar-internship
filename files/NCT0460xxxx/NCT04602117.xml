      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site phase I/Ib trial with SYD985, an antibody-drug&#xD;

      The study contains 2 cohorts. Cohort A is a 3+3 de-escalation cohort. Participants with&#xD;
      certain HER-positive advanced solid tumors or HER2-low breast cancer will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      cohort. Eligible participants will receive infusions of SYD985 every three weeks and of&#xD;
      paclitaxel weekly. Participants will be monitored for safety and for the occurance of DLTs.&#xD;
      Cohort B dose expansion will proceed at the identified dose from Cohort A (RP2D). Cohort B&#xD;
      will only enroll patients with HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer.&#xD;
