  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preserving pulpal vitality is a major challenge when excavating deep caries lesions without&#xD;
      severe symptomatology. Pulpal exposure alters success of the treatment (dropping from 93% for&#xD;
      indirect pulp treatment with selective excavation to 11% for direct pulpotomy) and thus&#xD;
      prognosis of dental organ and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. The preoperative x-ray is&#xD;
      a complementary examination which allows to estimate the depth of the carious lesion. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, it is currently difficult to accurately measure this depth on preoperative&#xD;
      radiographs. This lack of precision leads to a decrease in the effective capacity of the&#xD;
      operator to predict the risk of pulpal exposure. Their interpretation is considered imprecise&#xD;
      and is not used as a diagnostic element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to determine if the use of pre-operative retroalveolar radiographs&#xD;
      can help to predict pulpal exposure risk.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Outcome measure was assessed trough study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The radiographic assessment consisted in determining the depth of each carious lesion from the pre-operative radiographs and from their contrasted version. In this work, the depth of one carious lesion was measured by the ratio (expressed in percent): 100*residual dentin thickness (RDT)/ Total dentin thickness (TDT). A logistic regression that accounted for measurement error was applied to precisely estimate the capacity of the ratio to predict exposure (reported as odds-ratio).</description>

    <description>Three hundred and sixty pre-operative radiographs of deep carious lesions and a &quot;contrasted&quot; version of the same set have been screened and annotated by 4 evaluators. Annotations were placed at the dentino-enamel junction, at the floor of the carious lesions, and on pulp chamber wall. From these annotations, the ratios residual dentin thickness/ total dentin thickness were derived. First, inter-evaluator agreement and concordance were assessed. A logistic regression that accounted for measurement error was applied to precisely estimate the capacity of the ratio to predict exposure (reported as odds-ratio).</description>
