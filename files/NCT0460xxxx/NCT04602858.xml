  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls in older people are devastating, widespread, costly and increasing in the aging&#xD;
      Australian population. Although falls occur in approximately one third of older adults,&#xD;
      certain population groups such as the sarcopenic/frail present with further elevated risk of&#xD;
      falls. Many exercise interventions have been trialled but systematic review evidence&#xD;
      indicates such programs reduce fall rates by an average of only 20% and encounter issues such&#xD;
      as compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive balance training (also called perturbation-based balance training) utilises a&#xD;
      task-specific approach to balance training, applying repeated exposure to unpredictable&#xD;
      perturbations that mimic balance disturbances experienced in daily life. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      50% reductions in falls might be achievable in a time efficient manner with reactive balance&#xD;
      training but more evidence is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, ecologically valid, unpredictable trips and slips will be exposed to older&#xD;
      people in a safe environment to train their reactive balance. Three 40 min weekly training&#xD;
      sessions will be followed by 3-monthly retraining session over one year (40 min x 6 training&#xD;
      sessions = 4 hours of training in total). The neuromuscular, physiological, psychological,&#xD;
      behavioural effects of the reactive balance training will be comprehensively examined.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomised to the intervention group will initially undertake 3 x 40 min training sessions of reactive balance training over 3 weeks followed by 3-monthly retraining sessions at 3, 6 and 9 months, and final assessment at month 12.&#xD;
During the training, participants will be exposed to unpredictable slips and trips whilst they are walking on the Trip and Slip Walkway (Okubo et al. 2019). They will be required to consistently walk at their normal walking pace using our gait regulation protocol (i.e. individually adjusted stepping tiles and metronome). Each training session will involve up to 30 trips and slips which progress in unpredictability.&#xD;
Participants will also receive a &quot;Staying active and on your feet&quot; fall prevention booklet containing guidance regarding fall risk factors including exercise, diet, vision, footwear, medications and home safety.</description>
