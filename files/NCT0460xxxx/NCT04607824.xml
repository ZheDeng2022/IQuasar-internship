      HRV is attained using a Polar RS800CX. Then, evaluated through linear, non-linear and chaotic&#xD;
      global techniques (CGT). Forty-five male subjects were included in the DMD group and&#xD;
      age-matched with forty-five in the healthy Typical Development (TD) control group. They were&#xD;
      assessed for twenty minutes at rest sitting, and then five minutes whilst performing the maze&#xD;
      task on a computer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study, where HR was recorded beat-to-beat (RR intervals) using the&#xD;
      portable Polar RS800CX HR monitor (Polar Electro, Finland). HR was recorded before the onset&#xD;
      and at the end of the five minutes of the computer maze paradigm task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were seated in a standard chair (walkers, TD group and DMD) or in their own&#xD;
      wheelchair (non-walkers, DMD group), the Polar watch was positioned on the wrist. The&#xD;
      analysis of HRV was possible through the recording of RR interval in two periods: the period&#xD;
      of twenty minutes at seated rest, and then during the computer task for five minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer task used a maze paradigm with one correct pathway that could be negotiated and&#xD;
      ultimately solved. All participants were positioned comfortably and an evaluator responsible&#xD;
      for instruction and annotation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual was instructed to walk the correct path with the digital character pawn&#xD;
      (pointed on the screen by the evaluator) to the exit of the maze identified by an &quot;x&quot;&#xD;
      (pointed on the screen by the evaluator). It was provided for the subjects, who used the&#xD;
      arrow buttons on the keyboard, identified by up, down, right and left, using the dominant&#xD;
      hand, with the arrows moving through a 20 x 20 cm maze. Participants were requested to&#xD;
      complete the maze as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV analysis followed the guidelines published by the Task Force of the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. The RR intervals were&#xD;
      recorded, and then were downloaded to the Polar Precision Performance program (v.3.0). This&#xD;
      software enabled the visualization of HR and the extraction of a cardiac period (RR intervals&#xD;
      series; the variation of beat-to-beat interval in milliseconds) file in &quot;.txt&quot; format. For&#xD;
      analysis of HRV data at rest, we analyzed 1000 consecutive RR intervals, and for HRV analysis&#xD;
      for the computational task, the number of consecutive RR intervals obtained was exactly 256&#xD;
      RR intervals. Digital filtering complemented by manual filtering was performed to eliminate&#xD;
      artifacts and only series with greater than 95% of sinus beats were included in the study.&#xD;
      HRV analysis was undertaken through linear, non-linear and chaotic global techniques (CGT).&#xD;
