      The safety and effectiveness of nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay have been evaluated with&#xD;
      stage II and III advanced gastric cancer patients based on the 6th of the American Joint&#xD;
      Committee on Cancer (AJCC) through discovery clinical trial (418 patients) and confirmatory&#xD;
      clinical trial (684 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study, a retrospective, multi-center, single-blind, pivotal trial, is to&#xD;
      assess clinical equivalence with stage II and III advanced gastric cancer based on the 6th&#xD;
      and 8th of the AJCC and to evaluate prognostic equivalence between surgery only group and&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy group in Low risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow these procedures; Sample screening, Sample Preparation and Sample&#xD;
      Criteria Evaluation, Sample enrollment, nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay (gastric cancer&#xD;
      prognosis prediction), Prognostic Result Report, and Evaluation of Clinical Performance.&#xD;
