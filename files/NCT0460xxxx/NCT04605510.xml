      Aim of present study is investigating the acute effects of passive joint mobilization on pain&#xD;
      perception and range of motion. Study protocol includes passive joint mobilization&#xD;
      application to study group with neck pain and blood sample collection of study and healthy&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

      Our purpose of planning this study is to examine the acute effect of passive joint&#xD;
      mobilization application on pain perception and range of motion in women with non-specific&#xD;
      neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses we will test for this purpose;&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1- Passive joint mobilization application increases the range of motion of the cervical&#xD;
      joint in women with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2- Passive joint mobilization application increases the pressure pain threshold in women&#xD;
      with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3- Passive joint mobilization increases serum Orexin A and Neurotensin levels in women with&#xD;
      non-specific neck pain.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study includes two groups. Intervention group including women with non-specific neck pain will applied cervical passive joint mobilization and assessment protocol. Control group including healthy women without pain will applied only assessment protocol.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Cervical Range of Motion assessment will take maximum of 5 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical Range of Motion will be assessed by Baselşne Bubble Inclinometer as degree of flexion-extension, rotation and lateral flexion and will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain Pressure Threshold assessment will take maximum of 5 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold will be measured with the JTech Commander Algometer at the level of the right and left zygapophyseal joint of the dysfunctional cervical segment detected during physical examination. During the evaluation, the participants will be asked to lie in a prone position. By placing the probe of the algometer vertically on the skin, the pressure applied will be gradually increased and the participant will be asked to report at the first moment of pain. The measurement will be made once and the result will be recorded in kilograms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropeptide Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood Sample Collection for Neuropeptide Measurement will take maximum of 5 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropeptide Measurement will be performed as a result of evaluating the blood samples taken from the participants with the appropriate ELISA kits. Orexin A and Neurotensin levels are planned to be evaluated with Human Orexin A (Competitive EIA) ELISA Kit and Human NTS / NT / Neurotensin (Competitive EIA) ELISA Kit which are specific for these neuropeptides.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain Intensity Measurement will take maximum of 1 minute.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is a horizontal scale in the range of 0-100 mm, where 0 is the lowest pain and 100 the highest pain. The patient will be asked to mark the pain felt in the neck area on this line and the point marked will be measured with a ruler and recorded in mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Neck Disability measurement will take maximum of 1 minute.</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Disability will be measured by Neck Disability Index. The Neck Disability Index is a frequently used scale to evaluate the level of disability due to neck pain. It consists of 10 items and 6 options under each item. Options are scored between 0-5 points. An increasing score indicates a higher level of disability. The minimum score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, and the highest score is 50. 14 points are used as cut-off points for the minimal level of disability.</description>

    <description>24 female participants with non-specific neck pain included in the mobilization group will undergo detailed manual cervical examination. In the evaluation, the most painful segment with dysfunction will be selected and mobilization application and algometric measurements will be performed on this segment. Grade 3 Central Posterior-Anterior (CPA) passive joint mobilization with Maitland method will be applied in 3 sets, 30 seconds, to the segment with the detected dysfunction.</description>
