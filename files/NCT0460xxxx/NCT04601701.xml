  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with&#xD;
      Dexamethasone (Ozurdex) will be effective in reducing if not eliminating the macular edema&#xD;
      associated with the disease, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in comparison to&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (Avastin) alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinal Venous Occlusive disease is the second only to diabetic retinopathy as a major cause&#xD;
      of blindness associated with retinal vascular disease. Macular edema is a major cause of&#xD;
      vision loss in patients presenting with central and hemi vein occlusions. Until recently the&#xD;
      standard of care for macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion was&#xD;
      observation. Recent investigations of steroids for this condition has shown greater visual&#xD;
      benefit but is associated with risks such as cataract formation and increased intraocular&#xD;
      pressure. In the past laser photocoagulation has been used, but was found to offer no visual&#xD;
      benefits over the natural history in the treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability, with the&#xD;
      potential to reduce retinal vascular leakage and diminish macular edema. In addition, as an&#xD;
      anti-VEGF agent, it may also inhibit neovascularization of the iris, a frequent complication&#xD;
      of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Bevacizumab use as an intravitreal agent does&#xD;
      carry the risk of intraocular infection but probably carries very low risk of glaucoma or&#xD;
      cataract formation, making it a potentially safer pharmacologic treatment for CRVO associated&#xD;
      macular edema as compared to steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozurdex (dexamethasone) Intravitreal Implant is a steroid injected into the eye to treat&#xD;
      swelling that may occur when there is a blockage of certain blood vessels in your eyes.&#xD;
      Ozurdex is also used to treat non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior (rear) segment&#xD;
      of the eye.&#xD;
