  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to determine if a new investigational drug, OS2966,&#xD;
      when delivered directly to the brain of adult participants with recurrent/progressive&#xD;
      high-grade glioma (HGG) is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS2966 is a therapeutic antibody blocking a cell surface receptor governing fundamental&#xD;
      biological processes that allow cancer cells to grow, spread and become resistant to cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Despite availability of new promising cancer treatments, successful treatment of&#xD;
      HGG has been limited by the presence of the brain's protective blood brain barrier (BBB). The&#xD;
      BBB is made up of tightly knit cells that block entry of several substances including cancer&#xD;
      treatments. To overcome this obstacle, a technique called convection-enhanced-delivery (CED)&#xD;
      will be utilized to deliver OS2966 directly to the site of disease. Convection-enhanced&#xD;
      delivery involves placement of one or more catheters into the brain tumor and&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrated brain in order to slowly pump a therapy into the tissue. In this study, the&#xD;
      Infuseon Cleveland Multiport Catheter (ICMC) will be used. The ICMC is a type of catheter&#xD;
      developed specifically for direct delivery of therapies to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for this study participants must require surgical resection of their recurrent&#xD;
      HGG.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, ascending-dose, 2-part study designed to determine the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of OS2966, as well as the optimal infusion parameters when administering&#xD;
      OS2966 directly to the tumor and the surrounding tumor-infiltrated brain by CED in&#xD;
      participants with recurrent/progressive HGG undergoing a surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS2966 is an anti-CD29 (Beta1 Integrin) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has demonstrated&#xD;
      preclinical efficacy in resistant/recurrent glioblastoma animal models. This study will&#xD;
      recruit participants with recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma (HGG; WHO Grade III or IV&#xD;
      glioma). The development of effective treatments for HGG has been limited by an infiltrative&#xD;
      growth pattern, the blood brain barrier (BBB), and the rapid development of therapeutic&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convection-enhanced delivery is a specific technique that allows direct delivery of&#xD;
      therapeutics to the brain and to brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery bypasses the BBB&#xD;
      and allows for infusion of therapeutics that would otherwise be excluded from the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Importantly, CEDs targeted delivery obviates systemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS2966 will be delivered by CED using the Infuseon Cleveland Multiport Catheter (ICMC) in&#xD;
      both parts of the study. The ICMC is a type of catheter developed specifically for direct&#xD;
      delivery of therapies to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in this study will undergo 2 staged parts of treatment. In Study Part&#xD;
      1, participants will receive a single intratumoral infusion of OS2966 directly to the&#xD;
      contrast-enhancing bulk tumor by CED using one ICMC over 4 hours or until maximal tumor&#xD;
      coverage is obtained. In Study Part 2, participants will undergo surgical resection of the&#xD;
      previously infused tumor. Immediately following surgical resection, 2 ICMCs will be placed&#xD;
      directly into the surrounding tumor-infiltrated brain, and OS2966 will be infused over a 4&#xD;
      hour period and then the catheters removed. To confirm the quality of OS2966 delivery, a&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast agent will be added to OS2966 before each infusion in order to monitor&#xD;
      the infusion via magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be closely monitored clinically, and through the use of imaging&#xD;
      assessments to determine how effective OS2966 is at preventing further disease progression.&#xD;
      Tumor tissue will be collected in both study parts to evaluate how well OS2966 binds to its&#xD;
      intended target and to confirm mechanism of action. All enrolled patients will also receive&#xD;
      standard supportive care therapy.&#xD;
