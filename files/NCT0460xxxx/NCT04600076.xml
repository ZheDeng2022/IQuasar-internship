  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week pilot study to see how research participants feel about an internet support&#xD;
      site after a stillbirth or infant death. Losing a baby through stillbirth or early infant&#xD;
      death is typically devastating for families. However, investigators do not know if internet&#xD;
      on-line support for parents helps manage grief more easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to using the BabyCenter.com website, participants be asked to complete online&#xD;
      surveys at the beginning and the end of the study, as well partake in an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this pilot study will help develop a much larger randomized control study of&#xD;
      on-line support outcomes after perinatal loss.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Depression as measured by The Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention (day 0), Post intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) is a widely used and validated screen for depression. The PHQ-8 is scored by adding scores from each question (0-3) to a final score (up to 24). Higher scores indicate worse outcome and a score of 10 or higher indicates a positive screen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Post-traumatic stress Disorder (PTSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention (day 0), Post intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD will be measured using the 20-question Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Civilian Version). Scores range from 0-80. A score of 33 or above will be used as our cutoff.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety based on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder screen (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention (day 0), Post intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder screen (GAD-7) is a seven-item self-report instrument for screening, diagnosis and severity assessment of anxiety disorder. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21: 0-4 Minimal anxiety; 5-9 Mild anxiety; 10-14 Moderate anxiety; 15-21 Severe anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in grief based on the Perinatal Grief Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre intervention (day 0), Post intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perinatal Grief Scale measures grief, coping, and despair following the death of a child. It includes 33 questions on a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from 1=strongly agree to 5=strongly disagree. A higher score would indicate less grief and a lower score more grief.</description>
