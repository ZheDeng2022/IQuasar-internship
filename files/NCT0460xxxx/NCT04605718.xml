  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study consists of 2 Parts: Part 1 (Single Ascending Dose/SAD) and Part 2 (Multiple&#xD;
      Ascending Dose/MAD). Part 1 will investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of&#xD;
      single-ascending intravenous (IV) doses of RO7223280 in healthy participants. Part 2 will&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of multiple-ascending IV doses of RO7223280 in&#xD;
      healthy participants. Part 2 will only start after the completion of Part 1 (SAD).&#xD;
      Progression from Part 1 to Part 2 will be based on a satisfactory review of all available&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK data by the Investigator and the Sponsor from Part 1. The&#xD;
      starting dose for Part 2 is not confirmed; it will be established on the basis of all&#xD;
      available safety, tolerability, and PK data in Part 1 (SAD).&#xD;

    <description>Due to mandatory sentinel dosing, participants will be divided into two groups: 2 participants will be dosed on one day (sentinel group with 1 on active treatment and 1 on placebo) and remaining participants of the dose cohort (randomized as 5 on active treatment and 1 on placebo) at the earliest 24 hours after the first dosing occasion.</description>

    <description>In each dose cohort, a minimum of 4 participants and a maximum of 12 participants will receive either multiple IV doses of RO72232809 or placebo daily for 10 days (3:1 ratio of active:placebo treatment). Based upon the review of emerging data, there will be the option to adjust the number of participants on active treatment and placebo per dose level.</description>

    <description>RO7223280 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at escalating doses from 10mg to 4800mg, as per the dosing schedules described above. These are putative doses and the maximum daily dose that must not be exceeded is 5000mg.</description>
