  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the common complications of cancer&#xD;
      patients after operation with a 8.9%-46.1% incidence, which severely affecting patients'&#xD;
      postoperative recovery, increasing the medical cost, affecting the social function of&#xD;
      patients, reducing the quality of life and increasing the mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical trauma and perioperative pain can induce systematic inflammatory response and&#xD;
      release systematic inflammatory mediators, which can enter the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      and lead to CNS inflammatory. In order to prevent the development of POCD among elder&#xD;
      patients, the discovery of effective interventions reducing perioperative pain and&#xD;
      inflammatory response is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) is a non-invasive alternative to&#xD;
      needle-based electro-acupuncture (EA). It combines the acupuncture and transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) by pasting the electrode piece on the acupoint instead of&#xD;
      sticking the needles on the skin. TEAS can trigger the release of endogenous&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, releasing endogenous analgesic substances, such as endorphins. TEAS also&#xD;
      can reduce the intraoperative anesthetic consumption, postoperative pain score, postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting (PONV), and improve the postoperative recovery of patients. Recently,&#xD;
      TEAS was found to improve the cognitive function of geriatric patients with silent lacunar&#xD;
      infarction. However, the current TEAS mainly focus on intraoperative. The effect of&#xD;
      perioperative TEAS on POCD is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the effect of TEAS on POCD in geriatric adults undergoing radical resection of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors under general anesthesia was investigated to determine whether TEAS&#xD;
      can decrease perioperative pain or inflammatory response to prevent the occurrence of POCD&#xD;
      and to find out the relationship among perioperative TEAS, inflammatory response,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, and POCD preliminarily.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint&#xD;
      stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumor and received radical resection of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tumors under general anesthesia and to determine the relationship among perioperative TEAS,&#xD;
      inflammatory response, postoperative pain, and POCD preliminarily.&#xD;
