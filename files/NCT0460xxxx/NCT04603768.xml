    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized control trial conducted to check the effects of in patients&#xD;
      with chronic frozen shoulder theraband, isometric and co-contraction exercises so that we can&#xD;
      have best treatment option for patients with chronic frozen shoulder. upper cross syndrome,&#xD;
      duration was of 6months,convenient sampling was done, subject following eligibility criteria&#xD;
      from DHQ hospital Sheikhupura, were randomly allocated in three groups via lottery method,&#xD;
      baseline assessment was done, Group A participants were given baseline treatment along with&#xD;
      theraband exercises , Group B participants were given baseline treatment along with&#xD;
      co-contraction exercises and Group C were given baseline treatment along with isometric&#xD;
      exercises on 3rd and 6th week, post intervention assessment was done via, Numeric pain rating&#xD;
      scale(NPRS),Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI) and goniometric measurements of&#xD;
      shoulder ranges ,3 sessions per week were given, data was analyzed by using SPSS version 26.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Frozen shoulder is among the most commonly reported problems to physicians, orthopedics and&#xD;
      physical therapists. Even before reporting to clinics there is long history of using over the&#xD;
      counter pain killers. Pain avoidance behaviors let the joint stiff so much that a clinician&#xD;
      help is sought. Most times the cause of frozen shoulder is not known, therefore is termed as&#xD;
      'idiopathic frozen shoulder'.There is huge literature regarding the management of frozen&#xD;
      shoulder and yet after the decades of research there are gaps in treatment options. In modern&#xD;
      age of health care, it is common goal of every health care to make patient self-sufficient as&#xD;
      early as possible. The self-care models have tremendous advantages. The current study has&#xD;
      compared the use of theraband, co-contraction and isometric exercises. The current study was&#xD;
      novel in a way that there is limited literature about treating shoulder hypomobility with&#xD;
      physical strengthening exercises. All three methods were employed to see if they improve&#xD;
      ranges along with accompanying pain and disability.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3rd day</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
