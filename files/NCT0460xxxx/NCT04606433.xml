    <textblock>
      In this study, the safety and tolerability of GNC-038 in participants with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma will be investigated to assess the dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for MTD is not reached&#xD;
      of GNC-038. The recommended dose for future clinical study will also be determined.&#xD;
