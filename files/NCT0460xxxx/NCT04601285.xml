    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK profile and efficacy of JS108 for patients with advanced solid tumors. This&#xD;
      study is divided into 3 periods: dose escalation period, dose expansion period, and clinical&#xD;
      expansion period.&#xD;
