  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib trial, single-center, non-randomized, open-label study of Protein-bound&#xD;
      Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, And Gemcitabine (GCN) Combined with Tumor Treatment Fields (TTF) and&#xD;
      G+TTF maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GCN is predicted to be the front-line therapy for biliary and pancreatic cancer in the future&#xD;
      given excellent results of current early clinical trials (ORR â‰¥ 67% in pancreatic cancer).&#xD;
      This will change standard of care for front-line therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. In this cohort of patients' tolerability after 6 cycles of therapy will be a&#xD;
      challenge. Investigators hypothesize that developing a maintenance strategy with TTF+G will&#xD;
      be cutting edge approach and can potentially transform front-line standard of care therapy in&#xD;
      patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. If this pilot study proves fruitful then a larger&#xD;
      study to confirm findings can be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The trial will compose of 2 parts with a total of 40 subjects. The regimen will consist of gemcitabine (G) administered at a dose of 800 mg/m2, cisplatin (C) 30 mg/m2, and protein-bound paclitaxel (N) 150 mg/m2 administered on cycle 1 day 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter and TTF will be administered daily (150kHz 18 hours/day) starting with Cycle 1 Day 1 (dose level 1). After completing 6 cycles, patients will then transition to a maintenance phase of G administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 every 2 weeks and daily TTF (150 KHZ 18 hours/day) until progression of disease (POD) per RECIST v1.1. If 6 patients tolerate the dose level of GCN+TTF through the 1st cycle without defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or grade 4 treatment related adverse events (TRAE), the 2nd part of the study (phase Ib portion) will commence.
