        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically diagnosed as extra-nodal NK/T cell lymphoma (nasal type) according to&#xD;
             WHO 2016 criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Refractory and relapsed ENKTL patients, being relapsed is defined as re-occurrence of&#xD;
             the same lymphoma lesions at the primary site or new sites after complete response&#xD;
             (CR); being refractory is defined as having any of the following conditions: evaluated&#xD;
             as stable disease (SD) or progression disease (PD) after 2 cycles of treatment; not&#xD;
             being able to achieve partial response (PR) after 4 cycles of treatment; not being&#xD;
             able to achieve complete response (CR) after 6 cycles of treatment. Patients that did&#xD;
             not achieve remission, or relapsed/progressed after autologous stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation (ASCT) could also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received asparaginase-based chemotherapy previously (patients with&#xD;
             phase I/II disease must have received radiotherapy previously).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. With measurable foci, defined as: lymph nodes with long diameters&gt;15mmï¼Œextra-nodal&#xD;
             foci&gt;10mm on CT scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status) point 0 or 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Invasive NK cell leukemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Primary CNS lymphoma or CNS-involved lymphoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with hemophagocytic syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with lymphoma invading large pulmonary vessels;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients primarily resistant to anti-PD1,PD-L1,PD-L2 antibodies (generally considered&#xD;
             as those received anti- PD1,PD-L1,PD-L2 antibodies as monotherapy or in combination&#xD;
             with chemotherapy, but did not achieve PR or CR in non-maintenance treatment).&#xD;
