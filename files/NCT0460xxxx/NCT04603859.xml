  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of overweight and obese women becoming pregnant is increasing. Obesity in pregnancy&#xD;
      along with delivery by cesarean section in obese women is associated with several&#xD;
      complications as compared to normal weight women. The longer the woman is pregnant, the&#xD;
      longer she is at risk. In an otherwise low-risk pregnant woman at term, it is an ongoing&#xD;
      clinical dilemma, whether the benefits of elective induction of labor and termination of the&#xD;
      pregnancy will outweigh the potential harms from concomitant induction and delivery process.&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled study of elective induction versus expectant&#xD;
      management in obese women. The study will be carried out as a national multicenter study with&#xD;
      inclusion of 1900 participants from Danish delivery wards. The null hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      caesarean section rate is similar with elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation,&#xD;
      compared with expectant management among pregnant women with pre- or early pregnancy BMI≥30.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      of ≥25 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. Overweight and obesity are rising&#xD;
      dramatically worldwide. In fertile women, the prevalence of obesity is one third in the&#xD;
      United States, 20% in the United Kingdom, and 12-13% in Denmark. The association between&#xD;
      obesity in pregnancy and the risk of gestational complications increases with increasing BMI.&#xD;
      Among other complications, obesity in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. Delivery by caesarean section further adds significant risks of wound&#xD;
      infection or other infectious morbidity in obese women as compared to normal weight women.&#xD;
      The longer the woman is pregnant, the longer the risk of pregnancy complications remains. In&#xD;
      an otherwise low-risk pregnant woman at term, it is an on-going clinical dilemma, whether the&#xD;
      benefits of elective induction of labor (eIOL) and termination of the pregnancy will outweigh&#xD;
      the potential harms from the concomitant induction and delivery process. Regarding delivery&#xD;
      complications, based on data from historical cohorts, eIOL has traditionally been associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of caesarean section and instrumental delivery. Therefore, expectant&#xD;
      management has been the preferred clinical option. This interpretation has now been&#xD;
      challenged by a randomized trial (ARRIVE) with &gt;6000 low-risk pregnant women where eIOL at 39&#xD;
      weeks of gestation was associated with lower caesarean delivery rates. There are no&#xD;
      randomized studies in obese women, but two larger observational studies did find lower odds&#xD;
      of caesarean delivery in obese women with eIOL as compared to awaiting labor onset. Hence, a&#xD;
      randomized trial that would compare caesarean delivery among obese women whose labor is&#xD;
      induced with those expectantly managed is warranted. The proposed study will provide new and&#xD;
      important knowledge into the area of induction of labor among overweight and obese women with&#xD;
      potential great international impact for the future raising number of pregnant women in this&#xD;
      subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this trial, the investigators aim to compare the risk of caesarean section in obese (BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 30 kg/m2), but otherwise low-risk women with eIOL as compared to expectant management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1 in the&#xD;
      two following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention arm/elective induction of labor in pregnancy at 39 gestational week and 0&#xD;
           to 3 days: Induction is performed according to local policy for induction of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison arm/expectant management: Waiting for spontaneous onset of labor unless a&#xD;
           situation develops necessitating either induction of labor or caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1900 low-risk pregnant women with a pre- or early pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 carrying a&#xD;
           singleton pregnancy will be recruited from the Danish delivery wards. In each trial&#xD;
           site, a physician investigator will be responsible for the enrolment, the electronically&#xD;
           randomization, and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the caesarean section rate. Among others there will be secondary&#xD;
      endpoints on instrumental delivery, onset of labor, methods of induction, perinatal and&#xD;
      postpartum complications both maternal and neonatal along with data on women's experience on&#xD;
      birth measured by a questionnaire survey four to six weeks post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the&#xD;
      latest version of the 'Declaration of Helsinki' and the 'Guideline for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice' related to experiments on humans. The Central Denmark Region Committee on&#xD;
      Biomedical Research Ethics, and The Danish Health Authorities have approved the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives In perspective, more than 39% of the world's population is overweight and 13%&#xD;
      are obese by the WHO classification. Pregnant overweight women are at increased risk of&#xD;
      pregnancy and delivery complications, and there is a need to improve maternity care for this&#xD;
      subgroup of women. The results of this trial have the potential to generate important&#xD;
      knowledge for the improvement of delivery in obese women and they will add key information to&#xD;
      an on-going discussion of the effects of labor induction before term. Any possible harm or&#xD;
      disadvantage to the individual study participant is outweighed by the possible benefit to the&#xD;
      increasing number of obese women who will be pregnant in the future.&#xD;
