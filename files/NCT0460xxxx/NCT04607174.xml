  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation is the amount of voluntary recruitment of a muscle during voluntary contraction.&#xD;
      Full activation implies the recruitment of all muscle fibres at their tetanic frequency. In&#xD;
      healthy subjects, and even in sports performances, full activation may be rarely achieved&#xD;
      despite a subjectively maximal effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly decreased activation has been observed in patients affected by various orthopaedic and&#xD;
      neurological disorders. In these subjects, paresis may be caused or aggravated by primitive&#xD;
      impairments of the central nervous system and/or, by stimuli arising from peripheral damaged&#xD;
      tissues that inhibit the corticospinal or the intraspinal recruitment of motoneurones&#xD;
      (&quot;arthrogenous muscle weakness&quot;). There are numerous investigations in the literature on&#xD;
      activation measured during isometric contractions, while they are substantially missing as&#xD;
      far as isokinetic concentric contractions are concerned. There are reasons to suppose that,&#xD;
      contrary to what has been demonstrated for healthy subjects, in patients with various motor&#xD;
      impairments the activation is diminished the more, the higher is the joint rotation speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate the amount of activation of the quadriceps femoris&#xD;
      during subjectively maximal isometric contractions at 40° knee flexion (0°=complete&#xD;
      extension) and isokinetic concentric contractions at an angular velocity of 100°/s in&#xD;
      patients with various orthopaedic and neurologic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation will be measured on an isokinetic dynamometer, through the &quot;interpolated twitch&#xD;
      technique&quot;. This consists of stimulating a representative sample of the muscle belly through&#xD;
      an electric shock. If the shock does not generate an extra force during contraction, all&#xD;
      muscle fibres belonging to the sample reached by the electric shock can be claimed to be&#xD;
      recruited at their tetanic frequency. Otherwise, following the stimulus, a twitch can be&#xD;
      observed revealing submaximal voluntary recruitment of the muscle.&#xD;

    <description>Voluntary Activation level will be determined according to the interpolate twitch technique (ITT).&#xD;
During isometric contractions (knee at 40° flexion), three electric shocks (doublets) will be delivered. The first shock will be delivered at rest before contraction. The second one will be delivered 3-4 s after the beginning of the effort. The third one will be delivered at rest 2-3 s after the contraction has ended. Two isometric contractions will be performed, with a 3-minute break.&#xD;
Then, 3 consecutive continuous passive motion (CPM) extension-flexions of the knee joint (range 105-0°), and 3 isokinetic concentric contractions (ISOK) will be performed. During both CPM and ISOK an electric shock will be delivered during each repetition. The instant of stimulation will be determined in a way allowing the twitch moments to peak at exactly 40° of knee flexion during extension. The same procedure will be administered first to the affected limb, and then to the non-affected limb.</description>
