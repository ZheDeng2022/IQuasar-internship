  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes and complications of the transverse&#xD;
      preputial island flap (Duckett's procedure) to those of double-faced preputial flap (DFPF)&#xD;
      for one-stage repair of penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee, in addition to clinical&#xD;
      functional evaluation by estimated urine flow.&#xD;

      Type of study: RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different modalities of urethroplasty for repair of proximal hypospadias with chordee&#xD;
           (two-stage repair, one-stage repair, flap, graft).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disadvantages of two-stage urethroplasty for proximal hypospadias with chordee..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merits of one-stage urethroplasty for proximal hypospadias with chordee. This is a&#xD;
           prospective randomized controlled study conducted at pediatric surgery department,&#xD;
           Al-Houssain &amp; New Damietta Al-Azhar University Hospitals, from March 2014 to March 2020,&#xD;
           on 144 male patients with penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee. Patients will be&#xD;
           investigated by routine laboratory tests for fitness for surgery. All of them will&#xD;
           undergo one-stage repair using either of 2 techniques of tubularized preputial flap;&#xD;
           Duckett's versus DFPF. Written informed consent will be obtained from parents of all&#xD;
           participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study at Pediatric Surgery Departments, Al-Azhar University hospitals in Cairo&#xD;
      and New Damietta. Number of cases: One-hundred-Forty four male patients. Time frame: period&#xD;
      of 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be discussed and approved for clinical study by the Ethical Research&#xD;
      Committee at the principal investigator's hospital. The procedures and the aim of the study&#xD;
      will be clearly explained to the patient and the family. A written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before enrollment of the patients into the study. The family refusal to give consent&#xD;
      for one-stage repair is respected but does not deprive the patient from getting surgical care&#xD;
      by two-stage repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to history taking, clinical examination, and necessary&#xD;
      laboratory investigations (CBC, Coagulation profile, Liver and Renal Function tests,&#xD;
      Electrolytes Panel, Urinalysis). They will receive a dose of single broad-spectrum antibiotic&#xD;
      30 min-1 hour before surgery. Patients will be randomly divided (using the computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization table) into two equal groups, each will include 72 patients; Group I will&#xD;
      undergo transverse preputial island flap (Duckett's technique) and Group II will undergo&#xD;
      double-faced preputial flap (DFPF). Both techniques will be done by all members of the&#xD;
      surgical team equally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up at OPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected using a data collecting sheets (annexes) and were analyzed using the&#xD;
      statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,&#xD;
      IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD), range, and average and categorical variables were expressed as frequency count &amp;&#xD;
      percentage. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of frequency counts/percentage. A&#xD;
      two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will focus on one-stage urethroplasty using the preputial flap for proximal hypospadias&#xD;
      with chordee. The results obtained from this study will be compared between both group and&#xD;
      with those reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it will focus on results, complications, their management, and clinical evaluation by&#xD;
      estimated urine caliber and micturition time. At the end, the investigators will conclude the&#xD;
      reconstructive technique that gives the better results and least morbidity.&#xD;
