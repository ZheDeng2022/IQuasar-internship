  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve participants with unilateral cleft lip equally divided into two groups. Both groups&#xD;
      were photographed preoperative and postoperative. The Control group treated using&#xD;
      (Rotation-advancement) based on the Millard technique; and the test group treated using&#xD;
      (Straight-line) technique based on Fisher modification.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Advancement-rotation approach based on Millard' for repairing lip defect.</intervention_name>
    <description>patients were treated using Millard technique is the downward rotation of the medial part of the flap, and lateral advancement of the flap to close and fill the defect. if more lip height is needed; &quot;cut- as- you-go&quot; by adding a back-cut incision at the end of his rotation incision down toward the philtral ridge of non-clefted side. Moreover; C-flap is used to close nasal sill.</description>

    <intervention_name>Straight-line approach</intervention_name>
    <description>patients were treated using Straight-Line design based on Fisher modification. C-shaped flap extend from the proposed nasal sill to the origin of philtral column of medial flap as a straight incision to the planned top of the cupid's bow. In addition, to the previous mentioned incision, small inlate incision is needed to length the cleft side on the medial flap.&#xD;
On the other hand, on the lateral flap; two connected triangular incisions are used; one on the vermillion border at Noordhoff's point. And the other one just above the cutaneous margin to improve aesthetic outcome and diminish formed scar.</description>
