      In this study, a single-center, prospective, self-control, and blind design was adopted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 100 patients with solid pancreatic masses who are to be diagnosed&#xD;
      with contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopy ultrasonography (CH-EUS) follow by EUS-guided&#xD;
      fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). First, all patients will be diagnosed both by the&#xD;
      AI-assisted diagnosis system and the endoscopists under CH-EUS; Second, to compare the&#xD;
      EUS-FNA under the guidance of the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system and the EUS-FNA&#xD;
      under manual identification, patients were randomly assigned to undergo EUS-FNA with or&#xD;
      without the guidance of AI-assisted diagnosis system for the first two passes.&#xD;

    <description>The ultrasound endoscopists manually determined the region of interest (ROI) according to CH-EUS, and punctured 2 needles in the tumor area with a 22G needle, and each needle moved 15-20 times back and forth in the lesion. After puncture, insert the needle core, rinse the needle with 0.1ml sterile saline, and further apply air flushing to ensure that each tissue is sent to the slide.</description>
