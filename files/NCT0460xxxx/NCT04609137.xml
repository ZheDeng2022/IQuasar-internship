    <textblock>
      Main indications for distal pancreatectomy (DP) are pancreatic body and tail tumors including&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and cystic neoplasms. Despite a less invasive&#xD;
      operation with lower morbidity compared to pancreatic head surgery, DP is burdened by the&#xD;
      occurrence of clinically-relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) in a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drain fluid amylase (DFA) on POD 1 (postoperative day 1) &gt; 2,000 U/L appears as the best&#xD;
      performing threshold to predict the occurrence of CR-POPF after distal pancreatectomy.&#xD;
      Although there is preliminary evidence that early drain removal in the subgroup of patients&#xD;
      with DFA1 &lt; 2,000 U/L may reduce POPF, no prospective study has yet evaluated the impact of&#xD;
      an early drain removal strategy compared to standard management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question of this study is to evaluate to what extent early postoperative drain&#xD;
      removal according to a validated DFA1 impact on clinically-relevant POPF rate after distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy in comparison to standard drain management. The primary hypothesis is that,&#xD;
      early drain removal will result in a reduced proportion of patients experiencing grade B-C&#xD;
      POPF according to ISGPS definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a two-group, assessor-blind, randomized trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio into one of two groups: (1) standard drain management or&#xD;
      (2) early drain removal strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study adults (&gt;18 years) patients with pancreatic body or tail diseases planned for&#xD;
      distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy will be enrolled.The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      POPF at 90 days after surgery, defined as grade B or C POPF according to ISGPS definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires in order to assess their general&#xD;
      health status, and they will be evaluated at time of hospital admission, at 15 days, at 30&#xD;
      days after surgery (via telephone follow-up), and at 90 days after surgery (via telephone&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;

      RATIONALE AND RESEARCH QUESTION Distal pancreatectomy (DP) is defined as the resection of the&#xD;
      left portion of the pancreas extending from the neck to the tail of the gland. DP is burdened&#xD;
      by the occurrence of clinically-relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients.Traditionally, during DP drains were placed&#xD;
      intraoperatively in proximity of the pancreatic stump to mitigate the potential occurrence of&#xD;
      POPF. Postoperatively, drains were usually kept in place until a POPF was ruled out by the&#xD;
      presence of drain fluid amylase (DFA) values lower than 3-fold the upper limit of normal&#xD;
      serum amylase, and a non &quot;sinister&quot; appearance of drain fluid in accordance with the&#xD;
      International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition. For this reason, drains&#xD;
      were usually maintained in place after surgery for at least 5 - 7 days. Although there is&#xD;
      some preliminary evidence that early drain removal in the subgroup of patients with DFA1 &lt;&#xD;
      2,000 U/L, no prospective study has yet evaluated the impact of an early drain removal&#xD;
      strategy compared to standard management. Therefore, the overall aim of this study is to&#xD;
      contribute evidence about the effect of an early drain removal policy on postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes following distal pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is to evaluate to what extent does early postoperative drain&#xD;
      removal according to a validated DFA1 impact on clinically-relevant POPF rate after distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy in comparison to standard drain management. The primary (confirmatory)&#xD;
      hypothesis is that, early drain removal will result in a reduced proportion of patients&#xD;
      experiencing grade B-C POPF according to ISGPS definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the exploratory hypotheses that, in comparison to standard care, early drain&#xD;
      removal will: (1) reduce time to postoperative functional recovery, (2) reduce number and&#xD;
      severity of postoperative complications, (3) reduce postoperative surgical site infections,&#xD;
      (4) improve self-reported physical function status, (5) improve generic health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and (6) be cost-effective, will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS The study is designed as a two-group, assessor-blind,&#xD;
      randomized trial. Participants will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio into one of two&#xD;
      groups: (1) standard drain management or (2) early drain removal strategy. The intervention&#xD;
      will be provided during hospital stay. Adult people with pancreatic body or tail diseases&#xD;
      (i.e. pancreatic cancer, cystic neoplasms, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, etc.) planned&#xD;
      for distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy at the San Raffaele Hospital IRCCS&#xD;
      (HSR) will be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT PROCESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The step-by-step recruitment process is described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients scheduled for elective distal pancreatectomy who meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be informed about the study by a surgeon at their first office&#xD;
           consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient has interest in participating in the study, at the preoperative clinic&#xD;
           visit or at the time of hospital admission, a trial investigator will discuss the study&#xD;
           in detail with the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The potential participant or their legal representative will read the consent form. Once&#xD;
           the informed consent is signed and the patient enrolled in the study, preoperative&#xD;
           assessment will be undertaken&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUE The standard surgical procedure for DP will be performed and will not be&#xD;
      influenced by this study protocol. The choice of minimally invasive versus open technique&#xD;
      will be at surgeon's discretion. As a general rule, patients with benign lesions or&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors will be approached laparoscopically, while pancreatic cancer cases are&#xD;
      discussed on an individual basis according to tumor location and vessel proximity.&#xD;
      Splenectomy and standard lymphadenectomy will be routinely performed in cancer patients. A&#xD;
      spleen preserving procedure with preservation of splenic vessels will be attempted only in&#xD;
      non-neoplastic cases at surgeon's discretion. Pancreatic stump transection will be performed&#xD;
      with a stapler in laparoscopic procedures, whereas in open procedures the pancreas will be&#xD;
      cut using the scalpel followed by selective suturing of the pancreatic duct when visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the association between pancreatic parenchymal structure and occurrence of POPF,&#xD;
      in addition to standard pathology assessment, the pancreatic specimen will undergo a specific&#xD;
      pathological evaluation. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections (between 1 and 4 for&#xD;
      each case) of the pancreatic resection margin will be reviewed by two expert pancreatic&#xD;
      pathologists, blinded to all clinical information. All the definitive slides will be assessed&#xD;
      for their acinar, fat and fibrosis content as a proportion of the total surface area. Acinar,&#xD;
      fat and fibrosis scores will then calculated for each patient so that their sum is equal to&#xD;
      was 100%. The final score for each patient will be the result of two pathologists reached a&#xD;
      consensus agreement by the two pathologists.on the scoring of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRAIN MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the operation, after reassessing exclusion criteria, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard postoperative drain management: Participants randomized to this group will&#xD;
           receive the current standard of care at our institution. The drain will be maintained at&#xD;
           least until postoperative day 5. If DFA on POD 5 is lower than 3-fold the upper limit of&#xD;
           normal serum amylase value, and/or the drain fluid does not appear &quot;sinister&quot; (i.e.&#xD;
           varying from dark brown to greenish fluid to milky water to clear &quot;spring water&quot;&#xD;
           pancreatic juice like appearance) according to the clinical team, the drain will be&#xD;
           removed. If the drain is maintained in place beyond POD 5, it will be removed inhospital&#xD;
           or after discharge when the daily amount is lower than 10 ml and there are no signs of&#xD;
           ongoing infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early drain removal: Participants randomized to this group, will have an early drain&#xD;
           removal (before POD 3) if DFA on POD1 is lower than 2000 U/L and/or the drain fluid does&#xD;
           not appear &quot;sinister&quot; (i.e. varying from dark brown to greenish fluid to milky water to&#xD;
           clear &quot;spring water&quot; pancreatic juice like appearance) according to the clinical team.&#xD;
           If DFA is greater than 2000 U/L, the drain will be maintained in place. If the sample on&#xD;
           POD1 DFA is not available (e.g. drainage fluid is viscous and amylase value cannot be&#xD;
           evaluated) or the sample could not be analyzed (e.g. the fluid collection tube is lost&#xD;
           or not sealed) DFA will be evaluated on POD2, and drain removal will be considered if&#xD;
           DFA is lower than 2000 U/L. If DFA on POD 3 is lower than 300 U/L, that is 3-fold the&#xD;
           upper limit of normal serum amylase value, and/or the drain fluid does not appear&#xD;
           &quot;sinister&quot; (i.e. varying from dark brown to greenish fluid to milky water to clear&#xD;
           &quot;spring water&quot; pancreatic juice like appearance) according to the clinical team, the&#xD;
           drain will be removed. Otherwise, the drain will be kept in place and .the patient will&#xD;
           then follow standard postoperative drain management as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will measure serum amylase and drain fluid amylase along with other routine&#xD;
      postoperative laboratory tests on POD 1 - 3 - 5 as the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as drain fluid microbial contamination is considered to play a potential role&#xD;
      for the POPF occurrence, a drain fluid culture for aerobic and /anaerobic microorganisms will&#xD;
      be performed on POD1 (baseline) and POD5, in order to evaluate the predictive ability of&#xD;
      early bacterial contamination in the abdominal fluid for clinically relevant POPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS AND OUTCOMES Demographic data, medical history, laboratory values and&#xD;
      information relevant to the surgical procedure will be recorded. The main (confirmatory)&#xD;
      outcome of interest will be the occurrence of CF-POPF at 90 days after surgery, defined as&#xD;
      grade B or C POPF according to the 2016 ISGPS definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients discharged home without an abdominal drain represents the&#xD;
      explanatory outcome measure. It will be evaluated at time of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to functional recovery (TFR) will be measured by subtracting the date of surgery from&#xD;
      the date when participants achieves standardized criteria (tolerance of oral intake, recovery&#xD;
      of lower gastrointestinal function, adequate pain control on oral analgesia, ability to&#xD;
      mobilize and self-care and no evidence of untreated medical problems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications occurring during the index admission or in a subsequent&#xD;
      readmission, when related to surgery, will be recorded up to 90 days after surgery and graded&#xD;
      by severity using the Dindo-Clavien classification. Additionally, the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Complication Index will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative morbidity at 90 days after surgery will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical site infections classified as superficial incisional, deep incisional or&#xD;
           organ-space according to the definition by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage and delayed gastric empting as defined by the ISGPS&#xD;
           Self-reported activity status will be measured using the Duke Activity Status Index&#xD;
           (DASI) and Generic heath related quality of life will be measured using the Patient&#xD;
           Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS)-29+2 Profile v2.1. These&#xD;
           questionnaires will be completed before surgery, at 15, 30 and 90 days after surgery.&#xD;
           Cost-effectiveness will be estimated by the ratio of differences in costs to differences&#xD;
           in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDED ASSESSMENT An examiner blinded to the participants' treatment allocation will obtain&#xD;
      all measures. The code for group allocation will not be revealed until all analyses are&#xD;
      completed. The effectiveness of blinding will be estimated by asking the assessor to guess&#xD;
      the participant's group allocation at the completion of the 90 days assessment. It is not&#xD;
      possible to blind the participants to their group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND TIMELINES Recent studies carried at the HRS Division of&#xD;
      Pancreatic Surgery showed that, when standard drain management is used, the proportion of&#xD;
      patients developing CR-POPF is approximately 46%. Sample size requirement for the present&#xD;
      study was estimated for an α level of 0.05 and 80% power to detect a 23% reduction in this&#xD;
      proportion (risk ratio 0.23/0.46=0.5). According to this estimate, a sample of 66&#xD;
      participants per group is considered sufficient for our analysis. A sample size of 75&#xD;
      participants per group (total sample of 150) is targeted to account for possible dropouts.&#xD;
      Regression models will be used to test the main hypothesis related to the superiority of&#xD;
      early drain removal based on a reduction of CR-POPF at 90-days after surgery. The&#xD;
      randomization list will be created with the &quot;Block randomization&quot; rule, in order to reduce&#xD;
      bias and achieve balance in the allocation of participants to the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Division of Pancreatic Surgery at HSR performs about 90 distal pancreatectomies annually.&#xD;
      Based on previous trial experience, approximately 90% of these patients will be eligible and&#xD;
      agree to participate. Therefore, 150 participants could be feasibly enrolled in 21 months.&#xD;
      With an additional 90 days follow-up required for the primary outcome, the timeline for this&#xD;
      study is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY Previously completed studies have shown that early drain removal in patients with DFA1&#xD;
      values lower than a validated threshold in patients undergoing pancreatic head resection is&#xD;
      not only safe but beneficial, as it reduces the incidence of CR-POPF and the risk of further&#xD;
      complications due to the persistence of a foreign body&#xD;
