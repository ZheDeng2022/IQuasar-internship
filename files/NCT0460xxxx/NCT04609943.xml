  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study researchers want to find the highest safe dose of the soluble Guanylate&#xD;
      Cyclase (sGC) Activator, BAY 1211163 and how safe and well the study drug works. Furthermore&#xD;
      researchers want to gather information on the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid&#xD;
      of the study drug given as increasing multiple doses by inhalation to patients who cannot&#xD;
      breathe by their own and suffer from a type of lung failure that causes fluid to build up in&#xD;
      the lungs making breathing difficult (ARDS)&#xD;
