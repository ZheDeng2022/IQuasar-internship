    <textblock>
      This is a study of Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) and Apatinb for unresectable Recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction&#xD;
      Adenocarcinoma. Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib and standard chemotherapy will be given&#xD;
      to treatment-naïve participants; Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib will also be evaluated&#xD;
      in participants who have had ≥ 1 line of previous treatment. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      Overall Response Rate (ORR).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will have 2 cohorts. In Cohort 1, participants who have not received any previous&#xD;
      therapy for their disease will receive Camrelizumab and Apatinib in combination with&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin and S-1. In Cohort 2, participants who have received at least one prior therapy&#xD;
      for their advanced disease will receive Camrelizumab and Apatinib. A Simon two-stage phase II&#xD;
      design was used for the sample size Calculation.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an adverse event. The number of participants who experienced an AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received. The grade of AE will be assessed per CTCAE 5.0.</description>
