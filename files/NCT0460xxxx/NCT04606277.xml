      This study was planned considering that young people with smartphone addiction are depressed&#xD;
      and their physical activity is significantly reduced. In this direction, our aim is to&#xD;
      examine the relationship between smartphone use and physical activity among universities in&#xD;
      the 18-25 age group, which uses technology extensively. Our results are to raise awareness of&#xD;
      this prevention by uncovering the possibility that it may be the cause of smartphone use in&#xD;
      young people.&#xD;
