  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of digital storytelling on the&#xD;
      Self-Management behavior of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (TID).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 60 eligible adolescents with TID were&#xD;
      selected based on a convenient sampling method. Next, the participants were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two parallel groups: intervention (training with digital storytelling method,&#xD;
      n=30) or control (training with conventional) n=30) groups. Before and three months after the&#xD;
      intervention the patients' levels of self-management behaviors according to Self-Management&#xD;
      of TID amongst adolescents (SMOD-A); in addition to the Glycated Hemoglobin test (HbA1c) were&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
