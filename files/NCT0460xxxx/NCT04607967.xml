    <textblock>
      A quarter of the patients admitted to the Shock Room or Resuscitation Room of an Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) are admitted for severe hypoxemia resulting from acute respiratory distress.&#xD;
      Like all life-threatening conditions, acute respiratory distress (ARD) requires a rapid&#xD;
      identification and prompt implementation of effective resuscitation measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen treatment, first described in 1890, remains one of the most important discoveries in&#xD;
      medicine. The purpose of oxygenation is to alleviate respiratory failure and to restore a&#xD;
      satisfactory hematosis. The choice of the oxygen delivery device is based on the severity of&#xD;
      the hypoxemia, the underlying physiological problems, the type of dyspnea and the patient's&#xD;
      tolerance to the device. The most commonly used devices are nasal cannula, face mask and&#xD;
      high-concentration face mask (conventional oxygen therapy). High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) is&#xD;
      now widely used as a complement to conventional oxygen therapy in the EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNO ensures good clinical tolerance and better patient comfort (humidification and heating&#xD;
      of inhaled gases, ease of speech and possible oral feeding) than the other oxygen devices.&#xD;
      The HFNO flow rate can go up to 60-70 L/min with an FIO2 of 100% compared to a maximum output&#xD;
      of 15 L/min with conventional oxygen-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of data and clinical trials concerning the systematic use of HFNO in EDs in&#xD;
      cases of severe hypoxemia, a prospective study is essential. The purpose of this work is to&#xD;
      evaluate the contribution of early administration of HFNO for patients with acute&#xD;
      non-hypercapnic respiratory distress presenting in the ED, with the aim of obtaining rapid&#xD;
      correction of hematosis. The objective of this work is to compare Conventional Oxygen Therapy&#xD;
      (CO) delivered by nasal cannula or nasal-oral mask at flow rates up to a maximum of 15&#xD;
      liters, to HFNO with the hypothesis that HFNO would reduce the need for ventilation therapy&#xD;
      escalation. The other hypotheses concern the interest of the HFNO in reducing the use of&#xD;
      intensive care hospitalization and thus the costs of treating these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress (ARD) is defined as the inability of a patient to maintain normal&#xD;
      hematosis. A hematosis disorder is defined as an alteration of the blood gases with hypoxemia&#xD;
      (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) less than 80 mm of mercury (mmHg) and transcutaneous O2&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) less than 95%), associated or not with hypercapnia (partial pressure of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (PaCO2) &gt; 45 mmHg) or hypocapnia depending on the cause of the acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure. Compensation mechanisms include increased minute ventilation, increased&#xD;
      ventilatory work and increased cardiac output. When these compensatory mechanisms are&#xD;
      insufficient, acute respiratory distress occurs, along with signs of heart failure (acute cor&#xD;
      pulmonale) and neuropsychic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without care, a potentially fatal respiratory decompensation may occur. ARD can be&#xD;
      hypercapnic. It's defined by a PaCO2 greater than 45 mm Hg associated with a drop in blood pH&#xD;
      reflecting respiratory acidosis. Hypoxemic ARD is defined by a PaO2 of less than 60 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quarter of the patients admitted to the Vital Emergency Room (VER) are admitted for severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia resulting from acute respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like all life-threatening conditions, acute respiratory distress (ARD) requires a rapid&#xD;
      identification and prompt implementation of effective resuscitation measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen treatment, first described in 1890, remains one of the most important discoveries in&#xD;
      medicine. The purpose of oxygenation is to alleviate respiratory failure and to restore a&#xD;
      satisfactory hematosis. Most experts stress the importance of having an SpO2 target of more&#xD;
      than 90% in the majority of patients. While non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the standard of&#xD;
      care in the initial management of patients with hypercapnic acidosis, there are currently no&#xD;
      recommendations for oxygen therapy in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory distress in the&#xD;
      emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the oxygen delivery device is based on the severity of the hypoxemia, the&#xD;
      underlying physiological problems, the type of dyspnea and the patient's tolerance to the&#xD;
      device. The most commonly used devices are nasal cannula, face mask and high-concentration&#xD;
      face mask. They offer several Oxygen Inspired Fraction (fraction of O2 in the gas mixture&#xD;
      breathed, FiO2) depending on the oxygen flow rate instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) is used as a complement to conventional oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      emergency departments in general and in particular in the different emergency departments&#xD;
      participating in our study. HFNO is used in hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency according to&#xD;
      the national and international recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNO makes it possible to administer a much higher flow of oxygen than with the usual&#xD;
      hospital and prehospital flow meters. This flow rate can go up to 60-70 L/min with an FIO2 of&#xD;
      100%. This high flow rate allows to generate low levels of positive pressure in the upper&#xD;
      airways and to adapt the FIO2 delivered up to 100% notably thanks to dedicated nasal&#xD;
      cannulas. HFNO ensures good clinical tolerance and better patient comfort (humidification and&#xD;
      heating of inhaled gases, ease of speech and possible oral feeding) than the other oxygen&#xD;
      devices. Its use was initially developed in paediatric and neonatal intensive care units. It&#xD;
      was then gradually extended to &quot;adult&quot; intensive care units and intensive care units in the&#xD;
      treatment of hypoxemic, non-hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF) with no indication&#xD;
      for orotracheal intubation. The FLORALI study confirms its use as an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional oxygen therapy in intensive care units. Its implementation, its efficacy&#xD;
      (improvement of dyspnea, clinical respiratory signs and oxygenation parameters), its good&#xD;
      tolerance and acceptability by the nursing staff, were recently demonstrated in an emergency&#xD;
      department in 17 patients with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. However, despite the&#xD;
      increasing number of studies, methodologically heterogeneous and of insufficient statistical&#xD;
      power carried out on HFNO, these studies remain non-contributory with regard to the&#xD;
      superiority of high nasal flow compared to conventional oxygen therapy. The gain of the HFNO&#xD;
      strategy seems to be established for clinical ventilatory parameters and dyspnea level.&#xD;
      However, the need for therapeutic escalation and mortality have not been precisely evaluated.&#xD;
      On the other hand, there is very little information on the time required for the&#xD;
      implementation of HFNO in the various studies carried out in patients. The available data&#xD;
      indicate that the average time would usually be more than 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of data and clinical trials concerning the systematic use of HFNO in emergency&#xD;
      departments in cases of severe hypoxemia, a prospective study is essential. The purpose of&#xD;
      this work is to evaluate the contribution of early administration of HFNO for patients with&#xD;
      acute non-hypercapnic respiratory distress presenting in the emergency department, with the&#xD;
      aim of obtaining rapid correction of hematosis. The objective of this work is to compare&#xD;
      Conventional Oxygen Therapy (CO) delivered by nasal cannula or nasal-oral mask at flow rates&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 15 liters to HFNO, with the hypothesis that HFNO would reduce the need for&#xD;
      ventilation therapy escalation. The other hypotheses concern the interest of the HFNO in&#xD;
      reducing the use of intensive care hospitalization and thus the costs of treating these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
