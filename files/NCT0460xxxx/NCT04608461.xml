  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arsenicosis is a major health problem in Bangladesh. Long term exposure of arsenic causes&#xD;
      keratosis of palm which reduce working capacity of patient. It also causes massive skin&#xD;
      lesions like Bowen's disease which has a risk to develop squamous cell carcinoma. Pumpkin&#xD;
      seed is well known for its antioxidant and anticancer properties. So this study will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify the compound from pumpkin seeds and to see its outcome on keratosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contamination of groundwater by arsenic is a global problem affecting thousands of people&#xD;
      worldwide, especially in Bangladesh, India and West Bengal. In Bangladesh, an estimated 59&#xD;
      administrative districts out of 64 have been affected with significantly high concentrations&#xD;
      of arsenic. Due to arsenicosis, keratosis of palm and sole reduce the patient's working&#xD;
      capacity and affect the socioeconomic condition. Bowen's disease, squamous cell carcinoma and&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma which are invasive skin lesions also caused by arsenicosis. Keratosis&#xD;
      can be treated by various topical preparations like salicylic acid, alpha-lipoic acid, zinc,&#xD;
      propylene glycol, garlic oil, neem leaf extract, an extract of Azadirachta indica and Solanum&#xD;
      melongena. But these treatments require a longer time to relieve symptoms and thus reduce&#xD;
      patient's compliance. Pumpkin seeds are rich not only in antioxidant vitamins (carotenoids&#xD;
      and tocopherols), minerals and proteins, but also low in fat and calories. β-carotene reduces&#xD;
      the damage of skin from the sun and it also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. α-carotene&#xD;
      slows the aging process, prevents tumor growth and reduces the risk of developing cataracts.&#xD;
      Vitamin E also called tocopherols protects the cell from oxidative damage by preventing&#xD;
      oxidation of cell membranous unsaturated fatty acid. β-sitosterol also useful to reduce blood&#xD;
      cholesterol and to decrease the risks of some types of cancers. So this study will be&#xD;
      conducted to see the outcome of pumpkin seed extract in moderate to severe palmar arsenical&#xD;
      keratosis. The study will be an open phase-II clinical trial and will be conducted in&#xD;
      Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Sirajdikhan Upazila of Munshiganj District.&#xD;
      Extract from pumpkin seeds will be collected by using 70% ethanol as a solvent and rotary&#xD;
      evaporator. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) of extract will be done to identify the compound.&#xD;
      By using brine shrimp bioassay cytotoxicity assay will be done. The ointment will be prepared&#xD;
      from pumpkin seeds extract and supplied to each patient at an interval of 2 weeks. Each&#xD;
      patient will be advised about applying the cream. Improvement and adverse effects will be&#xD;
      monitored through phone calls and during the visit regularly. Clinical improvement will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring the palmar arsenical nodule size before and after completion of&#xD;
      treatment and perception of patients about their improvement. Statistical analysis and&#xD;
      results will be documented in different diagrams and in tabulated forms.&#xD;
