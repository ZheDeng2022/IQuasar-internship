  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an experimental study with a methodological and pre-test-post-test control group&#xD;
      in order to determine the effect of web-designed education developed for asthmatic patients&#xD;
      on drug compliance and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first stage, it is aimed to develop, implement and evaluate a web designed asthma&#xD;
      education program for asthma patients. In the second stage, it is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the web-designed education program developed for asthmatic patients on drug compliance and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study consists of patients diagnosed with asthma who are registered in&#xD;
      Family Health Centers in Eskişehir Tepebaşı and Odunpazarı districts. The individuals that&#xD;
      constitute the target group in the study will be determined through the records of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with asthma registered in the family health center or the list of patients in the&#xD;
      J45-Asthma and J46 Status Asthmaticus ICD codes. The sample of the study will be the patients&#xD;
      who meet the criteria for inclusion in the study. G power analysis program was used to&#xD;
      determine the sample size. The research will be conducted in two groups, an intervention and&#xD;
      a control group. The sample size of the research was found to be 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collecting research data; The personal descriptive characteristics form prepared by the&#xD;
      researcher, the questionnaire for determining the information needs, Form for evaluation of&#xD;
      the skills of using inhalation devices and the opinion form regarding the web-based asthma&#xD;
      education program will be used. At the same time, COPD and asthma fatigue scale, drug&#xD;
      compliance reporting scale and Asthma Control Test (AKT) will be used.&#xD;

    <description>Medication Compliance Reporting Scale Participants are asked to indicate the frequency of the 5 statements in each of them.&#xD;
The scale is evaluated with a 5-point Likert type such that 5 = never, 4 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 2 = often and 1 = always.&#xD;
The total test score is obtained by summing the scores obtained from the items. The scores obtained from the scale range from 5 to 25. An increase in the obtained scores indicates compatibility, and a decrease in scores indicates incompatibility.</description>

    <measure>change from baseline in COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale (DAS) at week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale (DAS) The scale consists of 12 items, and a Likert type rating (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often) is used for its answers.&#xD;
In calculating the scale score, the first 10 questions correspond to never = 1 point, rarely = 2 points, sometimes = 3 points, often = 4 points, very often = 5 points, and in the 11th and 12th questions never = 5 points, rarely = 4 points. , sometimes = 3 points, often = 2 points, very often = 1.&#xD;
The total raw score is determined by adding the scores of each item and the raw scores are converted into a total scale score between 0-100. The higher the score obtained from the scale indicates that the fatigue level of the person is high.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Test (AKT); This scale consists of five Likert type and consists of five questions.&#xD;
The maximum score of this test is 25 and the minimum score is 5, while 25 points are &quot;full control&quot;, 20-24 points &quot;good control&quot; and a score of less than 19 is considered &quot;uncontrolled&quot;</description>
