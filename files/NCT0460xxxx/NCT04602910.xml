      The objective of this study was to develop a web-based, shared decision-making (SDM) tool for&#xD;
      helping patients with breast cancer make decisions on fertility preservation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: The pregnancy rate after cancer treatment for female survivors is lower than that&#xD;
      of the general population. Future infertility is a significant concern for patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer and is associated with a poor quality of life. Reproductive- age patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer have safe options when choosing the type of fertility preservation method to be&#xD;
      applied. Better information and support resources aimed at women to support their decision&#xD;
      making are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a web-based, shared decision-making&#xD;
      (SDM) tool for helping patients with breast cancer make decisions on fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We used the action research cycle of observing, reflecting, planning, and acting to&#xD;
      develop a web-based SDM tool. The following four phrases were applied: (1) Observe and&#xD;
      reflect: Collect and analyze the decision-making experiences of patients and health care&#xD;
      providers; (2) Reflect and plan: Apply the initial results to create a paper design and&#xD;
      modify the content; (3) Plan and act: Brainstorm about the web pages, and modify the content;&#xD;
      (4) Act and observe: Evaluate the effectiveness, and refine the website SDM. Interviews,&#xD;
      group meetings, and constant dialogue were conducted between the various participants at each&#xD;
      step. The effectiveness was evaluated using the Preparation for Decision-Making (prepDM)&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

    <description>We evaluated the effectiveness of the Preparation for Decision-Making (prepDM) scale. Both patients and health care providers were invited to answer 10 questions by responding with a 5-point Likert scale rating (from 1 to 5). A higher score indicated greater agree with the effect.</description>

    <description>Each part of the website page was assessed for comprehensibility and usability by patients. Health care providers were asked to assess the acceptability of the website. A 5-point Likert scale was used for patient and health care provider ratings for each item. If the score were less than 3, then we would modify the website content based on the user feedback from patients and health care providers</description>

    <description>Five major parts were developed with the use of the action research approach. The Introduction and Options (parts 1 and 2) describe the severity of the cancer treatment and infertility and the knowledge of fertility preservation, respectively. The SDM tool was designed as a step by step process (part 3) that involves the comparison of options, patient's values and preferences, their knowledge regarding infertility and options, and reaching a collective decision. The Resources (part 4) provide information on the hospitals that provide such services, and the References (part 5) list all the literature cited in the website. The results show the web-based SDM meets both the patients' and health providers' needs and helps reproductive-age patients with breast cancer make decisions on fertility preservation.</description>
