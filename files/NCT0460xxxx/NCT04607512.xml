  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of telaglenastat on cardiac repolarization&#xD;
      (relative to placebo) in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind (with respect to telaglenastat and&#xD;
      placebo), placebo- and positive controlled, 3 way crossover thorough QT (TQT) study in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Treatments A and B, subjects will receive the assigned treatment on Day 1 through the&#xD;
      morning of Day 4. In Treatment C, subjects will receive a single-dose administration of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin in the morning of Day 4. Cardiodynamic readings will be collected for 24 hours&#xD;
      on Days 1 and 4. Plasma PK samples will be collected prior to dosing (for Treatments A and B&#xD;
      or Hour 0 for Treatment C) and up to 24 hours on Days 1 and 4 of all treatments.&#xD;
