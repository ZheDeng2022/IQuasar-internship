      The Bone Zone trial is a prospective, multi-centre, double-blind, phase II, randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial evaluating the effect of denosumab or zoledronic acid compared to placebo on&#xD;
      change in bone mineral density over one year in women aged 50 years or older requiring&#xD;
      admission to intensive care for greater than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      450 women aged 50 years or older, admitted to intensive care for greater than 24 hours will&#xD;
      be recruited into the study from participating study centres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care patients face health issues that extend beyond their critical illness. A&#xD;
      specific area where critical illness may adversely affect the well-being of survivors is&#xD;
      increased bone turnover during critical illness, and accelerated bone loss in subsequent&#xD;
      years. Critical illness bone loss begins in the first days of critical illness, occurs in&#xD;
      both men and women, and is greatest in post-menopausal women. Loss of bone mineral density is&#xD;
      significantly greater at both the femur (-2+4.0% vs -0.7+1.1%, p=0.001) and spine (-2.9+4.1%&#xD;
      vs -0.2+1.1%, p&lt;0.001) in women in the year after critical illness compared to age-matched&#xD;
      controls. One year after critical illness, 80% of women aged 50-years or greater are&#xD;
      classified as osteoporotic or osteopaenic, compared to 71% of the approximately 3.7 million&#xD;
      Australian women aged 50 year or greater. This population is most likely to suffer the major&#xD;
      consequence of accelerated bone loss, fragility fracture, and the associated morbidity, loss&#xD;
      of quality of life, and economic cost. Older women who survive critical illness have a&#xD;
      significantly higher fragility fracture rate compared to community age-matched controls&#xD;
      (Intensive Care Unit 4.33 vs control 2.81 per 100 patient years, adj HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.5),&#xD;
      p=0.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone antiresorptive therapies are effective at reducing bone loss and decreasing fracture&#xD;
      risk in non-critically ill populations. Zoledronic acid and denosumab represent&#xD;
      antiresorptive agents with established efficacy in non-critically ill women, and are&#xD;
      potential target interventions able to be delivered during critical illness. Denosumab is a&#xD;
      human monoclonal antibody directed against Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Î’&#xD;
      ligand, a central stimulator of osteoclast activity, and is effective for prevention of&#xD;
      fractures and bone loss in osteoporosis and malignancy. Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate&#xD;
      class agent that binds to bone and suppresses bone resorption by entering osteoclasts and&#xD;
      inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, resulting in disruption of osteoclast&#xD;
      attachment to bone surface. In addition to skeletal effects, there are possible mortality&#xD;
      benefits associated with the use of antiresorptive medications in populations with increased&#xD;
      bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence to support routine, early use of&#xD;
      antiresorptive medications in critically ill women. The Bone Zone trial is a phase III&#xD;
      multi-centre randomised placebo-controlled trial of 450 women aged 50-years or greater&#xD;
      requiring intensive care admission for more than 2 calendar days, to determine the effect of&#xD;
      denosumab or zoledronic acid on the prevention of bone loss in the year after critical&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
