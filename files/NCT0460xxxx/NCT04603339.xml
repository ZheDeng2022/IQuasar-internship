  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm feasibility study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of delivering the&#xD;
      12-week ReStOre programme (aerobic and resistance physiotherapy led-exercise, 1:1 dietary&#xD;
      counselling and group education sessions) via telehealth to a cohort of upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility - Recruitment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion approx 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be determined by recruitment rate, the number of eligible participants who consent to participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility - adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (T0) to immediately after the program intervention (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will also be determined by adherence to the trial intervention, the number of prescribed intervention sessions completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility - acceptability of the intervention (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the program intervention (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will also be determined by the acceptability of the programme. Acceptability of the telehealth programme will be assessed by the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ).&#xD;
The Telehealth Usability scale is a 5 point likert scale where 1 = completely disagree, and 5 =fully agree, Higher ratings indicate better usability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility - acceptability of the intervention (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the trial i.e. From enrolment of the first participant until completion of the final participants post-intervention assessment (Time period of up to 12 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention will be further determined by a qualitative approach.Interviews will be carried out with participants post-intervention to gain their perspectives of the impact of the program on physical and mental well-being and the suitability of the programme to delivery via telehealth</description>
