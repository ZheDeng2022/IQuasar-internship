  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate if a hybrid semi-supervised remote exercise&#xD;
      training program can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life and physical fitness in&#xD;
      individuals with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and determine if this&#xD;
      program is more effective than current standard of care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To answer these questions, 60 individuals with POTS will be recruited to complete a&#xD;
      symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test with measures of cardiac output, autonomic&#xD;
      function testing, blood volume measurement, and QOL questionnaires at baseline and following&#xD;
      3-months of treatment. Thirty participants will be randomized to continue with the standard&#xD;
      of care which can include lower body and core strengthening, fluids, salt, medications and&#xD;
      sometimes exercise. The other thirty participants will be asked to complete at least three&#xD;
      exercise training sessions a week (progressing to 3hrs/wk of aerobic and 1hr/wk of strength&#xD;
      training) and receive eight supervised training sessions over the 3-month treatment period.&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with a polar heart rate monitor which will be linked to a&#xD;
      connected health application to allow patients to track any aerobic workout, ensure during a&#xD;
      session they are in the correct training zone, and allow the study team to remotely monitor&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
