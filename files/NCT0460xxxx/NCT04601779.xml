  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems and overweight often co-occur, they have their origin in early&#xD;
      childhood and new research evidence suggest a key role of cognitive, emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      regulation in the early developmental trajectories and points to the benefits of intervention&#xD;
      in infancy that builds on strategies of sensitive parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group behind this project has developed the PUF program (PUF: In Danish:&#xD;
      'Psykisk Udvikling og Funktion') to target infants' mental health and development within the&#xD;
      settings of community health nurses. Still, measures are lacking that address the infants&#xD;
      most vulnerable regarding the development and progression of mental health problems and&#xD;
      overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we develop and test a new intensified intervention to address major&#xD;
      cognitive and regulatory vulnerabilities identified at child age 9-10 months and adapted to&#xD;
      the settings of community health nurses. The intervention is created as an add-on to the&#xD;
      PUF-program, using an evidence-based method to promote sensitive parenting, the Video-based&#xD;
      Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting (VIPP). The new intervention VIPP-PUF comprises&#xD;
      six therapeutic sessions delivered by the community health nurse during home visits over a&#xD;
      three months period. The intervention builds on teaching the health nurses to promote&#xD;
      parents' sensitivity to meet the infants' cognitive and regulatory vulnerabilities, and it&#xD;
      takes in account the needs of psycho-socially disadvantaged families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Infant Health project is conducted in sixteen municipalities across Denmark. We use the&#xD;
      Intervention Mapping approach as the study frame and integrate the best practice of community&#xD;
      health nurses. The efficacy of the VIPP-PUF intervention is examined in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled step-wedge design, in which approximately 1.000 children are followed up to the&#xD;
      age of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VIPP-PUF intervention is hypothesized to reduce mental health problems at ages 24 months&#xD;
      among infants with high levels of cognitive and regulatory problems at age 9-10 months,&#xD;
      (primary outcome). Also, it is hypothesized that among children with high levels of cognitive&#xD;
      and regulatory vulnerabilities at age 9-10 months, adding the VIPP-PUF intervention to&#xD;
      treatment as usual at age 9-10 months, will reduce infants' cognitive and regulatory&#xD;
      problems; promote healthy weight development; reduce parents' experiences of stress; promote&#xD;
      sensitive parenting and promote parents' feeling of competence and relatedness.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Childhood mental health problems and overweight are highly prevalent, and they&#xD;
      have severe long-term prognoses regarding mental and physical health, social functioning, and&#xD;
      premature death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of child mental health problems have their origin within the first years of&#xD;
      living with increased risk in infants from families of psycho-social disadvantage, and in&#xD;
      infants with perinatal adversities and cognitive and psycho-motor difficulties. Problems of&#xD;
      eating, sleep, and emotional and behavioral regulation may predict mental health problems and&#xD;
      disorders and persistent dysregulation trajectories are associated with emotional- and&#xD;
      behavioral problems, eating problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.&#xD;
      Early parent-child relations and the quality of parenting has a key position in the risk&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of overweight is highly increased in children, who are overweight in infancy.&#xD;
      Psycho-social risk factors are similar to those of mental health problems, e.g families of&#xD;
      psycho-social disadvantage with risk mechanisms including gene-environment interaction,&#xD;
      maternal feeding pattern; and higher risk among obese parents to introduce high energy and&#xD;
      fat foods very early and having impaired responses to the infant's hunger and satiety cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health problems tend to precede the development of overweight in childhood. Potential&#xD;
      mechanisms include cognitive vulnerability of inhibitory control/reward, sensitivity and&#xD;
      sustained attention, leading to impulsive eating and difficulties in delaying gratification.&#xD;
      Infants' problems of emotional regulation and problems of maintaining an affective&#xD;
      homeostasis confronted with stress-full experiences may result in emotional eating&#xD;
      characterized by pathways of physiological stress responses and reward, in which appetite and&#xD;
      attraction to sweet and fatty foods is considered to develop through poor emotional&#xD;
      regulation and lower inhibitory control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of mental health problems and overweight has to start early and combine universal&#xD;
      strategies and targeted interventions to reduce risk exposures, optimize parenting and&#xD;
      promote child development and a healthy weight development. The combination of universal&#xD;
      approaches and specific intervention to target the most vulnerable children is the most&#xD;
      effective way to the reduce the population load of childhood mental health problems and&#xD;
      overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to optimize parenting of infants at risk of mental health problems and overweight&#xD;
      have to build on measures that promote parent's sensitivity, understanding and careful&#xD;
      handling of the child's regulatory, emotional or cognitive vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-visiting programs that are embedded in the general child health surveillance have unique&#xD;
      possibilities of reaching the entire infant population and integrate specified interventions&#xD;
      to infants and parents of particular needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general child health surveillance in Denmark includes scheduled home visits to all infant&#xD;
      families offered by community child health nurses, CHNs. The CHNs measure the child's weight&#xD;
      and overall health and development, and they give parents advice regarding the care of the&#xD;
      infant. In about 20% of infant families, the CHNs extend their services to target particular&#xD;
      problems and needs, e.g regarding problems of eating and sleep, or the parent-child relation.&#xD;
      Until recently, however, no standardized measures have been available to specifically address&#xD;
      infants at risk of mental health problems and overweight. We have previously explored the&#xD;
      possibilities of prevention within the municipality child health surveillance and identified&#xD;
      potential predictors and mediators of developmental psychopathology, and a window of&#xD;
      opportunity regarding intervention towards infants' cognitive and regulatory vulnerabilities&#xD;
      at child age 9-10 months. We have developed, validated and implemented a standardized measure&#xD;
      to help the CHNs to identify mental health vulnerabilities. By this measure, the CHNs&#xD;
      combines information from parents and her own observations during the home-visit to make a&#xD;
      final conclusion about the child's development and functioning within eight areas of child&#xD;
      mental health: sleep, feeding and eating, emotional regulation, motor development, attention&#xD;
      and concentration, curiosity and interests; contact and communication and language&#xD;
      development. Validation studies have shown that children who have three or more problems&#xD;
      within these areas have a significantly increased risk of mental health problems. The&#xD;
      PUF-program was developed as a basic approach to help CHNs to guide their actions to address&#xD;
      the problems identified at ages 9-10 months within the existing service settings. Still, the&#xD;
      PUF-program do not include specified intervention to infants with high level of cognitive,&#xD;
      regulatory and emotional problems, leaving these children behind with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing mental health problems and overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The study aims to develop and test an intervention to promote sensitive parenting of&#xD;
      infants with mental health vulnerabilities identified by CHNs at age 9-10 months and to be&#xD;
      feasible within the settings of the municipality child health surveillance. Parents'&#xD;
      resources are a particularly important regarding interventions to target child mental health&#xD;
      and healthy weight, and it is a specific aim of the study to address the needs of parents of&#xD;
      psycho-social adversities and how the intervention works for the most vulnerable families.&#xD;
      The overall aim is to examine the feasibility, fidelity, and the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention delivered to parents of infants with major cognitive, regulatory and emotional&#xD;
      problems with child mental health and weight development at child ages 18 and 24 months as&#xD;
      the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The development, implementation and evaluation of the intervention is guided by the&#xD;
      Intervention Mapping approach, guides for development of complex interventions from the UK&#xD;
      Medical Research Council and the RE-AIM-method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Infant Health Study includes four work-packages (WPs), the WP 1: Project planning and&#xD;
      management; WP 2: Creating the intervention; WP 3: The efficacy study; WP 4 the process&#xD;
      evaluation, including an evaluation of what works for the vulnerable families, and a Pilot&#xD;
      study prior to WP3 and WP 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is anchored in the settings of CHNs in a collaboration of municipalities who join a&#xD;
      validated clinical database and among those municipalities who have implemented the basic&#xD;
      PUF-program one year prior to study start. These municipalities are overall representative of&#xD;
      the Danish population regarding key background characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is located at the National Institute of Public Health; and study methods make use&#xD;
      of the particular opportunities of epidemiological research in Denmark due to a civil&#xD;
      registration system which follows all citizens are throughout life and the possibilities of&#xD;
      valid tracking of children, parents and background information from Danish population&#xD;
      registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The stepped wedge cluster randomized design is chosen because it is more feasible to&#xD;
      randomize at the municipality level as compared to the level of the individual child or CHN.&#xD;
      For practical reasons, all municipalities cannot be trained at the same time but have to be&#xD;
      split into three groups, and with the stepped wedge design, we utilize this and randomly&#xD;
      allocate the 16 participating municipalities to the time at which their health nurses have&#xD;
      been trained, and at which they start offering the intervention to families. Also, with the&#xD;
      stepped wedge design, spill over is reduced by the randomization of clusters as compared to&#xD;
      individual randomization, and interventions are introduced in a stepwise manner to all&#xD;
      participating clusters (municipalities in this case) which encourages participation for those&#xD;
      who would otherwise have been randomized to the control condition. Further, with the stepped&#xD;
      wedge design control families are recruited in the early phases of the trial, which enhances&#xD;
      the recruiting of a control group with the level of usual care offered at the beginning of&#xD;
      the trial. In the control period no participants receive intervention and sequential random&#xD;
      crossover to the intervention cannot be reversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization of municipalities, all children assessed to have high levels&#xD;
      of cognitive and regulatory problems at age 9-10 months will function as controls and receive&#xD;
      care as usual from Step 0 until the municipalities initiate the intervention in Step 1- 3,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTPLANNING AND MANAGEMENT (WP 1) A participatory planning group of the principal&#xD;
      investigators and the leading CHNs are part of the planning and management of the project. A&#xD;
      well-established collaboration with the leading CHNs from the participating municipalities&#xD;
      facilitates their function as primary municipality stakeholders in WP 2-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information from our close collaboration with the CHNs is currently updated in WP 1, and&#xD;
      taken into account when developing the intervention, and in the strategies necessary to&#xD;
      ensure fidelity and deliver valid results for the efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARING THE INTERVENTION (WP 2) The overall goal is to create an intervention to function&#xD;
      as an add-on to the basic PUF-program within the municipality settings in order to promote&#xD;
      sensitive parenting of infants with high levels of cognitive and regulatory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among measures to promote parenting of vulnerable infants, the Video-feedback Intervention to&#xD;
      Promote Positive Parenting, VIPP takes a strong position in being effective in the reduction&#xD;
      of child problems, also in families of psycho-social disadvantage, including maternal eating&#xD;
      problems. Research in effective obesity prevention in early childhood is scarce, but the&#xD;
      available evidence points to infancy dysregulation and parenting as potential targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a group of CHNs are educated in the original VIPP method to enable them to&#xD;
      contribute to the adaptation of the VIPP into the novel combined VIPP-PUF intervention.&#xD;
      Further, these CHNs participate in the pilot testing of the VIPP-PUF, and they function as&#xD;
      co-trainers and supervisors of the next generation of CHNs educated in the VIPP-PUF during&#xD;
      the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT All children in the population are offered home visits, and more than 85% attend&#xD;
      at the home visits at child age 9-10 months. Parents of children who have three or more&#xD;
      problems at the PUF assessment are informed about the study by the CHNs, and via written&#xD;
      folders and information on the study home page. If the parents agree to participate, they are&#xD;
      afterwards invited to participate by e-post or by letter. Parents make their final agreement&#xD;
      for participation by answering the web-based questionnaires at the study website. Parents who&#xD;
      have difficulties in completing the questionnaires are offered assistance from the CHN. All&#xD;
      participating parents get a gift certificate of about 27 euro after answering the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control phase of the study, the CHNs deliver their service and care as usual. In the&#xD;
      intervention phase, the CHN offers parents the VIPP-PUF-intervention.&#xD;
