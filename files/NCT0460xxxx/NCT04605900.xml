  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines the effectiveness of plantar orthoses and custom-made orthopedic&#xD;
      footwear in functional level and quality of life of persons with diabetes type 2 and diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy. This study is important due the loss of protective sensation, feet are&#xD;
      vulnerable to minor trauma caused by plantar pressure as well as mechanical and thermal&#xD;
      injuries. Thus, Plantar Orthoses become necessary to reduce PP and align the foot.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is known that footwear is the most frequent cause of diabetic foot injury,&#xD;
      since ulceration is frequently a consequence of the continuous trauma provoked by inadequate&#xD;
      footwear. For a higher efficacy in the treatment of the foot, it is also necessary to use&#xD;
      custom-made orthopedic footwear, indicated in the treatment of foot pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of studies that evaluate the impact of this treatment on clinical measures such as&#xD;
      quality of life and functional level, led to the development of this study, comparing a&#xD;
      standard treatment (standard footwear and plantar orthoses) with an optimal treatment&#xD;
      suggested in diabetic foot guidelines (therapeutic footwear and plantar orthoses).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial includes 2 parallel intervention groups with a pre- and post-test&#xD;
      analysis. In the standard footwear (SF) group, plantar orthoses, standard footwear and&#xD;
      education on foot self-care were applied and in the orthopedic footwear (OF) group the same&#xD;
      intervention was applied, but with orthopedic footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intervention groups were evaluated at two different time points, with the pre-test&#xD;
      taking place at the beginning of the study (T0 - Baseline) and the post-test taking place 4&#xD;
      months after the application of the treatment (T4). In the middle of the study, at two months&#xD;
      (T2) a questionnaire was applied in order to understand the adherence and the perception of&#xD;
      individuals about the intervention applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was made with the Michigan Neuropathy&#xD;
      Screening Instrument (MNSI) and the description of the sample with an evaluation&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FL was evaluated through the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), physical tests and&#xD;
      the postural, static and dynamic barometric assessment. QoL was assessed with SF-36 and the&#xD;
      adherence and satisfaction with a questionnaire created ad hoc.&#xD;
