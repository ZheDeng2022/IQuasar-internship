  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a clinical trial to study the performance of a newly developed&#xD;
      high strength ceramic material for crowns. The ceramic has been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      patient treatment. A computer technique will be used to fabricate the crowns in a single&#xD;
      appointment without the need for a temporary crown or second appointment. Two adhesive resin&#xD;
      cement techniques will be used to hold the crown to the tooth and they will be evaluated for&#xD;
      creating sensitivity to the tooth. The purpose of the study is to measure how well the high&#xD;
      strength crowns function over an extended period of time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recently introduced high strength, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) ceramic&#xD;
      material for full contour CAD/CAM crowns is reported to offer a more translucent and esthetic&#xD;
      high strength crown in a more efficient oven firing process. Celtra Quatro (Dentsply Sirona)&#xD;
      is submitted to a high temperature matrix firing cycle in the SpeedFire oven (Dentsply&#xD;
      Sirona) to achieve high strength in less than 5 minutes following milling. It has a reported&#xD;
      flexural strength of 650 MPa compared to 450 MPa for lithium disilicate glass ceramic and &gt;&#xD;
      900 MPa for 3mol% full contour zirconia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most glass ceramic materials have a recommended material thickness of 1.5 mm to maximize the&#xD;
      strength potential of the material. Occlusal reduction resulting in a crown thickness of 1.0&#xD;
      mm, equitable to the recommendation for full contour zirconia crowns, may be considered&#xD;
      sufficient to maintain the desired high strength attained by the ZLS material. This would&#xD;
      also result in a more conservative tooth preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another potential advantage of high strength ZLS crowns to many clinicians is that they may&#xD;
      be inherently strong enough to allow for conventional cementation. However, for less&#xD;
      retentive preparations, it may also be possible to adhesively bond the crowns through the use&#xD;
      of adhesive resin cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the intent of this investigation to evaluate the clinical application and performance&#xD;
      of the new high strength, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate material (Celtra Quatro) for&#xD;
      CAD/CAM-generated chair-side crown applications. Patients will be recruited to have 60 Celtra&#xD;
      Quatro crowns prepared and delivered during a single dental appointment using a chairside&#xD;
      CAD/CAM system (CEREC/Dentsply Sirona). The crowns will be recalled at 6 months and then&#xD;
      yearly for 5 years to evaluate long-term outcomes of the crowns.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Crown failure</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Restoration failure is scored by visual loss of the crown from the tooth requiring replacement of the study crown with a new crown at any time between delivery and five years.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Crown loss of retention</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of retention is measured as visual detachment or dislodgment of the crown from the tooth without fracture of the crown requiring recementation of the crown at any time between delivery and five years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tooth sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient described sensitivity on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means absence of sensitivity (pain) and four means severe discomfort noted routinely with cold or pressure stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Margin staining</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Margin staining is categorized based on modified US Public Health Service criteria using a four point scale where 1 is no staining and 4 is penetrating stain involving more than 50% of the margin.</description>
