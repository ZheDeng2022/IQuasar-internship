    <textblock>
      The expansion study is a Phase I, multicenter, open label feasibility trial to characterize&#xD;
      the pharmacologic activity of IV CPX-POM in bladder tumor tissues obtained from patients with&#xD;
      MIBC (Stage ≥T2, N0-N1, M0) who will be scheduled for RC with bilateral (standard or&#xD;
      extended) pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose Escalation study was a Phase I, multicenter, open label, dose escalation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the DLTs and MTD and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-POM&#xD;
      administered IV in patients with any histologically- or cytologically-confirmed solid tumor&#xD;
      type and was completed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expansion cohort of this study will be conducted at up to 3 study sites. It will be an&#xD;
      open-label feasibility trial to characterize the pharmacologic activity of IV CPX-POM in&#xD;
      bladder tumor tissues obtained from patients with MIBC (Stage ≥T2, N0-N1,M0) who will be&#xD;
      scheduled for RC with bilateral (standard or extended) pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).&#xD;
      Approximately half of the patients enrolled will be cisplatin eligible and half will be&#xD;
      chemotherapy eligible and scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine +&#xD;
      cisplatin. Neoadjuvant treatment with CPX-POM, whether alone or in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine +cisplatin, will start within 8 weeks of transurethral resection of the bladder&#xD;
      tumor (TURBT) that showed muscularis propria invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled. Patients who are cisplatin eligible will be&#xD;
      treated with two 21-day treatment cycles of CPX-POM (Cycle 1, Days 1-5 treatment, rest days&#xD;
      6-21; Cycle 2, Days 22-26 treatment, rest days 27-43) before a planned RC.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-eligible patients who are scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (gemcitabine + cisplatin in three 21-day treatment cycles) will be treated in addition with&#xD;
      three 21-day treatment cycles of CPX-POM (Cycle 1, Days 1-5 treatment, rest days 6-21; Cycle&#xD;
      2, Days 22-26 treatment, rest days 27-42; Cycle 3, Days 43-47, rest days 48-63), i.e.&#xD;
      concurrently with the prescribed chemotherapy. The cisplatin + gemcitabine dosing regimen for&#xD;
      chemotherapy-eligible patients in the Expansion Cohort will be administered per the&#xD;
      institution's standard of care. After each infusion of CPX-POM, patients will remain in the&#xD;
      clinic for at least a 1-hour observation period. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, single blood and clean&#xD;
      catch urine samples will be collected prior to the first CPX-POM infusion.&#xD;
