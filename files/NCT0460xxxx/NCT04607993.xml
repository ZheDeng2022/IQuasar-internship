    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of conventional lying position and prone&#xD;
      position ventilation on infants with acute lung injury after surgery for congenital heart&#xD;
      disease. To explore the effectiveness and feasibility of prone position ventilation for&#xD;
      children with acute lung injury after congenital heart disease surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prone position has been used to treat severe hypoxemia in patients with acute respiration&#xD;
      dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) since the 1970s, and it has significant effectiveness in&#xD;
      improving gas exchange. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication after congenital&#xD;
      heart disease. The clinical manifestation is refractory hypoxemia. At present, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation is one of the main methods for the treatment of acute lung injury-induced&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome. Prone position ventilation refers to placing the patient in&#xD;
      the prone position during mechanical ventilation to expand the lungs in the atelectasis area&#xD;
      and improve the ratio of lung ventilation and perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone position ventilation technology as an important lung protection ventilation strategy&#xD;
      has been widely used clinically at home and abroad. Compared with adults, children are more&#xD;
      convenient and easy to implement. Due to the exact mechanism of improving oxygenation&#xD;
      function, the current domestic and foreign development of pediatric prone ventilation&#xD;
      technology is mainly focused on children with ARDS. There are few studies on high-quality&#xD;
      application effects after pediatric cardiac surgery, and almost no research has been carried&#xD;
      out, especially for pediatric heart The indications for the implementation of the prone&#xD;
      position after the disease surgery, the specific standardized process including the position&#xD;
      angle, the prone duration plan, etc. all need to be studied. Therefore, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need to develop prone position ventilation technology for critically ill children with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease after surgery to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and&#xD;
      shorten the time of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

    <description>Inform the children's family members of the purpose and method of prone position ventilation&#xD;
Assess the fixation of various catheters&#xD;
Suspend feeding before placing prone position&#xD;
Confirm the time to start prone position ventilation under the joint assessment of medical staff&#xD;
Place the child in a prone position with the participation of researchers, doctors and nursing staff, with the child's head tilted to one side to avoid damage to the eyes and nose due to compression, and the arms are bent upward to form a &quot;W&quot; . Bend both lower limbs downward to form an &quot;M&quot; shape, and use a soft pillow cushion to measure the knee joints to avoid compression&#xD;
The whole process ensures the smooth fixation of tracheal intubation and various catheters&#xD;
Proper sedation during prone position ventilation to achieve good human-machine synchronization&#xD;
At least 6-8 hours in prone position every day</description>
