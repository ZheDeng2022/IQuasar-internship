      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and staging of&#xD;
      liver fibrosis. Activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is a key link in the&#xD;
      pathophysiological development of liver fibrosis. In human liver tissue, fibroblast&#xD;
      activation protein (FAP) was only expressed in active HSCs and fibroblasts, but not in static&#xD;
      HSCs. Therefore, FAP has become an excellent target for diagnosis and treatment of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis. Recently, radionuclide-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) as a&#xD;
      new novel positron tracer has shown to be effective to detect various cancers. In this&#xD;
      prospective study, the investigators will use the most advanced imaging equipments,&#xD;
      integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with gallium-68 (68Ga) -FAPI to image patients with or&#xD;
      suspected of liver fibrosis, the aim is to explore the value of 68Ga-FAPI hybrid PET/MR and&#xD;
      PET/CT in liver fibrosis.&#xD;

      Liver fibrosis is a key step in the development of various chronic liver diseases (viral&#xD;
      hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver&#xD;
      disease, etc.) to cirrhosis and an important link that affects the prognosis of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease. Fibrosis is histologically reversible, and early liver fibrosis can still be&#xD;
      reversed to restore liver tissue to normal. However, due to the lack of specific initial&#xD;
      symptoms and accurate non-invasive diagnostic methods, the onset of liver fibrosis is&#xD;
      insidious. Most patients have developed liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma when&#xD;
      they are diagnosed, and some even require liver transplantation. If liver fibrosis can be&#xD;
      diagnosed accurately and treated early, the prognosis of chronic liver disease can be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
