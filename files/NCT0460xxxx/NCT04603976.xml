      This study aims to investigate the effect of erenumab on efficacy outcomes, tolerability&#xD;
      outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes in individuals with migraine. Furthermore, the study&#xD;
      aims to identify clinical predictors of erenumab response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder and a leading cause of years lived with&#xD;
      disability worldwide. As of recent, therapies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (e.g.&#xD;
      erenumab) have been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. This study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of erenumab on efficacy outcomes, tolerability outcomes, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes in individuals with migraine. Furthermore, the study aims to&#xD;
      identify clinical predictors of erenumab response.&#xD;
