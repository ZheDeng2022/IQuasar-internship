  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced small cell ovarian carcinomas are rare and have a very poor prognosis affecting a&#xD;
      young population. The objective of this study is to increase the efficacy of the initial&#xD;
      chemotherapy by providing immunotherapy and to be able to offer to more patients the&#xD;
      possibility of benefiting from an intensification of chemotherapy, which is a major&#xD;
      prognostic factor in this population.&#xD;
