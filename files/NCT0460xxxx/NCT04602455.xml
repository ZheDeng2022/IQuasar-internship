      This quantitative study assesses the baseline loneliness scores in all the high school&#xD;
      students in the US. Assessments at baseline will include the UCLA loneliness scale. The&#xD;
      Google form questionnaire will ask the high schoolers for their email address and their&#xD;
      parent's email address (if they are under 18). The form will also include a question&#xD;
      eliciting interest in participation in the 4-weeks Heartfulness program. The program will&#xD;
      include tools that promote a heart-based nurturing environment focusing on relaxation,&#xD;
      positivity, and developing growth mindsets.&#xD;
