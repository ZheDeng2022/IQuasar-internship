  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well pamiparib and temozolomide work in treating&#xD;
      patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell (kidney) cancer. Poly adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARPs) are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors, such as pamiparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair&#xD;
      themselves, and they may stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pamiparib and temozolomide may&#xD;
      help treat patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate response rate of pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival with pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety (adverse events [AE's]) with pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the association between plasma and tumor 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), fumarate,&#xD;
      and succinate levels and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To analyze the association of the genomic mutational signature (by whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing) of the tumor to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 36 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months.&#xD;
