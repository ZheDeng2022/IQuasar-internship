      Phase II, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label trial of atezolizumab in&#xD;
      combination of split-doses of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aurea trial aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab plus split-dose&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) for the first-line setting, in patients with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed advanced (locally advanced and metastatic) urothelial cancer in terms of overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include: efficacy (clinical benefit rate, duration of response, time to&#xD;
      response, overall survival and progression-free survival); safety (frequency and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0) and exploratory endpoints ( correlation of&#xD;
      prognostic biomarkers/factors with efficacy and relationship between the expression of PD-L1&#xD;
      and microbiome with ORR and PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 66 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment schedule is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 mg/m2 by intravenous (IV) infusion on D1 of each 21-day&#xD;
      cycle up to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or absence of clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on D1 and 1000 mg/m2 IV on D8 of each 21-day cycle plus Cisplatin&#xD;
      70 mg/m2 by IV on split-dose schedule of 35 mg/m2 on day 1 (D1) and 35 mg/m2 on day 8 (D8)&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of trials combining checkpoint inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are eagerly awaited. The combination of split cisplatin with&#xD;
      atezolizumab is a feasible treatment that may provide better outcomes than carboplatin/based&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the IMvigor130, 52% of patients considered cisplatin eligible at the entry of the study&#xD;
      were treated with carboplatin. Subanalysis presented at European Society of Medical Oncology&#xD;
      (ESMO) 2019 (Grande E, et al. 2019) has also shown a longer median OS are achieved with&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy combined with atezolizumab (21.7 months) when compared to the&#xD;
      carboplatin-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab (14.2 months), with similar findings when it&#xD;
      comes to PFS 8.8 months with cisplatin/gemcitabine/atezolizumab vs 7.1 months&#xD;
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reasonable strategy may be the use of split cisplatin with atezolizumab to increase the&#xD;
      number of patients receiving cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AUREA study is a multicenter, open labelled, single arm, multicohort Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial of of atezolizumab in combination of split-dose cisplatin plus gemcitabine in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (additional details on the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria of the study are found in section 6 of this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design includes screening phase, combined treatment initial phase, monotherapy treatment&#xD;
      phase, follow-up phase and translational research with biopsies, blood samples and faecal&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose scheme includes the initial dose of atezolizumab (1200 mg) intravenously&#xD;
      administered every 21 days (one cycle) up to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      absence of clinical benefit. Dose adjustment or dose reductions of atezolizumab are not&#xD;
      expected. AUREA is an Investigator Initiated Study, the Sponsor will supply Atezolizumab for&#xD;
      up to 24 months of treatment for each patient. For those patients in which the PI considers&#xD;
      that the best option for the patient is continuing atezolizumab for more than 24 months,&#xD;
      available commercial Site supplies should be used, after managed local administrative&#xD;
      regulation. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on D1 and 1000 mg/m2 IV on D8 of each 21-day cycle plus&#xD;
      Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 by IV on split-dose schedule of 35 mg/m2 on day 1 (D1) and 35 mg/m2 on day&#xD;
      8 (D8) for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will begin as soon as possible after signing the informed consent. Before&#xD;
      each treatment administration chemotherapy/atezolizumab administration laboratory, medical&#xD;
      consulting and other determinations will be performed to ensure that treatment can be safely&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT Scan or MRI will be performed at baseline, on week 9, week 18 and then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      (q12w) ± 1w until objective disease progression as per PI's criteria or death (whichever&#xD;
      comes first). Blood samples for biomarkers studies should be collected before administration&#xD;
      of cycle 4 and at the time of Progression Disease (PD) (end of treatment if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with progression reported as per RECIST criteria at week 9, continuity of&#xD;
      treatment with atezolizumab should be evaluated by the PI of each site as per clinical&#xD;
      benefit criteria.&#xD;
