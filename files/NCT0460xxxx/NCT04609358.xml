      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the implementation of an&#xD;
      algorithm for enteral nutrition support compared with usual standard practice in children&#xD;
      with malnutrition status with congenital heart disease&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many developing countries, pediatric cardiac programs are not fully established, and&#xD;
      nutrition support algorithm is lack. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of the implementation of an algorithm for enteral nutrition support compared with&#xD;
      usual standard practice in children with malnutrition status with congenital heart disease.&#xD;
      The usual standard practice for feeding often interrupted by retention in the gut and then&#xD;
      choose the parenteral nutrition support especially in the patients with unstable hemodynamic&#xD;
      status. Actually tiny and continuous feeding would improve the gut function and reach the&#xD;
      adequate energy supply.&#xD;
