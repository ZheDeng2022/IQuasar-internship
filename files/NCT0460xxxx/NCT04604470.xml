  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial-specific (NCT03705403) decision aid (tPDA) for stage IV NSCLC patients that&#xD;
      might want to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to investigate if a tPDA would be (significantly) helpful for these patients in&#xD;
      making a decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ImmunoSABR has a complex study design, we expect that the patients get a better overview of&#xD;
      the trial via the tPDA because you can bring multiple tools together. (text, video,&#xD;
      questions, pictures, timelines, etc.)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A lung cancer patient might want to take part in the ImmunoSABR phase 2 trial (NCT03705403).&#xD;
      Before they can decide, it is important that the patients understand why the research is&#xD;
      being done and what it would involve for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tPDA will give information about this trial via text, small movies, quiz and&#xD;
      preferences. In the end, the patient will receive an overview of their choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description ImmunoSABR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSABR will include 126 patients. In this single-stage controlled randomised open-label&#xD;
      phase II trial, we aim to demonstrate an absolute increase in progression-free survival&#xD;
      (primary endpoint). PFS will be determined as the time between randomisation and disease&#xD;
      progression, according to RECIST 1.1, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive&#xD;
      and progression-free. Patients will be randomized between control (no immunocytokine) and&#xD;
      experimental arms (with immunocytokine L19-IL2) in a 1:1 ratio. The accrual period will be 29&#xD;
      months (or 2.41 years), and the minimum follow-up will be 18 months (or 1.5 years), making&#xD;
      the total study duration 47 months. Comparison between control and experimental arms will be&#xD;
      made using the Log-Rank statistic. This test for superiority will be one-sided with the&#xD;
      desired type I error of 0.10 and power of 0.90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the trial will be randomised into the control arm (C-arm) or&#xD;
      experimental arm (E-arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-arm: Standard of Care (SOC) according to the local and national guidelines: (wait and see&#xD;
      or surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or standard (symptomatic) radiotherapy and/or SABR,&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-arm: SABR (oligometastatic disease) or radiotherapy (diffuse disease) + L19-IL2 up to 6&#xD;
      cycles (+ aPD(L)1 if SOC) The expected 1.5-year PFS is 15% in the C-arm and 35% in the E-arm.&#xD;
      A sample size of 116 patients (58 patients per treatment arm) is needed to show this&#xD;
      difference of 20% in PFS, using a logrank test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and power of&#xD;
      85%. Patients will be evenly divided over the two arms. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, a&#xD;
      total of 126 patients (63 per arm) need to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The main objective of the trial is to test if the activity of the&#xD;
      combination of (SAB)R and L19-IL2 in patients with metastatic NSCLC will result in improved&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the PFS of the patient cohort, at 5 years after randomisation. Assessment of&#xD;
      the overall survival of the patient cohort, at 5 years after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the toxicity of this treatment schedule; To assess Quality of Life (QoL); To assess&#xD;
      the occurrence of an Out of Field Radio-Immune (OFRI) response / abscopal effect using&#xD;
      imaging; To assess the occurrence of an In Field Radio-Immune (IFRI) response using imaging;&#xD;
      To perform correlative biomarker studies related to treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative biomarker studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour tissue: e.g EDB expression, non-synonymous mutations, immune monitoring; Blood: e.g.&#xD;
      EDB expression, cfDNA, and immune monitoring; Radiomics on CT and if available MRI; Faeces:&#xD;
      diversity in microbiota. iRECIST Tumour grow kinetics&#xD;

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histological confirmed limited metastatic adult NSCLC patients, regardless of the PD-L1&#xD;
        status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Maximum of 10 metastatic lesions, maximum two brain lesion with a total cumulative diameter&#xD;
        of 5cm is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        SOC baseline imaging e.g MRI and/or PET-CT and CT-brain or MRI brain and/or CT-scan with at&#xD;
        least covering thorax-upper abdomen-brain, within 6 weeks prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a patient has unclear lesions in the liver or brain an MRI would be advised following&#xD;
        the ESMO guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        o In patients with 2 lung tumours, it can be unclear if the patient has 2 concurrent&#xD;
        primary tumours or a primary lung tumour with 1 metastasis. In this case, the local&#xD;
        multidisciplinary tumour board will decide whether the patient has an M1 disease or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Previous treatment: Prior cancer treatments are allowed but must be discontinued for at&#xD;
        least 4 weeks before randomisation. In case of maintenance chemotherapy, this therapy will&#xD;
        only be started after the end of the L19-IL2 treatment or only in case of Anti-PD(L)1&#xD;
        treatment, during L19-IL2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age of 18 years or older. WHO performance status 0-1; Adequate bone marrow function,&#xD;

        already actively participating in another study. Patients who need simultaneous radiation&#xD;
        on the primary tumour and metastatic lesion(s). For these patients it might be an option to&#xD;
        treat the primary tumour first although this is not mandatory for this study. There must be&#xD;
        minimal four weeks between last treatment and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is not allowed, although it is accepted when given at least&#xD;
        4 weeks prior to randomisation or after the treatment period. Patients with stable brain&#xD;
        metastases are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous radiotherapy to an area that would be re-treated by (SAB)R, resulting in overlap&#xD;
        of the high dose areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Maintenance therapy with Anti-PD(L)1 treatment combined with chemotherapy is not allowed&#xD;
        during treatment ((SAB)R and L19-IL2 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other active malignancy or malignancy within the last 2 years (except localised skin&#xD;
        basal/squamous cell carcinoma, non-muscle invasive carcinoma of the bladder or in situ&#xD;
        carcinoma from any site).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concomitantly administered glucocorticoids may decrease the activity of IL2 and therefore&#xD;
        should be avoided. However, patients who develop life-threatening signs or symptoms may be&#xD;
        treated with dexamethasone until toxicity resolves or reduces to an acceptable level&#xD;
        (generally grade 1 and 2, however must be based at the research physician's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergy to intravenously administered proteins/peptides/antibodies/ radiographic&#xD;
        contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Systemic treatment with either corticosteroid (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or&#xD;
        Interferon alpha or immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to randomisation.&#xD;
        Topical or inhalation steroids are allowed. If a patient needs to take unexpectedly&#xD;
        immunosuppressive medication during the trial, it will be allowed but decreasing the dose&#xD;
        as soon as possible is strongly advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior history of organ transplant, including autologous stem cell transplant. Acute or&#xD;
        sub-acute coronary syndromes within the last year, acute inflammatory heart disease, heart&#xD;
        insufficiency NYHA &gt; 2, or irreversible cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A known impaired cardiac function defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50&#xD;
        % (or below the study site's lower limit of normal) as measured by MUGA or ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled hypertensive disease; (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 or diastolic blood&#xD;
        pressure (DBP) ≥100 mm Hg during two measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History or evidence of active autoimmune disease. Severe diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
        (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside the tumour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major trauma, including oncologic surgery, but excluding smaller procedures like the&#xD;
        placement of porth-à-cath or surgical biopsy, within 4 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
        (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside a tumour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any underlying mental, medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator will make administration of study drug hazardous or hinder the interpretation&#xD;
        of study results. Unstable or serious concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy or breast feeding; it is well known that ED-B, the target of both L19IL2, is&#xD;
        expressed in a variety of fetal tissues. Furthermore, anti-PD(L)1 treatment may increase&#xD;
        the risk of immune-mediated disorders. Therefore, it will be contra-indicated for pregnant&#xD;
        or lactating women.&#xD;
