  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics are commonly used intravenous anesthetics in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Remimazolam is a new benzodiazepine with the characteristics of rapid onset, short&#xD;
      maintenance and recovery time, no accumulation, metabolism independent of liver and kidney&#xD;
      function, and no serious side effects, which has a good prospect for clinical application.&#xD;
      Now we will study the emotional response caused by remimazolam during induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia and the postoperative recovery indicators, in order to further understand the&#xD;
      clinical application of remimazolam.&#xD;
