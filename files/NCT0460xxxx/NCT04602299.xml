    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, interventional study aims to include 2000 gastroscopic&#xD;
      procedures and investigate the relationship between procedure time and lesion detection rate&#xD;
      in tertiary endoscopic centers in China. At the first stage, the researchers observe the&#xD;
      actual procedure time of gastroscopies without affecting the natural behavior of&#xD;
      endoscopists. At the second stage, a minimal time limit will be set for each procedure based&#xD;
      on the observational results of the first stage. The primary study outcome is focal lesion&#xD;
      detection rate. Secondary outcomes include detection rate of early upper GI cancer, biopsy&#xD;
      rate and adverse event rate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      China is a country with a heavy burden of gastric cancer and esophageal cancer. In 2015, the&#xD;
      incidence/mortality of gastric cancer and esophageal cancer in China were 680000/500000 and&#xD;
      220000/200000, respectively. Gastroscopy is the most important means to detect early cancer&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal tract. However, due to various factors, the miss rate of clinical&#xD;
      significant lesions by gastroscopy is innegligible. Our previous research results showed that&#xD;
      the detection rate of early gastric cancer and early esophageal cancer in China was only&#xD;
      about 15%. This study aims to include 2000 gastroscopic procedures and investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between procedure time and lesion detection rate in tertiary endoscopic centers&#xD;
      in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first stage, the researchers observe the actual procedure time of gastroscopies&#xD;
      without affecting the natural behavior of endoscopists. Then, researchers collect the data&#xD;
      (including focal lesion detection rate, procedure time, detection rate of early upper GI&#xD;
      cancer, biopsy rate and adverse event rate) and analyze the minimal procedure time. At the&#xD;
      second stage, a minimal time limit will be set for each procedure. Every stage last two&#xD;
      months, and potential correlations between lesion detection rate and procedure time will be&#xD;
      investigated through subsequent statistical analysis.&#xD;
