    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the influence of sleep apnea on clinical and radiological features&#xD;
      of MS. Sleep apnea is associated with hypoxemia during sleep, which we believe is detrimental&#xD;
      to MS. We will examine clinical data (MRI, lab results, medical history, labs, and sleep&#xD;
      studies) of Dr. Sloane's MS patients. This will allow us to study correlations between MRI,&#xD;
      clinical data, lab studies and sleep studies. We are specifically interested in the type of&#xD;
      sleep apnea associated with MS, and whether MRI or clinical metrics of MS severity correlate&#xD;
      with presence or absence of sleep apnea.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating neurologic disease&#xD;
      associated with significant disability. Many pathological mechanisms are believed to drive&#xD;
      MS, including inflammation. However, the mechanism behind progression, the major driver of&#xD;
      disability in MS, is thought to be distinctly different. With progression, neurodegeneration&#xD;
      and loss of neurons/axons appears to be primarily responsible. A theory of &quot;virtual hypoxia&quot;&#xD;
      has been theorized, in that inflammation and demyelination cause neurons and axons to work&#xD;
      harder, utilizing more energy. The overuse of neuron/axon energy makes it more likely that&#xD;
      there are periods of low/absent energy availability, which drives neuron/axon degeneration&#xD;
      and progression in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that MS is associated with sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&#xD;
      prevalence in MS patients is approximately 58%. Sleep apnea is a disorder where lower blood&#xD;
      oxygenation occurs during sleep. Since it is probable that low blood oxygenation would&#xD;
      contribute to neuron/axon injury, we think it is possible MS patients with sleep apnea have&#xD;
      worse neurological outcomes (clinically and radiographically).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also anticipate that testing can show an effect on neuron/axon injury as well as&#xD;
      inflammation. In addition to MRI changes that correlate with these changes, there are blood&#xD;
      markers of neurodegeneration and inflammation including neurofilament-light (NFL) and glial&#xD;
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), now available for blood testing commercially. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that elevations in such markers may be associated with sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study MS patients with and without sleep apnea by reviewing clinical records of&#xD;
      MS clinic patients. This study will enable a first approximation of the prevalence of sleep&#xD;
      apnea in MS as well as associated features of the comorbidity. Please note any assessment of&#xD;
      prevalence from medical record review is only an approximation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would also like to conduct a Home Sleep Test sub-study using an at home polysomnagraphy&#xD;
      device to help determine an accurate prevalence rate of sleep apnea in the MS population, We&#xD;
      will also collect patient questionnaires to gain qualitative data on fatigue, sleepiness,&#xD;
      sleep quality, restless leg syndrome risk, pain, sleep apnea risk, depression, and anxiety.&#xD;
      Lastly, we would also like to collect blood samples to study markers of neurodegeneration and&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B3. DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL A. Study Design - Overview, Methods, Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis will be the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for this study. As patients come to clinic for their routine clinical care&#xD;
      visits, we will identify presence of MS. During these visits we will also identify through&#xD;
      their medical records those who are pre- treatment for OSA with CPAP (Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure) machine and those who are currently on this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will identify approximately 400 people will take part in this study at Beth Israel&#xD;
      Deaconess Medical Center. Approximately 200 people each will take part in this study at UMass&#xD;
      Medical Center MS Center and at Lahey MS Center. A total of 800 people will take part in this&#xD;
      study at all study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Record Review We will collect retrospective data from the patient's medical record&#xD;
      including date of birth and demographic data. We will also collect past medical history&#xD;
      including medical conditions, surgical history, family history, social history, medications,&#xD;
      allergies, as well as the results from prior neurological exams, diagnostic tests, MRIs,&#xD;
      previous lab work, and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Information Collection Clinical information from routine clinical care visits will&#xD;
      be collected including medical history, surgical history, family history, social history,&#xD;
      medications, and allergies. We will also collect other information including vital signs,&#xD;
      results from diagnostic tests including lab work and MRIs, neurological exams, neurological&#xD;
      and physical functioning assessments on their level of disability, cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      hand eye coordination, vision, and walking ability,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires Questionnaires will be used to assess sleep quality and habits, urinary&#xD;
      habits, risk of sleep apnea, fatigue levels, insomnia levels, risk of restless leg syndrome,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and pain levels. They will take approximately 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Measurements. We will measure neck size since this is a risk factor for sleep apnea. We&#xD;
      will measure height and weight to calculate BMI since obesity is a risk factor for sleep&#xD;
      apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sample Collection Blood will be taken at their screening clinical care visit, at month&#xD;
      6, and month 12. The number of samples and the amount of blood collected will vary at each&#xD;
      visit but will not exceed 5ml per visit. These samples will be taken for measuring markers of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration and inflammation including neurofilament-light (NFL) and glial fibrillary&#xD;
      acidic protein (GFAP). Note that at any time during the study, additional blood samples may&#xD;
      have to be taken to assess safety or repeat a test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified blood samples will be sent to Quanterix at 113 Hartwell Ave Lexington, Ma 02421&#xD;
      for detection of biomarkers of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Samples will be labeled&#xD;
      with subject ID number only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Sleep Test We will then have subjects undergo a home sleep test using The Home Sleep&#xD;
      Test. The Home Sleep Test (HST) is a device that has an oximeter, a string that goes around&#xD;
      the chest to record breaths. A wrist oximeter is a lightweight device that has a wrist band&#xD;
      that has sensor to measure oxygen levels in the blood. The HST device also has a lightweight&#xD;
      tube which on one end splits into two prongs which are placed in the nostrils for measuring&#xD;
      air movement. Within one month of their screening visit, subjects will wear the wrist&#xD;
      oximeter and the HST device overnight while subjects sleep and remove them upon waking in the&#xD;
      morning. Subjects will only do this once. Subjects then either return the device to the&#xD;
      clinic in person or mail the device back using pre-addressed and pre-paid packaging within&#xD;
      one week of completing the test.&#xD;

      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Data will be analyzed continually over the course of this study. Once HST data is collected&#xD;
      we will determine sleep apnea prevalence and severity. We will correlate this with&#xD;
      questionnaire findings as well as HST metrics, clinical metrics of MS disease&#xD;
      activity/disability. We will also assess blood and MRI testing on an ongoing basis in a&#xD;
      similar manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Activities as Coordinating Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinating site will train the other involved sites in accordance with the protocol.&#xD;
      All sites will have a copy of our IRB approved protocol. We will communicate with the other&#xD;
      sites on an as needed basis regarding updates to the protocol or any other changes to the&#xD;
      study. Any retraining will be performed if requested. The coordinating site will provide&#xD;
      questionnaires, checklists, and materials related to completion of the proposed work. The&#xD;
      coordinating site will disseminate funds as required from any grant associated with this&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinating site will be in charge of collecting and storing all data for the proposed&#xD;
      study. This data includes clinical and demographic data as well as laboratory and&#xD;
      radiological data. The coordinating site will record any deviations and adverse events&#xD;
      related to the protocol. The principle investigator will oversee all unanticipated problems,&#xD;
      adverse events, noncompliance, and new information about the study will be report them to the&#xD;
      other sites immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Statistical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Size Justification: All of Dr. Sloane's current MS patients are eligible to be&#xD;
           screened for this study. The sample size will be 400 patients from Beth Israel&#xD;
           Deaconness Medical center, 200 from Lahey Clinic, and 200 from UMASS for 800 patients&#xD;
           total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Analysis: All data will be collected and stored using Microsoft Excel on a secure&#xD;
           computer. Data analysis will be conducted by utilizing Harvard Catalyst biostatistician&#xD;
           services. Statistical analyses used will be up to the discretion of the biostatistician&#xD;
           and team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Subject Selection We will use electronic medical records from Dr. Sloane's patients to&#xD;
      identify patients with MS and distinguish those who are either on CPAP therapy or not. Since&#xD;
      patients with or without obstructive sleep apnea will be considered for the study, all of Dr.&#xD;
      Sloane's patients are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4. POSSIBLE BENEFITS There is no direct benefit to the patient from being in this study.&#xD;
      However, patients' participation may help others in the future as a result of knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B5. POSSIBLE RISKS AND ANALYSIS OF RISK/BENEFIT RATIO There are minimal risks associated with&#xD;
      this medical record review, which include a breach of confidentiality. The risk that someone&#xD;
      other than the patient's physician and the MS treatment team will be able to link the&#xD;
      patient's information to the study with the patient's name is minimal. The information that&#xD;
      we receive will be kept in a secure, password-protected computer within the MS team's&#xD;
      research drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the questions asked as part of the study, may make the patient feel uncomfortable.&#xD;
      They may refuse to answer any of the questions. Although not ideal for purposes of this&#xD;
      study, refusing to answer questions/questionnaires is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HST devices are used as a diagnostic tool routinely in clinical practice for sleep apnea and&#xD;
      are FDA approved for this indication. Complications are rare and not high-risk. The most&#xD;
      common side effect is skin irritation caused by the adhesive used to attach test sensors to&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of blood draw may include discomfort, bruising, and very rarely infection at the site&#xD;
      where the needle enters the skin. Patients may also possibly experience dizziness, nausea, or&#xD;
      fainting during blood collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Subjects will be identified via medical record review. Any subject data included&#xD;
      in the study will be a result of the subject matching the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written Consent The PI on this study has requested a HIPPA Waiver of Authorization due to the&#xD;
      fact that this is a retrospective medical record review. An informed consent will be signed&#xD;
      for the HST device substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal Consent Prior to any data collection under this protocol for patients restricted to&#xD;
      telemedicine visits due to COVID-19, a verbal consent will be obtained using a verbal consent&#xD;
      script. An information sheet will be sent to the patient by email or by mail. Written consent&#xD;
      can be obtained if/when subjects come to the medical center for in person visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Protection No subjects in this study will be vulnerable to coercion or undue&#xD;
      influence because this is a retrospective medical record review. However, since this study&#xD;
      does involve the use of PHI, every effort will be maintained to de-identify PHI to maintain&#xD;
      confidentiality. In addition, each subject will be given a unique identifier (i.e. 001) and&#xD;
      the codebreaker will be located in a secure, locked office&#xD;
