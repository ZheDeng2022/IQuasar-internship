  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized control trial conducted to check the effects of eccentric and&#xD;
      concentric muscle energy techniques on patients with upper cross syndrome so that we can have&#xD;
      best treatment option for patients with upper cross syndrome, duration was of&#xD;
      6months,convenient sampling was done, subject following eligibility criteria from Mansoura&#xD;
      hospital female physiotherapy department, Lahore were randomly allocated in two groups via&#xD;
      lottery method, baseline assessment was done, Group A participants were given conservative&#xD;
      treatment along with eccentric muscle energy technique and Group B participants were given&#xD;
      conservative treatment along with concentric muscle energy technique than on 1st,3rdand 6th&#xD;
      week post intervention assessment was done via neck disability index, Numeric rating scale,&#xD;
      inches tape method,3 sessions per week were given, data was analyzed by using SPSS version&#xD;
      26.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Upper cross syndrome upper trapezius, pectoralis major, and levator scapulae become tight&#xD;
      and rhomboids , serratus anterior, middle and lower trapezius, and deep neck flexors,&#xD;
      including scalene becomes weak. The postural muscles have tendency to become tight while the&#xD;
      phasic muscles have tendency to become weak and inhibited. Thus typical pattern of altered&#xD;
      posture and muscular imbalance occurs whenever dysfunction of muscle start. mainly muscular&#xD;
      imbalance between weak and tonic muscles leads toward this upper cross syndrome. Soft tissue&#xD;
      and cervical spine disorders are found out to be the major contributor in neck pain but when&#xD;
      postural abnormality becomes the reason behind neck ache than this is categorized as Upper&#xD;
      cross syndrome due to this imbalance in muscles our body has to suffer from severe&#xD;
      consequences.rounded shoulder posture is a result of protracted girdle of shoulder due to&#xD;
      muscular imbalances between agonist and antagonist muscles resulting in extreme pain and&#xD;
      exaggerated cervical curvature.Imbalanced stress on cervical vertebrae is responsible in&#xD;
      creating extra pull on neck and head similarly change in normal posture is responsible in&#xD;
      overloading, weakening or tightening of cervical area. Characteristics of patient presenting&#xD;
      with UCS will have forward head posture, kyphosis ,hunch of thoracic spine (rounded&#xD;
      shoulder),winged scapulae, protracted and elevated shoulder and reduced thoracic spine&#xD;
      mobility. UCS with the passage of time can detoriate persons physical fitness and health ,it&#xD;
      is not only responsible for changes in posture of upper back i.e hypokyphosis over time, but&#xD;
      it is also responsible for inducing respiratory problems including asthma. It also cause neck&#xD;
      back shoulder and chest wall pain, this pain can be caused by muscular imbalance leading to&#xD;
      overuse and fatigue of muscle because of movement dysfunction of back and neck.when muscles&#xD;
      become fatigued they start generating more amount of inflammatory chemicals resulting in&#xD;
      becoming more sore and increased spasticity. With the passage of time biomechanical and&#xD;
      postural changing will induce osteoarthritis in upper thoracic and lower cervical spine in&#xD;
      early ages. Functional Shoulder impingement syndrome is also considered to be another&#xD;
      complication of Upper cross syndrome. Therefore it is necessary to correctly diagnose and&#xD;
      treat this condition before its complication starts worsening.&#xD;
