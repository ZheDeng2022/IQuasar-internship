    <textblock>
      This is a four-arm randomized pilot study aimed at reducing internal and/or external shame&#xD;
      using self-compassion and/or compassion from others. The study is designed to test the theory&#xD;
      that trait shame is comprised of both internal and external shame and to test compassion for&#xD;
      others as an intervention for external shame.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shame is a common, painful emotion involving negative evaluations of the self. It has been&#xD;
      theorized that trait shame involves both internal shame (i.e., evaluating oneself negatively)&#xD;
      and external shame (i.e., perceiving that others evaluate the self negatively). Shame is&#xD;
      experienced across a variety of psychiatric illnesses, yet it has been highly understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-compassion has been used as an intervention for reducing shame in a variety of research&#xD;
      studies, often in the context of a specific psychiatric disorder. However, self-compassion&#xD;
      interventions, which aim to change the way one thinks and feels about oneself, may&#xD;
      specifically target internal shame but not external shame. It is proposed that receiving&#xD;
      compassion from others is an analogous and plausible intervention for external shame. In&#xD;
      order to test the theory that trait shame is comprised of both internal and external shame&#xD;
      and to test compassion for others as an intervention for external shame, a four-arm&#xD;
      randomized pilot study aimed at reducing internal and/or external shame using self-compassion&#xD;
      and/or compassion from others is proposed here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (N=180) scoring high on both internal and external shame on self-report measures&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline using both questionnaires and a shame-memory recall.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of four conditions: a) describing a shameful&#xD;
      experience using a self-compassionate prompt and receiving no verbal responses from&#xD;
      confederates (self-compassion only), b) describing a shameful experience using a neutral&#xD;
      prompt and receiving compassionate responses from confederates (compassion from others only),&#xD;
      c) both describing a shameful experience using a self-compassionate prompt and receiving&#xD;
      compassionate responses from confederates (self-compassion plus compassion from others), or&#xD;
      d) describing a shameful experience using a neutral prompt and receiving no verbal responses&#xD;
      from confederates (sharing-only control). Participants will complete questionnaires and&#xD;
      shame-memory recalls again immediately following the sharing intervention and at a one-week&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary outcome measures will be state internal shame, as measured by the&#xD;
      Internalized Shame Sclae, and state external shame, as measured by the Other As a Shamer&#xD;
      scale. Both the Internalized Shame Scale and Other As a Shamer scale will be administered at&#xD;
      baseline (immediately pre-treatment), immediately post-treatment, and a one-week&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include the Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Affect Scale, and a real-time assessment of state shame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that (a) participants assigned to describe a shameful experience using&#xD;
      self-compassionate instructions will display larger reductions in internal shame relative to&#xD;
      those assigned to describe a shameful experience using neutral instructions; (b) participants&#xD;
      who receive compassionate responses from others after sharing a shameful experience will&#xD;
      display larger reductions in external shame relative to those assigned to a listening-only&#xD;
      control; and (c) participants assigned to describe a shameful experience using&#xD;
      self-compassionate instructions combined with receiving compassionate responses from others&#xD;
      will display larger reductions in both internal and external shame relative to participants&#xD;
      who receive either component alone.&#xD;
