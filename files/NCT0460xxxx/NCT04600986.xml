  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, proof-of-concept study, designed to compare the IVF&#xD;
      results in patients diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) defined as per the&#xD;
      ESHRE/ASRM Rotterdam criteria (2003) undergoing in-vitro fertilization/ intracytoplasmic&#xD;
      sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) in antagonist protocol. Patients were randomized into two groups.&#xD;
      Group A: single dose of GnRHa 0.2 mg, 35 h prior to oocyte retrieval, and Group B: 0.2 mg&#xD;
      GnRHa 35 h prior to oocyte retrieval + a repeat dose of 0.1 mg 12 h following the 1st dose.&#xD;
      12 h post-trigger, luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone (P4) values will be estimated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this study was to establish if a second dose of GnRHa repeated 12 h following the&#xD;
      initial dose optimizes the cycle outcome in terms of oocyte maturity in women with PCOS of&#xD;
      Asian origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the institutional review board and written, informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from each participant. Infertile women with a diagnosis of PCOS, who undergo the&#xD;
      IVF / ICSI cycle are assigned to two groups by stratified randomization method according to&#xD;
      the method of triggering. Before the starting the treatment cycle, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized with sealed randomization envelopes. The random allocation is concealed from the&#xD;
      physician performing the IVF/ICSI treatment cycle. All patients will receive antagonist&#xD;
      controlled ovarian stimulation protocol with same starting dose of gonadotropin. On the day&#xD;
      of trigger, serum E2, LH, and P4 concentrations will be measured. When three lead follicles&#xD;
      achieved 17-mm diameter, in group A, the final oocyte maturation will be triggered with a&#xD;
      single dose of 0.2 mg s.c triptorelin (decapeptyl), 35 h prior to oocyte retrieval in both&#xD;
      the groups and in Group B, a repeat dose of 0.1 mg 12 h following the first dose.&#xD;
      Post-trigger, LH, and progesterone levels will be measured 12 h following the first dose of&#xD;
      GnRHa. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte pickup (OPU) will be performed 35 h following&#xD;
      the first dose under intravenous sedation with single-lumen oocyte retrieval needle. Post&#xD;
      pickup on days 4 and 7, an assessment for symptoms and signs of OHSS and patients will be&#xD;
      advised to present at any time within 2 weeks of GnRHa administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all subjects, IVF or ICSI will be performed according to the standard operating procedure.&#xD;
      The fertilization will be assessed 18 h following ICSI or IVF by the appearance of two&#xD;
      pronuclei. All embryos will be cryopreserved by vitrification in the form of blastocyst. The&#xD;
      frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles will be performed following pretreatment with oral&#xD;
      contraceptive pills in an artificial cycle with a daily dose of orally administered 6 mg of&#xD;
      estradiol. When the endometrium evaluated by TVS was &gt;8 mm with triple-layer morphology, it&#xD;
      is considered mature. This will be followed by endometrial priming with 5 days of injectable&#xD;
      progesterone for blastocysts. The transfer will be performed using Sure-Pro Ultra catheter.&#xD;
      Luteal-phase supplementation will be continued with vaginal progesterone and estradiol for 14&#xD;
      days and when pregnancy will be achieved till 10 weeks of gestation..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the maturity rate of the oocytes (the ratio of MII oocytes to the&#xD;
      total number of oocytes retrieved) and oocyte yield. The secondary outcomes are fertilization&#xD;
      rate, number and quality of blastocyst embryos, OHSS occurrence, and post-trigger serum LH&#xD;
      (IU/L), and P4 (ng/mL) levels. In addition, implantation and clinical pregnancy rates will be&#xD;
      also evaluated. Data collection will be performed by using questionnaires to be filled as per&#xD;
      the available records and laboratory results. Data analysis will be done through descriptive&#xD;
      and perceptive statistical methods by using SPSS software version 20 for windows.&#xD;
