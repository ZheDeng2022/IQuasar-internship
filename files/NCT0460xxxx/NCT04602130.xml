      Purpose: This randomized experimental study aimed to analyze the effect of massage, wipe&#xD;
      bathing and tub bathing of late premature newborns on their physiological measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods: . This randomized experimental study was conducted on 192 newborns at the&#xD;
      gestational week of 34 or higher in the newborn intensive care unit of a university hospital.&#xD;
      The researcher applied massage (n: 48), tub bathing (n: 48), and wipe bathing (n: 48) to the&#xD;
      newborns. The control group (n: 48) received no intervention except for the routine clinical&#xD;
      practices. The newborns' physiological measurements before, immediately after and 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the interventions were taken and recorded on the &quot;Newborn Follow-up Form.&quot; The&#xD;
      statistical analysis was performed using percentages, means, and ANOVA test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The neonatal period covers the postnatal first 28 days. During this period, newborns try to&#xD;
      adapt to the extrauterine life after the intrauterine life and stabilize their respiratory&#xD;
      and circulatory functions. Therefore, the acquisition of information on newborns' vital signs&#xD;
      is crucial in the evaluation of and caregiving for newborns. The increase in evidence-based&#xD;
      studies in nursing has led to changes and developments in the caregiving instructions that&#xD;
      have hitherto been used in newborn intensive care units. However, the required and effective&#xD;
      nursing practices that are considered indispensable in newborn intensive care units may cause&#xD;
      various physiological (increase or decrease in heart and respiration rate, temporary decrease&#xD;
      in oxygen saturation, hypothermia) and behavioral reactions (crying, uneasiness) Nurses,&#xD;
      therefore, should closely monitor newborns' vital signs and make various interventions to&#xD;
      keep these signs within normal values, as a primary practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature includes many studies conducted by nurses that focus on keeping newborns'&#xD;
      physiological measurements within normal values. Massage means the stimulation of the soft&#xD;
      tissues in the body. Previous studies have indicated that massage has positive effects such&#xD;
      as relaxing the muscles, relieving pain, reducing bilirubin values by enabling blood and&#xD;
      lymphatic circulation, increasing sleep duration, and strengthening the relationship between&#xD;
      mothers and newborns. However, only a limited number of studies exist on the effects of&#xD;
      massage on newborns' physiological measurements reported that the tactile stimulus through&#xD;
      massages supported premature infants' parasympathetic functions and positively affected the&#xD;
      infants' heart rate by reducing neurochemical and stress stimuli. Furthermore, Dieogo et al.&#xD;
      (2008) reported that premature infants' body temperature increased due to the increased blood&#xD;
      circulation during massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bathing of newborns plays a highly important role in routine newborn clinical care&#xD;
      practices, as well as in the individual, aesthetic, cultural, and hygienic benefits it&#xD;
      confers. In neonatal intensive care units (NICU), tub baths, wipe baths, swaddle baths and&#xD;
      shower-type bathing are commonly used. In Turkey, however, wipe baths and tub baths are often&#xD;
      the most commonly used bathing methods in neonatal intensive care units . Although the&#xD;
      literature shows differences among the institutions and countries, in newborn care units,&#xD;
      wipe bathing is generally carried out by nurses, and tub bathing is not recommended until the&#xD;
      infants' naval cord falls of. Numerous studies have shown that bathing can be performed&#xD;
      without harming the newborn. Bryanton et al. (2004) indicated in their study that&#xD;
      thermoregulation was ensured for the infants by drying them under a radiant warmer and&#xD;
      placing them in an incubator. Mörelus et al. (2006) reported that infants might show&#xD;
      physiological reactions, such as increased respiration and heart rate, to any stress. They&#xD;
      also found that bathing positively affected infants' physiological measurements by relaxing&#xD;
      them and reducing their stress levels. Studies that compare the effects of traditional wipe&#xD;
      and tub bathing on newborns' physiological measurements have shown that tub bathing had more&#xD;
      positive effects than wipe bathing. However, no studies have analyzed in the related&#xD;
      literature that investigate the effects of massage, wipe bathing and tub bathing on&#xD;
      physiological measurements, in the studies also have several inconsistencies, such as a small&#xD;
      sample size, the failure to use control groups and a lack of blinding and follow-up. This&#xD;
      randomized experimental study aimed to analyze the effect of massage, wipe bathing and tub&#xD;
      bathing of late premature newborns on their physiological measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, setting, and population This study was conducted as a randomised controlled&#xD;
      study between January and December 2018 in the NICU of a university hospital in Turkey. The&#xD;
      NICU employs 30 nurses who provide newborns with bathing care performed routinely between 2&#xD;
      and 3 pm each afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, permission to conduct the research was obtained from the hospital and the&#xD;
      Inonu University Health Sciences Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Committee. All&#xD;
      parents who agreed to participate in the research were informed of its methods and purpose,&#xD;
      and each completed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample included the newborns who a) were born at 34 weeks' gestation and over b)&#xD;
      were receiving routine care and who were stable (temperature &gt;36.5 °C, SpO2&gt; 95%, HR =&#xD;
      120-160 / min) c) had an apgar score of 7 or higher at the first minute after birth; d) were&#xD;
      at least 24 hours old and who had no health problems that prevent bathing (e.g., congenital&#xD;
      anomaly, surgical intervention, etc.) were included in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G*Power software package was used to calculate the sample size. The sample consisted of&#xD;
      192 newborns who comprised (d=0.5)effect size and(α=0.050) alpha level and95%confidence&#xD;
      level(1-β) according to the power analysis. Each group consisted of 48 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomizasyon Newborns meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to one of the 4&#xD;
      groups. Numbers were given to newborns sequentially on entry into the study and the random&#xD;
      number stable used to allocate to one of 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological measurements Oxygen saturation Heart rate and oxygen saturations of newborns&#xD;
      were examined using a pulse oximeter. A separate pulse oximetry probe was used for each baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body temperature Newborns' body temperatures were measured using a non-contact thermometer.&#xD;
      Bath water temperature The temperature of the water used for bathing was controlled using a&#xD;
      bath thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The data were collected using the &quot;Newborn Follow-up Form.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn Follow-up Form:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form was prepared by the researcher upon a literature review and included questions on&#xD;
      the newborns' height, weight, diagnosis, gender, gestational age, physiological measurements&#xD;
      (pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, body temperature), and the delivery&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE Preparation for applications The newborns' mothers were allowed to observe during&#xD;
      the applications (massage, wipe bath and tub bath use). Suitable environmental conditions&#xD;
      were provided for all newborns. The massages and wipe bathing were performed first by setting&#xD;
      an appropriate temperature and humidity in the tub bathing . The door of the room used for&#xD;
      bathing was kept closed, preventing heat loss and convection caused by air circulation. The&#xD;
      room temperature and humidity were set to 26-28 °C and 40-60%, respectively. The duration of&#xD;
      the applications was a maximum of 5 minutes. Clinical care of newborns (at least half an hour&#xD;
      after feeding) and treatment processes were taken into consideration. In addition, the&#xD;
      newborns were not touched until the evaluation was completed after the massage and bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the massage application, alcohol-free and paraben-free baby oil with moisturising&#xD;
      properties, suitable for newborns' skin type, was used. The temperature of the water used for&#xD;
      the sponge bath was set at 37-38 °C, and separate cotton wipes were used for each body&#xD;
      region. A folded cloth towel was placed in the tub bath before the bathing began. The water&#xD;
      level inside the tub was set to 9-12 cm, deep enough to cover the newborn's shoulders. The&#xD;
      temperature of the bath water was controlled using a special water thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials used during the applications were placed in easily accessible places, and&#xD;
      nurses wore gloves after washing their hands prior to beginning the activities. All materials&#xD;
      were disinfected after each application. The researchers were not involved in clinical&#xD;
      follow-up of the infants, and nurses took all physiological measurements, recording them on&#xD;
      the Newborn Follow-up Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Control Group The newborns in the control group did not undergo any&#xD;
      intervention other than standard clinical practices. All physiological measurements (pulse,&#xD;
      respiration, oxygen saturation and body temperature) were performed by nurses and recorded on&#xD;
      the Newborn Follow-up Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massage Group Massages were performed starting from the face, focused on the newborns&#xD;
      forehead, and then around the eyes and cheeks with gentle touches. Then, newborns' chest area&#xD;
      and the upper and lower extremities were massaged. Finally, newborns'were placed prone&#xD;
      position and the back was massaged. Nurses recorded newborns' physiological measurements&#xD;
      (pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation and body temperature) on the Newborn Follow-up Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wipe Bathing Group In the sponge bathing group, the newborns' eyes, faces (outward from the&#xD;
      midline), around the ear and the back of the ear were wiped from the inside out with cotton&#xD;
      wipes and dried. Then, the chest area and arms, abdomen and back, legs and feet,&#xD;
      respectively, were wiped and dried. Finally, the genital area was cleaned, before diapering&#xD;
      the newborn. Nurses recorded newborns' physiological measurements (pulse, respiration, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and body temperature) on the Newborn Follow-up Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tub Bathing Group In the tub bathing group, before being immersed in the tub, the newborns'&#xD;
      faces and heads were cleaned outwards from the midline and dried. Then, the neck, chest,&#xD;
      arms, back, legs and genital area were soaped, before the full body was rinsed and dried.&#xD;
      Finally, umbilical cord care was performed, and the baby was diapered. Nurses recorded the&#xD;
      newborns' physiological measurements (pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation and body&#xD;
      temperature) on the Newborn Follow-up Form.&#xD;
