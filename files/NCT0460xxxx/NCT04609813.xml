      This multicenter study aims to include 20000 upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and establish a&#xD;
      risk prediction model for esophageal cancer. This study will propose a table, including Risk&#xD;
      factors for esophageal cancer and evaluate the function and value of new type esophageal cell&#xD;
      collector to China's esophageal cancer screening. The primary study outcome is the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the model to diagnose esophageal cancer. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include sensitivity and specificity of the esophageal cytology to diagnose esophageal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most unknown and deadiest cancers worldwide, mainly because&#xD;
      of its extremely aggressive nature and poor survival rate. In 2018, the incidence rate and&#xD;
      mortality rate of esophageal cancer were 6.3/100000 and 5.5/100000. There are clear&#xD;
      differences between the risk factors of both histological types that affect their incidence&#xD;
      and distribution worldwide.There are areas of high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (some&#xD;
      areas in China) that meet the requirements for cost-effectiveness of endoscopy for early&#xD;
      diagnosis in the general population of those areas. The gold standard to detect and diagnose&#xD;
      esophageal cancer is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy. However, China is a&#xD;
      country with large population, which makes it difficult to perform screening endoscopy in the&#xD;
      whole crowd. There are several researches showing that there is a low detecting rate of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer if only perform screening endoscopy in high risk area. This multicenter&#xD;
      study aims to propose a table, including Risk factors for esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, esophageal cytology is essential to detect and diagnose esophageal. Now there are&#xD;
      improved esophageal cell collector（CytospongeTM、EsophaCapTM）which adopt an inflatable sponge&#xD;
      capsule design to increase the contact area with the esophageal mucosa. Our study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the function and value of new type esophageal cell collector to China's esophageal&#xD;
      cancer screening.&#xD;
