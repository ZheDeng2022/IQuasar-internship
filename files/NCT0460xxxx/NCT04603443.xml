      The most persistent and disabling postconcussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (mTBI) are sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction, with few tractable&#xD;
      interventions currently available. Here, a novel therapy will be tested consisting of dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAA), based on the study team's previous&#xD;
      preclinical work showing restoration of glutamate neurotransmitter balance in sleep and&#xD;
      memory circuits. Supplementation with Amino acid Rehabilitative Therapy in TBI (SmART-TBI) is&#xD;
      a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, exploratory clinical trial of BCAA intended&#xD;
      to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and limited efficacy of long-term BCAA to&#xD;
      improve sleep and cognition in Veterans with mTBI. These results will inform the optimal&#xD;
      study design of a future, full-scale randomized controlled trial, including the&#xD;
      identification of the proper dose and duration of BCAA to improve sleep and the potential&#xD;
      subpopulations of Veterans with mTBI that may benefit the most.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has impacted over 60% of all OEF/OIF Veterans over the&#xD;
      past decade, and over 20% of these Veterans carry a diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome.&#xD;
      Arguably the most disabling postconcussion symptoms are sleep-wake and cognitive&#xD;
      disturbances. Sleep, cognitive function, and related symptoms often remain impaired &gt;10-15&#xD;
      years following mTBI. Not only are these symptoms themselves exceedingly difficult to live&#xD;
      with, but poor sleep and cognition also interfere with ongoing rehabilitation interventions,&#xD;
      and prevent reintegration into civilian life and return to gainful employment. Most existing&#xD;
      therapies for sleep-wake and cognitive dysfunction following mTBI are merely symptomatic, and&#xD;
      they also suffer from low efficacy and/or patient acceptability. Thus, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need to identify mechanism-based interventions for sleep and cognitive problems following&#xD;
      mTBI, in order to facilitate optimal rehabilitation and functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team's long-term goal is to implement a brain-bioactive pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention to address sleep and cognitive disturbance in individuals with mTBI. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this application, which represents the first step towards this goal, is to test&#xD;
      the feasibility and limited efficacy of a highly promising therapy consisting of a dietary&#xD;
      supplement, branched chain amino acids (BCAA; i.e., leucine, isoleucine, and valine), to&#xD;
      treat sleep disturbances in individuals with mTBI. There is compelling scientific precedent&#xD;
      and safety data to support the testing of BCAA therapy in Veterans with mTBI. Preliminary&#xD;
      preclinical data has shown that the mechanism of action for BCAA, acting as a precursor to&#xD;
      the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, restores the balance of excitation to inhibition&#xD;
      within the dysfunctional brain circuits for both sleep and cognition in mTBI. With these&#xD;
      data, the study team has also meticulously mapped the optimal dosing, duration, and route of&#xD;
      administration in mice. Further, the study team now has pilot data from a double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study showing that 3 weeks of dietary BCAA supplementation, but not&#xD;
      placebo, significantly improved self-reported sleep in Veterans. Other research groups have&#xD;
      used dietary BCAA supplementation in humans across multiple conditions at doses up to 60&#xD;
      grams/day and durations up to 12 months with few to no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that BCAA dietary supplementation will improve sleep quality in&#xD;
      Veterans with mTBI. As a first step towards testing this hypothesis, herein is proposed a&#xD;
      long-term feasibility, acceptability, and limited efficacy study of BCAA's effects on sleep&#xD;
      that will be randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded. Veterans with mTBI will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive BCAA at 20, 40 or 60 grams/day per oral (PO) or a placebo (n=50&#xD;
      per group) for 12 weeks. Feasibility, acceptability, and limited efficacy outcomes based on&#xD;
      sleep (e.g., self-report, continuous actigraphy, and overnight polysomnography) will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will inform the optimal study methodology and design for a future, full-scale&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, including the identification of the proper dose and duration of&#xD;
      BCAA to improve sleep and the potential subpopulations of Veterans with mTBI that may be&#xD;
      differentially affected by BCAA. This work will aos be used to generate hypotheses on the&#xD;
      effect of BCAA on cognition and overall quality of life measures to inform future research.&#xD;
