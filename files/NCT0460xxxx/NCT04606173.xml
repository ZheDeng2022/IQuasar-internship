      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a brief&#xD;
      educational intervention (TEACH) that includes evidence-based strategies designed to improve&#xD;
      task-specific teamwork and its impact (vs. standard practice) on teamwork among primary care&#xD;
      team members and on evidence-based suicide prevention care provided to Veterans in Primary&#xD;
      Care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to achieve a 20% reduction in suicide rates by 2025, successful suicide prevention&#xD;
      efforts need to optimize care delivered by primary care teams due to their increased&#xD;
      likelihood of having contact with patients prior to suicide attempts. Several evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations exist in the clinical practice guidelines for primary care team members to&#xD;
      improve suicide prevention at every visit with an at-risk patient (i.e., patient has a risk&#xD;
      factor for suicide, such as substance use diagnosis). However, past research has shown there&#xD;
      are opportunities for improvement. Successful implementation of these guidelines relies on&#xD;
      the knowledge and delivery of the elements of evidence-based care, which often involves&#xD;
      several primary care team members working together. In addition, the delivery must be&#xD;
      patient-centered to improve success of a patient feeling comfortable enough to share&#xD;
      honestly. Both are areas of deficit. Thus, leveraging the team to utilize the team skillsets&#xD;
      for interactive learning to improve knowledge, patient-centered care, and address team&#xD;
      processes may be ideal to overcome provider's reported barriers to providing evidence-based&#xD;
      care, such as lack of self-efficacy. The proposed research will examine the use of&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies to improve task-specific team processes packaged within a brief&#xD;
      interactive interprofessional educational intervention called Team Education for Adopting&#xD;
      Changes in Healthcare (TEACH). Matching the commonly used primary care huddle format often&#xD;
      used daily for the team to review patients prior to engaging in clinical services, TEACH&#xD;
      involves 4 brief (~20 minutes) team meetings with all members of the primary care teamlet,&#xD;
      including the increasing number of embedded behavioral health providers in primary care to&#xD;
      discuss suicide prevention. The investigators will conduct a small randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      which will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of TEACH on improving&#xD;
      evidence-based suicide prevention care (as assessed via components in the electronic medical&#xD;
      record) as well as team processes (as assessed by the Team Development measure) compared to&#xD;
      standard practice (i.e., mandated didactics, electronic medical record support) within 8&#xD;
      primary care teamlets. In addition, the investigators will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruiting at-risk Veterans to complete a structured interview regarding their experience of&#xD;
      the team's suicide prevention efforts during a visit and provide objective measurement of&#xD;
      evidence-based care via audio recording of a recent visit. This work aims to provide&#xD;
      preliminary data supporting the use of TEACH as an adjunctive educational strategy to improve&#xD;
      patient-centered evidence-based suicide prevention care. If successful, future work would&#xD;
      continue to examine the effectiveness of TEACH and work towards examining implementation&#xD;
      strategies to help facilitate uptake of TEACH in primary care.&#xD;
