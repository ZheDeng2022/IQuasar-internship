  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of patients with cancer will be exposed to anaesthesia at some point in their&#xD;
      treatment. There is increasing evidence that perioperative events, including the type of&#xD;
      anaesthesia drugs utilised, have an impact on cancer recurrence and metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although potentially and theoretically curative, surgical resection, manipulation and trauma&#xD;
      may disseminate tumour cells and reduce immunity. There have been a number of suggestions as&#xD;
      to why cancer may be, paradoxically, worsened by surgery and what methods may be used to&#xD;
      mitigate this. One of these is propofol based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), whereby&#xD;
      the traditional inhalational anaesthetic drugs are avoided. Commonly used inhalational drugs,&#xD;
      such as sevoflurane and desflurane, are pro-inflammatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol, however, has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, induces apoptosis and&#xD;
      has specific inhibitory effects on tumour cell growth in vitro. Laboratory investigations,&#xD;
      animal models, retrospective clinical studies and initial clinical research are producing&#xD;
      evidence that inhalational anaesthesia facilitates tumour recurrence and metastasis, whilst&#xD;
      TIVA can prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised, controlled trial will look at the effects on DNA damage and biomarkers of&#xD;
      immunity and inflammation of inhalational anaesthesia versus TIVA in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma, a common tumour in the Southern Chinese population, for&#xD;
      whom surgery is potentially-curative. It will focus on subjects undergoing open hepatectomy&#xD;
      and investigate changes in biomarkers of inflammation, immunity and gene expression from the&#xD;
      patients' blood samples taken before, during and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be followed-up for cancer recurrence, morbidity and five-year mortality.&#xD;
      Results could represent a breakthrough in knowledge of how anaesthetic agents impact the&#xD;
      results of cancer surgery, and have important implications for a more disease- sensitive&#xD;
      approach to improving management and outcomes in these patients.&#xD;

      Pre-operative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative assessment will be performed at the preadmission clinic or at the general ward.&#xD;
      Patients will be fasted for intake of solid food for 6 hours and clear liquids for 2 hours.&#xD;
      Sedative premedication will not be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and intraoperative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEVO Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the SEVO group will be anaesthetized according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival at the operation theatre, an intravenous cannula will be inserted. Standard&#xD;
      monitoring with pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure, and three-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      will be applied prior to induction. Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) will be checked at&#xD;
      least every 5 minutes throughout the operation. An arterial line may be inserted at the&#xD;
      discretion of the anaesthetist before or after induction, with invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring in lieu of NIBP if deemed necessary. Additional intravenous cannulas or central&#xD;
      lines may also be inserted to facilitate fluid therapy, measure the central venous pressure&#xD;
      or administer drugs, also at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with titrated, manual propofol injection of 1-2 mg.kg-1.&#xD;
      Remifentanil infusion will be given for analgesia at a rate of 0.1 - 0.35 mcg.kg.min-1 as&#xD;
      required, according to haemodynamic parameters. Cisatracurium 0.15 mg.kg-1 or atracurium 0.5&#xD;
      mg.kg-1 will be used for muscle relaxation. Tracheal Intubation will be performed after&#xD;
      induction of general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia monitoring will be used. Sevoflurane at&#xD;
      0.5- 1 MAC, air and oxygen will be used for maintenance of general anaesthesia. Processed EEG&#xD;
      (BISâ„¢) will be utilized to monitor depth of anaesthesia, aiming at a BIS value of 40-60. FiO2&#xD;
      will be kept between 35-50% to maintain and SaO2 of &gt; 95%. Further muscle relaxants can be&#xD;
      given during the operation if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with British consensus guidelines on intravenous fluid therapy for Adult&#xD;
      Surgical Patients [22], intraoperative fluid or blood loss will be initially replaced with&#xD;
      balanced crystalloid solution, preferably Plasmalyte A (a physiologically balanced&#xD;
      electrolyte solution similar to extracellular fluid), for up to 20% of body volume, with&#xD;
      additional fluid replacement with colloid or crystalloid at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anaesthetist. Intravenous phenylephrine, ephedrine or fluid administration may also be given&#xD;
      for management of hypotension. Intravenous anti-hypertensive agents such as beta blockers&#xD;
      (e.g. esmolol, labetalol) and glyceryl trinitrate can be given if hypertension occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standardized opioid analgesia of 0.1 mg.kg-1 intravenous morphine&#xD;
      intra-operatively followed by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine post-operatively,&#xD;
      as well as local anaesthesia (0.5% levobupivacaine) injected in the areas of surgical&#xD;
      incision during wound closure for pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forced air warming blankets will be used with the aim of keeping a core temperature of&#xD;
      35.5-37.5 degrees Celsius. Ondansetron 4mg IV will be given 30 minutes before end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevoflurane and remifentanil infusion will be switched off at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
      Reversal of muscle relaxation can be achieved if required with neostigmine 50 mcg.kg-1 IV and&#xD;
      atropine 20 mcg.kg-1 IV. Patients will subsequently be transferred to the post anaesthetic&#xD;
      care unit (PACU) for monitoring for at least 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIVA Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the TIVA group will be anaesthetized according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and other anaesthetic procedures including the management of hypertension and&#xD;
      hypotension will be the same as SEVO group. Induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia&#xD;
      will be conducted using total intravenous infusion of propofol. Sevoflurane will not be used,&#xD;
      and oxygen and air would be given to provide a FiO2 of 30-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target controlled infusion (TCI) with a modified Marsh effect site model (Fresenius Kabi)&#xD;
      will be used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia and titrated to effect. The&#xD;
      usual effect site concentration is 1.5-3 mcg.ml-1 and BIS monitoring will also be used to&#xD;
      produce a value of between 40-60. As with patients in the SEVO group, remifentanil will be&#xD;
      infused at a rate of between 0.1-0.3 mcg.kg.min-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care for both groups In the recovery room after surgery, numerical rating pain&#xD;
      score (NRS) will be used to assess level of pain. Patients will select a whole number (0-10&#xD;
      integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain, in which 10 represents the&#xD;
      maximal imaginable pain. Boluses of 2 mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes&#xD;
      until the numerical rating scale (NRS) is less than or equal to 4/10. A patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia (PCA) machine will then be connected. The machine will be configured to give 1 mg&#xD;
      of morphine whenever the patient demands with the lockout duration set to 5 minutes. No&#xD;
      background infusion will be given and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1 mg.kg-1 per hour of&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On post-operative day 1, when the patient resumes a fluid diet, oral celecoxib 200 mg will be&#xD;
      given twice daily for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst on PCA morphine, the patient's respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and sedation&#xD;
      score will be monitored every hour. Heart rate and blood pressure will be checked every 4&#xD;
      hours. NRS pain scores at rest and during cough/movement, cumulative PCA morphine doses, and&#xD;
      number of PCA demands/goods delivered, and side effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness,&#xD;
      hypotension, desaturation) will be recorded every 4 hours. Patients will be assessed by a&#xD;
      &quot;pain team&quot; every day to determine sufficiency of analgesia, as per usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be kept on PCA morphine for at least 2 days. If NRS pain scores during cough/&#xD;
      movement on postoperative day 2 are less than or equal to 3/10, PCA morphine will be stopped.&#xD;
      PCA morphine will be continued if NRS is equal or greater than 4, or if the patient remains&#xD;
      on a high PCA use. Assessment for analgesia will be conducted daily. Evaluation for&#xD;
      complications will be required if NRS pain score is 4 or higher on postoperative day 5. The&#xD;
      patient will be further managed at the discretion of the anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After PCA morphine has been withdrawn, NRS pain scores at rest and during cough/ movement, as&#xD;
      well as the dose and frequency of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
