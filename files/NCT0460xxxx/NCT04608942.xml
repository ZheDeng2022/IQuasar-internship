      PURPOSE: The investigators propose a new treatment for refractory Meibomian Gland Dysfunction&#xD;
      (MGD) patients with plasma jet to remove the hyperkeratinization layer from the lid margin to&#xD;
      unblock terminal gland ducts and use thermal stimulation to enhance meibum delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A prospective, interventional clinical safety and efficacy trial with 25 patients&#xD;
      from the Department of Ophthalmology at Escola Paulista de Medicina (UNIFESP) to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the treatment of refractory MGD patients with plasma jet on both&#xD;
      upper and lower lids. Patients will be submitted to an ophthalmology workup with&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (ETDRS chart) and dry eye questionnaires (DEQ-5 and&#xD;
      OSDI). Bulbar redness, tear film meniscus height, noninvasive breakup time (NIKBUT),&#xD;
      meibography under infrared light will be measured with Keratograph (Oculus®). Following, tear&#xD;
      film osmolarity (i-PenTM), meibomian gland expression, and Marx line assessment. All exams&#xD;
      were performed at the baseline, 30 days, and 90 days after the plasma jet application.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most prevalent conditions at an&#xD;
      ophthalmology office that may reach 15 to 40% of prevalence in the population. It is&#xD;
      didactically classified as two forms that exist as a continuum: aqueous deficient dry eye&#xD;
      (ADDE) and evaporative dry eye (EDE). In EDE patients Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is&#xD;
      the major etiology in which the insufficient meibum secretion can be decreased by cicatricial&#xD;
      (trachoma, ocular pemphigoid, erythema multiforme) and non-cicatricial causes (skin disorders&#xD;
      such as acne rosacea and atopic dermatitis, blepharitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MGD pathophysiology can be explained by hyposecretion or ducts obstruction, resulting in low&#xD;
      delivery of phospholipids and cholesterol that grant stability to the tear film.&#xD;
      Hyposecretion of the sebaceous glands can result from intrinsic (age, ethnicity, hormonal&#xD;
      profile) and extrinsic factors (chronic blepharitis, Demodex folliculorum infestation,&#xD;
      contact lens wear, topical drops). Furthermore, the duct obstruction occurs in a consequence&#xD;
      to cicatricial rearrangement of the terminal ducts or by non-cicatricial hyperkeratinization&#xD;
      of the lid margins, leading to increased duct pressure, dilatation, and disuse atrophy of the&#xD;
      glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires such as Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Dry Eye Questionnaire-5&#xD;
      (DEQ-5) that evaluate the grade of severity of DED and assessment of MGD by noninvasive tear&#xD;
      breakup time (BUT) evaluation that measures tear film stability and by meibography under&#xD;
      infrared light that analyses gland vitality are central when dealing with any EDE patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of MGD can be very challenging in cases where a clinical approach with&#xD;
      non-preserved ocular lubricants, lid hygiene, and warm compresses are not sufficient. Oral&#xD;
      tetracyclines can be a good alternative in cases of evident lid inflammation to reduce&#xD;
      bacterial colonization and inhibit collagenase action although long-term use intolerance&#xD;
      limits its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermodynamic treatment with a device that performs controlled local heating and massage of&#xD;
      the ducts showed clinical improvement and symptoms reduction whereas multiple sessions are&#xD;
      necessary. Mechanical debridement of gland ducts terminals with scalpel blade also improved&#xD;
      ocular symptoms and gland function of patients with EDE with MGD. A combination of intense&#xD;
      pulsed light (IPL) therapy and gland expression has been shown to be an effective treatment&#xD;
      to MGD with increases in BUT and improvement of ocular symptoms related to DED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma jet has been successfully used in Dermatology and is an increasingly popular method&#xD;
      for smoothing wrinkles, blunt blepharoplasty, as well as performing thermal ablation for&#xD;
      superficial skin layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a new treatment for refractory MGD patients with plasma jet with a&#xD;
      device used in Dermatology to remove the hyperkeratinization layer from the lid margin to&#xD;
      unblock terminal gland ducts and use thermal stimulation to enhance meibum delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A prospective, interventional clinical safety and efficacy trial to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the treatment of refractory MGD patients with plasma jet will be&#xD;
      conducted at Ophthalmology Department at Escola Paulista de Medicina (UNIFESP) with 25&#xD;
      Caucasian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed about the study design and will be given full access to the&#xD;
      results at any time of the protocol. All will sign an informed consent form and have their&#xD;
      identity protected in accordance with patient medical confidentiality. This case series is in&#xD;
      accordance with Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be submitted to an ophthalmology workup with best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) (ETDRS chart), dry eye questionnaires (DEQ-5 and OSDI), corneal topography, bulbar&#xD;
      redness, tear meniscus height, noninvasive breakup time (NBUT), tear film osmolarity,&#xD;
      meibography under infrared light, meibomian gland expression and Marx line assessment. All&#xD;
      exams will be performed before and 30 days after the plasma jet application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed about the procedure by the ophthalmologist and a nurse and the&#xD;
      procedure will be performed after topical anesthesia with lidocaine 2.0%. The plasma jet will&#xD;
      be applied 3 times on both superior and inferior terminal gland ducts in the lid margins with&#xD;
      a 14.4mm tip and intensity of 5 on the device (0,9W) reaching only the superficial epidermis.&#xD;
      Patients will receive topical antibiotics and corticosteroids after the procedure. During all&#xD;
      periods (90 days) patients will use sodium hyaluronate 0,15% and actinoquinol at the&#xD;
      recommended dosage of twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software program GraphPad Prism version 7.0 will be used to conduct the statistical&#xD;
      analyses. Continuous data distribution will be verified by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality&#xD;
      test. Data will be analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test with the Wilcoxon test considering&#xD;
      2-time points for nonparametric variables and paired t-test for parametric variables. All p&#xD;
      values of &lt; 0.05 will indicate statistically significant differences.&#xD;
