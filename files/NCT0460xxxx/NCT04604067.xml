      Within this exploratory multicohort phase II trial, SAKK aims to evaluate a PET_CT and ctDNA&#xD;
      oriented therapy in DLBCL in order to test the following working hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acalabrutinib-R-CHOP may improve the progression free survival in genetically defined&#xD;
           DLBCL harboring the MYD88 L265P and/or CD79A/B mutations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment escalation to acalabrutinib-R-CHOP in DLBCL patients who have positive PET/CT&#xD;
           (with residual disease scored as Deauville score 4) and no molecular response (&lt;2log10&#xD;
           reduction of ctDNA) after two courses of R-CHOP could improve the anti-tumour activity&#xD;
           of R-CHOP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment de-escalation to 4 total R-CHOP courses plus 2 rituximab single agent&#xD;
           infusions does not compromise the outcome in patients lacking both MYD88 L265P and&#xD;
           CD79A/B mutations and quickly obtaining both negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) and&#xD;
           molecular response (&gt;2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two R-CHOP, and further improve to&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in the clinical care of patients with DLBCL and in understanding the biology&#xD;
      of this disease, cure rates have remained the same since the introduction of rituximab to&#xD;
      CHOP chemotherapy, and R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy remains the standard of care. Over the last&#xD;
      years many phase III trials investigating new agents added to R-CHOP have been performed but&#xD;
      they have all invariably failed to improve treatment outcomes. Importantly, three of the most&#xD;
      recently completed phase III trials that were developed based on the cell of origin&#xD;
      distinction of DLBCL and aimed to improve treatment outcome in the ABC (or non- Germinal&#xD;
      center B-Cell (GCB)) subtype by adding a targeted agent to R-CHOP have also failed. This&#xD;
      provides clinical evidence that cell of origin may not be an accurate biomarker for treatment&#xD;
      decisions. The R - CHOP + investigational drug approach has thus failed either when broadly&#xD;
      applied to unselected DLBCL patients or when applied to DLBCL patients selected according to&#xD;
      inaccurate biomarkers such as COO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this exploratory multicohort phase II trial, SAKK aims to evaluate a PET_CT and ctDNA&#xD;
      oriented therapy in DLBCL in order to test the following working hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acalabrutinib-R-CHOP may improve the progression free survival in genetically defined&#xD;
           DLBCL harboring the MYD88 L265P and/or CD79A/B mutations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment escalation to acalabrutinib-R-CHOP in DLBCL patients who have positive PET/CT&#xD;
           (with residual disease scored as Deauville score 4) and no molecular response (&lt;2log10&#xD;
           reduction of ctDNA) after two courses of R-CHOP could improve the anti-tumour activity&#xD;
           of R-CHOP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment de-escalation to 4 total R-CHOP courses plus 2 rituximab single agent&#xD;
           infusions does not compromise the outcome in patients lacking both MYD88 L265P and&#xD;
           CD79A/B mutations and quickly obtaining both negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) and&#xD;
           molecular response (&gt;2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two R-CHOP, and further improve to&#xD;
           Deauville score 1-2 and absence of ctDNA after two more R-CHOP courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the efficacy of acalabrutinib-R-CHOP in DLBCL harboring MYD88 L265P and/or&#xD;
           CD79A/B mutations (cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the activity of treatment escalation to acalabrutinib-R-CHOP followed by&#xD;
           acalabrutinib monotherapy in DLBCL patients who are double positive: PET/CT positive&#xD;
           (Deauville score 4) and no molecular response (&lt;2log10 fold reduction) after two courses&#xD;
           of R-CHOP (cohort B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploring the feasibility of treatment de-escalation to 4 total R-CHOP courses plus two&#xD;
           infusions of single agent rituximab in patients lacking both MYD88 L265P and CD79A/B&#xD;
           mutations and quickly obtaining both negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) and molecular&#xD;
           response (&gt;2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two cycles of R-CHOP, which further improve&#xD;
           to Deauville score 1-2 and absence of ctDNA after two additional R-CHOP courses (cohort&#xD;
           C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploring clinical implications of having a negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) but no&#xD;
           molecular response (&lt;2log10 reduction of ctDNA) vs a positive PET/CT (Deauville score 4)&#xD;
           but molecular response (&gt;2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two R-CHOP courses (cohort D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability of acalabrutinib-R-CHOP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of prognostic value of baseline PET radiomics indexes, alone or in&#xD;
           association with other parameters&#xD;
