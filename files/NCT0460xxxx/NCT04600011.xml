  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective in this 10-week pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using&#xD;
      videoconferencing technology to provide Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, alongside their&#xD;
      supervising care partners, specialized physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT) focused on&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation that ultimately aims to reduce fall risk. This therapy is similar to what&#xD;
      a PD patient could receive in-person with neurologic-certified physical therapists and&#xD;
      occupational therapists with significant experience working with PD patients and addressing&#xD;
      their needs, but it is delivered through a virtual platform. Feasibility is defined by&#xD;
      measures of adherence, retention, and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specialized PT and OT measurement tools and strategies used in this study are in-line&#xD;
      with the most current formal evidence-based guidelines/recommendations available for therapy&#xD;
      in PD: European Physiotherapy Guideline for Parkinson's Disease, Parkinson Evidence Database&#xD;
      to Guide Effectiveness (PD-EDGE) Task Force and Guidelines for Occupational Therapy in&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is approximately 10 weeks of the primary telerehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      and a 2 follow-up phone calls at the 3- and 6-month timepoints. There will be one baseline&#xD;
      in-person evaluation and one final in-person evaluation following the completion of all&#xD;
      televisits. The enrollment target is up to 15-20 patient and care partner (P+CP) pairs,&#xD;
      meaning 30-40 subjects total. There are no controls for this study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait dysfunction, postural instability, and freezing-of-gait (FOG) ultimately develop in&#xD;
      about 80% of PD patients, which lead to falls and advancing disability. This is significant&#xD;
      because the consequences of falls are far-reaching: accelerating immobility due to heightened&#xD;
      fear-of-falling, reducing quality of life and independence, and increasing healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and costs. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand evidence- based outpatient&#xD;
      neurologic-PT/OT services to community-dwelling PD patients to reduce fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal will address this unmet need by determining whether&#xD;
      tele-neurorehabilitation is a care model that can be executed safety for PD patients to&#xD;
      provide these services from well-trained therapists who are not easily accessible otherwise.&#xD;
      This feasibility data is critical in the development of a novel tele-neurorehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol and randomized-controlled efficacy trial thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the intended research is to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of this novel teleconferencing-based delivery of gait and balance&#xD;
      exercises/strategies with guided instruction much like one would receive in-person but in the&#xD;
      comfort of one's own home. By demonstrating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this&#xD;
      pilot program, subsequent long-term goals are to apply for larger sources of funding to&#xD;
      sustain the program. By leveraging the data gained from these studies it is anticipated the&#xD;
      practice of telerehabilitation will be expanded and improved; and ultimately its efficacy to&#xD;
      health care policy providers and insurers for potential reimbursement will be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers intend to enroll 15-20 individuals with mild-moderate PD into our proposed&#xD;
      novel telerehabilitation program, where patients will receive tele-PT/OT home visits and&#xD;
      home-safety surveillance with neurologic-specialized therapists who are experienced with the&#xD;
      core problem areas seen in PD patients. The intended clinical impact is to improve&#xD;
      gait/balance function and postural stability, and thus reduce falls in patients with PD. With&#xD;
      the remote telecommunications intervention, we aim to enable the additional clinical impact&#xD;
      of expanding access to therapy for people with PD that otherwise would have significant&#xD;
      difficulty obtaining this type of multiple-visit, individually-tailored, and specialized&#xD;
      therapy care due to travel burden and cost.&#xD;
