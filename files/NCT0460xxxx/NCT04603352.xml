  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with Down syndrome (DS) develop slower than their typically developing peers.&#xD;
      Physical therapist (PT) supervised home programs have the potential to optimize gross motor&#xD;
      development in a financially feasible way. An inexpensive orthotic garment (Hip Helpers®) is&#xD;
      commonly employed by PTs as a home program supplement, but its effectiveness has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated. The garment is worn as pliable shorts over a child's lower extremities to keep&#xD;
      upper legs together, promoting a narrow base of support. This encourages activation of&#xD;
      upright postural muscles to improve gross motor skill development. The purpose of this&#xD;
      randomized controlled study is to investigate the impact of a home program using the Hip&#xD;
      Helpers® orthotic garment on gross motor skill acquisition in infants with DS. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the addition of a structured home program using Hip Helpers®, supervised by a PT and&#xD;
      implemented by parents, will increase the rate at which infants with DS acquire gross motor&#xD;
      skills. Thirty-four participants, consisting of children who are at least three-months-old&#xD;
      and are not yet able maintain sitting independently, will be randomly assigned to a control&#xD;
      (n=17) or intervention group (n=17). PTs at pediatric therapy agencies will initiate the home&#xD;
      program and administer the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) at regular intervals to&#xD;
      monitor gross motor skill acquisition until the child is able to take three independent&#xD;
      steps. Groups will be compared on the length of time elapsed between the acquisition of&#xD;
      identified gross motor skills using independent t-tests. GMFM-88 scores will be compared&#xD;
      between the two groups at different ages to identify trends using independent t-tests. The&#xD;
      contribution of this project will be significant by informing physical therapists about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an inexpensive orthotic garment used in a supervised home program on gross&#xD;
      motor outcomes in infants with DS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTs at local Early Intervention and pediatric home health agencies will be recruited to&#xD;
      administer the home program and GMFM-88 (Appendix D) tests on their patients that consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of PTs will occur through an email sent to the local agencies. (Appendix E) The&#xD;
      PTs (additional personnel) will watch a GMFM-88 training video. They will be given a GMFM-88&#xD;
      manual, and blank protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants will occur by the PTs, who are treating patients in a home health&#xD;
      environment. The PTs will offer the opportunity to participate in the study to any of their&#xD;
      patients/clients that meet the inclusion criteria by handing them a flyer about the study&#xD;
      (Appendix A. If the parent of the potential participant is interested, the PT will ask the&#xD;
      parent to call or email the closest investigator for more information (Austin, TX, San&#xD;
      Marcos, CA, or St. Augustine, FL). The study investigator will discuss the study with the&#xD;
      parent and, if parents decide to participate, email the informed consent to the parent.&#xD;
      Parents who choose to participate will sign the informed consent form, which a study&#xD;
      investigator will read and explain to the parents over the phone if requested. The parent&#xD;
      will sign the informed consent in front of an investigator or the additional personnel PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTs will take a course on the responsible conduct of research through CITI. They will also be&#xD;
      trained by one of the investigators on the protocol of how to properly conduct the study. The&#xD;
      investigator will instruct the PTs that they may not coerce or discuss the study with&#xD;
      potential participants, but can only hand the recruitment flyer to the parent of the&#xD;
      participant. The PT will not ask the parent about their participation further after handing&#xD;
      them the flyer. If the parent has questions, the PT will instruct the parent to contact the&#xD;
      investigator for more information. The PT will also be instructed that data collection will&#xD;
      not begin until the parent has signed the informed consent and the investigator has given the&#xD;
      participant a number and randomly assigned the participant to a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental consent will be obtained prior to any data collection. (Appendix C) Parents will&#xD;
      complete a short demographic survey about their children (Appendix F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigator (PI) will then assign the child a participant number and randomly&#xD;
      assign the child to either the control group or the intervention group. This will be done&#xD;
      using a randomization website: https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the child has been given a participant number and is assigned to a group, the PT will&#xD;
      administer the first GMFM-88. PTs will continue to administer the GMFM-88 every 4 weeks to&#xD;
      all participants, regardless of group. Each GMFM-88 testing session is expected to take&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes per session. PTs will stop administering the GMFM-88 when the child&#xD;
      is able to take three independent steps. Additionally, PTs will note the child's age (in&#xD;
      months/days) upon successfully attaining the following gross motor skills: 1) rolling, 2)&#xD;
      sitting for 30 seconds independently, 3) transitioning from supine to sitting, 4) pulling up&#xD;
      to stand, 5) standing independently for 30 seconds, 6) walking independently for three&#xD;
      consecutive steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a child gains one of these gross motor skills listed above, parents will be asked to&#xD;
      obtain a short video of the child performing the skill using their smart phone or computer.&#xD;
      Parents will email the video to the PI via an encrypted email. No additional data will be&#xD;
      collected and transmitted with the video clips. The PI will instruct parents on how to send&#xD;
      an encrypted email by going to this website for instructions:&#xD;
      https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/panda-security/how-to-encrypt-email/. Data obtained&#xD;
      by the PTs will be sent to the PI electronically using the participant's number only, with no&#xD;
      other identifying information. The PI will label the videos sent by the parents with the&#xD;
      participant's number and no other identifying information prior to saving them on a&#xD;
      password-secured external hard drive. All de-identified data (including videos) will be&#xD;
      stored on a password-secured external hard drive. Only the PI will have access to the hard&#xD;
      drive. Signed consent/assent forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in the locked office of&#xD;
      the PI for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants assigned to the control group will continue with their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will be given a custom pair of Hip Helpers® to use at&#xD;
      home. (Appendix G) Parents will begin the Hip Helpers® home program upon study entry and stop&#xD;
      the program once the child is able to pull to stand independently. The Hip Helpers® home&#xD;
      program protocol (Appendix H), which consists of using the orthotic garment twice daily for&#xD;
      30 minutes each time, will be given to the parents and supervised by the PT. The Hip Helpers®&#xD;
      should be donned when the child is actively playing, and not used sleep or when child is&#xD;
      inactive. To monitor compliance, parents will be given a log (Appendix I) which they will&#xD;
      fill out and turn into the PT during each GMFM-88 assessment. The PT will give the log and&#xD;
      the GMFM-88 scores with the participant's number to the PI each month. Additionally, PTs will&#xD;
      supervise the home program, adjusting it as needed for their individual patients within the&#xD;
      following parameters: 1) the target for total wear time should be 1 hour to be distributed&#xD;
      throughout the day, 2) total wear time should not exceed 1 hour per day, 3) PT may suggest&#xD;
      positions or activities to engage the child while wearing the garment, but may not suggest&#xD;
      using while sleeping, 4) PT may &quot;ramp up&quot; wear time as needed for the individual participant&#xD;
      starting with as little as 15 minutes per day and increasing to the full 1 hour per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected by the PTs will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 software (IBM&#xD;
      Corporation, Armonk, New York). To test the hypothesis that participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will improve their gross motor skills faster than participants in the control, groups&#xD;
      will be compared on the length of time elapsed between the acquisition of identified gross&#xD;
      motor skills using independent t-tests. A p-value &lt; 0.05 will indicate significance. GMFM-88&#xD;
      scores will be compared between the two groups at different ages to identify trends using&#xD;
      independent t-tests. Average percent improvement will be calculated for both groups on&#xD;
      various domains of the GMFM-88, and the difference in these improvements will be calculated&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos will be qualitatively analyzed by coding and triangulation. Quality and variability of&#xD;
      movement will be coded by 2 of the investigators for each video. Inter- and intrarater&#xD;
      agreement will be established before formal data coding using a ratio of agreements/&#xD;
      disagreements x 100 to establish a percentage of agreements. Short descriptions of movement&#xD;
      quality will be written by 2 investigators with all 3 investigators coding and categorizing&#xD;
      the descriptions to determine emergent themes.&#xD;

    <description>The GMFM-88 is a measure of gross motor function for children with Down syndrome (DS) under six years old. The examiner scores a child's capabilities across five dimensions of functional movement: A) Lying and Rolling, B) Sitting, C) Crawling and Kneeling, D) Standing, and E) Walking, Running, and Jumping. Each dimension consists of several items on an ordinal scale. The child receives a score of 0 (does not initiate), 1 (initiates), 2 (partially completes), or 3 (completes). This outcome measure can be administered by direct observation or by parent report. For children with DS, the GMFM-88 has strong interrater reliability (ICC = 0.9</description>
