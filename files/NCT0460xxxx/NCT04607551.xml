  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ECMO has emerged as a promising intervention that may provide more efficacious supportive&#xD;
      care to patients with refractory severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The&#xD;
      largest randomized trial of ECMO for severe forms of ARDS was recently published and&#xD;
      demonstrated no significant benefit from early initiation of ECMO with respect to 60-day&#xD;
      mortality, when compared with a strategy of conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) (ref&#xD;
      EOLIA). However, a rescue ECMO option was used by 28% of the controls, which is likely to&#xD;
      have diluted the potential positive effect of ECMO. One may argue that a less restrictive&#xD;
      primary endpoint, such as death or rescue ECMO, would have yielded positive findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, improvements in technology have made ECMO safer and easier to use, allowing for&#xD;
      the potential of more widespread application in patients with ARDS. VV-ECMO can be used as a&#xD;
      life-saving rescue therapy in patients with ARDS when MV cannot maintain adequate oxygenation&#xD;
      or CO2 elimination. Alternatively, VV-ECMO may be used in patients who remain hypoxemic&#xD;
      during MV (i.e., PaO2/FiO2&lt;80 mmHg) despite optimization of MV (including the application of&#xD;
      high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), neuromuscular blockers, and prone&#xD;
      positioning) and allow &quot;lung rest&quot; by lowering airway pressures and tidal volume to&#xD;
      ameliorate ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning (PP) has been used for more than 30 years in patients with acute hypoxemic&#xD;
      respiratory failure and in particular with ARDS. Initially, PP in ARDS patients was proposed&#xD;
      as an efficient mean to improve oxygenation, sometimes dramatically, in a large number of&#xD;
      patients. In addition, it is now clear, and data are still accumulating, that PP is also able&#xD;
      to prevent VILI which is as important as maintaining safe gas exchange in mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Therefore, PP is a strategy that covers the two major goals of ventilator&#xD;
      support in ARDS patients, maintaining safe oxygenation and preventing VILI and reducing&#xD;
      mortality at the end. This latter objective makes sense on ECMO as one of the main objective&#xD;
      of this device is to markedly reduce VILI by resting the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that PP is a valuable and safe therapy to reduce VILI, its combination with ECMO&#xD;
      could enhance VILI prevention. In recent preliminary studies, it was reported that the&#xD;
      combination of VV-ECMO and PP was associated with a dramatic improvement in oxygenation, in&#xD;
      pulmonary and thoracic compliance and in chest X-ray findings. It may thus facilitate the&#xD;
      weaning of ECMO and can be performed without compromising the safety of the patients. Lung&#xD;
      recruitment and improvement in ventilation/perfusion mismatch on prone position may both&#xD;
      contribute to improve oxygenation. PP may therefore be efficient to hasten the weaning of&#xD;
      VV-ECMO when atelectasis and ventilation/perfusion mismatch occur under ultra-protective&#xD;
      ventilation even in patients in whom pre-ECMO PP failed. In addition, it could also enhance&#xD;
      ventilator induced lung injury prevention on ECMO.&#xD;

    <description>ECMO weaning will be considered successful only if the patient survives without ECMO, or lung transplantation 30 days after ECMO removal. Thus all ECMO weaning from randomization to 60 days after randomization will be considered, and the qualification for successful ECMO weaning will need 30 days of follow-up after ECMO removal (thus until day 90 after randomization for an ECMO weaning performed on day 60 after randomization).&#xD;
Patients still under ECMO 60 days after randomization will be censored.&#xD;
A protocolized management regarding weaning of VV-ECMO will be applied to both groups&#xD;
The planned analysis will model the risk of successful ECMO ablation in the presence of competing risk (death and weaning failure).</description>

The direction of the rotation will be decided giving priority to the side of the central venous lines. The length of vascular and ventilator lines will be checked for appropriateness, the endotracheal tube and gastric tube will be secured, and the patient's knees, forehead, chest, and iliac crests will be protected using adhesive pads. The patient will be then moved along the horizontal plane to the opposite side of the bed selected for the direction of rotation. Patients will be proned at least four times during the first days on ECMO. Each prone session will stand for at least 16 hours</description>
