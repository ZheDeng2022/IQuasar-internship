  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, interventional study in cancer survivors and patients to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of a mobile health application, Elly (Elly Health Inc.), to reduce&#xD;
      levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness, and social isolation. Participants will be given&#xD;
      access to the Elly phone application developed by Elly Health Inc. and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires measuring quality of life at multiple timepoints during the study.&#xD;
