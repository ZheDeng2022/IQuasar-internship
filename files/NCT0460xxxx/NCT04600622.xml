  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will use community based participatory research to adapt an existing&#xD;
      diabetes self-management and education intervention with a telehealth intervention to be&#xD;
      culturally relevant for rural English- and Spanish-speaking populations. Participants and&#xD;
      care partners will receive a one-time, 5.5-hour telehealth intervention from a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team specializing in diabetes. The overarching aim of this study is to&#xD;
      provide a sustainable model to provide diabetes specialty care to rural populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes prevalence is higher in rural areas that have lower resources to diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and support (DSMES), a cornerstone to optimal diabetes management.&#xD;
      A time efficient DSMES program delivered via telehealth by multidisciplinary experts that&#xD;
      also encourages care partner and peer support is a creative solution to increasing access to&#xD;
      DSMES and reducing disparities. This study is guided by the Research, Effectiveness,&#xD;
      Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. English and Spanish-speaking&#xD;
      participants and care partners will receive a one-time, 8-hour telehealth intervention at the&#xD;
      rural clinic where they receive their usual care, from the multidisciplinary team. The rural&#xD;
      clinical practices will provide feedback in two rounds, with iterative practice-level&#xD;
      changes, to address process and/or workflow issues. Our overall objective is to adapt,&#xD;
      implement, refine, and evaluate a time efficient DSMES program delivered via telehealth by a&#xD;
      team of multidisciplinary experts that encourages care partner and peer support to improve&#xD;
      A1C and diabetes self-management in rural communities to reduce disparities. Our&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team includes researchers and clinical healthcare providers with experience&#xD;
      in diabetes care, DSMES delivery, community-engaged research, practice-based research, and&#xD;
      rural health issues. The University of Utah and High Plains Research Network provide a strong&#xD;
      environment for this particular study. The proposed study will 1) adapt the exiting Diabetes&#xD;
      One-Day Program (D1D) for use in rural communities (Rural Diabetes One-Day Program or R-D1D),&#xD;
      2) conduct a patient-level pilot RCT to examine effects of R-D1D (intervention group) versus&#xD;
      standard patient education (attention control group), guided by the RE-AIM framework. Our&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to reduce health disparities in rural populations by increasing access to&#xD;
      diabetes specialty care using telehealth. Preliminary data support the D1D intervention, but&#xD;
      will require adaptation to translate for rural populations, then iterative refinement at the&#xD;
      practice level to support long-term maintenance. Such a tested, accepted intervention should&#xD;
      have a beneficial effect on diabetes self-management across multiple rural locations.&#xD;
