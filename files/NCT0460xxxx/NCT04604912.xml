  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a global burden, affecting patients, society as a whole and the economy. For&#xD;
      most common food allergies, patients synthesize specific IgE-antibodies against harmless food&#xD;
      proteins. Clinical phenotypes of food-allergic patients are highly diverse. Differences in&#xD;
      medical symptoms (organs, severity, delay), threshold and cross-reactivity levels suggest&#xD;
      variable underlying endotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify phenotypic biomarkers for advanced stratification of&#xD;
      food-allergic patients. Our study will consist of up to 50 participants (30 food-allergic, 20&#xD;
      tolerant), recruited in Luxembourg. Clinical samples will be collected before, during and&#xD;
      after the event of a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge for patients. Multi-omics&#xD;
      analyses of blood (sera, peripheral blood mononuclear cell, basophils) and stool will allow a&#xD;
      deeper understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms, including allergen metabolism&#xD;
      aspects, as well as the functional gut microbiome. Deciphering these basic aspects during the&#xD;
      present pilot study is expected to pave the way towards novel personalized medicine&#xD;
      approaches for diagnosing and treating of food-allergic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cooperation project between the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL), the&#xD;
      Luxemburg Institute of Health (LIH), the University of Luxembourg and the Integrated Biobank&#xD;
      of Luxemburg (IBBL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Food allergies are a global burden causing severe clinical reactions including&#xD;
      fatal anaphylaxis. Peanuts are counted among the most potent elicitors involved in&#xD;
      IgE-mediated food allergies. Peanut allergy is a relevant disease model because of its&#xD;
      steadily increasing prevalence and poor prognosis of outgrowth. Clinical phenotypes of&#xD;
      peanut-allergic patients are highly variable. Patients might experience variable medical&#xD;
      symptoms (organs, severity, delay), threshold and cross-reactivity levels suggest. Reliable&#xD;
      in-vitro biomarker allowing to predict clinical reactivity and score the patients into&#xD;
      reaction endotypes are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most important peanut allergens have been studied as to their biomolecular properties&#xD;
      biological activities and allergenic potency. The pronounced protein stability of potent&#xD;
      peanut allergens is thought to contribute to the molecules' allergenicity. Upon ingestion,&#xD;
      food proteins are broken down, entering the human body via epithelial surfaces. The identity&#xD;
      and the fate of immunologically active allergen peptides after epithelial absorption remains&#xD;
      elusive. Beyond this, complex immune cascades take place during acute allergic episodes. How&#xD;
      immune cells, such as lymphocytes, orchestrate in patients with different clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., sensitivity, severity) still remains to be solved. Several studies have shown that the&#xD;
      composition and the diversity of the gut microbiota is relevant for shaping the immune&#xD;
      response to food proteins. The functional interaction between host and gut microbiome, in the&#xD;
      context of symptom development and phenotypic variations, is unexplored until today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims. This project aims to explore putative biomarkers at various levels, at the level of&#xD;
      IgE-profiles, at the level of allergen absorption, at the level of scored basophil&#xD;
      reactivity, at the level of immune phenotypes and at the level of gut microbiome-host&#xD;
      interactions, by applying multiple omics technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners. The Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH), Department of Infection and Immunity&#xD;
      (DII; head Prof. M. Ollert) has the scientific project lead (Principal Investigator Dr. A.&#xD;
      Kuehn). Main clinical partners are Dr. F. Codreanu-Morel from the National Unit of&#xD;
      Immunology-Allergology, Centre Hospitalier (CHL), Luxembourg, as well as Prof. C.&#xD;
      Bindslev-Jensen from Odense Research Centre for Anaphylaxis (ORCA), Denmark. Partner for the&#xD;
      execution of the clinical part will be the Clinical and Epidemiological Investigation Center&#xD;
      (CIEC, LIH) headed by Dr. M. Gantenbein. The Integrated Biobank of Luxembourg (IBBL) will&#xD;
      prepare and store clinical samples until use. Clinical samples (blood, sera, plasma) will be&#xD;
      analyzed at DII, LIH. Stool samples will be investigated with the help of Prof. P. Wilmes&#xD;
      from the Systems Ecology research group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project implementation. Food challenges (OFC) to peanut will be proceeded according to&#xD;
      official guidelines (European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, EAACI). Healthy&#xD;
      controls (N=10) will be split, half will receive a single food dose of up to 100 g of roasted&#xD;
      peanuts (open OFC) and the other half will be tested with up to 5 incremental doses&#xD;
      (double-blind placebo-controlled OFC) using the same doses as for allergic patients. For&#xD;
      single-dose OFC, blood samples from controls will be taken before the OFC and at 30 minutes,&#xD;
      at 60 minutes and at 120 minutes. Controls receiving 5 incremental allergen doses will be&#xD;
      subjected to blood sampling before the beginning of the OFC and 1 h after the end of the&#xD;
      challenge. As a further control arm in the study, allergenic food from animal origin will be&#xD;
      used in OFC. Further healthy controls (N=10) will receive either a single food dose of up to&#xD;
      200 g of cooked fish (open OFC) and the other half will be tested with up to 5 incremental&#xD;
      doses (double-blind placebo-controlled OFC). Doses in a range of 10 mg to 100 g of fish will&#xD;
      be selected for the blinded OFC with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic participants (N=30) will ingest incremental doses of peanuts. The OFC doses will be&#xD;
      in the range of 5 mg, 15 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 390 mg, 790 mg, 1,580 mg, 3,160 mg and&#xD;
      5,530 mg of roasted peanut. Maximum five doses will be selected from the above mentioned&#xD;
      ranges of peanut doses. Upon observation of allergic symptoms, the OFC will be stopped. If no&#xD;
      allergic symptoms occurred during a food challenge with five incremental doses, the patient&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in a second oral provocation (min. 14 days later) in order to&#xD;
      undergo a test with higher allergen doses. Blood samples from allergic study participants&#xD;
      will be drawn prior, during and after OFC (0, 60, 150, 180 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples from peanut-allergic participants (n=30) and healthy controls (n=20) will be&#xD;
      collected earliest 2 months after the food challenge. Prior sampling, participants should not&#xD;
      have used antibiotics within the last month, or have recent/ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      (= diarrhea; Bristol scale 5-7) at the time of stool collection. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      collection kit at home, containing special sampling tubes, gloves and instructions. In&#xD;
      addition, patients are asked to record their food intake for the last 24 hours before&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected clinical samples will be pseudonymized at the clinical centers. A synonym list, as&#xD;
      part of the investigator file, containing the information on the participants' identity and&#xD;
      the corresponding pseudonym, will be available at the clinical center only (medical&#xD;
      investigators) and at CIEC. Personal data is protected under the regulation (EU) 2016/679 of&#xD;
      27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data&#xD;
      (GDPR) and the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Data Protection&#xD;
      Commission and the General Data Protection Act.&#xD;
