  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of orthodontic treatment is one of the exacerbation causes of orthodontic pain.&#xD;
      Several methods have been suggested to reduce the duration of orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      classified to surgical and non-surgical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers used minimally invasive surgical methods like corticision, piezocision,&#xD;
      micro-osteoperforation, and piezopuncture indicated that most of these methods can accelerate&#xD;
      dental movement by 20 - 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of corticision as a minimally invasive procedure on root resorption and dehiscence&#xD;
      formation during orthodontic tooth movement has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying corticision on the lower anterior teeth using a surgical blade and a hammer may&#xD;
      accelerate tooth alignment during orthodontic treatment. This study consists of two groups,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of these two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontically induced external root resorption accompanying orthodontic treatment is&#xD;
      defined as a microscopic loss of root tissue as a result of the inflammatory reaction that&#xD;
      occurs in the area of application of orthodontic force. It can be diagnosed and measured&#xD;
      using conventional radiography or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dehiscence is a loss of alveolar bone on the facial (rarely lingual) aspect of a tooth that&#xD;
      leaves a characteristic v-shaped, root-exposed defect from the cementoenamel junction&#xD;
      apically. Bone dehiscence cannot be detected through conventional radiography or clinical&#xD;
      examination. Actually, CBCT can be considered the best accessible technique providing 3D&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticision is one of the minimally invasive surgical procedures that is not associated with&#xD;
      flap lifting. It was used to accelerate tooth movement in animals and case report studies.&#xD;
      Its application on humans may aggravate their fear and anxiety towards the pain that may&#xD;
      accompany this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has compared flapless corticision in the&#xD;
      non-extraction-based orthodontic decrowding of lower anterior teeth (LAT) with the&#xD;
      conventional treatment in terms of external apical root resorption (EARR) and dehiscence&#xD;
      formation (DF).&#xD;

    <time_frame>T1: one day before the beginning of the orthodontic treatment, T2: exactly at 12 months following the onset of orthodontic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cone-beam computed tomography imaging will be used for the lower jaw. Any V-shaped bone defect located buccally or lingually in the lower anterior region involving bone margin is preliminarily identified as dehiscence. This is going to be measured and the proportion of the presence of such defects will be calculated on two different occasions (T1 and T2).</description>
