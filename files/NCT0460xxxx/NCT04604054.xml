  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients who suffered from recurrent implantation failure in intracytoplasmic&#xD;
      sperm injection (ICSI) were allocated in the study. On ovum pick-up day, 50 of them were&#xD;
      intrauterine injected with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the other 50&#xD;
      were injected with intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotropins (HCG). The clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      rate was evaluated as a primary outcome and ultrasound imaging of the gestational sac was&#xD;
      evaluated as a secondary outcome&#xD;

      One hundred patients suffering from recurrent implantation failure in intracytoplasmic sperm&#xD;
      injection (ICSI) were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into two&#xD;
      groups. The intervention group consisted of 50 patients who received intrauterine injected&#xD;
      with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The other group (the control group)&#xD;
      consisted of 50 patients and injected with intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotropins (HCG).&#xD;
      Both groups received the interventions at ovum pick-up day. The main outcome was the clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate which has been evaluated after 2 weeks of the positive pregnancy test. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome was an ultrasound image of the gestational sac after 6 weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;
