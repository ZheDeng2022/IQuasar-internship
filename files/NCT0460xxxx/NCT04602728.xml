  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how teenagers with chronic pain and sickle cell&#xD;
      disease respond to a new training program called Back2Life and get their feedback about how&#xD;
      to modify the program to best fit their needs. The Back2Life training program focuses on&#xD;
      teaching pain coping skills (also known as cognitive-behavioral therapy). The program teaches&#xD;
      skills and strategies that may help teens improve chronic pain management and get back into&#xD;
      their everyday activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the hemoglobin in which the course of&#xD;
      acute pain from vaso-occlusion and its sequelae vary widely across genotypes and individual&#xD;
      patients. SCD pain often begins during childhood and can progress to chronic pain for&#xD;
      approximately 23% of children and adolescents. Youth with chronic SCD pain, that is pain that&#xD;
      is present on most days per month and persists for at least 6 months, report high levels of&#xD;
      functional disability, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and reduced quality of life&#xD;
      relative to youth with SCD without chronic pain. The complex, multifactorial nature of&#xD;
      chronic SCD pain can also contribute to increased healthcare utilization for pain. The most&#xD;
      effective management and treatment of chronic SCD pain likely requires individualized,&#xD;
      multimodal, multidisciplinary treatments that go beyond pharmacological management alone. A&#xD;
      range of evidence-based non-pharmacological treatments, such as behavioral health,&#xD;
      complementary, and integrative health approaches, are recommended for chronic pain management&#xD;
      and are gaining greater awareness and integration into comprehensive chronic pain care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral health treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain, focuses on&#xD;
      improved daily functioning and coping through several core treatment components such as&#xD;
      psychoeducation about how the body processes pain, relaxation skills training, and cognitive&#xD;
      strategies. Youth with chronic SCD pain need an evidence-based, culturally informed, adaptive&#xD;
      treatment. Behavioral treatments that are tailored to patient and family needs are beneficial&#xD;
      when patients may require different levels of care. Adaptive designs are more effective in&#xD;
      improving health outcomes, satisfaction with treatment, and reducing healthcare use than&#xD;
      standard protocols where patients receive a fixed &quot;one size fits all&quot; treatment that is not&#xD;
      personalized to their needs; adaptive designs are also recommended for tailoring&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions with culturally diverse populations. Adaptive treatments can&#xD;
      integrate evidence-based strategies to address common co-morbid problems associated with&#xD;
      chronic pain, such as elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance. Teaching&#xD;
      parents problem-solving skills can reduce caregiver stress among families managing chronic&#xD;
      pain and illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize an adaptive behavioral treatment to target psychosocial risk factors&#xD;
      for youth with chronic SCD pain as a first step towards developing a stepped care model for&#xD;
      SCD pain.&#xD;

    <description>The Back2Life intervention uses an adaptive treatment approach with module-based treatment sessions selected on the basis of baseline assessment (rather than a fixed treatment approach) to allow flexibility in tailoring treatment components to meet individual family needs. All youth participants will receive the standard 6-session pain coping skills training program, consisting of learning ways to cope with and manage chronic sickle cell pain. The standard program includes topics that were identified by young people with chronic sickle cell pain and their parents as important skills for all youth with chronic pain and sickle cell disease. In addition to the standard 6-session program, youth participants may receive an additional 1 to 4 sessions that may help with specific problems and/or co-morbidities related to pain. At least one parent or guardian is required to attend the sessions with their child.</description>
