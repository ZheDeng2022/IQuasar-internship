  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare the efficiency in&#xD;
      preventing perioperative hypothermia of a continuous active prewarming combined with active&#xD;
      intraoperative warming versus passive prewarming plus intraoperative warming for short&#xD;
      outpatient surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of accidental perioperative hypothermia is high, ranging from 20 to 90% in the&#xD;
      literature, and its prevention still remains a major issue despite the many existing&#xD;
      prevention techniques. Perioperative hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature below&#xD;
      36.0 ° Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deleterious effects of perioperative hypothermia are well known : increased risk of wound&#xD;
      infection, adverse cardiac events and blood loss. Moreover, the pharmacology of anesthetic&#xD;
      agents can be altered by hypothermia, which in turn could lengthen the emergence of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Patient comfort and satisfaction are also related to hypothermia and the feeling&#xD;
      of cold generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, hypothermia may be associated with prolonged length of stay in the recovery room and in&#xD;
      the hospital for outpatient surgeries. Therefore, hypothermia can indirectly increase the&#xD;
      costs of an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques have been described for the prevention of perioperative hypothermia.&#xD;
      Passive warming is a method used to prevent heat loss such as warm cotton blankets, drapes or&#xD;
      plastics whereas active warming consist in adding heat to the body surface using a warming&#xD;
      system such as forced-air warming to increase mean body temperature. So, the use of a&#xD;
      prewarming, an active warming before induction of anesthesia, could reduce the potential for&#xD;
      redistribution, the main mechanism of hypothermia under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a literature review, the combined use of active prewarming with intraoperative&#xD;
      active warming appears to be the most effective technique in preventing hypothermia upon&#xD;
      arrival in the recovery room for inpatient surgeries lasting longer than 30 minutes. In the&#xD;
      literature, the majority of publications on prewarming focus on surgeries lasting at least&#xD;
      one hour, despite strong recommendations to use active warming for surgeries of 30 minutes or&#xD;
      more. There is not so much data regarding the efficiency of continuous prewarming for short&#xD;
      outpatient surgeries, from the preoperative unit to induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled study is designed to evaluate if the combination of a&#xD;
      continuous active prewarming of at least 30 minutes (Flex Warming Gown, Bair Paws, 3M) with&#xD;
      an active intraoperative warming (Bair Hugger, 3M) would be effective in demonstrating a&#xD;
      significant difference in temperature at the end of surgery between the two groups (control&#xD;
      and intervention) for short (30 to 120 minutes) outpatient surgeries under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. This intervention will be compared to the standard care which are a passive&#xD;
      warming preoperatively with an active intraoperative warming.&#xD;
