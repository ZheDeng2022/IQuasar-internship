      A study for identification of immune determinants for response to Nivolumab in Recurrent&#xD;
      /Metastatic HNSCC(Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is incurable and requires&#xD;
      aggressive treatment, resulting in functional disability, dismal prognosis, and high&#xD;
      mortality rate. Prognosis of Recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      is poor, with limited treatment options and survival rates of 6-9 months following&#xD;
      standard-of-care (SOC) therapies. Clinical trials have demonstrated promising clinical&#xD;
      activity of anti PD-1(programmed death-1) therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      Currently, nivolumab were approved for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma refractory to&#xD;
      platinum-based therapy. However, the response rate of anti PD-1(programmed death-1) therapy&#xD;
      is relatively low and durable clinical benefit is limited to the minority of patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, the presence of PD-1(programmed death-1) did not clearly predict response and&#xD;
      treatment survival outcome, reflecting imperfection of this biomarker. Actually,&#xD;
      PD-1(programmed death-1) negativity cannot preclude the therapeutic benefit of&#xD;
      PD-1(programmed death-1) blockade, and vice versa. Hence, development of reliable predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers is essential for proper patient selection to maximize clinical benefit of&#xD;
      PD-1(programmed death-1) blockade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we need to select patients who are most likely to benefit from anti&#xD;
      PD-1(programmed death-1) therapy and identify the better biomarker to predict the response to&#xD;
      PD-1(programmed death-1) blockade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. patients&#xD;
      earlier than tumor assessment by imaging scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we aimed to elucidate immune-related biomarkers to predict response&#xD;
      with tumor tissue and peripheral blood from Recurrent /Metastatic HNSCC(Head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma) patients treated with nivolumab.&#xD;
