  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The post market surveillance study will employ a prospective, multi-center, single-arm,&#xD;
      observational design to capture data on children who undergo CRRT using the Carpediem™&#xD;
      system. Participating clinicians will manage subjects in accordance to their local standard&#xD;
      of care practices and decisions on initiating, modifying or discontinuing CRRT are up to the&#xD;
      local investigative team's prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 centers in the United States, that have been trained on the use of the&#xD;
      Carpediem™ system, will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining institutional&#xD;
      review board approval and written informed consent from a parent or legally authorized&#xD;
      representative (LAR), data from all subjects treated with the Carpediem™ system will be&#xD;
      included in the study. A minimum of 35 subjects will be enrolled and sites may be asked to&#xD;
      screen and enroll patients for the study for up to 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status of subjects discharged from hospital will be collected at 30- and-90 days following&#xD;
      hospital discharge by phone interviews in accordance to local standard of care practices,&#xD;
      review of in-hospital records or in-clinic visit, as available.&#xD;

      The post market surveillance study is designed to capture data in the real-world clinical&#xD;
      setting on the use of the Carpediem™ system and will evaluate the safety and performance in&#xD;
      children requiring CRRT in the US. Data on survival and the effectiveness of the Carpediem™&#xD;
      system on renal function recovery will be evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of subjects&#xD;
      being treated with Carpediem™ will include, but is not limited to, acuity at hospital/ICU&#xD;
      admission and prior to CRRT initiation, Carpediem™ treatment parameters, laboratory data, and&#xD;
      requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic support. Subject status and&#xD;
      requirement for renal replacement therapy post hospital discharge will be evaluated at 30-&#xD;
      and 90-days.&#xD;
