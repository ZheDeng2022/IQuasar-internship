  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Yale New Haven Hospital, parents on the postpartum ward receive a Take 5 program to help&#xD;
      train and prepare parents for strategies to manage their infant's crying. Inconsolable crying&#xD;
      is a leading cause for abusive head trauma (AHT) in infants, and the Take 5 program has&#xD;
      proven effective in reducing rates of AHT. However, it is also important to examine new ways&#xD;
      of improving AHT preventative programs to optimize outcomes for infants. The purpose of this&#xD;
      proposal is to determine whether adding a one-minute audio-clip of an infant crying, which&#xD;
      specifically addresses AHT, to the Take 5 message given to parents of newborns on the&#xD;
      postpartum floor of the hospital strengthens the preventive message. This is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) of parents on the postpartum ward; half will receive just Take 5, and&#xD;
      the other half will receive the audio-clip and Take 5. Our hypotheses to be tested are that&#xD;
      relative to parents who had Take 5 alone, those parents who hear the audio-clip before&#xD;
      learning Take 5 will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have higher HR/BPs and higher negative affect after the training session&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Be more likely to remember use Take 5 when they became frustrated with their infant's&#xD;
           crying when followed up 6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Be more likely to tell other people about Take 5 and be more likely to say Take 5 was&#xD;
           useful.&#xD;

      The purpose of this proposal is to determine whether adding the one-minute audio-clip of an&#xD;
      infant crying to the Take 5 message given to parents of newborns on the postpartum floor of&#xD;
      the hospital strengthens the preventive message. To do this, a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) will be conducted. The investigators would like to determine if the anticipatory&#xD;
      guidance of Take 5 is strengthened by hearing a 1-minute audio-clip of an infant crying&#xD;
      followed by a preventive message about abusive head trauma, which was used as a radio public&#xD;
      service announcement in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of a non-programmatic effort to reduce&#xD;
      the rates of AHT and is used with permission. All families in the post-partum unit are&#xD;
      eligible to have the Take 5 message as part of their anticipatory guidance before newborn&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done based on the postpartum day of life. If the infant's postpartum&#xD;
      date of life is an even number, parents will get Take 5 only; for odd numbers, they would get&#xD;
      Take 5 and the audio PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, three baseline self-report measures will be obtained: the Reflective&#xD;
      Functioning Questionnaire, the Parenting Stress Index, and the Emotion Regulation&#xD;
      Questionnaire; and 5 measures will be obtained at baseline and after the recording: blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, and affect descriptors. Affective descriptors include the Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Affective Scale and Likert-scales of self-reported levels of stress and frustration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline measures have been obtained, all parents will receive the current standard&#xD;
      of care -- Take 5, the safety plan for crying. For infants born on odd days, the audio&#xD;
      recording will be played before the parent is taught Take 5. For infants born on even days,&#xD;
      the parent will receive Take 5. After obtaining the post-recording self-report and&#xD;
      physiological measures, we will also ask parents using a 5-point Likert the extent to which&#xD;
      Take 5 (both conditions), and the audio recording (odd condition only) might impact them and&#xD;
      the caregiving practices related to their infant. About six weeks after, each parent will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone and asked about his/her memory of the recording, how many and whom they&#xD;
      told about the recording, and what effect if any the recording had on their self-awareness&#xD;
      about crying and about their behaviors toward their infant. We will use a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale to have parents who heard the audiotape before being taught. Take 5 describe the extent&#xD;
      to which the recording had impacted them and their infant caregiving practices. We will also&#xD;
      ask all parents what impact Take 5 had on their caregiving using 5-point Likert scales as&#xD;
      well. The research protocol in the hospital should take no longer than 25 minutes. This&#xD;
      second (telephone) interview will also be audio recorded, and then a transcript will be made&#xD;
      for analysis. A scripted questionnaire will be used to conduct a telephone interview (see&#xD;
      attached Interview.docx). This second interview should last approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data to be collected on the sample includes parental age, parental sex, parental&#xD;
      ethnicity, marital status, the highest level of education (in years), number of children, age&#xD;
      of the youngest child, age of other children (if any), number of people living in the&#xD;
      household. We will also collect two contact phone numbers and an email address for the&#xD;
      participant. We will also collect information on child outcomes, namely: mode of delivery,&#xD;
      gestational age, gestational birth weight, and any complications following delivery.&#xD;
