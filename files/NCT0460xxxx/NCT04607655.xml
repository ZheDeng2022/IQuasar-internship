      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of orally administered GB1211 a gelectin-3 inhibitor over 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will receive two doses of GB1211, each given twice per day and compared to&#xD;
      placebo in participants with fibrotic NASH&#xD;
