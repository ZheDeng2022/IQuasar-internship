    <textblock>
      In this three-year proposal, we will explore the MRI-visible EPVS in CAA and investigate its&#xD;
      pathophysiology using animal models. Our specific aims include: (1) Establish the&#xD;
      relationship of MRI-visible enlarged perivascular space and CAA, (2) Determine whether&#xD;
      vascular amyloid clearance in CAA is associated with lymphatic drainage system, (3) Establish&#xD;
      longitudinal data for MRI-visible enlarged perivascular space and cerebral amyloid angiopathy&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) involves amyloid deposition in the vessel walls in the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex and overlying leptomeninges, causing symptomatic intracerebral lobar&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly. CAA is considered as a form of cerebral small&#xD;
      vessel disease, which refers to a group of vascular pathologies that affect the small vessels&#xD;
      of the brain. In addition to lobar ICH, patients may present with other parenchymal injuries&#xD;
      that can be detected on blood-sensitive MRI, such as multiple strictly lobar cerebral&#xD;
      microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis and leukoariosis. Recently, CAA has been&#xD;
      suggested in association with MRI-visible enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) in&#xD;
      centrum-semiovale (CSO), contrary to more severe MRI-visible EPVS in basal ganglia that is&#xD;
      frequently found in chronic hypertension. The dilated perivascular space in CAA is suggestive&#xD;
      of chronic poor perivascular drainage of the leptomeningeal arteries, predisposing&#xD;
      individuals to impaired or altered meningeal lymphatic drainage and causing defect in amyloid&#xD;
      clearance and subsequent CAA development. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether lymphatic&#xD;
      drainage are the main routes for vascular amyloid clearance, and its relationship to the&#xD;
      long-term outcome has not been clearly investigated in clinical patients yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this three-year proposal, we will explore the MRI-visible EPVS in CAA and investigate its&#xD;
      pathophysiology using animal models. Our specific aims include: (1) Establish the&#xD;
      relationship of MRI-visible enlarged perivascular space and CAA, (2) Determine whether&#xD;
      vascular amyloid clearance in CAA is associated with lymphatic drainage system, (3) Establish&#xD;
      longitudinal data for MRI-visible enlarged perivascular space and cerebral amyloid angiopathy&#xD;
      progression. In the first year, we will recruit spontaneous ICH patients for brain MRI, in&#xD;
      vivo amyloid imaging and measuring their plasma Aβ40/42 levels. We aim to confirm EPVS in CSO&#xD;
      as a specific marker for CAA, and to provide direct evidence that dilated perivascular space&#xD;
      is worse with more advanced CAA; For the second year, we plan to use transgenic CAA mouse&#xD;
      models to confirm that meningeal lymphatic drainage routes are crucial for clearance of&#xD;
      vascular amyloid-β. We will manipulate the lymphatic drainage routes by either blockage or&#xD;
      enhancement of the lymphatic vessels, to see if the vascular amyloid clearance is affected;&#xD;
      For the third year, the main research focus will on be establishing the longitudinal data on&#xD;
      amyloid and tau deposition in clinical ICH patients. We plan to repeat in vivo amyloid&#xD;
      imaging in 2 years, for the purpose of validating our hypothesis in human that baseline worse&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage function is associated with quicker cerebral vascular amyloid progression&#xD;
      or prediction of future CAA development. We will also recruit patients for in vivo tau&#xD;
      imaging to investigate long-term neuronal injury and neurodegeneration, namely tau-mediated&#xD;
      neurofibrillary tangle, in relation to the impaired perivascular drainage in CAA.&#xD;
