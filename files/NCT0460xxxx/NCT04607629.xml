      This is a randomized, double-blind, comparative, parallel-group study of the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Genolar® and Xolair® in the treatment of persistent atopic bronchial asthma of&#xD;
      moderate and severe course, whose symptoms are insufficiently controlled by the 4-step&#xD;
      treatment GINA (2017)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing incidence of bronchial asthma (BA) and other allergic diseases around&#xD;
      the world. Bronchial asthma suffers from 4 to 10% of the world population, in Russian&#xD;
      Federation, the incidence of BA across the adult population ranges from 2.2 to 5-7%, in the&#xD;
      child population is about 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe BA is associated not only with frequent hospitalizations and increased mortality but&#xD;
      also with high treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to it, there is a hot button issue of developing new drugs for treating patients not to be&#xD;
      achieved effectively with standard therapy. Considering the leading pathogenesis role of&#xD;
      IgE-mediated allergy, the use of drugs to block IgE makes it possible to control the disease&#xD;
      at the earliest allergic reaction phase of the development. It was shown that the IgE&#xD;
      elimination from the mast cells and basophils surface reduced the severity of acute allergic&#xD;
      reactions, reduced the allergen-induced late phase of the immune response and infiltration&#xD;
      with inflammatory cells. These anti-IgE antibodies effects have been shown in various&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genolar® (omalizumab) (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, the Russian Federation) is a humanized recombinant&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody selectively binding to immunoglobulin (IgE) and is a biosimilar of Xolar®&#xD;
      (&quot;Novartis Pharma AG&quot;, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This III phase study is aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Genolar® (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, Russia) and Xolair® to register of the drug Genolar® (JSC&#xD;
      &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, the Russian Federation), a lyophilizate for subcutaneous administration, in the&#xD;
      Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included patients (n = 192) aged 18 to 75 years with moderate to severe persistent&#xD;
      atopic bronchial asthma. The diagnosis was documented for ≥1 year. The symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease were insufficiently controlled by therapy corresponding to the 4th stage of treatment&#xD;
      (GINA, 2017) during ≥2 months before screening. With block randomization, the patients were&#xD;
      divided into two groups in a 2: 1 ratio: in group 1 - 127 patients received treatment with&#xD;
      Genolar® for 52 weeks ± 3 days, in group 2 - 64 patients received treatment with Xolair® for&#xD;
      26 weeks ± 3 days. The study consisted of a screening period, an induction period for basic&#xD;
      treatment standardizing with the using inhaled budesonide + formoterol, a comparative period&#xD;
      of treatment with the studied drugs (Genolar® vs. Xolair®) for 26 weeks ± 3 days, and an&#xD;
      additional period of continuing treatment with Genolar® for 26 ± 1 week for its long-term&#xD;
      immunogenicity study.&#xD;
