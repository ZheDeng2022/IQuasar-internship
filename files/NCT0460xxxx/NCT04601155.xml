  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing kidney transplantation alone (either de-novo or re-transplant) at a&#xD;
      participating hospital are routinely surveyed with interval blood tests as part of standard&#xD;
      post-operative care through outpatient consultation. These tests include serum creatinine,&#xD;
      blood sugar as well as DSA testing at various intervals. The ability to screen patients to&#xD;
      better identify those who may be at risk of developing an adverse event using AlloSure cfDNA&#xD;
      is likely to be advantageous, with the potential to improve graft survival and outcomes for&#xD;
      transplant patients. The addition of AlloSure to the interventional group will be the focus&#xD;
      of this study. Patients will have quarterly AlloSure cfDNA testing (every 3 months) and DSA&#xD;
      as part of their post-transplant surveillance for a period of 5 years.Participants will&#xD;
      attend outpatient visits/follow-up visits as part of their standard care, these will include&#xD;
      appointments where they will have blood tests taken as part of post-transplant surveillance.&#xD;
      For AlloSure cfDNA and DSA, blood will be taken quarterly.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have quarterly AlloSure cfDNA testing (every 3 months) and DSA as part of their post-transplant surveillance for a period of 5 years. For the quarterly AlloSure tests, approximately 20 mL of blood will be obtained in Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes and shipped to CareDx, Inc. (Brisbane, CA) to analyze the presence of donor-derived cell-free DNA.</description>

    <description>AlloSure is an analytically validated targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that uses single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to measure the fraction of dd-cfDNA in transplant patients without the need for genotyping either the donor or the recipient.8</description>
