  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a form of cognitive function that is known to be&#xD;
      directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research in&#xD;
      healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to&#xD;
      enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant&#xD;
      (basal ganglia) network effects - hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal&#xD;
      ganglia dysfunction. To date, however, only null-effects have been reported in persons with&#xD;
      PD. In the present study, the investigators will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered&#xD;
      over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the Serial Reaction Time task, in persons with PD.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the&#xD;
      application of tDCS but also short-term (five minutes post-tDCS) and long-term (one week&#xD;
      post-tDCS) consolidation effects, as previous studies suggest that tDCS exerts its beneficial&#xD;
      effects on IMSL in a consolidation phase rather than in an acquisition phase. Establishing&#xD;
      possible consolidation effects is of a particular interest, as long-term effects are vital&#xD;
      for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a single-blind, sham-controlled, counterbalanced study to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of M1 tDCS on IMSL. As age-related effects may serve as an&#xD;
      explanation for the conflicting findings in healthy young adults and persons with PD, the&#xD;
      investigators will include a healthy control group, age-matched to the PD group. For the&#xD;
      sequence-specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome), a mixed factorial repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will be carried out with &quot;group&quot; (2 levels: PD, healthy) as between-subjects factor and&#xD;
      &quot;stimulation&quot; (2 levels: anodal, sham), &quot;blocks&quot; (2 levels: random block, mean of adjacent&#xD;
      blocks) and &quot;time&quot; (3 levels: during, post5min, post1week) as within-subjects factors.&#xD;
      Similarly, for general learning (secondary outcome), a mixed factorial repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA will be carried out with &quot;group&quot; (2 levels: PD, healthy) as between-subjects factor and&#xD;
      &quot;stimulation&quot; (2 levels: anodal, sham), &quot;blocks&quot; (7 levels: Blocks 1-6, Block 8) and &quot;time&quot;&#xD;
      (3 levels: during, post5min, post1week) as within-subjects factors. All participants will&#xD;
      receive both anodal (real) and sham (placebo) tDCS in a random order. Counterbalancing will&#xD;
      be done by an independent investigator using Microsoft Excel®. Baseline scores on the Scales&#xD;
      for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease COGnition (SCOPA-COG), Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires, as well as clinical&#xD;
      subtypes (akinetic-rigid subtype, tremor subtype) and sequence awareness scores will be taken&#xD;
      up as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with PD will be recruited via following instances and centres: the Flemish Parkinson&#xD;
      Liga (VPL); neurologists of the University Hospital of Brussels (UZ Brussel), University&#xD;
      Colleges Leuven-Limburg (UCLL) and RevArte rehabilitation centre (Antwerp); private&#xD;
      physiotherapy practitioners specialized in neurologic rehabilitation. Age-matched healthy&#xD;
      participants will be recruited via the PD candidates (partners of the patients), several&#xD;
      residential care homes in and around Brussels and by posting digital flyers on social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no restrictions or prohibitions for the subjects. Participants will continue to&#xD;
      take their medication during the trial period, and will perform the experimental procedure&#xD;
      during the ON-phase of their medication. This is in order to maximize feasibility to perform&#xD;
      the task and for the sake of uniformity with previous studies examining tDCS effects in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1x1 Low Intensity Direct Current Stimulator (Soterix Medical Inc, New York, USA) will be&#xD;
      used to generate and deliver tDCS through a pair of identical square rubber electrodes (size&#xD;
      35 cm2), placed in rectangular saline-soaked sponges. For the stimulation of M1, electrodes&#xD;
      will be placed over C3 or C4 according to the international 10-20 electroencephalogram&#xD;
      system, matching with the M1 contralateral to the performing hand. The reference electrode&#xD;
      will be positioned on F1 or F2, ipsilateral to the performing hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current stimulation will be slowly ramped up from 0 milliampere (mA) to 2 mA in one&#xD;
      minute. For the anodal tDCS condition, this intensity will be maintained for the duration of&#xD;
      the SRT-task (approximately 20 minutes), which is well within evidence-based safety standards&#xD;
      for tDCS. This will result in a current density of 0,057 mA/cm2. For the sham tDCS condition&#xD;
      - unbeknown to the subject - stimulation will be gradually decreased towards 0 mA immediately&#xD;
      after the one-minute ramp-up. During the last block of the SRT-task, this gradual ramping-up&#xD;
      and -down of the current stimulation will be repeated to optimize the process of blinding of&#xD;
      participants. To control for blinding of the subjects, after the last session subjects will&#xD;
      be asked whether they were aware of the stimulation condition or not. Transient side-effects&#xD;
      will be inventoried by the experimenter during and two weeks after the tDCS protocol,&#xD;
      including a slight itching sensation under the electrode, redness of the skin under the&#xD;
      electrode, headache, nausea, fatigue or insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Serial Reaction Time task (SRT-task) will be used to determine IMSL. The SRT- task will&#xD;
      be performed on a laptop using E-Prime® software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Participants will be asked to press the horizontally aligned&#xD;
      response keys C, V, B, N of a standard azerty keyboard for a leftmost, left, right, rightmost&#xD;
      target, respectively. Responses will be given with the index finger of the least affected&#xD;
      hand in the case of the persons with PD and with the dominant hand in the case of the healthy&#xD;
      controls. If both hands are equally affected in the persons with PD, the dominant hand will&#xD;
      be used as well. The response keys C, V, B and N will be the only visible keys, all other&#xD;
      keys will be covered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will take place at a laboratory of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in&#xD;
      the participants' home environment, or at a nearby community centre of their choosing, under&#xD;
      supervision of the investigator. The option to conduct the experiment outside of our&#xD;
      laboratory at the VUB is given as displacements are not always evident for these&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedure will be preceded by an in-person interview to collect general&#xD;
      clinical and demographic characteristics. A shortened, 3-block x 25 trials random SRT-task&#xD;
      will also be performed to assess whether participants have sufficient motor function to&#xD;
      complete the experiments. Following the interview, a neuropsychological assessment will be&#xD;
      done by means of three questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be used to assess cognitive function&#xD;
           across 8 domains (executive functions, visuospatial skills, attention, concentration,&#xD;
           language, short term memory and orientation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease, COGnition part (SCOPA-COG) is a short,&#xD;
           reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of cognitive function in PD. It&#xD;
           consists of 10 items, divided over four domains: memory (4 items), executive function (3&#xD;
           items), attention (2 items) and visuospatial function (1 item). Scored 0-43, with lower&#xD;
           scores indicating more severe cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a two-dimension scale developed to&#xD;
           identify depression and anxiety. It consists of 14 items, divided into two 7-item&#xD;
           subscales. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absence) to 3 (extreme&#xD;
           presence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants' motor function will be assessed by means of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III), one of the most widely&#xD;
      used clinical rating scales for PD, which consists of 4 parts. For the present study, only&#xD;
      part III will be used, which assesses motor function by means of 14 items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the screening session (T0), all eligible participants will be seen four times&#xD;
      (T1-T4) over the course of minimally five to maximally eleven weeks. All four sessions (T1,&#xD;
      T2, T3, T4) will start with a practice block of the SRT-task consisting of 72 random trials,&#xD;
      followed by the actual experimental SRT-task of eight blocks of 72 trials. Blocks will be&#xD;
      separated by a thirty second break. In Blocks 1 through 6 and Block 8, the order of the&#xD;
      target (i.e. black dot) locations will follow a repeating sequence. This is unbeknown to the&#xD;
      participant. The rationale is that reaction times will decrease with repetition of the&#xD;
      sequence throughout blocks 1-6 and 8, denoting a general training effect (secondary outcome&#xD;
      measure IMSL). When the sequence suddenly changes to a random sequence in Block 7, reaction&#xD;
      time will increase in Block 7 and decrease once more in regularly sequenced Block 8, denoting&#xD;
      a sequence-specific learning effect (primary outcome measure IMSL). To control for possible&#xD;
      carry-over effects, the SRT-task will follow a different sequence in each stimulation&#xD;
      condition (e.g. 132342134142 in T1-T2 and 243413241213 in T3-T4). To make sure IMSL is&#xD;
      independent of a specific sequence, six different, structurally identical, sequences of 12&#xD;
      elements long will be counterbalanced between the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interventional session (T1) will be planned at least 1 week after the screening&#xD;
      session (T0) and will consist of active (anodal) tDCS or sham (placebo) tDCS administered&#xD;
      during the SRT-task. Five minutes post-tDCS, subjects will be asked to carry out a short,&#xD;
      three-block version of the SRT-task without application of tDCS to investigate potential&#xD;
      short-term consolidation effects: Blocks 1 and 3 following the same regular sequence as&#xD;
      earlier; Block 2 following a random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session (T2) will be planned one week later. During this one-week post-tDCS&#xD;
      session the same, full version of the SRT-task from one week earlier will be performed, this&#xD;
      time without the application of tDCS, to determine potential long-term consolidation effects.&#xD;
      After T2, a washout period of at least three weeks will be planned to control for carry-over&#xD;
      effects between the two stimulation conditions (active/sham tDCS). Cross-over will take place&#xD;
      and the same procedure with the opposite stimulation condition will be repeated during the&#xD;
      third (T3) interventional and fourth (T4) follow-up session. Half of participants in each&#xD;
      group will have received active tDCS during T1 and sham tDCS during T3, while the other half&#xD;
      of participants will have received these conditions in reversed and randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session, the SRT-task will be started within 90 minutes after medication intake&#xD;
      (&quot;ON-phase of medication&quot;). This is in order to maximize feasibility to perform the task and&#xD;
      for the sake of uniformity with previous studies examining tDCS effects in PD. A&#xD;
      post-SRT-task questionnaire will be completed after the last session (T4) to determine&#xD;
      whether participants became aware of the sequential nature of the task. If participants&#xD;
      indicate that they believe a specific sequence appeared, they will have to reproduce the&#xD;
      sequence of the last session as correct as possible. This sequential score (x/12, based on&#xD;
      the highest number of sequence elements they can reproduce in the correct order) will serve&#xD;
      as the outcome measure for explicit knowledge regarding the repeating sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be carried out using International Business Machines (IBM)&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics version 26. The level of&#xD;
      significance will be set at α = 0.05. A trend towards significance will be defined as 0.05 ≤&#xD;
      α &lt; 0.10. Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons will be made when necessary.&#xD;
      Cohen's f effect sizes will be reported, with values of .10, .25, and .40 representing small,&#xD;
      medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of null-effects, the investigators will conclude that there is no evidence of a&#xD;
      difference between conditions. However, the investigators will also calculate post-hoc Bayes&#xD;
      factors for each group (PD, healthy controls) to assess whether a lack of difference in&#xD;
      sequence learning between the anodal and sham stimulation conditions could be interpreted as&#xD;
      evidence for the absence of an effect of tDCS on sequence learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PD group, patients will be classified as akinetic-rigid subtype or tremor subtype&#xD;
      based on UPDRS-III subscores in the &quot;Off&quot; medication state. This clinical subtype of the&#xD;
      persons with PD will be taken up as covariate, to assess whether this characteristic&#xD;
      influences IMSL or the treatment thereof via tDCS. A method similar to the one used by Xu et&#xD;
      al. (2018) will be used [70]. First, &quot;tremor score&quot; (sum of UPDRS items 20 and 21 divided by&#xD;
      7) and &quot;non-tremor score&quot; (sum of UPDRS items 18, 19, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 divided by&#xD;
      12) will be calculated per patient. If the tremor score is at least twice the non-tremor&#xD;
      score, patients are classified as tremor subtype; if the non-tremor score is at least twice&#xD;
      the tremor score, patients are classified as akinetic-rigid subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analyses, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons, will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate if the amount of IMSL correlates with demographical, neuropsychological and&#xD;
      clinical variables (including clinical subtypes of PD). If assumptions for parametrical&#xD;
      testing are violated, the non-parametric alternative Spearman's Rho will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the SRT-task performance will be based on median reaction time (RT) per block&#xD;
      instead of mean RT to minimize potential outlier effects. Practice trials, the first response&#xD;
      after each break, erroneous responses and responses following an error will be excluded from&#xD;
      the analyses. Median RTs per block will be analyzed to determine (1) a general learning&#xD;
      effect (secondary outcome measure) and (2) a sequence-specific learning effect (primary&#xD;
      outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General learning effects during and one-week post-tDCS will be derived from a decline in&#xD;
      median RTs over the seven regularly sequenced blocks (i.e. Blocks 1-6 and Block 8). This will&#xD;
      not be applicable to the 5-minutes post-tDCS SRT-task as it is a short version with only&#xD;
      three blocks. A 2x2x2x7 repeated measures ANOVA will be carried out with group (PD, healthy&#xD;
      controls) as between-subjects factor and stimulation (active, sham), time (during, post1week)&#xD;
      and block (Blocks 1-6, Block 8) as within-subjects factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-specific learning effects during, 5 minutes and 1 week post-tDCS will be analyzed by&#xD;
      subtracting the mean of the median RTs of adjacent sequenced blocks (Blocks 6 and 8 during&#xD;
      stimulation and at 1 week post-tDCS; Blocks 1 and 3 at 5 minutes post-tDCS) from the median&#xD;
      RT of the random block (Block 7 during stimulation and at 1-week post-tDCS; Block 2 at&#xD;
      5-minutes post-tDCS). A 2x2x2x3 repeated measures ANOVA (or Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      tests as non-parametrical alternatives) will be carried out with group (PD, healthy controls)&#xD;
      as between-subjects factor and stimulation (active, sham), sequence (random block, mean of&#xD;
      adjacent sequenced blocks) and time (during, post5min, post1week) as within-subject factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case assumptions of sphericity are violated, Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt corrections&#xD;
      will be reported. Bonferroni-corrected t-tests will be implemented to further analyze&#xD;
      significant main and interaction effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Error percentages in the SRT-task are generally small and thus, because of a limited number&#xD;
      of observations, less sensitive to IMSL. The percentage erroneous reactions per block will be&#xD;
      calculated for both stimulation conditions (anodal, sham) and for the three measurements over&#xD;
      time (concurrent, post5minutes, post1week). The Shapiro-Wilk test of residuals will be&#xD;
      carried out to evaluate normality of distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequential score, as outcome measure for explicit knowledge, will be taken up as a&#xD;
      covariate in the analyses. An independent samples t-test (or non-parametrical alternative&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test) will be carried out to ascertain whether the sequential scores (x/12) of&#xD;
      the PD group are different from the healthy control group.&#xD;

    <description>The Serial Reaction Time task (SRT-task) will be employed, using E-Prime® software.

    <intervention_name>1x1 Low Intensity Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS will be delivered through a pair of identical square rubber electrodes (size 35 cm2), placed in rectangular saline-soaked sponges. For the stimulation of M1, electrodes will be placed over C3 or C4 according to the 10-20 EEG system, matching with the M1 contralateral to the performing dominant hand. The reference electrode will be positioned on F1 or F2, ipsilateral to the dominant hand.&#xD;
The current stimulation will be slowly ramped up from 0 mA to 2 mA in one minute. For the anodal tDCS condition, this intensity will be maintained for the duration of the SRT-task (approximately 20 minutes). This will result in a current density of 0,057 mA/cm2. For the sham tDCS condition - unbeknown to the subject - stimulation will be gradually decreased towards 0 mA immediately after the one-minute ramp-up. During the last block of the SRT-task, this gradual ramping-up and -down of the current stimulation will be repeated to optimize the process of blinding of participants.</description>
