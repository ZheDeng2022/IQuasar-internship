  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part first time into human study (FTIH) study for GSK3915393. Parts A and B of&#xD;
      the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single&#xD;
      ascending and repeat oral doses of GSK3915393 in healthy adult participants. Part C will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of co-administration of GSK3915393 with grapefruit juice and itraconazole&#xD;
      on the PK of GSK3915393.&#xD;

             monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) test on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;=40 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-29.9&#xD;
             kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or females: No restrictions for male participants. A female participant is&#xD;

             a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and using an acceptable contraceptive method&#xD;
             from 30 days prior to first dose until follow up visit. The investigator should&#xD;
             evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (e.g., noncompliance, recently&#xD;

             the clinical unit. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history,&#xD;
             menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a&#xD;
             woman with an early undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             psychiatric disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or&#xD;
             elimination of drugs; constituting a risk when taking the study treatment; or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with signs/symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (i.e. fever, cough, etc)&#xD;
             within the past 14 days prior to screening and admission to clinical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known COVID-19 positive contacts in the past 14 days prior to&#xD;
             screening and admission to clinical unit.&#xD;

          -  Average QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 milliseconds&#xD;
             (msec) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality on the screening medical assessment, laboratory&#xD;
             examination, or electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of QTc prolongation, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Part C only, history of liver toxicity resulting from drug administration.&#xD;

             half- lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication for each&#xD;
             dosing, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor&#xD;
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise participant&#xD;
             safety. (Paracetamol is acceptable at a dose of no more than 500 milligrams [mg] at a&#xD;
             time and no more than 2 grams [g] per day).&#xD;

             investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day&#xD;
