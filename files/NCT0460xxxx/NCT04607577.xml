      The QoR-15 Is a post operative recovery score developed in 2013 from the QoR-40 with an&#xD;
      advantage of simplification. The investigators Aim to translate and to validate a such useful&#xD;
      score in Arabic adapted for Morocco by a full psychometric evaluation of the Arabic version,&#xD;
      by testing its validity, reliability, responsiveness, and clinical acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility, with patients undergoing abdominal, thoracic, gynecological surgery, or&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy in the National Institute of Oncology of Rabat, affiliated to Mohammed V&#xD;
      University in Rabat, Morocco.&#xD;
