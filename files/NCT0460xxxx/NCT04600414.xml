      The gold-standard intervention for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is Medication for Opioid Use&#xD;
      Disorder (MOUD). Because more patients with OUD need access to MOUD in primary care, the&#xD;
      investigators are testing whether the Collaborative Care model (CoCM) is effective at&#xD;
      treating both mental health disorders (MHD) and OUD concurrently in primary care settings.&#xD;
      The intervention is CoCM for MHD and OUD. The active control is CoCM for MHD, but not&#xD;
      treating OUD. The primary objective is to compare patient-reported outcomes in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups, and will be tested with in an Effectiveness trial. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to compare the detection of OUD pre- versus post-OUD screening&#xD;
      implementation, and will be tested using a Pre-Post trial design. The exploratory objective&#xD;
      is to compare intervention clinics randomized to a low-intensity sustainability&#xD;
      implementation strategy or a high-intensity sustainability strategy, and will be tested in an&#xD;
      Implementation trial.&#xD;

      This multi-site study involves a sequence of trials (Pre-Post -&gt; Effectiveness -&gt;&#xD;
      Implementation 3) to examine our primary, secondary and exploratory objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-Post trial (secondary objective) - Screening for Opioid User Disorder (OUD) will be&#xD;
           integrated into Mental Health Disorder (MHD) screening and electronic health record&#xD;
           (EHR) data will be used to determine if screening improves the detection of new cases of&#xD;
           OUD during the first six months of the trial compared to the six months prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cluster randomized Effectiveness trial (primary objective) - The primary objective of&#xD;
           the trial is to test the effectiveness of delivering (Medication for OUD) MOUD in the&#xD;
           context of Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) for MHD, hereafter termed the&#xD;
           &quot;intervention&quot; compared to CoCM for MHD only hereafter termed the &quot;control&quot;. All 24&#xD;
           sites have previously partnered with the AIMS Center to implement CoCM for MHD. After&#xD;
           monitoring CoCM for MHD fidelity during a three month &quot;run in&quot; phase, the investigators&#xD;
           will categorize clinics into one of two cohorts and then randomize them.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1 (n=600) - Randomize clinics with high CoCM for MHD fidelity to&#xD;
                sequentially adding MOUD for OUD (intervention group) or maintenance CoCM for MHD&#xD;
                only (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2 (n=600) - Randomize clinics with low CoCM for MHD fidelity to simultaneous&#xD;
                implementation of CoCM for MHD and OUD (intervention group ) or CoCM for MHD only&#xD;
                (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cluster randomized Implementation trial (exploratory objective) - At the end of the&#xD;
           Effectiveness trial, the intervention clinics will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
           low-intensity or high-intensity implementation strategy to promote sustainability&#xD;

In the past 30 days, how many days did you use opiates such as Heroin, Morphine, Dilaudid, Demerol, Oxycontin, oxy, codeine (e.g., Tylenol 2,3,4), Percocet, Vicodin, Fentanyl, etc.?

    <description>CoCM is based on six key principles: 1) evidence-based, 2) measurement-based, 3) team-based, 4) population-based, 5) patient-centered, and 6) accountable. CoCM supports the delivery of evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. CoCM is measurement-based with screening and monitoring of patient-reported outcomes over time to assess treatment response and facilitate treatment adjustments. CoCM is team-based led by a primary care provider with support from a care manager in consultation with a psychiatrist who provides treatment recommendations for patients who are not responding. CoCM is population-based whereby a registry is used to monitor treatment engagement and facilitate the identification of patients falling through the cracks. CoCM is patient-centered with proactive outreach to engage and activate patients. Collaborative care is accountable with continuous quality improvement to meet clinic performance benchmarks.</description>

    <description>Pharmacologic treatment of OUD will rely mainly on transmucosal buprenorphine/naloxone prescribed by primary care providers with DATA 2000 waivers. Measurement-based care and &quot;treat to target&quot; are fundamental principles of CoCM and will be incorporated into the intervention. Care managers will ask four yes/no questions about: 1) opioid withdrawal symptoms, 2) illicit opioid craving, 3) illicit opioid use, 4) medication side effects. If necessary, consulting psychiatrists will then recommend a change to the treatment plan to the primary care provider. In the case of buprenorphine/naloxone, options for changing the treatment plan include: 1) increasing the dosage (max dose 32mg), 2) augmenting with clonidine, 3) switching to injectable buprenorphine, and/or 4) intensifying psychosocial interventions. If the patient is experiencing medication side effects, but not opioid withdrawal symptoms or illicit opioid craving, consideration will be given to lowering the medication dosage.</description>
