    <textblock>
      The pilot study aims to test the acceptability of content, feasibility of delivery methods&#xD;
      and preliminary assessment of outcomes from the implementation of the Ntombi Vimbela&#xD;
      intervention with volunteer groups of female first year students at eight South African&#xD;
      higher education campuses. Data to inform the different objectives will be collected from&#xD;
      participants at different time points. A baseline questionnaire was administered at the&#xD;
      beginning of the Ntombi Vimbela workshops. Qualitative data to provide evidence about the&#xD;
      workshop content and relevance was collected using participant end of workshop evaluation&#xD;
      forms and end of intervention delivery focus group discussions.Feasibility data was collected&#xD;
      through research team observations, facilitator debriefings and end of intervention delivery&#xD;
      workshop One year post-implementation data which provides evidence of preliminary impact has&#xD;
      commenced which includes a survey and in-depth interviews with participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facilitator recruitment and training: The intervention piloting will be conducted in eight&#xD;
      selected campuses. In each campus, three facilitators will be recruited through a process&#xD;
      involving advertisements, applications, screening and interview. This makes a total of nine&#xD;
      facilitators. The criteria for facilitators will be full time female students, between the&#xD;
      ages of 25 and 30 years of age, enrolled at the institution for at least one year.&#xD;
      Facilitators will be trained by the lead researchers to recruit participants and run&#xD;
      intervention with groups of participants. The facilitator training will be conducted by the&#xD;
      lead researchers over a duration of seven days. The training will cover the intervention&#xD;
      content, participatory delivery protocol, group facilitation techniques, dynamics of&#xD;
      co-facilitation and problem-solving techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project marketing and participant recruitment: First posters about the study will be put up&#xD;
      in lecture rooms, residences and central meeting points at selected campuses. Posters will&#xD;
      have information which will include the study aims, participation criteria and contact&#xD;
      details of the project managers. Facilitators will also approach students, share the study&#xD;
      information and invite them to participate. The Student Support managers will also assist in&#xD;
      publicising the project as they conduct their normal duties. In each institution, 20 students&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate in the intervention. To be eligible to participate, a&#xD;
      student has to be female, aged 18-30 years and a full-time student at the college. At the&#xD;
      final stage of recruitment, participants will receive the written project information leaflet&#xD;
      and will be required to give written consent prior to participation. Participants will also&#xD;
      be required to provide their contact details which will be used to communicate project&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant assessments and feedback: Prior to participating in the programme, participants&#xD;
      will be required to complete a short baseline questionnaire that includes measures of their&#xD;
      background data, gender attitudes, perceptions of sexual violence, violence exposures,&#xD;
      knowledge or use of campus support services or other forms of support (informal and formal).&#xD;
      The same tool used at baseline will be used at 1 year post-implementation of workshops to&#xD;
      assess any changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. In compliance to the COVID-19&#xD;
      regulations the researchers will contact participants and invite them to participate&#xD;
      remotely. A survey link will be sent to them which they will use to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire. For the qualitative follow up component, researchers will systemically sample&#xD;
      half of the participants at each site and invite them to participate in telephonic in-depth&#xD;
      interviews. On agreed days and times, researchers will conduct the telephonic interview using&#xD;
      a structured guide. All interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and&#xD;
      translated into English in preparation for analysis. The assessments are solely for the&#xD;
      purpose of assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and impact&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitator support, debriefing and feedback: During the implementation of the programme,&#xD;
      facilitators will be expected to fill attendance records, collect filled participant&#xD;
      evaluation forms and compile session reports. Attendance record will allow us to ascertain&#xD;
      whether workshop attendance gets sustained throughout the four sessions. Facilitators will&#xD;
      use session reports to document challenges encountered and how those were resolved; which&#xD;
      exercises worked well and which did not; what do they think could be done to make the&#xD;
      exercises work better. Each facilitator will be expected to attend a weekly two-hour face to&#xD;
      face debriefing and planning meeting chaired by the lead researchers. The debriefing sessions&#xD;
      will be used to engage with the participant evaluations and as a means of getting facilitator&#xD;
      feedback relating to intervention delivery. Facilitators will also be expected to request the&#xD;
      inputs of the project manager when dealing with any challenges in implementation. In closing&#xD;
      the implementation, in-depth one-on-one interviews will be conducted with facilitators on&#xD;
      their experiences of delivering the intervention, reflecting on similar issues as are&#xD;
      observed for participants. A focus group discussion will also be conducted with all&#xD;
      facilitators to allow them to discuss in detail amongst themselves the challenges, successes&#xD;
      and suggest improvements to the intervention.&#xD;
