  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema (LO) is a chronic and disabling condition that affects quality of life. This&#xD;
      pathology has a physical, psychological, social and professional impact. Pelvic or genital&#xD;
      lymphedema (LP/LG) is the result of a dysfunction of the lymphatic system in the genital area&#xD;
      that can occur following surgery, radiation therapy, tumor, infections affecting the inguinal&#xD;
      lymph nodes or related lymphatic pathways (secondary LP/LG). Urogenital cancers are the major&#xD;
      cause of secondary LP/LG. It is difficult to have an accurate estimate of the prevalence of&#xD;
      LP/LG. LP/LG can be painful, the edema very bulky and disharmonious. The patient is facing&#xD;
      with significant physical and psychological difficulties. The volume of the lymphedema can be&#xD;
      important, causing discomfort, rubbing when walking or during physical activities, disrupting&#xD;
      daily life and may constitute a major handicap.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no reference treatment which is validated for these lymphedemas, and few&#xD;
      recommendations from the competent authorities or learned societies are available. There is&#xD;
      no solution available on the market which covers all the needs and expectations of patients&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Panty MOBIDERM is a standard pelvic compressive orthosis that should promote lymphatic&#xD;
      drainage, then reduce the volume of edema, and contributing to an overall improvement in the&#xD;
      patients' quality of life.&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's impression of overall change is measured by the Patient's opinion on Global Impression of Change questionnaire. The scale has 7 levels of response :&#xD;
&quot;no change or condition has got worse&quot; that is the worst outcome (= 1 point) &quot;almost the same, hardly any change at all&quot; (= 2 points); &quot;a little better , but no noticeable change&quot; (= 3 points); &quot;somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference&quot; (= 4 points); &quot;moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change&quot; (= 5 points); &quot;better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (=6 points) &quot;A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the diiference&quot; (=7 points) The highest score corresponds to the most improvement in quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL): Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory (LyQLI) self-questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>day : 0, 30, 90</time_frame>
    <description>The evolution of quality of life is measured by the lymphedema Quality of life Inventory self-questionnaire. This tool is designed as a patient-completed questionnaire.&#xD;
It comprises 45 items. Forty-one items are divided into three multi-item domains: physical (12 questions), psychosocial (16 questions), and practical (13 questions).&#xD;
For each item, the impact of lymphedema over the last 4 weeks is assessed on a 4-point Likert scale (0: None, 1: A little bit, 2: Somewhat, 3: A lot). Scores are presented as the mean for each domain, ranging from 0.0 to 3.0. A higher score indicates lower QoL. The questionnaire also includes four global questions, of which item 44 assesses the overall experience of lymphedema and item 45 the overall quality of life, both on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0:Very bad to 3: Very good. A higher score indicates higher QoL.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL): EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>day : 0, 30, 90</time_frame>
    <description>The evolution of quality of life is measured by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (Level 1 is coded as a '1'), slight problems (Level 2 is coded as a '2'), moderate problems (Level 3 is coded as a '3'), severe problems (Level 4 is coded as a '4'), and extreme problems (Level 5 is coded as a '5'). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS is measured by VAS : 100 corresponds to the best health and 0 to the the worst health.</description>
