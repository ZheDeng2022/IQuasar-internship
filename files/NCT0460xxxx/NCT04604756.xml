  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of losartan (50mg, single dose) on social&#xD;
      reward&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled design the effects of a single dose of&#xD;
      losartan (50mg) on social reward in healthy participants will be examined. 90 minutes after&#xD;
      subjects administrate 50mg losartan or placebo, participants will undergo a social incentive&#xD;
      delay task. Neural activity will be assessed by the acquisition of functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data.&#xD;

    <measure>Losartan effects on neural activity as assessed by blood oxygenation dependent (BOLD) fMRI during the anticipation of social feedback.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes to 105 minutes after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The social incentive delay task provides subjects with trial-wise feedback on their performance (as assessed by reaction time). Neural activity will be measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To examine effects of treatment during the anticipation of social feedback fMRI-based neural indices during the anticipation period will be compared between the losartan and the placebo treated group using a Generalized Linear Model approach. The analysis will focus on brain systems that play an important role in the anticipation of reward and punishment (prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions, including the striatum)</description>

    <description>The social incentive delay task provides subjects with trial-wise feedback on their performance (as assessed by reaction time). Following each trial the feedback will be indicated by positive and negative social stimuli. Neural activity will be measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To examine effects of treatment during the consummation of social feedback fMRI-based neural indices during the presentation of the feedback will be compared between the losartan and the placebo treated group using a Generalized Linear Model approach. The analysis will focus on brain systems that play an important role in reward and punishment (prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions, including the striatum)</description>
