  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study design is a single arm Phase II trial to document the feasibility of&#xD;
      carboplatin-mirvetuximab - in patients with advanced-stage EOC. Patients with biopsy&#xD;
      confirmed, newly diagnosed, advanced-stage serous EOC deemed appropriate for NACT will have&#xD;
      their tumors evaluated for FRα receptor over-expression via a centralized immunohistochemical&#xD;
      assay (IHC) and identified as appropriate for study participation if IHC staining is PS2+ in&#xD;
      &gt;75% of cells (40% of all serous patients). Eligible patients will receive NACT with one&#xD;
      cycle of carboplatin, followed by mirvetuximab + carboplatin (if FRα +) every 21 days for&#xD;
      three cycles prior to interval cytoreductive surgery (iCRS). A total of 70 will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Following completion of 4 cycles total of NACT and after allowing for&#xD;
      appropriate recovery of cycle # 4, patients eligible for surgery, will undergo an iCRS.&#xD;
      Patients will then complete 3 more cycles of mirvetuximab + carboplatin for a total of 7&#xD;
      intended cycles of treatment. It is up to the treating physician if they want to add&#xD;
      bevacizumab to the last 2 cycles or use any type of maintenance therapy. The decision to add&#xD;
      bevacizumab or use maintenance therapy does not need to be made upfront. Patients will sign a&#xD;
      screening consent form prior to tissue biopsy. If a patient is found to be FRα negative,&#xD;
      their treating physician can select the treatment they deem appropriate and the patient will&#xD;
      be declared a screen failure. Patients with BRCA mutations are not excluded from this trial&#xD;
      and are allowed to receive standard of care maintenance therapy including bevacizumab and/or&#xD;
      PARP inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mirvetuximab soravtansine (also known as IMGN853 and MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate&#xD;
      (ADC) that consists of a high affinity humanized monoclonal antibody against folate receptor&#xD;
      α (FRα, the protein product of the folate receptor 1 [FOLR1] gene) that is conjugated to a&#xD;
      cytotoxic maytansinoid by the hindered disulfide succinimidyl&#xD;
      4-(pyridin-2-yl)disulfanyl)-2-sulfo-butyrate linker (sulfo-SPDB) linker. FRα is a&#xD;
      glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein, which shows limited normal tissue&#xD;
      expression and high expression on the surface of solid tumors, particularly epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer (referenced herein&#xD;
      collectively as EOC), endometrial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell&#xD;
      cancer. The selective upregulation of FRα in solid tumors and the potent and selective&#xD;
      cytotoxicity of MIRV against FRα-positive tumor cells demonstrated in nonclinical studies and&#xD;
      clinical studies to date provide rationale for further investigation of MIRV in the treatment&#xD;
      of FRα-positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer is a lethal disease with 22,530 new cases and 13,980 deaths expected in 2019&#xD;
      in the US. The estimated number of new EOC cases in the EU (EU27) in 2012 was 44,149 with&#xD;
      29,758 deaths. The overall 5-year survival for EOC patients is only 44%. Besides the&#xD;
      incorporation of a platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy regimen into the upfront&#xD;
      treatment, no major strides have been made to improve overall survival (OS) following EOC&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care chemotherapy includes every 21-day paclitaxel and carboplatin, weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel and every 21-day carboplatin. Recently, bevacizumab was approved to be given with&#xD;
      and to follow intravenous chemotherapy in front line ovarian cancer based on the PFS&#xD;
      advantage demonstrated in GOG 218 and ICON7. This study continued bevacizumab for 15 cycles&#xD;
      post completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. In evaluating the morphology of the Kaplan Meier&#xD;
      curves from both these trials, it is apparent that there is an inflexion in the curves at the&#xD;
      point where the bevacizumab is discontinued. To evaluate whether further continuation of&#xD;
      bevacizumab would improve PFS, AGO-OVAR17 (BOOST study) is evaluating 15 versus 30 cycles of&#xD;
      bevacizumab following front line chemotherapy. These results are anticipated in 2021. Given&#xD;
      the above data, this trial as designed, will not include a specific maintenance portion, but&#xD;
      physicians can choice what type of maintenance therapy, if any, they give at the completion&#xD;
      of at least 7 cycles of platinum +Mirvetuximab soravtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable improvements in primary therapy, 80% of the patients with advanced EOC&#xD;
      are expected to relapse during or after treatment with platinum-containing regimens. Disease&#xD;
      recurring within 6 months of platinum-based chemotherapy is classified as platinum resistant,&#xD;
      whereas, disease recurring longer than 6 months after therapy is termed platinum sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients with PROC who have received prior bevacizumab, either in the&#xD;
      platinum-resistant or in the platinum-sensitive setting, have few options. They typically&#xD;
      receive subsequent single-agent chemotherapy. Unfortunately, response rates to single-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy are modest (~10 to 15%) and DOR is typically 4 to 8 months. Similarly, OS is&#xD;
      poor (median ~11 to 14 months). Because PROC remains a significant unmet medical need, the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that platinum-resistant&#xD;
      patients participate in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Carboplatin AUC 5 day 1 (Q21 days) 7 cycles (first cycle is Carbo alone) IV Mirvetuximab 6&#xD;
      mg/kg (adjusted ideal body weight) day 1 (Q21 days) 6 cycles (starting with cycle #2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive MIRV until they present with PD per RECIST 1.1, as assessed&#xD;
      by study Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or death, whichever comes&#xD;
      first, or until the Sponsor terminates the study. Study treatment and/or participation in the&#xD;
      study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator. The following&#xD;
      may be reasons for the Investigator to remove a patient from the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient suffers an intolerable Adverse Event (AE). Noncompliance, including failure to&#xD;
      appear at one or more study visits Study treatment and/or participation in the study may be&#xD;
      discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for treatment discontinuation must be captured in the clinical trial database. Any&#xD;
      AEs experienced up to the point of discontinuation and 30 days thereafter must be documented.&#xD;
      All serious adverse events (SAEs), and those AEs assessed by the Investigator as at least&#xD;
      possibly related to study drug should continue to be followed until they resolve or&#xD;
      stabilize, whichever comes first. Patients will continue to be followed for OS, after&#xD;
      discontinuing study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study, the period of safety observation extends from the time of&#xD;
      informed consent until the 30-Day Follow-up visit unless additional follow-up safety&#xD;
      information is requested as described in Section 9.3. Short-term follow-up for patients who&#xD;
      discontinue study drug without documented PD will be followed per RECIST 1.1 every 12±1 weeks&#xD;
      until PD, until the patient starts new anticancer treatment, the patient dies, or the patient&#xD;
      withdraws consent, whichever comes first. All patients will be followed every 3±1 months for&#xD;
      survival until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for survival or until EOS,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic tumor evaluation by CT or MRI of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed&#xD;
      within 28 days before first dose of study drug, before IDS within 21 days after C4D1, and a&#xD;
      minimum of 21 days following C7D1. The same method of radiologic assessment used at Screening&#xD;
      must be used at all subsequent radiographic evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1. Response as determined&#xD;
      by the Investigator will be recorded in the clinical trial database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will comprise of approximately 70 patients from the University of Alabama at&#xD;
      Birmingham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be feasibility (the proportion of consented patients who&#xD;
      successfully obtain biopsy confirmation of disease status and IHC analysis of FRα receptor&#xD;
      status prior to starting treatment with mirv). The primary analysis will include all&#xD;
      consenting patients. Patients who obtain both the biopsy confirm and are FRα positive will be&#xD;
      considered feasibility successes. The remainder of the consenting sample will be considered&#xD;
      feasibility failures, regardless of the reason for failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Secondary Objective will be progression free survival (PFS), percentage disease free at 2&#xD;
      years, ORR prior to interval debulking surgery (IDS) per iRECIST 1.1 and GCIG CA-125&#xD;
      criteria, and percentage of optimal cytoreduction and pathological complete response (PCR) at&#xD;
      IDS.&#xD;
