      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fractional CO2 laser (&quot;SmartXide2 -&#xD;
      V2LR&quot;, DEKA M.E.L.A., Florence - Italy) &quot;the Laser&quot; in the treatment of genitourinary&#xD;
      symptoms of menopause, female sexual function, and urogenital health in comparison to vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen. Only breast cancer patients who have HR (-) breast cancer are planning to be&#xD;
      included in the vaginal estrogen group.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to determine the efficacy of the MonaLisaTouch Laser in comparison with&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen in the management and treatment of GSM symptoms resulting in vaginal&#xD;
      atrophy, sexual dysfunction and a decreased quality of life in women with a history of breast&#xD;
      cancer. Patients will be stratified according to menopausal status prior to breast cancer&#xD;
      therapy and HR tumor status. Fractional CO2 laser therapy has been approved by Health Canada&#xD;
      for use in menopausal women with GSM, nevertheless long term efficacy and safety data is&#xD;
      lacking in the breast cancer survivor population. In the short term (i.e. 6 month follow up),&#xD;
      research has shown that this therapy is a safe and effective treatment that has promising&#xD;
      benefits with little to no reported adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>During our study, women will undergo treatment intravaginally and vulvar with the fractional microablative CO2 laser system (SmartXide 2 V 2 LR, MonaLisa Touch, DEKA, Florence, Italy). A treatment cycle includes three laser applications (every 40-50 days, approximately 6 weeks). The procedure will be performed in the outpatient clinic and does not require any specific preparation (e.g. analgesia/anesthesia).</description>
