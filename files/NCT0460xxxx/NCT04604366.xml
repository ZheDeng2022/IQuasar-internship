      This study will be conducted in gynae and obstetric department of Akbar Niazi teaching&#xD;
      hospital.Patients coming to gynaecology Outpatient department having confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      missed miscarriage on pelvic ultrasound in first trimester will be enrolled after taking&#xD;
      written consent for medical treatment.Patients will be randomly selected for oral or vaginal&#xD;
      route of misoprostol,dosage according to international federation of gynaecology and&#xD;
      obstetrics protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal dose---800 microgram 3 hourly two doses Sub lingual 600 microgram 3 hourly two doses&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for vaginal bleeding and expulsion for 24 hours if no expulsion or&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding occurred then dose will be repeated .maximum of two cycles will be given.&#xD;
      Failure of treatment confirmed by Ultrasonography will be dealt with surgical evacuation In&#xD;
      case of heavy vaginal bleeding or expulsion pelvic USG will be done to confirm.After&#xD;
      admission baseline investigation and coagulation studies will be performed . demographic&#xD;
      details will be recorded...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for time taken in complete expulsion of conceptus. No of doses&#xD;
      required Need for surgical evacuation Haemorrhage Fall in Hb level Need of blod transfusion&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction Side effects of misoprostol like shivering,fever diarrhea and oral&#xD;
      ulcers and others EXCLUSION CRITERIA patients who opted for surgical management or expectant&#xD;
      management. Gestational age &gt;13 weeks Patients with co-morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A total of 120 women will be selected for the study, divided into two equal&#xD;
      groups of 60 women in each group. The sample size was calculated by WHO sample size&#xD;
      calculator with of help of 5% level of significance, 90% power of test, 48% vs. 20% overall&#xD;
      complication rate in sub inguinal and vaginal misoprostol groups (???).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: All the collected data will be entered into SPSS v. 21 for analysis.&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be presented in the form of mean ± standard deviation. Independent&#xD;
      sample t-test will be applied to compare the quantitative variables (like age and gestational&#xD;
      age) between both groups. Frequency with percentages will be calculated for qualitative data&#xD;
      and chi-square test will be used to compare the qualitative variables (like abortion and&#xD;
      complications) between both groups. P-value ≤ 0.05 will be taken as significant.&#xD;
