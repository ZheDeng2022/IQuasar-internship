  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective treatment of schizophrenia is very challenging due to a number of factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include issues such as poor engagement with treatment plans and care providers, limited&#xD;
      contacts with providers due to under-resourced health services, and the challenges inherent&#xD;
      to schizophrenia symptoms. The outcomes of these problems include frequent, lengthy, and&#xD;
      costly hospital readmissions, low quality of life, high levels of distress, and difficulties&#xD;
      engaging in valued community roles. Digital Health technologies are a promising model to help&#xD;
      address these problems. They are a low cost and accessible form of support and have not been&#xD;
      substantively developed or studied for people with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses. In this&#xD;
      study, the feasibility of one such technology that is in development will be tested:&#xD;
      App4Independence (A4i). A4i provides customized coping prompts, peer-peer networking, and a&#xD;
      portal that facilitates better provider engagement. This research will provide critical&#xD;
      information in the development of this new technology to address a key problem in the field -&#xD;
      how to enhance care in a resource-limited context where provider-patient contacts are brief,&#xD;
      infrequent, and rely on in the moment recall and self-advocacy by patients. These findings&#xD;
      will lay the groundwork for a larger program of research and software development that will&#xD;
      (i) validate the technology across multiple sites and, (ii) catalyze engagement with&#xD;
      healthcare systems and caregiver networks to scale-out access to this promising resource.&#xD;

      Problem Statement: Among schizophrenia-spectrum populations, adherence to treatment is poor,&#xD;
      community-based supports are limited, and efforts to foster illness self-management have had&#xD;
      limited success. These challenges contribute to frequent, lengthy, and costly hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and poor functional outcomes. Digital health strategies, in turn, hold&#xD;
      considerable promise in the effort to address these problems. Across healthcare domains,&#xD;
      digital health is a rapidly growing area due to its potential reach, accessibility, low cost,&#xD;
      and implications for the use of data to customize treatments and identify risk trajectories.&#xD;
      Despite this promise and for reasons that are not entirely clear, the development and study&#xD;
      of digital health strategies for more severe mental health conditions such as schizophrenia&#xD;
      is much less developed than other domains of healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This feasibility trial will examine a digital health platform designed to enhance&#xD;
      illness self-management and treatment engagement for individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology: The investigators and collaborators have developed and piloted a digital&#xD;
      technology called App4Independence (A4i). This platform was designed to (i) help prevent&#xD;
      social isolation through behavioral activation prompts and peer-peer strategy sharing, (ii)&#xD;
      enhance coping with schizophrenia symptoms through functions that draw on evidence-based&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., texted tips derived from cognitive and behavioral therapies) and provide a&#xD;
      novel technology that assists with the identification of auditory hallucinations, (iii)&#xD;
      enhance treatment adherence through scheduling, text and reminder functions, (iv) track level&#xD;
      of wellness/risk and progress on personal goals through both active (self-ratings) and&#xD;
      passive (sleep monitoring proxy) metrics, and (v) facilitate communications with care&#xD;
      providers through a provider dashboard summarizing platform-collected data gathered between&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners: This study builds on a partnership between the Centre for Addiction and Mental&#xD;
      Health (research capability, mental health service and associated expertise, access to&#xD;
      patient populations) and MEMOTEXT, a health technology company with a track record of success&#xD;
      in digital health approaches across multiple health conditions and care contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This single blind, randomized controlled trial examines the feasibility of A4i.&#xD;
      Feasibility metrics include study recruitment and retention, rate of technology use, safety,&#xD;
      and utility in clinical interactions. Other outcome metrics include symptomatology, treatment&#xD;
      adherence, patient-provider alliance, and quality of life. In this trial, study participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either treatment or control conditions, with pre-post outcomes measured&#xD;
      over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This research will provide critical information for the development of this new&#xD;
      technology in the larger effort to address a key problem in the schizophrenia field - how to&#xD;
      leverage technology to enhance illness self-management and care engagement in&#xD;
      resource-limited service contexts. These findings will lay the groundwork for larger trials&#xD;
      assessing the impacts of A4i on hospital readmission and functioning - providing essential&#xD;
      evidence for commercialization and expanded access to this tool. This work is at the&#xD;
      forefront of international efforts to explore and validate digital health approaches for&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

Stratification by study site (CAMH versus community agency) will also be undertaken to determine feasibility questions that may differ as a function of same. REDCap will be employed and will allocate based on the computer-generated randomization list. Allocation concealment will be achieved since the person making the assignment will have no awareness or control over the randomization schedule.</masking_description>
