  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated doses&#xD;
      (MTDs) and recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of JNJ-74856665 as monotherapy and/or in&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1, dose escalation study of JNJ-74856665 alone or in&#xD;
      combination with Azacitidine or Venetoclax in participants with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Participants with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)&#xD;
      are also eligible and will either receive JNJ-74856665 as monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      Azacitidine. AML is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled clonal expansion of&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells (myeloid blasts) in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and&#xD;
      other tissues and is the second most common form of leukemia. MDS are a heterogeneous group&#xD;
      of malignant hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are characterized by cytopenias, myeloid&#xD;
      dysplasia, and a risk of transformation to AML. JNJ-74856665 is an orally bioavailable,&#xD;
      potent, and selective dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor that binds to the&#xD;
      enzyme's ubiquinone binding site promoting AML/MDS differentiation as well as cell cycle&#xD;
      arrest and apoptosis. Azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that&#xD;
      has been US Food and Drug Administration-approved for several MDS subtypes. Venetoclax (VEN)&#xD;
      is a BCL-2 inhibitor that can restore activation of apoptosis in malignant cells, the&#xD;
      survival of which often depends on dysregulation of this pathway. The study is divided into 3&#xD;
      periods: a Screening Phase (within 28 days before the first dose of study drug), a Treatment&#xD;
      Phase (first dose of study drug until the completion of the end-of-treatment visit) and a&#xD;
      Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (up to the end of study participation or end of study). The&#xD;
      end of study is defined as the last study assessment for the last participant in the study.&#xD;
      Total duration of study is up to 2 years and 10 months. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points during this study.&#xD;
      Participants safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
