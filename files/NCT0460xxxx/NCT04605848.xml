  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by pheochromocytoma (PHEO) have brown-adipose tissue (BAT) hyperactivation.&#xD;
      They perform, in routine settings, a FDG PET-CT scan. The high metabolic activity of BAT and&#xD;
      its ability to consume both glucose and fatty acid suggest that it may have potential as a&#xD;
      therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity. However, alternative non-invasive techniques&#xD;
      to PET-CT BAT detection still need more validation. Accordingly, our aim will be to measure&#xD;
      the temperature and microcirculation of the skin overlaying BAT depots in the region of&#xD;
      FDG-uptake detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT before and after a cold test in PHEO patients.&#xD;

      Objectives and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse the change in temperature and microcirculation of the skin overlaying BAT&#xD;
           depots in the region of FDG-uptake detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT before and after a cold&#xD;
           test in PHEO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the decreased temperature and microcirculatory response after a cold test&#xD;
           following resection of the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients affected by will benefit from a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical: treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological evaluations: glycemia, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, plasma&#xD;
           epinephrine and norepinephrine, urine catecholamine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cutaneous microcirculation by means of Laser Speckle Imaging will be recorded at rest&#xD;
           and during a cold test in the supra-clavicular region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cutaneous microcirculation by means of Laser Doppler Flowmetry will be recorded at rest&#xD;
           and during a cold test with one probe in the supra-clavicular region and one probe in&#xD;
           umbilical region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin temperature by means of infrared thermography will be recorded at rest and during a&#xD;
           cold test in the supra-clavicular region&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will have surgery will be investigated before and after one year following&#xD;
      resection of the tumor.&#xD;
