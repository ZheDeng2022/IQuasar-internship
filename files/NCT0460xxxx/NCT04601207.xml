    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the bioavailability of Cannabidiol (CBD) and&#xD;
      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in an emulsion product against a comparator product. Thirty-two&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into a single-center, double-blind, parallel trial.&#xD;
      Participants will be dosed in clinic and blood and urine samples will be taken over a 12-hour&#xD;
      period. Blood and urine samples will also be collected for 48 hours post-dose at check-in&#xD;
      visits. Questionnaires regarding drug effects and cognitive function will also be completed&#xD;
      following each blood sampling. Participants who consumed the comparator product will be asked&#xD;
      to return to the clinic following a wash-out period of at least 45 days to consume the&#xD;
      emulsion product in-clinic and complete questionnaires at the same specified time points over&#xD;
      a 12-hour period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of marijuana or cannabis for medicinal purposes is deeply rooted in history, and&#xD;
      medicinal preparations from Cannabis indica and C. sativa have been used for almost 5,000&#xD;
      years for treating nausea, inflammation, vomiting and pain. However, the major lipophilic&#xD;
      cannabinoids out of &gt;60 terpenophenolic compounds that cause these effects were not&#xD;
      identified until the early 20th century. Sativex, dronabinol, and nabilone (synthetic or&#xD;
      similar to cannabinoids) are the only currently approved cannabis derived medicinal products&#xD;
      in the United States and Canada for different conditions such as nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      associated with cancer, multiple sclerosis, intractable cancer pain, etc. Controversies&#xD;
      regarding legal, medicinal and ethical use of cannabis have increasingly placed this plant in&#xD;
      the spotlight in recent years. Although the use of cannabis fell from favor to fear in the&#xD;
      early 1900s, a widespread support for its use for medicinal purposes has been on the rise in&#xD;
      several countries across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid constituent of cannabis plants possesses anxiolytic,&#xD;
      antipsychotic, antiemetic and anti-inflammatory properties, without exhibiting the&#xD;
      psychoactive effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the other major cannabinoid from&#xD;
      the same plant Δ9-THC and CBD are biosynthesized as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and&#xD;
      cannabidiolic acid from the common precursor olivetol. Both Δ9-THC and CBD exert their&#xD;
      effects by interacting with the G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (GPCRs), CB1 and CB2&#xD;
      with varying affinities. While CB1 receptors are expressed in large quantities in the brain&#xD;
      and regions central nervous system, and in lower amounts in peripheral tissues; the less&#xD;
      studied CB2 receptors have been identified to be localized to immune cells, tonsils and the&#xD;
      spleen. The CB1 receptors have been identified to play significant roles in pain perception,&#xD;
      memory, motor regulation, appetite, mood, and sleep, whereas the CB2 receptors have been&#xD;
      linked with anti-inflammation, pain reduction and reducing tissue damage. Physiologically,&#xD;
      upon activation by the endocannabinoids like anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG)&#xD;
      (which are short lived), CB1 and CB2 trigger a downstream cascade of events that mediate&#xD;
      homeostasis and healthy functioning. In contrast, the phytocannabinoids Δ9-THC and CBD that&#xD;
      directly or indirectly interact with CB1 and CB2 with varying affinities modulate the&#xD;
      activities of these receptors for prolonged durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Δ9-THC is the major psychoactive cannabinoid and mimics the action of the endogenous&#xD;
      cannabinoid receptor ligands anandamide and 2-AG by activating both CB1 and CB2 receptors.&#xD;
      Due to its binding to CB1 receptors which are specifically present in the central nervous&#xD;
      system in areas associated with pain (eg. Spinal trigeminal nucleus, amygdala, basal ganglia&#xD;
      and periaqueductal gray), Δ9-THC possesses antinociceptive activity and is hence used as an&#xD;
      analgesic agent in certain pain medications. In addition, Δ9-THC has also been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of glaucoma, nausea, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy&#xD;
      and inflammation in several pre-clinical and clinical studies . However, Δ9-THC abuse is a&#xD;
      global concern and due to the behavioural and psychological dependence, Δ9-THC has remained a&#xD;
      subject of controversy and a largely unproved therapy with limited studies establishing its&#xD;
      benefit-to-risk ratio, safety and efficacy for different indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBD, which is the non psychoactive phytocannabinoid, and can hence be a promising therapeutic&#xD;
      has gained increasing attention in the recent past. Previous studies have shown that CBD is a&#xD;
      promising potential therapeutic for various disorders of the central nervous system including&#xD;
      anxiety, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzhiemer's disease, multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and many more. Unlike Δ9-THC, CBD does not activate CB1 and CB2, and instead blocks&#xD;
      the cannabinoids that activate these receptors by a complex mechanism. Several groups have&#xD;
      proposed that this activity not only results in the non-psychotropic effects exhibited by CBD&#xD;
      but may also account for ameliorating some of the psychotropic effects shown by Δ9-THC. In&#xD;
      addition, by lowering the psychoactivity of Δ9-THC, CBD may also potentiate some of Δ9-THC's&#xD;
      benefits by enhancing its tolerability and widening its therapeutic window. CBD can also&#xD;
      inhibit or delay the reuptake and hydrolysis of the endocannabinoids like anandamide and&#xD;
      adenosine. CBD has also been hypothesized to interact with several other non-endocannabinoid&#xD;
      signaling systems such as serotonin receptors, vanilloid receptors, GPR-55 (orphan&#xD;
      receptors), peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) making it a &quot;multi-target&#xD;
      drug&quot;. In addition to these activities, the polyphenolic ring in CBD also results in it being&#xD;
      a potent antioxidant. All these results have prompted the exploration of the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of CBD for a range of neuropsychiatric as well as inflammatory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups have attempted to study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CBD and&#xD;
      Δ9-THC. It is generally accepted in drug research that lipophilicity promotes the passage of&#xD;
      molecules across cellular barriers and therefore the most lipophilic compounds will have&#xD;
      greatest intestinal absorption. Due to the lipophilicity of cannabinoids, smoking results in&#xD;
      the fastest absorption of CBD and Δ9-THC, however, the half-life of CBD in humans was found&#xD;
      to be between 18-33 h upon intravenous injection, 27-35 h upon smoking, and 2-5 days upon&#xD;
      oral administration. Bioavailability of oral and smoked CBD in humans was found to be around&#xD;
      6% and 31%, respectively; and bioavailability of oral and smoked Δ9-THC is shown to be 4-12%&#xD;
      and 10-27% respectively. Other studies have previously determined the time to achieve peak&#xD;
      plasma concentration (tmax) as 1.5- 4 h for different doses of CBD and 1-2 h for different&#xD;
      doses of Δ9-THC. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel study will investigate the bioavailability of CBD and Δ9-THC in the test product-&#xD;
      SolutechTM - TC10 manufactured by New Age Ventures LLC in a healthy population.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of cognitive functions by BrainCheck questionnaire for the investigational product and active comparator product. It involves tests of memory (immediate- and delayed-recall) and of cognitive processing and executive function (digit-symbol substitution, trail-making, Stroop Interference). Once a patient has completed the assessments, the BrainCheck platform immediately provides validated, norm-based scores to the investigators. These scores are adjusted for age, derived from a normative database ranging from ages 10 to 99. Raw scores for the different parameters are scaled and ranked in percentiles. Scores that fall within a range of one standard deviation above the mean (50th percentile) indicate &quot;normal&quot; cognitive function. So, overall scores above 50th percentile are graded normal cognitive function while those below 50th suggest cognitive impairment.</description>
