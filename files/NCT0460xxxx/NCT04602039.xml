  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colostrum is the milk that is first produced by a mother after giving birth. It plays a key&#xD;
      role in the normal early development of mammals by providing substances that are important&#xD;
      for nutrition, immunological defence and healthy growth and development. Research has shown&#xD;
      that the immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides and growth factors in dairy colostrum and&#xD;
      early season milk from cows are nearly identical to human. After puberty our bodies begin the&#xD;
      aging process, and gradually produce less immune and growth factors that resist disease and&#xD;
      heal tissue. Colostrum is a natural source of these life-enhancing components. Research shows&#xD;
      that colostrum supports immune function and can help use fat for fuel and optimise cellular&#xD;
      reproduction. Colostrum is receiving an increasing amount of interest in the healthcare&#xD;
      community because of the potential benefits it can offer to a variety of patient groups by&#xD;
      boosting the body's immune response, encouraging growth and repair in the gut, stabilising&#xD;
      gut microflora and supporting better nutritional absorption and muscle growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      predominantly from associated chronic diseases. Currently within the UK approximately 5% of&#xD;
      NHS spend is in relation to type 2 diabetes alone. Within Wales, approximately £256 million&#xD;
      is spent on the care of these patients. Estimates suggest that people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      have the disease for approximately 10 years before diagnosis, during which complications&#xD;
      become well established including dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Additionally, many of these&#xD;
      people are overweight or obese before they develop diabetes. The prevalence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes continues to increase despite recent advances in our understanding of the basic&#xD;
      physiology of glucose control. There is a clear association between inflammation, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and type 2 diabetes. We aim to target inflammation levels seen in those with&#xD;
      impaired glucose homeostasis such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (IGT), collectively called pre-diabetes.&#xD;

      The focus of the work will be to investigate the effects of dairy colostrum as a food&#xD;
      supplement on inflammatory processes and the potential role that it could play in the&#xD;
      prevention of pre-diabetes developing into type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
