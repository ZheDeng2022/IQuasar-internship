  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is being conducted to evaluate the impact of explosive synchronization (ES) and&#xD;
      its treatment with non-invasive brain stimulation in fibromyalgia (FM). The study design has&#xD;
      three components, however, only 2 aims are enrolling participants. The first part (Aim1) is a&#xD;
      cross sectional assessment of brain network explosive synchronization activity, connectivity,&#xD;
      and response to pain in healthy controls and age and sex-matched fibromyalgia patients; the&#xD;
      third part (Aim 3) is a longitudinal assessment of fibromyalgia patients undergoing one week&#xD;
      of sham followed by high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of the&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) or one week of ES HD-tDCS of a brain region identified from computer&#xD;
      modelling (Aim 2).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first part healthy controls (25 female/10 males) and fibromyalgia (25 female/10 males)&#xD;
      participants that are enrolled in this phase will have 3 visits as well as a run-in&#xD;
      observational period (up to a total of 33 days). During this time, participants will complete&#xD;
      surveys, as well as have electroencephalograms (EEG) with quantitative sensory testing and&#xD;
      functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: FM patients will display greater ES in the brain, compared to pain-free controls&#xD;
      when assessed with EEG at rest. Furthermore, patients experiencing increased clinical pain,&#xD;
      will display increases in ES metrics&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third part FM patients will be enrolled (50) and receive treatment with either sham&#xD;
      treatment followed by M1 HD-tDCS or sham treatment followed by ES HD-tDCS. These participants&#xD;
      will also complete surveys and have neuroimaging EEG/MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Following a course of HD-tDCS targeted at either A.) the motor cortex (M1) or B.)&#xD;
      an ES-sensitive region identified in Aim 2, FM patients will display decreased strength of ES&#xD;
      conditions (correlation between node degree and frequency) as compared to Sham, when assessed&#xD;
      with EEG. Moreover, the degree of pain reduction following HD-tDCS will correlate with the&#xD;
      amount of reduction in these network parameters leading to ES. If unable to identify an&#xD;
      ES-sensitive region using computer modeling in Aim 2, our hypothesis for motor cortex&#xD;
      stimulation is that HD-tDCS at M1 will result in decreased ES conditions as compared to Sham,&#xD;
      when assessed with EEG.&#xD;
