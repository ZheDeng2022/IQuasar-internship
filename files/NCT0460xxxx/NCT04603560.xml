  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test two interventions targeting&#xD;
      clinical inertia in hypertension compared to control, followed by predictive modeling to&#xD;
      identify factors that are associated with intervention responsiveness. Study investigators&#xD;
      will use EHR data to identify providers of patients whose hypertension treatment was not&#xD;
      intensified. Primary care physicians will then be randomized to one of three arms: pharmacist&#xD;
      e-detailing, provider dashboards, or no intervention (control). After the intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct virtual interviews with select providers from each arm. A&#xD;
      predictive modeling approach will then be used to identify patient and provider&#xD;
      characteristics that are associated with inertia and with responsiveness to each&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test two interventions targeting&#xD;
      clinical inertia in hypertension compared to control, followed by predictive modeling to&#xD;
      identify factors that are associated with intervention responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, we will use Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to identify physicians of patients&#xD;
      whose hypertension treatment was not intensified despite their having persistently elevated&#xD;
      blood pressure. We will then randomize primary care physicians to on of three arms: academic&#xD;
      e-detailing, social norming, or no intervention (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, we will conduct interviews with select physicians from each arm. We will then&#xD;
      identify patient and physician characteristics that are associated with inertia and with&#xD;
      responsiveness to each intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Intensification of treatment will include an increase in dose of an existing antihypertensive medication, adding an additional medication, or rotation of one medication to another that is stronger or more appropriate for the patient (e.g. changing hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide for a patient with chronic kidney disease). These will be measured using prescribing information from the EHR on the day of the patient's visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months following the intervention date</time_frame>
    <description>The initial value will be the systolic blood pressure at the time of the visit targeted by the intervention. The follow-up blood pressure will be the last blood pressure available in the EHR within 6 months after the visit targeted by the intervention.</description>
