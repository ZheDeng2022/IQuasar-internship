  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address engagement in unhealthy behaviors, low levels of self-regulation, and&#xD;
      unhealthy weight gain for children from low-income households.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that components within structured days (e.g., school days) have a positive&#xD;
      influence on children's obesogenic behaviors (i.e., diet, sleep, physical activity, sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors) and self-regulation. In this pilot study children will be randomized to two arms:&#xD;
      attend a structured summer camp, not attend a camp. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      children attending the summer camp will engage in more healthy obesogenic behaviors, display&#xD;
      higher levels of self-regulation, and subsequently will experience less weight gain than&#xD;
      children not attending the summer camp. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims&#xD;
      will be accomplished: Aim 1 (Primary): Compare changes in BMI z-scores and fitness among&#xD;
      children from low-income households attending a structured summer day camp and those not&#xD;
      attending a structured summer day camp. Aim 2 (Secondary): Compare changes in obesogenic&#xD;
      behaviors among children attending a structured summer day camp and those not attending a&#xD;
      structured summer day camp. Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore changes in self-regulation and the&#xD;
      moderating effect of these changes on primary and secondary outcomes among children attending&#xD;
      and not attending a structured summer day camp.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention camps will operate according to routine practice, with no assistance from the investigative team. The camps provide indoor and outdoor opportunities for children to be physically active each day, provide enrichment and academic programming, as well as provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks. All camp meals will adhere to the United States Department of Agriculture Summer Food Service Program nutrition guidelines. The camps employ 1 staff member for every 12 children - which is consistent with childcare regulations in the state of operation and operate daily (Mon-Fri) for 8 weeks during the summer. The camps open at 7am and close 6 pm daily.</description>
