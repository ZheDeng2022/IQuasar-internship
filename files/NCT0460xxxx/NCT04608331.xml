  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disturbance that can cause intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia, hypercapnia, and sleep structure disorders. The presence of OSA is associated with&#xD;
      worse outcomes after surgery including increased incidence of complications. High-flow nasal&#xD;
      cannula (HFNC) therapy can improve oxygenation of OSA patients by maintaining a certain&#xD;
      positive pressure in the nasopharyngeal cavity. Previous studies showed that, dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      supplemented analgesia can improve sleep quality and pain relief. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that, for high-risk OSA patients following major non-cardiac surgery with HFNC&#xD;
      therapy, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can improve sleep quality. The purpose of&#xD;
      this pilot randomized controlled trial is to investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      supplemented analgesia on sleep quality in high-risk OSA patients after major non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disturbance that can cause intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia, hypercapnia, and sleep structure disorders; the latter include prolonged sleep&#xD;
      latency, shortened sleep duration, frequent wake-up, and disordered circadian rhythm. During&#xD;
      the postoperative period, surgical stress, pain and the residual effects of&#xD;
      sedatives/analgesics can aggravate the sleep disorder and physiological changes in OSA&#xD;
      patients. The resulting consequence is increased incidence of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy can improve the oxygenation of OSA patients by forming&#xD;
      a certain positive pressure in the nasopharyngeal cavity. Previous studies showed that HFNC&#xD;
      therapy can reduce respiratory events, improve oxygenation in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and&#xD;
      anti-anxiety properties. Unlike other sedative agents, dexmedetomidine exerts its sedative&#xD;
      effects through an endogenous sleep-promoting pathway, producing a state like non-rapid eye&#xD;
      movement sleep without disturbing respiration. Our previous studies shows that&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can improve sleep quality and pain relief in patients&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, for patients at high-risk of OSA who are recovering from&#xD;
      major non-cardiac surgery and receiving HFNC therapy, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia&#xD;
      can improve sleep quality and postoperative recovery. The purpose of this pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is to investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia on&#xD;
      the sleep quality in high-risk OSA patients after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
