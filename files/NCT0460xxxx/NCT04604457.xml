      A machine learning algorithm will be used to accurately identify patients in certain primary&#xD;
      care units who may benefit from palliative care consults. These patients will be presented&#xD;
      weekly to a palliative care specialist in a custom user interface. The palliative care&#xD;
      specialist will reach out to primary care teams if she determines that the patient would&#xD;
      benefit from palliative care. If the primary care provider agrees, he/she would write a&#xD;
      palliative care consult order for the patient. The goal is to reduce the time to palliative&#xD;
      care for these patients, who may not have been identified as quickly without the algorithm.&#xD;
