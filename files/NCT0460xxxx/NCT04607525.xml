  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear consensus among neuroanesthesiologists regarding which anesthetic regimen&#xD;
      is optimal for craniotomy. Propofol and short-acting opioids (such as remifentanil, fentanyl,&#xD;
      or sufentanil) are commonly used. However, use of opioids is associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of respiratory depression and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Dexmedetomidine is a highly&#xD;
      selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist that has been considered as a useful and safe adjunct to&#xD;
      anesthesia for various surgical procedures&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators designed this randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of administration of Dexmedetomidine infusion at a dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h without loading dose&#xD;
      during elective supratentorial craniotomy under GA. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      intraoperative hemodynamics in both groups, intraoperative analgesic consumption,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, postoperative sedation scores, intraoperative need for rescue&#xD;
      hypotensive agents, and finally the satisfaction of surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the effect of Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      infusion without loading dose in elective supratentorial craniotomy&#xD;
