      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a person-centred nurse-led outpatient&#xD;
      clinic on health related quality of life, for persons with AF. Secondary outcomes are effects&#xD;
      on anxiety, depression, illness perception, symtom burden, life style and health economics.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a person-centred nurse-led outpatient&#xD;
      clinic on health related quality of life, for persons with AF. Secondary outcomes are effects&#xD;
      on anxiety, depression, illness perception, symtom burden, life style and health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing person centred nurse led care vs. standard&#xD;
      care. A sample size of 100 persons per group will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through questionnaires, medical records, interviews.&#xD;
