  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hemiparetic arm is one of the most undesirable consequences of stroke. Approximately&#xD;
      30-66% of patients with stroke are not able to gain motor function of their affected hand&#xD;
      which prevents them from performing their daily activities for the rest of their lives. It is&#xD;
      very important in the treatment of stroke patients to improve their upper limb function.&#xD;
      Mirror therapy has drawn much focus on the rehabilitation of hemiplegic stroke patients in&#xD;
      the past two decades. Mirror therapy is one of the priming technique that causes neural&#xD;
      plasticity of the brain. In mirror therapy a mirror is placed in the mid-sagittal plane of&#xD;
      the patient between his two arms and the patient is given instruction to move his less&#xD;
      affected or normal limb while looking at its reflection in the mirror which will produce as&#xD;
      the affected or paretic limb is also moving with a normal movement pattern. This will create&#xD;
      visual stimulus on the patient's brain known as mirror visual feedback (MVF) and will cause&#xD;
      cortical reorganization hence it will increase the motor recovery of the affected or paretic&#xD;
      limb. A type of mirror therapy is task-based mirror therapy in which the participants are&#xD;
      asked to perform specific motor tasks with their less affected arm. There are very few&#xD;
      studies regarding mirror therapy combined with functional tasks. It is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial study and its duration is 6 months. Total sample size will be 26; 13&#xD;
      participants into each group. The subjects will be divided into two groups, Group A&#xD;
      Experimental group and Group B control group. A 20 minutes session will be performed thrice&#xD;
      in a week for a total of 6 weeks. The experimental group will perform functional tasks with&#xD;
      mirror therapy and the control group will perform functional tasks without mirror therapy.&#xD;
      The Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination scale and Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery&#xD;
      scale will be used in the inclusion criteria of patients. Outcomes of patients will be&#xD;
      measured using Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) upper limb&#xD;
      component, Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment Scale (FMA-UE) and Functional Independence&#xD;
      Measure (FIM) self-care component at baseline, after every 2 weeks and with follow up at 6&#xD;
      weeks. After this, the data will be analyzed on the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) 21 version.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The hemi paretic arm is one of the most undesirable consequences of stroke. Approximately&#xD;
      30-66% of patients with stroke are not able to gain motor function of their affected hand&#xD;
      which prevents them from performing their daily activities for the rest of their lives.The&#xD;
      paralysis of upper limb along with increase in muscle spasticity, muscle weakness and loss of&#xD;
      sensory perception are reasons of disability in stroke patients. It is very important in the&#xD;
      treatment of stroke patients to make effective treatment strategies to improve their upper&#xD;
      limb function. Many treatment options are used for the recovery of upper limb motor function&#xD;
      such as robot-assisted therapy and constraint induced movement therapy. Mirror therapy has&#xD;
      drawn much focus for the rehabilitation of hemiplegic stroke patients in the past two&#xD;
      decades. Mirror therapy is one of the priming technique that causes neural plasticity of&#xD;
      brain.Mirror therapy is also used to address problems like phantom limb pain.In stroke&#xD;
      patients it is helpful in managing pain and hemi spatial neglect. According to the theory the&#xD;
      cortical areas of brain that are involved in the motor task execution can be activated by&#xD;
      observing the actions performed by others, which is the function of the mirror neuron system&#xD;
      (MNS).The mirror neuron system is composed of mirror neurons that discharge during action&#xD;
      observation (AO) and action execution. The mirror neuron system is located in the inferior&#xD;
      frontal gyrus (IFG), including the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), the inferior parietal&#xD;
      lobule (IPL), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). It also extends to other brain areas like&#xD;
      the primary motor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the middle frontal cortex. In&#xD;
      mirror therapy we use the mirror neuron system to perform action observation training (AOT)&#xD;
      and action execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mirror therapy a mirror is placed in the mid sagittal plane of a patient between the two&#xD;
      arms and the patient is given instruction to move his less affected or normal limb while&#xD;
      looking at its reflection in the mirror which will produce as the affected or paretic limb is&#xD;
      also moving with a normal movement pattern.This will create visual stimulus on the patient's&#xD;
      brain known as mirror visual feedback (MVF) and will cause cortical reorganization hence it&#xD;
      will increase the motor recovery of the affected or paretic limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scales that have been used in previous studies to measure motor recovery and improvement&#xD;
      in daily functions of stroke patients with mirror therapy are Brunnstrom stages of recovery,&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM).The findings of these&#xD;
      studies has shown positive effects of mirror therapy on decreasing motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional mirror therapy that is most commonly used involves simple movements performed by&#xD;
      unaffected arm like wrist extension flexion, fingers flexion extension and forearm supination&#xD;
      and pronation while looking at the visual stimulus created by the mirror placed at their mid&#xD;
      sagittal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional task-oriented training is mostly used intervention for bringing beneficial&#xD;
      neural plasticity and improving paretic upper limb functional performance. Functional&#xD;
      task-oriented training recently applied on stroke patients has proven to be more effective&#xD;
      than the conventional therapy. A type of mirror therapy is task based mirror therapy in which&#xD;
      the participants are asked to perform specific motor tasks with their less affected arm.&#xD;
      Functional tasks may include flipping a card, holding a polystyrene cup, squeezing a sponge.&#xD;
      A research was carried out in Korea to determine the effects of mirror therapy with&#xD;
      functional tasks on upper limb function and activities of daily living in patients with&#xD;
      subacute stroke. The patients were randomly divided into two groups the mirror therapy group&#xD;
      and the control group.The Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment (FMA), Brunnstrom motor&#xD;
      recovery stage, and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) were assessed 4 weeks after the treatment&#xD;
      and the results were significantly greater in the mirror therapy group than the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of mirror therapy in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients with severe dysfunction of upper limb and its comparison was done with the control&#xD;
      group. The results showed significant improvements in mirror therapy group regarding motor&#xD;
      recovery and tactile stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study done b to determine if a mirror therapy-based action observation (AO) protocol&#xD;
      contributes to motor learning of the paretic arm in post stroke patients.The outcome measure&#xD;
      of this study was movement time of the reaching movement which was measured by accelerometry.&#xD;
      The results showed that the decrease in movement time was much more in the action observation&#xD;
      group as compared to the control group. Thus the study showed that a mirror therapy based&#xD;
      action observation protocol contributes more to motor learning in post stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      another study which was the first to achieve delayed mirror visual feedback (MVF) for upper&#xD;
      extremity mirror therapy training. Their results support the positive effects of mirror&#xD;
      visual feedback on the cortical activation of brain and hence give additional evidence&#xD;
      supporting the use of mirror therapy in the future for upper-limb motor training in patients&#xD;
      with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review was done to evaluate the activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS)&#xD;
      during the action observation and action execution training with mirror visual feedback (MVF)&#xD;
      in post stroke patients. The effect of activation of motor cortex of brain in stroke patients&#xD;
      with mirror therapy was also determined. The results showed that the MVF may cause stroke&#xD;
      recovery by revising the interhemispheric imbalance caused by stroke and also cause the&#xD;
      activation of the MNS. Action observation training also promoted motor relearning in stroke&#xD;
      individuals by the activation of the MNS and the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another systematic review was done to conclude the effects of mirror therapy for improving&#xD;
      motor functions and decreasing motor impairment after stroke. They also assessed the effects&#xD;
      of mirror therapy on the activities of daily living of stroke patients. The results gave&#xD;
      evidence on the effectiveness of mirror therapy for increasing upper limb motor function,&#xD;
      decreasing motor impairment, improving their activities of daily living and decreasing their&#xD;
      pain as compared to the conventional rehabilitation for stroke patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale (FMA), developed in 1975, has been used to describe the motor and sensory recovery of patients after stroke. It is divided into 5 domains: motor function, sensory function, balance, joint range of motion, and joint pain.&#xD;
The FMA is a well-designed and efficient clinical examination tool that has been widely used in post stroke patients. Excellent interrater and intrarater reliability and construct validity have been demonstrated score of 0-28 indicate severe , 29-42moderate, and 43-66 mild impairment in upper limb function.</description>
