    <description>Sevoflurane will be administered in steps to achieve a loss of consciousness via a tight-face mask by increasing the end-tidal concentration of Sevoflurane (ETSEVO). Targeted concentration for ETSEVO are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 4, 5% or higher until MOAA/S scales at values less than 2 is reached.&#xD;
The equilibration time for each targeted concentration will be approximately 12 minutes to maintain a constant ETSEVO. The BIS™ value, MOAA/S score and picture recall test will be assessed when the patient is awake and at the different ETSEVO concentrations.&#xD;
ETSEVO is decreased by the same steps until consciousness is regained.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sevoflurane with Remifentanil Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Two (2) minutes before starting sevoflurane, to attain an effect-site targeted concentration of remifentanil of 4 ng/ml, an initial IV bolus of remifentanil will be given followed by the start of an infusion. Approximately within 7 minutes, the infusion rate of remifentanil may be adjusted to maintain the effect-site concentration of remifentanil of 4 ng/ml.&#xD;
Sevoflurane will be administered via a tight-face mask in steps to achieve a loss of consciousness by increasing the end-tidal concentration of Sevoflurane (ETSEVO). Targeted concentration for ETSEVO are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 4, 5% or higher until an MOAA/S score of less than 2 is reached.&#xD;
ETSEVO is decreased by the same steps until consciousness is regained.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sevoflurane with Fentanyl Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Two (2) minutes before starting sevoflurane, to attain an effect-site targeted concentration of fentanyl of 2 ng/mL, an initial IV bolus of fentanyl will be given followed by the start of an infusion. Approximately within 10 minutes, the infusion rate of fentanyl may be adjusted to maintain the effect-site concentration of fentanyl of 2 ng/ml.&#xD;
Sevoflurane will be administered via a tight-face mask in steps to achieve a loss of consciousness by increasing the end-tidal concentration of Sevoflurane (ETSEVO). Targeted concentration for ETSEVO are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 4, 5% or higher until an MOAA/S score of equal to or less than 2 is reached.&#xD;
ETSEVO is decreased by the same steps until consciousness is regained.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Desflurane Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Due to desflurane being a volatile agent and not well tolerated as an induction agent, an initial IV bolus of 1% propofol provided at 2mg/kg, with supplemental boluses given at the investigators discretion in order to achieve LMA insertion, will be administered 15-20 minutes prior to desflurane. Once correct LMA placement has been confirmed, there will be an equilibrium time of approximately 15-20 minutes to allow the effect site concentration of propofol to reach a level consistent with a pharmacodynamic effect of consciousness as measured by a MOAA/S score of 2 or 3. Desflurane will then be administered via a tight-face mask at the targeted end-tidal concentration (ETDES) of 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 %, or higher until an MOAA/S score of less than 2 is reached.&#xD;
The BIS™ value will be correlated with desflurane ETDES concentration. ETDES is decreased by the same steps until consciousness is regained.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Isoflurane Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Due to isoflurane being a volatile agent and not well tolerated as an induction agent, an initial IV bolus of 1% propofol provided at 2mg/kg, with supplemental boluses given at the investigators discretion in order to achieve LMA insertion, will be administered 15-20 minutes prior to isoflurane.Isoflurane will be administered via a tight-face mask in steps to achieve a loss of consciousness (MOAA/S of 0,1) by increasing the end-tidal concentration of Isoflurane (ETISO). Targeted concentration for ETISO are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5% or higher until MOAA/S scales at values less than 2 is reached.&#xD;
The BIS™ value will be correlated with desflurane ETISO concentration. ETISO is decreased by the same steps until consciousness is regained.</description>
