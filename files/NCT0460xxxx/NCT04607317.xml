  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a 12-week telehealth aerobic&#xD;
      exercise intervention is feasible in people with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will also gather information on the effect of the intervention on sleep and&#xD;
      stress as mediators of seizure frequency, well as effects on epilepsy and epilepsy associated&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility and fidelity of a 12&#xD;
      week, individualized, telehealth exercise intervention in people with refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
      This will be carried out using a 2 arm, parallel group design with a waitlist attention&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo formal exercise testing prior to enrollment to determine safety and&#xD;
      establish a baseline fitness level. Participants will use a wrist-worn Garmin device to&#xD;
      record activity and sleep. After a 4 week baseline period, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      intervention or wait-list attention control. The intervention group will undergo a 12-week&#xD;
      telehealth exercise program designed by a trained health coach and tailored to the&#xD;
      individual's personal fitness level and exercise preferences. The intervention is based in&#xD;
      social cognitive theory to implement and enforce sustainable behavior change. The wait-list&#xD;
      attention control will receive health education but will not be given an exercise program. At&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period, the control group will be given the option to participate&#xD;
      in the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess recruitment and retention as well as fidelity, acceptability and&#xD;
      sustainability of a telehealth exercise intervention in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate objective and subjective measures of the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on the known seizure triggers of sleep and stress as possible mediators of&#xD;
      seizure frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect information regarding the effects of the intervention on depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life, cognition, and seizure frequency.&#xD;

Three subscale scores will be generated. Physical scores range from 6 to 30 with higher scores indicating higher levels of outcome expectations for exercise.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will be enrolled in a telehealth-delivered exercise program with the goal of progressing to 150 min/week (5 days per week, 30 minutes of steady state walking per day). Participants will meet weekly 1:1 with a trained health coach via a Webex platform. Weekly exercise goals will be tailored to the individual's abilities and specific barriers. Coaching will utilize social cognitive theory and self-determination theory to develop self-efficacy for sustainable behavior change.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the wait-list attention control group will continue to undergo standard care for 12 weeks. They will continue to wear the Garmin activity tracker and can view their activity but will not be given an exercise program.

Participants will meet with the coach to review a brief social cognitive theory-based module, which will provide education on core behavior change concepts and the benefits of physical activity for those with epilepsy. The coach will review the previous week's exercise during meetings, and will then work with the participant to revise and reset goals for the coming week.</description>
