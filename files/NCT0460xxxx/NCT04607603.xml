  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a very common disease, especially in&#xD;
      older people (lifetime prevalence 9.5%). Current systemic pharmacological treatment options&#xD;
      are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients presenting with knee osteoarthritis are of an advanced age and suffer from&#xD;
      various co-morbidities. The benefit of the available systemic pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      options in these patients can be summarized as uncertain. Therefore, the investigation of new&#xD;
      symptomatic systemic pharmacological treatment options for knee OA is relevant. Even in&#xD;
      patients without known contraindications, the treatment period with non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs should be kept short. It follows that the investigation of new&#xD;
      potentially anti-inflammatory substances is of interest in symptomatic OA of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabidiol has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in animal models. We therefore&#xD;
      propose a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the&#xD;
      potential efficacy of cannabidiol in painful symptomatic OA of the knee.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Painful symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a very common disease, especially in&#xD;
      older people (lifetime prevalence 9.5%). Current systemic pharmacological treatment options&#xD;
      are limited. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends paracetamol,&#xD;
      duloxetine, oral non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitors (anti-inflammatory substances) in patients without relevant concomitant diseases.&#xD;
      In individuals with relevant concomitant diseases (diabetes, advanced age, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, gastrointestinal complications, depression,&#xD;
      obesity), the recommendation for paracetamol, oral non-selective non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and oral COX-2 inhibitors changes to 'inappropriate'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In individuals with high co-morbidity risk (history of GI-bleeding, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      chronic renal failure) NSAIDs and oral COX-2 inhibitors are evaluated as inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients presenting with knee osteoarthritis are of an advanced age and suffer from&#xD;
      various co-morbidities. The benefit of the available systemic pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      options in these patients can be summarized as uncertain. Therefore, the investigation of new&#xD;
      symptomatic systemic pharmacological treatment options for knee OA is relevant. Even in&#xD;
      patients without known contraindications, the treatment period with non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs should be kept short. It follows that the investigation of new&#xD;
      potentially anti-inflammatory substances is of interest in symptomatic OA of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study will be randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled. 2 parallel groups&#xD;
      will be investigated. One group will receive placebo, the other will receive 600mg&#xD;
      cannabidiol per os during the treatment phase. The total study duration will be 13 weeks (2&#xD;
      weeks screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 week titration phase; 7 weeks maintenance phase; 1 week tapering phase; 2 weeks follow-up)&#xD;
      Main objective of the study will be to compare the change in the Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Index from baseline to the last week&#xD;
      of the maintenance phase between the placebo and verum groups. The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      is a validated patient questionnaire to assess symptoms and physical functional limitations&#xD;
      in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include comparing the change in the WOMAC Function Index, the Global&#xD;
      Patient Assessment of Gonarthrosis and the VAS Score. The planned number of participants is&#xD;
      86 (43 patients per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures/procedure After a 2-week screening phase, patients are randomised to a 1:1&#xD;
      placebo:verum after written consent. During the screening all patients are adjusted to a&#xD;
      basic medication of 3 times 1g paracetamol/day. In the cannabidiol arm, titration is carried&#xD;
      out within one week to the target dose of 600mg per day. This dosage is maintained for 7&#xD;
      weeks. This is followed by a balancing phase of 1 week. A follow-up is carried out 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the maintenance phase is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 study visits are associated with blood sampling (safety laboratory) and physical&#xD;
      examination and the completion of questionnaires and are carried out at our pain outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. The remaining weekly visits are carried out by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire duration of the study, patients are allowed the rescue medication of&#xD;
      Tramadol 50mg up to 6/day.&#xD;
