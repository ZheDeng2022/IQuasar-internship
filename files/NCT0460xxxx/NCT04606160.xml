  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to utilize an innovative approach of a single session problem-solving&#xD;
      intervention to address psychosocial factors affecting patient outcomes within the pediatric&#xD;
      sickle cell population. The study will be a randomized control trial of a single session&#xD;
      problem-solving intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This original research will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing a&#xD;
      single-session problem-solving intervention to address problems affecting children and&#xD;
      families receiving chronic blood transfusions for sickle cell disease in order to: 1)&#xD;
      contribute to literature related to single session problem solving interventions with the&#xD;
      chronic transfusion sickle cell population and 2) identify a model of sustainable care that&#xD;
      reduces the burden of a multiple session intervention and increases access to services.&#xD;
      Additionally, this research aims to provide relatively low burden and potentially highly&#xD;
      effective intervention into regular care for this population in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of integrating a single-session problem solving intervention into routine&#xD;
      clinical flow, thereby addressing needs more systematically that have been identified by&#xD;
      families. Further, this research aims to identify potential utility of medical providers&#xD;
      being trained on providing the intervention, which could be part of a future study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the event that research must be completed virtually due to coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      restrictions at the research site, an Ipad will be provided to participants by clinic staff&#xD;
      to complete measures, through Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and the&#xD;
      intervention/control visits through a Children's Health-approved and HIPAA compliant&#xD;
      telehealth platform. Due to continued changes in protocols, it is possible that participants&#xD;
      may begin with in-person research and transition to virtual research, or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient list for chronic blood transfusion clinic will be reviewed weekly for eligible&#xD;
      participants. Eligible participants will be approached at the start of their routine blood&#xD;
      transfusion (which are part of their clinical care) appointment to minimize interference from&#xD;
      sedative medications. The researcher will explain the study and answer questions related to&#xD;
      participation. If the caregiver and youth choose to participate, written consent (and patient&#xD;
      assent when appropriate) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit one, both study groups will receive a baseline visit (V1), which will include&#xD;
      completing measures, and participants will be provided a handout of community mental health&#xD;
      resources to have for future reference if mental health needs arise. During visit two (V2),&#xD;
      (typically occurs approximately 1 month after V1) caregivers in the intervention group will&#xD;
      complete the Psychological Outcomes Profiles (PSYCHLOPS) measure, receive a single session&#xD;
      problem-solving intervention to target an identified problem, and complete the Abbreviated&#xD;
      Acceptability Rating Profile (AARP) at the end of the intervention. Problem to be targeted&#xD;
      will be identified collaboratively by the researcher and the caregiver, after review of&#xD;
      measures completed by the caregiver and youth participant during visit one. The control group&#xD;
      will receive a visit from the researcher, in which the caregiver participant will complete&#xD;
      the PSYCHLOPS measure. During visit three (V3), (typically occurs approximately 2 months&#xD;
      after V1), both groups will complete the same measures from visit one, with the addition of&#xD;
      all caregiver participants completing the PSYCLOPS measure. At this visit, caregivers in the&#xD;
      intervention group will also receive a short review of the problem-solving strategy and&#xD;
      address questions about the skill following completion of measures. The caregiver&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will complete the AARP at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      review. At visit four (V4), (typically occurs approximately five months after V1) both groups&#xD;
      will complete the same measures as visit one, in addition to the PSYCHLOPS measure, for&#xD;
      longer-term follow up. In addition, the intervention group will complete the AARP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual alternative for all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will remain the same as stated above, except clinic staff will provide&#xD;
      the handout of community mental health resources to participants and visits with both the&#xD;
      Intervention Group and Control Group will be conducted through a Children's Health-approved&#xD;
      telehealth platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of utilizing a single-session problem solving intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: At least 70% of participants approached for this study will agree to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: At least 70% of participants who start the study will be retained through V4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the acceptability of a single-session problem solving intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: At least 70% of caregivers will find the single-session intervention to be&#xD;
      acceptable at V3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: At least 70% of caregivers will find the single-session intervention to be&#xD;
      acceptable at V4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of a single-session problem solving intervention at improving&#xD;
      the selected problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: The intervention group will report a greater decrease in difficulty associated&#xD;
      with their identified problem [Psychosocial Outcomes Profiles (PSYCHLOPS)] over time (V3 and&#xD;
      V4) compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: The intervention group will report a greater decrease in psychosocial risk&#xD;
      factor score [Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT)] over time as compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 7: The intervention group will report a greater increase in quality of life&#xD;
      [Pediatrics Quality of Life_ Sickle Cell Disease Module (PedsQL_SCD Module)], both patient&#xD;
      and caregiver report) over time as compared to the control group.&#xD;
