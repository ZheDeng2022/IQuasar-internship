      Periprosthetic infection following shoulder arthroplasty is a devastating complication.&#xD;
      Diagnosing and treating periprosthetic shoulder infection poses a significant challenge. At&#xD;
      the forefront of this issue is Cutibacterium acnes because the current prophylactic regimens&#xD;
      are insufficient to eradicate C acnes from the surgical field. It is believed that C acnes&#xD;
      infections occur during surgery when the sebaceous glands in the skin are cut and exposed,&#xD;
      leading to C acnes contaminating the surgeon's instruments and gloves and, thus, the surgical&#xD;
      wound. The purpose of this study is to examine if making skin incisions using electrocautery&#xD;
      will result in decreased C acnes contamination during shoulder arthroplasty. To this end, we&#xD;
      propose a randomized clinical trial where patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty are&#xD;
      randomized into two groups - Electrocautery incision group (Electro) vs. Scalpel incision&#xD;
      group (Scalpel) - and swab cultures are obtained from the skin incision and operating&#xD;
      surgeon's gloves and forceps&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Periprosthetic infection following shoulder arthroplasty is a devastating complication.&#xD;
      Infected shoulder arthroplasty not only causes an unexpected health hazard to patients but&#xD;
      also imposes a heavy financial burden at both individual and societal levels. The rates of&#xD;
      periprosthetic shoulder infection (PSI) have been reported to be 0.80% to 1.46%, but the&#xD;
      number of infections is likely to increase as shoulder arthroplasty becomes more commonplace&#xD;
      in an aging active population. Diagnosing and treating PSI poses a significant challenge.&#xD;
      Unlike periprosthetic infection in other joints, PSI lacks the typical clinical signs and&#xD;
      laboratory findings of infection due to the indolent nature of the offending pathogens. At&#xD;
      the forefront of this issue is Cutibacterium acnes. Although the typical Staphylococcus,&#xD;
      Streptococcus, and Corynebacterium species that reside on the skin surface are the primary&#xD;
      targets of most surgical infection prophylaxis regimens, C acnes has emerged as a problematic&#xD;
      bacterium because the current prophylactic regimens are insufficient to eradicate C acnes&#xD;
      from the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C acnes is one of the most common pathogens of infections after shoulder surgery. It is a&#xD;
      commensal, gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that resides in the sebaceous glands associated&#xD;
      with hair follicles. The colonization with C acnes of the front and back side of the shoulder&#xD;
      epidermis is greater than that of other regions of the body because of the high density of&#xD;
      the sebaceous glands in that area. C acnes can cause low-grade infections after shoulder&#xD;
      surgery, and it has been shown that it is the most commonly detected bacterium after revision&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty surgery. During revision shoulder arthroscopy cases performed for pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, or weakness, 30% of patients had positive culture findings, and 80% of those&#xD;
      findings were positive for C acnes. It is believed that C acnes infections occur during&#xD;
      surgery when the sebaceous glands in the skin are cut and exposed, leading to C acnes&#xD;
      contaminating the surgeon's instruments and gloves and, thus, the surgical wound. Recent&#xD;
      studies showed that hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl peroxide were more effective than the&#xD;
      conventional skin preparation methods in decreasing the C acnes load in the skin, but as high&#xD;
      as 17% of the cultures were still positive for C acnes even with these new measures. Thus,&#xD;
      despite all the efforts to eradicate C acnes from the shoulder, C acnes remain an elusive&#xD;
      pathogen that is potentially contaminating tens of thousands of shoulder arthroplasties each&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical diathermy (or electrocautery) has been used routinely for tissue dissection and&#xD;
      hemostasis during surgical procedures. In the cutting mode, the use of an electrode&#xD;
      delivering a pure continuous sinusoidal wave of low voltage produces as high temperatures as&#xD;
      1000â„ƒ, which heats cells within the tissue so rapidly that they vaporize, leaving a cavity&#xD;
      within the cell matrix. The heat created dissipates as a stream rather than being transmitted&#xD;
      into adjacent tissues. This allows tissue cleavage without damage to surrounding areas. The&#xD;
      electrode does not need to be in contact with tissue as an arc is formed producing a clean&#xD;
      cut. With the coagulation mode on high power, cutting also occurs, but this produces a larger&#xD;
      zone of greater thermal damage. Electrocautery can be used for dissecting fascia and muscle&#xD;
      layers, as well as achieving hemostasis, and it has become an integral part of modern&#xD;
      surgical practice. A number of clinical studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of cutting&#xD;
      electrocautery for surgical incisions in general, plastic, otorhinolaryngological,&#xD;
      orthopedic, neurosurgical, and gynecologic procedures. Additionally, systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses were conducted for the same purposes. The majority of these studies showed that&#xD;
      using electrocautery to cut the skin provided the benefits of reduced bleeding, a quicker&#xD;
      incision, and decreased postoperative pain with no increase of wound complications when&#xD;
      compared to scalpel incisions. Given the high temperatures generated at the tip of an&#xD;
      electrode of electrocautery, it is reasonable to assume that making a skin incision with&#xD;
      electrocautery could potentially destroy exposed colonies of C acnes in hair follicles and&#xD;
      sebaceous glands open on the incisional surface of the skin. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine if making skin incisions using electrocautery will result in decreased C acnes&#xD;
      contamination during shoulder arthroplasty. To this end, we propose a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial where patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty are randomized into two groups -&#xD;
      Electrocautery incision group (Electro) vs. Scalpel incision group (Scalpel) - and swab&#xD;
      cultures are obtained from the skin incision and operating surgeon's gloves and forceps.&#xD;
