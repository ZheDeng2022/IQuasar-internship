  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, prospective, non-significant risk study to compare the impact of&#xD;
      the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System to the current standard of care (SMBG,&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood glucose) on reducing time above 180 mg/dL in subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes who are not adequately controlled on their existing oral anti-diabetes medication&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to approximately 350 subjects will be enrolled to obtain a minimum of 130 randomized&#xD;
      subjects, with a minimum of approximately 65 subjects per arm. At least 50% of randomized&#xD;
      subjects will be age 65 and older. Subjects will be randomized to use either the FreeStyle&#xD;
      Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System or traditional SMBG to manage their diabetes. The&#xD;
      subsequent impact of FreeStyle Libre 2 versus SMBG on reducing the amount of time spent above&#xD;
      180 mg/dL will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and SMBG will be&#xD;
      characterized by Adverse Device Effects and Serious Adverse Device Effects experienced by&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
