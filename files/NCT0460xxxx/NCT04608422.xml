      This study aims to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation on renal function and&#xD;
      physical capacity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with patients from the HD outpatient of Santa Clara hospital at Irmandade&#xD;
      Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre (ISCMPA), who will be allocated to a control group&#xD;
      (it will be evaluated and reassessed) or intervention group (it will receive electrical&#xD;
      stimulation). Interventions will occur during the HD session, twice a week, for eight weeks,&#xD;
      totaling 16 sessions. The groups will be evaluated prior to physiotherapy intervention and at&#xD;
      the end. The following outcomes will be measured: renal function, functional capacity, muscle&#xD;
      strength of lower limbs and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease consists of kidney damage, with consequent progressive and&#xD;
      irreversible loss of kidney function. Lower circulating levels of α-klotho protein are&#xD;
      related to worsening kidney function and as it is affected, systemic changes occur and lead&#xD;
      to the involvement of other organs. Supplementation of soluble α-Klotho protein carried out&#xD;
      in experimental studies has been shown to be effective in protecting renal function, in&#xD;
      addition to slowing the progression of CKD. Endogenously, physical exercise seems to be a way&#xD;
      to increase circulating levels of α klotho. In addition, it is suggested that the contractile&#xD;
      activity of the skeletal muscle modulates the expression of circulating Klotho. The practice&#xD;
      of physical exercise is considered fundamental in the treatment of patients with CKD, since&#xD;
      they present loss of muscle mass and decline in muscle function, and consequently low rates&#xD;
      of physical activity and physical inactivity, which is strongly associated with mortality in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to mitigate the deleterious effects of sarcopenia in this population,&#xD;
      studies have shown beneficial effects of electrical stimulation, such as increased muscle&#xD;
      strength, functional capacity and protection against muscle atrophy of the lower limbs. In&#xD;
      addition to the clinical and functional effects, electrostimulation reduces DNA damage in&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis (HD), suggesting that electrical stimulation has a systemic effect.&#xD;
      In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation&#xD;
      on renal function and physical capacity in patients with CKD on HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 20 patients of both sexes, with CKD in stage V of the DRC&#xD;
      recruited from the HD outpatient of Santa Clara hospital at ISCMPA. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into an control or electrical stimulation group. The control group will be&#xD;
      evaluated and reassessed. Evaluations will be carried out before and after follow-up:&#xD;
      analysis of the plasma content of soluble α-Klotho and creatinine to assess renal function,&#xD;
      six-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess functional capacity, sit-and-stand test (STS) with 10&#xD;
      repetitions and dynamometry per load cell to assess muscle strength of lower limbs and&#xD;
      application of the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire for quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation will be performed during HD, twice a week, for eight weeks, totaling&#xD;
      16 sessions. In the same session, a protocol of neuromuscular electrical stimulation will be&#xD;
      applied to quadriceps muscle for 20 min. After, a protocol of sensory electrical stimulation&#xD;
      will be applied on kidney anatomical region for 45 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, is expected from patients who received electrical stimulation an&#xD;
      increase in kidney function and improvement on physical capacity, muscle strength and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
