  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor is one of the malignant diseases that people face. In 2015, the incidence of malignant&#xD;
      tumors was about 3.929 million, and the annual growth rate is about 3.9%. Chemotherapy is&#xD;
      currently the most commonly used treatment for patients with tumor, but chemotherapy also&#xD;
      brings many other problems, such as thrombocytopenia which can leads to increased medical&#xD;
      costs, chemotherapy cycles delayed, and chemotherapy doses reduced. Studies have found that&#xD;
      the reduction of the chemotherapy dose and the delay of the chemotherapy cycle will affect&#xD;
      the survival rate of patients. So it is an important to solve the problem of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are some methods to treat thrombocytopenia such as platelet transfusion,&#xD;
      rhTPO, rhIL-11 and other methods. However, these methods have some defects, platelets are at&#xD;
      risk of ineffective transfusion, rhTPO may produce neutralizing antibodies and rhIL-11 has&#xD;
      serious side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safer and faster methods to&#xD;
      treat chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. As a new generation of TPO receptor agonist,&#xD;
      avatrombopag has the advantages of being taken with food, no hepatotoxicity, good safety, and&#xD;
      rapidly increase platelet count. Therefore, avatrombopag has great research value in the&#xD;
      treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
