      This is a 2-part open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-sequence, 3-period crossover,&#xD;
      relative bioavailability, and food-effect study comparing different formulations of danicopan&#xD;
      in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For both parts of this study, on Day 1 of each period, participants will receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of danicopan as either the prototype powder-in-capsule (PIC) formulation (1 or 2)&#xD;
      under fed conditions, the prototype PIC formulation (1 or 2) under fasting conditions, or the&#xD;
      tablet formulation under fed conditions.&#xD;
