  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      budesonide, glycopyrronium and formoterol (BGF) metered dose inhaler (MDI) formulated with 3&#xD;
      different propellants: Propellant 1 (Treatment A [test]), Propellant 2 (Treatment B [test])&#xD;
      and Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) (Treatment C [reference]).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period: up to 28 days prior to first dosing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods of maximum 3 days each: participants will be resident from the&#xD;
           morning of the day before the first dosing with BGF MDI (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1,&#xD;
           throughout all treatment and washout periods up to discharge on Day 2 of Treatment&#xD;
           Period 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: within 3 to 7 days after the last administration of BGF MDI. There will be a&#xD;
           washout period of 3 to 7 days between each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive 3 single-dose treatments of BGF MDI (1 dose Propellant 1&#xD;
      [Treatment A]; 1 dose Propellant 2 [Treatment B] and 1 dose HFA [Treatment C]), following an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Each participant will be involved in the study for up to&#xD;
      53 days.&#xD;
