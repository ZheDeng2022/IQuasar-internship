  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label phase I/II trial studying the safety and efficacy of focal&#xD;
      're-priming' radiation therapy (RT) to FDG-avid residual sites of disease in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL) patients with incomplete response (IR) to&#xD;
      CAR T-cell therapy (CAR-T) by day 30 post-CAR-T PET/CT. We hypothesize that focal&#xD;
      're-priming' RT will be safe (phase I) and improve conversion to metabolic complete response&#xD;
      (CR) by day 90 post-CAR-T PET/CT from 29% (historical control) to 58% (phase II).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early clinical trials of CAR-T in R/R NHL suggest that only ~40% of patients achieve CR by&#xD;
      day 30 PET/CT evaluation. Of those who do not, the large majority (~70%) ultimately fail,&#xD;
      while ~30% convert to CR after a median time of 64 days (range, 49-424). This group of&#xD;
      patients, who have incomplete response on day 30 PET/CT after CAR-T and thus are most likely&#xD;
      to fail CAR-T alone, may be the ideal target for early therapeutic intervention to 're-prime'&#xD;
      CAR-T and convert them from IR to CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest potential immune augmentation when combining&#xD;
      RT with CAR-T. Therefore, we propose a phase I/II clinical trial investigating the impact of&#xD;
      RT to poor responding sites of disease after CD19-directed CAR-T in R/R NHL patients who are&#xD;
      likely to fail CAR-T alone. We hypothesize that focal RT to residual FDG-avid sites of&#xD;
      disease on day 30 PET/CT will improve the number of patients who convert to CR by day 90&#xD;
      PET/CT both through local cytotoxic effects as well as local and systemic synergistic effects&#xD;
      through 're-priming' of CAR T-cells.&#xD;
