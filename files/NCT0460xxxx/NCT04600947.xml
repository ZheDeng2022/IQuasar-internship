  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LP002 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which&#xD;
      prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell&#xD;
      activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.&#xD;
      In this study, the efficacy and safety of LP002 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma will be evaluated.&#xD;
