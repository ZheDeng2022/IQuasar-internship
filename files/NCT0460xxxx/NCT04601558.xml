  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient education in lifestyle changes has a positive effect on health in individuals with&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) risk. Despite current positive evidence about lifestyle and dietary&#xD;
      change in the prevention of CVD, the recommendations are still not consistently and optimally&#xD;
      applied to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of an intervention in the form of Cochrane&#xD;
      abstract letters on women between 45 to 65 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study took place in family medicine (FM) offices from 1 February 2018 to 1 June 2020. Two&#xD;
      FM offices were in the city of Split, the capital of the Split-Dalmatian County, two offices&#xD;
      were in Osijek, the capital of the Osijek-Baranja County, one in Kutina, and one in Rijeka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were all women between 45 to 65 years. The investigators enrolled 210&#xD;
      participants, and the participants were divided in three groups. The first group was control&#xD;
      group, and participants were not exposed to the intervention. The second group was&#xD;
      passive-intervention group, which means the participants received letters in the same time&#xD;
      period as active-intervention group but only with a reminder at their own cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk. The third group was active-intervention group, where the participants received&#xD;
      letters every three months, with their own cardiovascular disease risk and Cochrane abstracts&#xD;
      in the form of blog-shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants first completed the Pre-study questionnaire (Questionnaire 1), which&#xD;
      included: a) demographic data, b) attitudes and knowledge questionnaire about CV risk&#xD;
      factors, c) decisional conflict scale (DCS), and d) integrative hope scale (IHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attitudes and knowledge questionnaire about CV risk factors was created according to the&#xD;
      model of &quot;Ottawa Decision Support Tutorial&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCS consist of 16 items rated in a 5-point Likert-type response format, and measures&#xD;
      individual's uncertainty toward a course of action. There are five subscales: uncertainty,&#xD;
      informed, values clarity, support and effective decision. The scores on the total scale and&#xD;
      subscales are calculated as a sum of items, divided by the number of items and multiplied by&#xD;
      25, allowing for a score range from zero (no decisional conflict) to 100 points (extreme&#xD;
      decisional conflict). The Croatian version of the scale was previously validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IHS is 23-items scale, a self-rating instrument with items being rated on a six-point&#xD;
      Likert scale from 1, strongly disagree, to 6, strongly agree. It provides an overall score&#xD;
      and four dimension scores, obtained by summing up the individual item scores, with negative&#xD;
      items being rated inversely. This produces possible overall hope scores ranging from 23 to&#xD;
      138 with higher scores representing higher hopefulness. The scores for the sub-dimensions&#xD;
      vary according to the number of items. The Croatian version of the scale was previously&#xD;
      validated. Hope to be healthy at 70 and hope to reduce CV risk was assessed by a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale from 0 to 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten-year risk of fatal CVD was estimated using the ACC/AHA (American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology/American Heart Association) guidelines, based on the following data collected from&#xD;
      the study participants: age, gender, race, total and HDL (high-density lipoprotein)&#xD;
      cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, data about antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and smoking status. Also, BMI, waist and hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and smoking status were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first months after recruitment, all participants received letter on home address with&#xD;
      the count of their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, every two months, passive-intervention group and active-intervention group were&#xD;
      receiving letters. The passive-intervention group of women were receiving the letters only&#xD;
      with remainder on their own CV risk, and the active-intervention group were receiving&#xD;
      Cochrane abstracts in the form of blog-shots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were three Cochrane blog-shots. The first was about calcium in prevention of high blood&#xD;
      pressure, the second was about the effect of reducing saturated fat acids in eating habits&#xD;
      and the third consisted informations of green and black tea for the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
