  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal osteoporosis is one of the important medical disorders affecting women after&#xD;
      menopause. It is characterized by bone loss and reduced bone strength. In turn, this leads to&#xD;
      increased risk of fracture. Bone loss in postmenopausal women occurs when calcium leaks out&#xD;
      of the bones. Supplementing calcium and vitamin D is considered as standard prophylactic&#xD;
      measures against osteoporosis for postmenopausal women over age 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, various formulations of calcium salt are under development for the effective&#xD;
      supplementation of calcium. Pearlium/Effecti-Cal is a new formulation optimized for high&#xD;
      solubility of calcium salt. Formulation A5 (the base formulation of Pearlium/Effecti-Cal)&#xD;
      showed three fold higher retention of calcium in rats than calcium carbonate (the most&#xD;
      popular calcium supplement). High retention of calcium allowed the reduction of orally&#xD;
      administered calcium for the same effect. This can contribute to the reduction of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In postmenopausal women, bone mineral loss is reflected on the elevated level of bone&#xD;
      turnover markers. In this study, the efficacy of Pearlium/Effecti-Cal will be assessed by the&#xD;
      suppression of bone turnover markers. In addition, the safety of Pearlium/Effecti-Cal will be&#xD;
      evaluated with a bowel function diary, which can capture the profile of constipation&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will experience run-in period (two months) for removing the residual effect&#xD;
      of previously taken health product on bone turnover. For the following treatment period (six&#xD;
      months), one hundred and two participants will be allocated by chance into groups for the&#xD;
      treatment of Pearlium/Effecti-Cal or active comparator (conventional calcium supplement).&#xD;
