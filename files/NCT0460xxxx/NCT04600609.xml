  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-phase mixed methods study design. A literature review (Phase 1) has been&#xD;
      completed to determine the areas of exploration and to identify challenges faced and the&#xD;
      impact of the blood disorder on pediatric patients. Based on Phase 1, Phases 2 and 3, as&#xD;
      proposed in this study, will be completed and will include interviews of patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with bleeding and thrombotic disorders (phase 2). The interviews will be individual,&#xD;
      semi-structured, and consist of open-ended questions to elicit unbiased and in-depth&#xD;
      responses to gain an understanding of participant's perspectives on themes predetermined in&#xD;
      the study design phase.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of pediatric patients with blood&#xD;
      disorders, specifically thrombotic, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), and hemostatic or&#xD;
      bleeding disorders. The information gleaned from this study will help identify specific&#xD;
      challenges faced by patients with hemostatic and thrombotic disorders - information that is&#xD;
      necessary to develop impactful, evidence-based solutions to support patients with hemostatic&#xD;
      and thrombotic disorders cope with the physical, emotional, and psychological impact of blood&#xD;
      disorders. Participants with blood disorders in this study will participate in open-ended,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with a study investigator focusing on the psychosocial experiences&#xD;
      of patients with diagnosis and treatment of their underlying disorder and the understanding&#xD;
      of their diagnosis. Female participants additionally will be asked questions about the unique&#xD;
      effects of heavy menstrual bleeding, either from their underlying blood disorder or secondary&#xD;
      to anticoagulation, on similar aspects of the impact of having a blood disorder. Validated&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed to obtain concurrent quantitative data. The interviews will&#xD;
      be recorded and transcribed. Participation is complete after the interview has finished;&#xD;
      participants will continue to receive standard of care treatment during and beyond the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
