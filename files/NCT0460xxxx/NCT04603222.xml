      Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease that affects ~15-30 million people in the&#xD;
      USA alone. It creates an enormous societal and economic burden, decreases productivity in the&#xD;
      workplace, and affects the quality of lives of the people affected by this disease. DED is&#xD;
      primarily caused by blepharitis, a chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins. If left&#xD;
      untreated, blepharitis results in the obstruction and loss of the glands responsible for tear&#xD;
      film production. The standard of care is the use of self-administered at home commercially&#xD;
      available products, e.g., eyelid foams, gels, and pads. Although these products are helpful,&#xD;
      they have limitations. Patients often require expensive in office procedures, e.g., lid&#xD;
      debridement with exfoliation devices or more expensive procedures. The scope of this project&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new self-administered disposable ocular brush used in&#xD;
      conjunction with the most common eyelid cleanser. The investigators are looking to see if&#xD;
      combining the microexfoliation provided by the brush with the eyelid cleanser is more&#xD;
      effective at removing the eyelid debris than the cleanser alone.&#xD;

      Dry Eye Disease is a multifactorial disease that affects approximately 15-30 million people&#xD;
      in the United States alone. it creates an enormous societal and economic burden, decreases&#xD;
      productivity in our workplace, and significantly affects the quality of lives of the people&#xD;
      affected by this disease. Appoximately 86% of Dry Eye Disease is caused by Blepharitis, a&#xD;
      chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins. If left untreated, Blepharitis results in the&#xD;
      obstruction and eventual loss of the glands responsible for a critical component of tear film&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care in the treatment of Blepharitis is the use of self administered at home&#xD;
      commercially available products such as eyelid foams, gels, and pre moistened pads. These&#xD;
      products contain non abrasive cleansers designed to remove the buildup of biofilm and excess&#xD;
      microorganisms on the lid margin. Although these products are helpful, they do have some&#xD;
      limitations. Many patients still require more expensive in office procedures such as lid&#xD;
      debridement with electro-mechanical exfoliation devices or other even more expensive&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new self administered&#xD;
      disposable ocular brush used in conjunction with the most commonly prescribed commercially&#xD;
      available eyelid cleanser. The investigators are looking to see if combining the&#xD;
      microexfoliation provided by the brush with the eyelid cleanser is more effective at removing&#xD;
      the eyelid debris (scurfs, collarettes, and demodex) than the cleanser alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The Summit Ocular Brush used in conjunction with Ocusoft Original lid cleanser is&#xD;
      more effective than the cleanser alone at removing the debris (scurfs, collarettes, and&#xD;
      demodex) from the eyelids in the treatment and management of Blepharitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to determine if the addition of the ocular brush with the eyelid&#xD;
      cleanser has synergistic effects on reducing the signs and symptoms of Blepharitis and Dry&#xD;
      Eye Disease. They also hope to learn that with this additional step, further and more&#xD;
      expensive procedures could be avoided thereby decreasing the overall economic burden on the&#xD;
      patient and society as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants: Dr. Kevin Danahey, Dr. Richard Mangan, and Dr. Paul Karpecki are&#xD;
      the three clinical investigators for this multi-site study. They are all directors of Dry Eye&#xD;
      Clinics and regularly see patients throughout the course of the day. Potential participants&#xD;
      will be identified during routine office visits. Participants will be identified by&#xD;
      subjective symptoms and objective signs of Blepharitis. The SPEED (Standardized Patient&#xD;
      Evaluation of Eye Dryness) Questionnaire will be utilized to identify symptoms and Slit Lamp&#xD;
      Biomicroscopy will be used to identify objective clinical signs of Blepharitis. Once patients&#xD;
      are identified as potential candidates, they will be informed by the investigator that they&#xD;
      are a candidate for a study and asked if they would be interested in participating. A brief&#xD;
      explanation of the study will be given and the patient will be informed that regardless of&#xD;
      which group they are assigned to, they would still be receiving the current standard of care.&#xD;
      The candidates would then be asked to return so that the Investigators may provide informed&#xD;
      consent, thorough written and verbal instructions, HIPPA forms, SPEED questionnaires, and&#xD;
      treatment products. The patients would also have digital photos and video performed with Slit&#xD;
      Lamp Biomicroscopy at that time. These images would only involve the lids and lashes of the&#xD;
      subjects allowing the investigators to protect the identity, gender, and age of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: This multi-site study will involve 60 subjects. Each site will have 20 participants.&#xD;
      Each site will divide participants into two groups of 10. The control group will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care. The standard of care would be Ocusoft Lid Scrub Original Foaming Eyelid&#xD;
      Cleanser to be used once per day. The treatment group would receive the same treatment as the&#xD;
      control group with the addition of the experimental disposable ocular brush. The foam will be&#xD;
      applied to the brush and the subjects will gently provide a scrubbing action to the eyelids&#xD;
      while keeping the eyelids closed. They will also be instructed to perform treatment once per&#xD;
      day and to dispose of the brush after two weeks and replace it with a new brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to return to their respective site for two follow up visits.&#xD;
      The first visit will take place at two weeks commencing treatment and the final visit will&#xD;
      take place two weeks later for a total treatment duration of one month. During each visit,&#xD;
      the subjects will fill out the SPEED questionnaire and digital images and videos will be&#xD;
      taken. The length of each visit should take no longer than 15 minutes. At the conclusion of&#xD;
      the study, subjects in the treatment group will be asked to discontinue the experimental&#xD;
      brush. They would be asked to continue with the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SPEED scores and digital images would then be de-identified to avoid any bias by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and his research staff. These scores and images would be uploaded and&#xD;
      sent electronically via encrypted password protected file to Giles Duffield, PhD. for&#xD;
      interpretation and statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior blepharitis is an ophthalmologic condition characterized by an inflammation of the&#xD;
      eyelid margins. It can be acute or chronic with chronic being the more common form.&#xD;
      Blepharitis is a clinical diagnosis based on irritation of the lid margins with flaking and&#xD;
      crusting of the lashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main treatment for blepharitis is good eyelid hygiene and elimination of triggers that&#xD;
      exacerbate symptoms (Pflugfelder SC, Karpecki PM, Perez VL. Treatment of blepharitis: recent&#xD;
      clinical trials. Ocul Surf. 2014 Oct;12(4):273-84).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blepharitis is not specific to any group of people. It affects people of all ages,&#xD;
      ethnicities, and gender. It is more common in individuals older than the age of 50. The total&#xD;
      number of cases in the US at any one time is not known. In a 2009 US survey, 37% of patients&#xD;
      seen by an ophthalmologist and 47% of patients seen by an optometrist had signs of&#xD;
      blepharitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact pathophysiology of blepharitis is not known. The cause is most likely&#xD;
      multifactorial. Causative factors include a combination of chronic low-grade bacterial&#xD;
      infections of the ocular surface, inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea,&#xD;
      and parasitic infestations with Demodex mites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of products on the market that aid in reducing the inflammatory and&#xD;
      bacterial load to the lid margin and lashes. However, mechanical debridement (or lid scrubs)&#xD;
      is best at removing debris and the bacterial biofilm that forms in chronic cases. As one&#xD;
      ages, near vision and dexterity worsens. Timely and appropriate lid hygiene then suffers that&#xD;
      may result in lid and ocular infection, as well as vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Summit Ocular Brush proposed here should improve the effectiveness of personal home lid&#xD;
      hygiene, even in an aging population. This is what the Investigators wish to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design includes one experimental group and one control group. Subjects will&#xD;
      be divided up such that each clinic collects 10 subjects from each group. This will provide&#xD;
      us with 30 experimental and 30 control subjects and spread evenly between the three separate&#xD;
      clinical locations. Data analysis will be of still images taken from video and photographic&#xD;
      images of the eye lid margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be in the form of counts of eyelid debris, specifically 1) scurfs, 2) collarettes,&#xD;
      and 3) demodex. Analysis will be performed by Dr. Duffield and his team at the University of&#xD;
      Notre Dame and will be performed blind. Each subject data set will only be identifiable by a&#xD;
      code, which will not allow for prior knowledge of origins of treatment group. The n=30 sample&#xD;
      size is deemed appropriate for the application of standard statistical methods on continuous&#xD;
      data, specifically parametric t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Analysis at the&#xD;
      subgroup level (with 3+ groups), such as incorporation of gender or age fractionation,&#xD;
      parametric ANOVA or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests will be performed on the data,&#xD;
      followed by post-hoc pair wise comparison tests. In all cases, alpha will be set at 0.05,&#xD;
      i.e. p&lt; 0.05 will be seemed significant. The relatively large sample size of 30 subjects in&#xD;
      each main group affords us the opportunity to examine subgroup affects without concern that&#xD;
      the Investigators have insufficient numbers of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lid Scrubs are listed at every stage of the treatment algorithm for anterior blepharitis. As&#xD;
      patients age, their ability to perform proper lid scrubs / hygiene declines. Without proper&#xD;
      mechanical debridement of lid and lash flakes, scurfs, collarettes, or mites, this condition&#xD;
      can remain chronic or recalcitrant. Chronic use of topical antibiotics promotes bacterial&#xD;
      resistance and chronic use of steroids puts patients at risk for infection and elevated&#xD;
      intra-ocular pressure. With sound and proper debridement technique using the Summit Ocular&#xD;
      Brush, this should lesson the need for such prescription medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by their doctor's normal standard of care protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design includes one experimental group and one control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided up such that each clinic collects 10 subjects from each group. This&#xD;
      will provide us with 30 experimental and 30 control subjects and spread evenly between the&#xD;
      three separate clinical locations. Data analysis will be of still images taken from video and&#xD;
      photographic images of the eye lid margins. Data will be in the form of counts of eyelid&#xD;
      debris, specifically 1) scurfs, 2) collarettes, and 3) demodex. Analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      Dr. Duffield and his team at the University of Notre Dame and will be performed blind. Each&#xD;
      subject data set will only be identifiable by a code, which will not allow for prior&#xD;
      knowledge of origins of treatment group. The n=30 sample size is deemed appropriate for the&#xD;
      application of standard statistical methods on continuous data, specifically parametric&#xD;
      t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Analysis at the subgroup level (with 3+ groups),&#xD;
      such as incorporation of gender or age fractionation, parametric ANOVA or nonparametric&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis tests will be performed on the data, followed by post-hoc pair wise comparison&#xD;
      tests. In all cases, alpha will be set at 0.05, i.e. p&lt; 0.05 will be seemed significant. The&#xD;
      relatively large sample size of 30 subjects in each main group affords us the opportunity to&#xD;
      examine subgroup affects without concern that the Investigators have insufficient numbers of&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by their doctor's normal standard of care protocol. Participants&#xD;
      can be both male and female over the age of 18 with clinical signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      Blepharitis (Staphylococcal and Demodex). Participants must exhibit visible collarettes,&#xD;
      clear sleeves, and scurfs on the eyelid margins upon Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants both male and female under the age of 18. Patients with any active hordeolum&#xD;
      (stye), chalazion, periorbital cellulitis, or any evidence of allergic eyelid dermatitis.&#xD;
      Participants will also be excluded if they have any active acute bacterial conjunctivitis or&#xD;
      any active open periorbital wounds.&#xD;
