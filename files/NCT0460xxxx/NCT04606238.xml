      To support advanced cancer patients, for whom standard therapy is no longer available, and&#xD;
      their oncologists in therapy decisions, the investigators aim to develop a decision-making&#xD;
      aid (DA) in a multi-phased bicentric study. The DA aims to help patients to understand better&#xD;
      risks and benefits of available treatment options including the options of standard&#xD;
      palliative care, off-label drug use within an individual treatment plan and involvement in&#xD;
      early clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decisions about the provision of anticancer therapy and the initiation of palliative care in&#xD;
      the last months of life are frequent and challenging in clinical practice. Research indicates&#xD;
      that there is considerable heterogeneity regarding clinical practice in this context and that&#xD;
      oncologists' values influence treatment decisions, as well as whether or not patients&#xD;
      participate in these decisions. While there is evidence that seriously ill patients differ in&#xD;
      their choices between treatment options compared to healthy persons, as well as in their&#xD;
      evaluation of treatment goals and related care settings, there is a lack of analysis&#xD;
      regarding criteria relevant to patients in the last 6 months of life, when assessing the&#xD;
      benefit of anticancer treatment and palliative care. Yet, in decisions about anticancer&#xD;
      treatment and involvement of palliative care, patients' preferences and values are of&#xD;
      particular importance since anticancer treatment - while associated with high expectations&#xD;
      for a positive effect - often has only marginal influence on prognosis towards the end of a&#xD;
      cancer trajectory and sometimes forestalls choosing a palliative care setting or coping with&#xD;
      the disease. Hence, the decision has a high impact on patients' last months of life.&#xD;
      Involving patients more actively in the planning of their care has been on the agenda for&#xD;
      more than a decade, but the implementation of this idea in routine clinical practice remains&#xD;
      a challenge. Instead, oncologists often avoid prognosticating and eliciting patient&#xD;
      preferences for or against anticancer treatment and values in the last phase of life. One&#xD;
      important reason is that oncologists report discussions about ending anticancer therapy the&#xD;
      most challenging communication task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support advanced cancer patients, for whom standard therapy is no longer available, and&#xD;
      their oncologists in therapy decisions, the investigators aim to develop a decision-making&#xD;
      aid (DA) in a multi-phased bicentric study. The DA aims to help patients to understand better&#xD;
      risks and benefits of available treatment options including the options of standard&#xD;
      palliative care, off-label drug use within an individual treatment plan and involvement in&#xD;
      early clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase I, the DA will be developed after exploration of decisional needs of patients and&#xD;
      views of health care providers based on face-to face interviews and focus groups discussions.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the DA will be alpha-tested and redrafted, as necessary, in phase II. In phase&#xD;
      III, the DA will be (1) beta-tested with patients and oncologists and (2), and assessed by&#xD;
      experts. In the last project phase, the investigators will run a pre-post design study with&#xD;
      doctor-patient-encounters to access improvements on primary study outcome, i.e. patients'&#xD;
      level of decisional conflict. In addition, the user acceptance will be tested.&#xD;

It has 16 items and 5 response categories, ranging from &quot;0&quot; -strongly agree till &quot;4&quot;-strongly disagree</description>

Patients indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with the statements on a 5-point Likert scale. High scores on the quantity or quality scale indicate the importance of length or quality of life, respectively.</description>

    <description>Preferred role of the patient in decision-making will be assessed with a German version of the Control Preference Scale (CPS). It consists of five statement (A, B, C, D, E) that each portrays a different role in treatment decision-making.

Preference orders will be reclassified into Active (A, B), Collaborative ( C) and Passive (D, E). Ordinal categorical analysis can be applied.</description>
