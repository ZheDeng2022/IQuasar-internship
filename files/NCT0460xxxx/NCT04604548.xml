      This is an open-label, multi-centre study in subjects with a genetically confirmed&#xD;
      mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA)Leu(UUR) m.3243A&gt;G&#xD;
      mutation who completed study KH176-202. In the KH176-203 study subjects will be receiving&#xD;
      KH176 100 mg BID or KH176 50 mg bid in die (BID) (as determined by the investigator based on&#xD;
      safety / tolerability considerations) for a year, thereby ensuring continued treatment with&#xD;
      KH176 after study KH176-202. A final follow-up visit is scheduled 4 weeks after the intake of&#xD;
      the last dose of study medication for patients not rolling over into the compassionate use&#xD;
      program. Primary safety data and secondary efficacy (endpoint) data will be monitored and&#xD;
      reviewed every three months by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to evaluate&#xD;
      potential risks and benefits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases, estimated prevalence 1 in 4,300 adults, are caused by pathogenic&#xD;
      mutations in genes that ultimately encode mitochondrial proteins of the different enzyme&#xD;
      complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Of these mutations, the 3243&gt; G&#xD;
      nucleotide change in the mitochondrially encoded transfer RNALeu (UUR) leucine 1 gene (MT TL&#xD;
      1) is the most prevalent one. When mitochondria are defective, it can result in a wide&#xD;
      variety of serious and debilitating diseases, especially in energy-demanding tissues such as&#xD;
      the muscles and brain. Therefore, signs and symptoms of mitochondrial disease can include a&#xD;
      variety of symptoms such as fatigue, exercise tolerance, muscle weakness, and ataxia, heart&#xD;
      failure, deafness, blindness, stunted growth, and cognitive learning disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in understanding mitochondrial disease, treatment options are extremely&#xD;
      limited and largely supportive to date. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new&#xD;
      treatments. KH176, a pharmaceutical ingredient (API), is an orally bioavailable small&#xD;
      molecule under development for the treatment of these conditions. KH176 acts as a potent&#xD;
      intracellular redox modulating agent targeting the reactive oxygen species as demonstrated in&#xD;
      a number of in vitro and in vivo assays. An earlier phase II study showed positive effects of&#xD;
      KH176 on alertness and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to enable continued treatment with KH176-202 for&#xD;
      patients who have completed the KH176-202 study. Since KH176 is expected to be a chronic&#xD;
      treatment for mitochondrial diseases, this study will examine long-term safety and explore&#xD;
      long-term efficacy. To this end, the highest dose of 100 mg KH176 twice daily (safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated by the target group in study KH176-201) will be used as the initial dose, to be&#xD;
      administered over 1 year (minimum 365 days). Study KH176-202 uses doses of 50 mg twice daily&#xD;
      and 100 mg twice daily. Currently, this study is still blinded, but a review of blinded&#xD;
      safety data suggests that these doses are well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety data and secondary efficacy (endpoint) data will be monitored and reviewed&#xD;
      every three months by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to evaluate&#xD;
      potential risks and benefits.&#xD;

          8. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive&#xD;
             methods during the entire study, i.e., combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)&#xD;
             oral, intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation;, oral, injectable or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
             associated with inhibition of ovulation; use of an intrauterine device; an&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomy of the&#xD;
             partner. Any hormonal contraception method must be supplemented with a barrier method&#xD;
             (preferably male condom). Vasectomised partner is considered a highly effective birth&#xD;
             control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the subject and&#xD;
             that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.&#xD;
             Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as&#xD;
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated&#xD;
             with the study treatments. Reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in&#xD;
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 1: Natural family planning methods, female condom, cervical cap or diaphragm are&#xD;
             not considered adequate contraceptive methods in the context of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 2: To be considered not of childbearing potential, potential female subjects must&#xD;
             be post-menopausal for at least two years, or have been surgically sterilised&#xD;
             (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 6&#xD;
             months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 3: KH176 has been shown non-genotoxic judged from the Ames test, Chromosomal&#xD;
             Aberration test and in vivo Micronucleus test. Moreover, appreciable systemic exposure&#xD;
             from the exposure to (~2.5 mL) semen is extremely unlikely. However, until&#xD;
             reproductive toxicology studies have confirmed that KH176 does not adversely affect&#xD;
             normal reproduction in adult males and females, as well as causing developmental&#xD;
             toxicity in the offspring, the following contraceptive precautions must be adhered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to&#xD;
                  use condoms during the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  female partners of childbearing potential of male subjects must be willing to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraceptive methods during the entire study, i.e., a hormonal&#xD;
                  contraceptive method (pill, vaginal ring, patch, implant, injectable,&#xD;
                  hormone-medicated intrauterine device) or an intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able to comply with the study requirements, including swallowing study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
