  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In phase Ia study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B003 in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors will be investigated to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT),&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for MTD is not reached of&#xD;
      SI-B003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ib study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B003 in specific tumors will be&#xD;
      further investigated by selecting multiple doses based on the results of phase Ia study&#xD;
      or/and the fixed-dose administration method with the closest exposure level, and recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose (RP2D) for phase II clinical studies will be determined.&#xD;
