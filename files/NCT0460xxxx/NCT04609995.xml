    <textblock>
      This pilot, three-arm, randomized trial study involves 200 18-24-year-old young adult&#xD;
      men-who-have-sex-with-men (YMSM) recruited through the internet. YMSM are eligible if they&#xD;
      are 18-24 years-old, live in the United States, are not known to be HIV infected&#xD;
      (self-report), have ever had condomless anal sex with another man, and have never taken HIV&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The aim of this pilot project is to compare the effect of&#xD;
      financial incentives on encouraging YMSM to get tested for HIV and start PrEP for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be recruited online through advertising on the internet and&#xD;
      complete the study eligibility and consent procedures. Following provision of consent online,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted via the email they provided and asked to confirm their&#xD;
      willingness to participate. Email addresses are being collected as part of this study to help&#xD;
      ensure that individuals do not attempt to participate more than once in this study. Study&#xD;
      staff will review the email addresses for duplications. Anyone who attempts to enroll more&#xD;
      than once will be disqualified from the study. Participants will not ask for their name as&#xD;
      part of the study. Once study interest is confirmed, participants will be provided a study&#xD;
      identification number and study arm assignment. They also will be provided with instructions&#xD;
      specific to their study arm assignment for the study as well as online resources about HIV&#xD;
      testing and PrEP, including options for paying for PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms (no financial incentive, a&#xD;
      fixed incentive ($25 Amazon.com gift card) or a lottery (20% for a $100 Amazon.com gift&#xD;
      card). Participants in each study arm will be asked to contact the telehealth company&#xD;
      PlushCare and make an appointment within two weeks. For this appointment, participants will&#xD;
      speak with a PlushCare doctor about being tested for HIV and starting PrEP. They will provide&#xD;
      PlushCare with their study identification number. As part of their services, PlushCare will&#xD;
      obtain personal identifiers from participants but will not share this information with the&#xD;
      study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, participants are asked to undergo an evaluation for PrEP through the&#xD;
      PlushCare doctor, but will NOT be required to be tested for HIV nor start PrEP. It will be&#xD;
      the participants choice whether or not to be tested for HIV and start or continue PrEP after&#xD;
      consultation with the PlushCare doctor. For some participants, the PlushCare doctor might&#xD;
      recommend against starting PrEP. PlushCare will follow usual standard-of-care practices for&#xD;
      their evaluation, counseling and consideration of PrEP as well as provision and maintenance&#xD;
      of services for PrEP. Using only the study identification numbers and not the participant's&#xD;
      personal identifiers, PlushCare will provide the study staff with data on completion of the&#xD;
      primary and secondary study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that they or their healthcare insurance will bear the costs of&#xD;
      HIV testing and PrEP, but not the consultation with PlushCare. They will be provided with&#xD;
      resources about how to pay for PrEP from the study as well as PlushCare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the primary study outcome (completing an appointment with the telehealth&#xD;
      provider PlushCare for a PrEP evaluation) and secondary outcomes (undergoing HIV testing,&#xD;
      starting PrEP, time elapsed from study enrollment to PlushCare evaluation, time elapsed to&#xD;
      HIV testing and PrEP initiation) will be compared by study arms.&#xD;
