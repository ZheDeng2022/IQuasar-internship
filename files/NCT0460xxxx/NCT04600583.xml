    <description>To compare the ability to achieve soft tissue balance between Robotic Assisted Functional Alignment and Robotic Assisted Mechanical Alignment. This object will be achieved by comparing pre-operative plan and pre-resection gaps with the final surgical plan and implanted gaps as derived from the robotic system. The implant position is defined as the angulation of components and resected bone in each anatomical plane. The soft tissue balance is defined as gaps created in extension and 90° of flexion when stressing the medial compartment (medial collateral ligament) and lateral compartment (lateral collateral ligament). The overall limb alignment is assessed by comparing the Hip-Knee-Ankle angle from pre-operative to 1-year post-operative on a long leg weight bearing x-ray.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this group will undergo a TKA (total knee arthroplasty) to receive a Triathlon Total Knee System aligned according to Functional Alignment philosophy. This method of implant alignment is defined by a patient's native joint line as well as the soft tissue envelope. Triathlon Total Knee System components will be positioned relative to intra-operative soft tissue laxity assessment. A mobile application (KneeBalancer) will be used to assist surgeon decision making during the dynamic joint balancing surgical step.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this group will undergo a TKA (total knee arthroplasty) to receive a Triathlon Total Knee System neutrally aligned to the Mechanical axis. More specifically, the femoral component and tibial component are aligned 0° to the mechanical axis of each respective limb. Femoral component rotation is fixed to the trans-epicondylar axis. Soft tissue releases are performed at the discretion of the surgeon to achieve balance and full range of motion.</description>
