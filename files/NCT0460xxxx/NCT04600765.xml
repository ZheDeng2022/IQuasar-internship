      Dietary intervention studies thus far have failed to be replicable or causal. The results,&#xD;
      therefore, have failed to provide clinicians and the general public with consistent and&#xD;
      useful information on which to base reliable food-related health decisions. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant regarding plastic-derived chemicals (PDCs), such as Bisphenol A, now&#xD;
      that the federal CLARITY-BPA program has failed to achieve scientific consensus.&#xD;
      Investigators propose a novel human dietary protocol that is both replicable and causal,&#xD;
      based upon BPA's demonstrated inflammatory effects in humans. This first-of-a-kind dietary&#xD;
      intervention study explores a potential causal relationship between human serum levels of BPA&#xD;
      and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), a proven clinical indicator of inflammation.&#xD;
      Investigators used the equivalent of a USDA-defined &quot;typical diet&quot; followed by a PDC-reduced&#xD;
      diet to compare blood levels of hsCRP. This proof-of-concept investigation is the first to&#xD;
      use an easily accessible, medically-accepted clinical laboratory test to directly measure&#xD;
      human health effects of PDC reduction. Unexpected new complications discovered during the&#xD;
      investigation indicate that these results may yet be inconclusive for direct causal&#xD;
      relationship. However, the novel lessons and techniques developed as a result of those&#xD;
      discoveries offer further specific and improved methods and best practices that can enable&#xD;
      future dietary interventions to produce replicable, causal results.&#xD;
