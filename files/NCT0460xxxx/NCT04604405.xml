    <textblock>
      This project is a single-center, prospective, self-controlled clinical study. It intends to&#xD;
      select patients with simple medium and low degree myopia as subjects, and apply 650nm&#xD;
      low-energy red light irradiation to the retina to observe its effect on macular&#xD;
      microcirculation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 120 subjects are planned to be recruited and divided into 4 groups according to&#xD;
      age and intervention, including 30 in the juvenile intervention group, 30 in the juvenile&#xD;
      control group, 30 in the adult intervention group and 30 in the adult control group. Two&#xD;
      intervention groups received 650nm low-energy red light irradiation treatment with a 650nm&#xD;
      low-energy light emitter, twice a day for 3 minutes each time, The subjects were treated and&#xD;
      followed up for 3 months. The control group was not treated and followed up for 3 months too.&#xD;
      All subjects were followed up before treatment, at the end of the 1st month and at the end of&#xD;
      3rd month. Angio-oct was used as the main examination to observe and record the vascular&#xD;
      density and blood perfusion in macular area. Axial length, diopter and OCT were used as&#xD;
      secondary observation indexes. At the end of the experiment, the data of the intervention&#xD;
      group and the control group were compared&#xD;
