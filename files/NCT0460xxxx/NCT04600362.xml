  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nummular eczema (NE) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory skin disease that occurs&#xD;
      throughout all life periods. Diagnosis is made primarily clinically in correlation with&#xD;
      histological findings. Treatment of NE is difficult. Standard treatment consists of the use&#xD;
      of emollients, topical as well as systemic corticosteroids and phototherapy. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      remission is hard to achieve and relapse occurs often. Patients usually suffer from severe&#xD;
      pruritus and reduced quality of life. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupilumab (Dupixent®), a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway by&#xD;
      targeting the IL-4-receptor, has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD). Since there is an overlap between AD and NE with both being caused by&#xD;
      impaired epidermal barrier, broad immune-mediated inflammation and microbial skin&#xD;
      colonization, using Dupilumab in NE seems to be promising.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims on investigating the efficacy of Dupilumab in NE patients. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline&#xD;
      to week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the number of patients achieving an improvement (decrease) in&#xD;
      Physician Global Assessment (PGA) by two or more points at week 16 as compared to week 0 or&#xD;
      achieving an absolute PGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16, the EASI 50 score at week 16, the change from&#xD;
      baseline in transepidermal waterloss (TEWL) at week 16, significant histological improvement&#xD;
      at week 16, change from baseline in the reduction of the use of topical steroids at week 16,&#xD;
      change form baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at week 16, change from&#xD;
      baseline in Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS), change from baseline in the global&#xD;
      satisfaction subscale of the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM) score&#xD;
      at week 16 and the safety of Dupilumab.&#xD;
