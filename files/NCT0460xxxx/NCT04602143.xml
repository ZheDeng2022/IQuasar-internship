      This randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted between January 2018 and September 2019 at&#xD;
      the National Center for Reproductive Medicine, Hanoi, Vietnam. The eligibility of a total of&#xD;
      165 women with POR, undergoing IVF treatment, to be enrolled in the study was assessed.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included patients who met at least two of the following criteria: (i)&#xD;
      having one previous IVF/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle with ≤ 3 oocytes&#xD;
      recruited; (ii) AFC ≤ 5-7; and (iii) anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) ≤ 0.5 - 1.1 ng/mL were&#xD;
      enrolled. Exclusion criteria included donated gamete IVF cycles, thyroid disease, liver and&#xD;
      kidney dysfunction, and abnormal genitalia. After screening, eligible patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two TTG intervention groups (4-week and 6-week groups) and one control group&#xD;
      through a manual lottery. Allocation concealment was by sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. All participants were blinded to group assignment, but researchers were not&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum testosterone are measured before treatment. Durations of androgen supplement are 4 or&#xD;
      6-weeks. After completing the pretreatment, patients are asked to come back when they have&#xD;
      menses to begin IVF treatment. Serum testosterone is measured again after the pretreatment in&#xD;
      both groups. Patients will be interviewed for side effects and compliance of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, patients in both group undergo IVF treatment. IVF treatment will then be&#xD;
      performed for all patients, according to the current hospital treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at least until 12th week of gestation, if they have positive&#xD;
      pregnancy test after embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using STATA software version 14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX,&#xD;
      USA). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Proportions, means, and standard&#xD;
      deviations (SDs) were examined and presented for selected baseline variables by treatment&#xD;
      group. Comparisons of baseline characteristics and outcomes by treatment group were performed&#xD;
      with the use of ANOVA for continuous variables and a chi-square test for proportions. A&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction was used for multiple testing, in which the resulting P-value was&#xD;
      multiplied by the number of tests that measured similar constructs. Multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regressions were used to quantify the effects of the treatment group, adjusted for all&#xD;
      potential confounders including maternal age, body mass index (BMI), infertility duration,&#xD;
      primary or secondary infertility, and history of IVF treatment. All statistical tests were&#xD;
      two-sided, and P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
