  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Melasma is a commonly acquired hypermelanosis that affects facial sun exposed&#xD;
      areas, most commonly in Asians and other darker skin type females. Recent evidence has&#xD;
      demonstrated melasma to be a photoaging disorder. The histological findings of melasma are&#xD;
      similar to photoaging and include solar elastosis, increased mast cells and sebaceous glands,&#xD;
      as well as increased vascularization. Pendulous active melanocytes with weakened basal&#xD;
      membranes, and changes in nuclear morphology and chromatin texture of adjacent basal&#xD;
      keratinocytes also seemed to be a characteristic feature of melasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the difference of photoaging features of melasma skin and normal skin by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (ApolloVue® S100 Image System, a 510(K) class II medical device) and&#xD;
      reversal of photoaing features by 755nm picosecond alexandrite laser with diffractive lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We enroll 20 adults with facial melasma. The patients received 755nm picosecond alexandrite&#xD;
      laser with diffractive lens array over whole face at W0, W4, and W8. Evaluation with VISIA,&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography, Cutometer MPA580 at W4, W8, W12. All the patients will be&#xD;
      instructed with use of moisturizer, gentle cleaning, and sunscreen use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results and applications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expects to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. understand the role of 755nm picosecond alexandrite laser with diffractive lens of&#xD;
           reversal of photodamage and improving the melasma by evaluation with optical coherence&#xD;
           tomography and other noninvasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Set evidence based guidance for melasma treatment and set the protocol or clinical path.&#xD;
