  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with solid tumors. One new way is&#xD;
      called cancer genomic medicine. In cancer genomic medicine, doctors use tests to look at the&#xD;
      genetic information in a solid tumor. These tests are called panel tests. The results of the&#xD;
      panel tests help doctors to choose the best type of medicine to treat that tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about what a large number of patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors think are the burden and benefits of taking panel tests. The researchers also&#xD;
      want to know what doctors who treat patients with solid tumors think about panel tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include about 650 men and women in Japan who are at least 20 years old. About&#xD;
      340 of the participants will be patients with solid tumors who are taking medicine to help&#xD;
      treat their tumors. About 310 of the patients will be doctors who are treating patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 parts in this study. Part 1 will include patients with solid tumors. Parts 2&#xD;
      and 3 will include patients with solid tumors and doctors who are treating patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors. In each part, the patients and doctors will answer questions about what they&#xD;
      think of panel tests. During Part 1, all of the patients will answer questions in a&#xD;
      teleconference. Some of the patients and physicians in Part 2 will also answer questions in a&#xD;
      teleconference. During Part 2 and Part 3, all of the patients and doctors will complete an&#xD;
      online questionnaire.&#xD;
