  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals&#xD;
      across Europe (UK, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands). In total, 50 adult patients with a&#xD;
      hearing loss that are already planned for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin)&#xD;
      bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after implantation&#xD;
      of the Ponto implant system using a minimally invasive surgical technique.&#xD;

      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals&#xD;
      across Europe (UK, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands). In total, 50 adult patients with a&#xD;
      hearing loss that are already planned for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin)&#xD;
      bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after implantation&#xD;
      of the Ponto implant system using a minimally invasive surgical technique. The implant,&#xD;
      coupled to a skin-penetrating abutment, is implanted in the bone behind the ear and is later&#xD;
      loaded with a sound processor which transforms sound waves to sound vibrations that can be&#xD;
      sent directly to the inner ear via the skull bone. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the proportion of implant/abutment complexes providing a reliable anchorage for a&#xD;
      sound processor three months after implantation/surgery.&#xD;
