      This is a phase 2, open-label, umbrella study, with the purpose to evaluate the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of chemoradiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy and/or targeted&#xD;
      treatment in high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The specific&#xD;
      grouping of patients' depends on the SYSUCC immune subtyping based on 100+ gene panel&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
