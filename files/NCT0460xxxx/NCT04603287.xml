  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In phase Ia study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B001 in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic epithelial malignancies will be investigated to determine the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SI-B001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ib study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B001 at the phase Ia recommended&#xD;
      dose will be further investigated, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for phase II clinical&#xD;
      studies will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      SI-B001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epithelial tumors will be evaluated.&#xD;
