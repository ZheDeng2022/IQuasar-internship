  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular consumption of dairy products is found to negatively associated with metabolic&#xD;
      diseases and improve body composition in long term studies and has positive effect on acute&#xD;
      glycemia control and satiety. However, new Canada's Food Guide released in 2019 promotes a&#xD;
      shift from traditional dairy products to plant-based dairy alternatives. The present study&#xD;
      examines the effect of traditional dairy products in comparison with plant-based alternatives&#xD;
      on glycemic response and satiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past forty years, the prevalence of obesity in adults has doubled, and nearly two&#xD;
      thirds of Canadian adults are currently overweight or obese (Kenneth and Eggleton,2016). The&#xD;
      incidence of diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain cancers has also increased&#xD;
      correspondingly (Xavier P. 2010). Obesity not only leads to other chronic diseases but also&#xD;
      decreases life expectancy and puts a strain on the health care system (Tremmel 2017).&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to find strategies to minimize obesity and type-2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemia (PPG) has been identified to be one of the implications of risk factor&#xD;
      of metabolic diseases such as obesity (Black 2012). To better help identify foods that&#xD;
      increase satiety and decrease PPG, Health Canada released a draft guidance document to&#xD;
      validate health food claims related to &quot;reduction of post-prandial glycaemic response&quot;&#xD;
      (Health Canada 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular consumption of dairy products correlates with improved body composition and lower&#xD;
      incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes in both observational and long-term clinical&#xD;
      studies (Hirahatake et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2018; Murphy et al. 2013; Soedamah-Muthu and de&#xD;
      Goede 2018). Within typical dietary patterns, high-fat dairy consumption is inversely&#xD;
      associated with the risk of obesity or overweight (Kratz et al. 2013; Rautiainen et al.&#xD;
      2016). Frequent cheese consumption was associated with lower BMI in a 10 year follow-up study&#xD;
      (Guo et al. 2018). The hypothesis that these associations between dairy and obesity and&#xD;
      chronic metabolic diseases can be attributed to lasting metabolic effects of dairy when&#xD;
      consumed with high glycemic carbohydrate or as a between meal snack is supported by short&#xD;
      term studies. A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials concluded that, dairy products when&#xD;
      consumed alone result in significant decreases in appetite and later energy intake (Onvani et&#xD;
      al. 2017). Other recent studies have shown that milk consumed with a high glyemic breakfast&#xD;
      cereal significantly reduced PPG as well as appetite in both young (Kung et al. 2018; Law et&#xD;
      al. 2017a) and older adults (Law et al. 2017b). Among dairy products, semi solid and solid&#xD;
      dairy products such as cheese and yogurt consumed with carbohydrates increased satiety and&#xD;
      lowered PPG more than milk or soy beverages (Law et al. 2017b). PPG and appetite were&#xD;
      significantly reduced following single serving amounts, of skim-milk, full fat milk, yogurt&#xD;
      and cheese when consumed alone (Vien et al. 2019). Appetite measured over three hours was&#xD;
      reduced after dairy consumption compared to a water control, particularly skim milk reducing&#xD;
      appetite more than full fat milk, yogurt or cheese. Over 120 minutes, PPG was the lowest&#xD;
      after cheese (Vien et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data suggests that dairy consumed immediately before a meal will affect satiety and&#xD;
      glycemic responses to a later meal, but the response will depend on the type of dairy product&#xD;
      consumed. The updated Canada's Food Guide promotes the consumption of plant-based protein and&#xD;
      a shift away from consuming dairy products as plant-based products may provide more fibre and&#xD;
      less saturated fat (Canada Food Guide 2019). As a result, many plant based dairy substitutes&#xD;
      have appeared in the marketplace. However, these new products, in addition to being of low&#xD;
      protein quality, my lack the physiological functionality of dairy in metabolic regulation.&#xD;
