        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants between the ages of 18 (or the minimum country-specific&#xD;
             age of consent if &gt;18) and 70 years, inclusive, at the screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 38.0 kg/m2, inclusive; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg&#xD;
             (110 lb), at the screening visit; with a single repeat assessment of total body weight&#xD;
             (and hence BMI), on a separate day permitted to assess eligibility, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, prior bariatric surgery,&#xD;
             gastrectomy, ileal resection); NOTE: Participants who have undergone cholecystectomy&#xD;
             and/or appendectomy are eligible for this study as long as the surgery occurred more&#xD;
             than 6 months prior to Screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, participants with a positive result for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) antibodies, as assessed by sponsor-identified central laboratory, with a single&#xD;
             repeat permitted to assess eligibility, if needed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive COVID-19 test at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is documented by medical history;&#xD;

          -  Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine&#xD;
             neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2), or participants with suspected MTC per the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prior/concomitant therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known prior participation (ie, randomized and received at least 1&#xD;
             dose of investigational product) in a study involving PF-06882961;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             Visit 1, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test, for illicit drugs at screening, as assessed by&#xD;
             sponsor-identified central laboratory. However, participants in Cohorts 2-4, only, who&#xD;
             have been medically prescribed opiates/opioids or benzodiazepines and report the use&#xD;
             of these drugs to the investigator at the Screening visit will be allowed to&#xD;
             participate; NOTE: repeat urine drug testing is not permitted in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening or Day -1, a positive breath alcohol test, as assessed using kits&#xD;
             provided by sponsor-identified central laboratory, with a single repeat on a separate&#xD;
             day permitted to assess eligibility, if needed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing and until the follow-up contact; 13. History of&#xD;
