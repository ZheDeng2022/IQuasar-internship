      This study consists of having subjects, those with calcium oxalate kidney stones as well as&#xD;
      healthy controls, consume low and oxalate enriched diets to investigate the role of oxalate&#xD;
      on crystalluria (the presence of crystals in urine), immunity and infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20-30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non tobacco users or not pregnant/breast feeding/nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal fasting blood comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, C-reactive&#xD;
             protein, and urinalysis. Must accurately collect two 24-hour urine collections within&#xD;
             20% of appropriate ratio of creatinine (mg)/body weight (kg) for gender&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects: No history of calcium oxalate kidney stones (CaOx KS) or other&#xD;
             medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CaOx KS: Recent stone composition greater than 50% CaOx; no uric acid or&#xD;
             struvite stone content must be present. Must be first time or recurrent CaOx stone&#xD;
             former (last stone event within the past 3 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to not consume supplements (i.e. vitamins, Ca (citrate or carbonate) and other&#xD;
             minerals, herbal supplements, nutritional aids, and probiotics) for 2 weeks before the&#xD;
             study and during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from vigorous exercise during the study as this may compromise&#xD;
             immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to consume diets provided only by the University of Alabama Center for&#xD;
             Clinical and Translational Science Bionutrition Core. No food allergies or intolerance&#xD;
             to any of the foods on the study menus.&#xD;
&#xD;

             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If on medications for kidney stone prevention (e.g. thiazides, citrate supplementation&#xD;
             excluding calcium citrate), patients must be on a stable dose regimen for at least 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to and during screening, with no changes in dosing anticipated during the&#xD;
             study. Patients should not take allopurinol for 2 weeks prior to screening since&#xD;
             allopurinol has anti-oxidant properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet the inclusion criteria or physician refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to sign and read the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical, psychiatric, or social conditions that would prohibit participants from&#xD;
             abiding to the study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 or less than 20 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tobacco users or pregnant or breast feeding/nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal fasting blood comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, C-reactive&#xD;
             protein, and urinalysis. Inaccurate 24-hour urine collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects: Taking medications or dietary supplements. History of kidney stones&#xD;
             or any medical condition that could influence absorption or excretion of oxalate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active illness including COVID-19, flu, common cold, fever, diarrhea, urinary tract&#xD;
             infections or other infections 14 days before the study and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active disease including diabetes, gout, hypertension, primary hyperoxaluria,&#xD;
             nephrotic syndrome, enteric hyperoxaluria, renal tubular acidosis, primary&#xD;
             hyperparathyroidism, liver disease, autoimmune disorder, neurogenic bladder, urinary&#xD;
             diversion, and bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy or treatment for malignancy within 12 months prior to screening.&#xD;
