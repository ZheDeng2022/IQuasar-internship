      This study is being conducted to validate early and ultra-early blood-based and novel imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers of Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI), Microvascular Injury (MVI), and neuroinflammation&#xD;
      that may serve as predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a new cohort of&#xD;
      moderate-severe TRACK-TBI subjects. The study team will enroll a cohort of moderate to severe&#xD;
      TBI subjects (N=50), stratified according to VA/DoD criteria for these injury severities&#xD;
      through the existing TRACK-TBI network sites to obtain novel advanced neuroimaging and more&#xD;
      frequent biomarker sampling. Subjects will be assessed over 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2009, the multicenter Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain&#xD;
      Injury Consortium was implemented to characterize the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), and blood-based biomarker features of TBI to inform design of next-generation&#xD;
      precision medicine clinical trials in TBI. Over the past 10+ years, TRACK-TBI has been&#xD;
      supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Department of&#xD;
      Defense (DoD), Department of Energy (DoE), the National Football League, and other&#xD;
      philanthropic and industry partners. TRACK-TBI has enrolled &gt;3000 control and TBI subjects&#xD;
      across the injury spectrum at 18 US Level 1 Trauma Centers. This effort has established the&#xD;
      world's largest collection of TBI imaging studies and bio-specimens. The study results are&#xD;
      already being adopted into clinical research and bedside practice. The TRACK-TBI Consortium&#xD;
      is now primed to deliver on critical military and public health knowledge gaps and needs:&#xD;
      objective classification of TBI based on what is termed as &quot;mechanistic&quot; endophenotypes,&#xD;
      e.g., diffuse axonal injury (DAI), microvascular injury (MVI), and neuroinflammation. An&#xD;
      endophenotype is an internal phenotype discoverable by biochemical, physiological,&#xD;
      radiological, pathological, or other techniques, which is intermediate between a complex&#xD;
      phenotype and the presumptive genetic or environmental contribution to a disease.&#xD;
      Endophenotypes are quantitative, continuous variables, unlike a phenotype which is usually a&#xD;
      binary, categorical variable. These mechanistic endophenotypes, defined by imaging and&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers, will direct targeted treatments based on mechanism, providing the&#xD;
      tools needed for successful execution of precision medicine clinical trials. To achieve the&#xD;
      goal of precision medicine in TBI, it is necessary to identify subgroups of TBI patients that&#xD;
      will respond to a targeted therapy. Investigators will assess putative blood-based and&#xD;
      neuroimaging biomarkers for DAI, MVI, and neuroinflammation. Fluid biomarkers complement&#xD;
      imaging markers and may provide important tools for precision medicine clinical trials.&#xD;
      Investigators will collect acute data (early and ultra-early i.e., hours-days following&#xD;
      injury), to validate the utility of these biomarkers in defining TBI mechanistic&#xD;
      endophenotypes for use in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim for TRACK-TBI Precision Medicine Phase 2-Option 1: To validate early and&#xD;
      ultra-early blood based and novel imaging biomarkers of DAI, MVI, and neuroinflammation that&#xD;
      may serve as predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a cohort of moderate-severe&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The TRACK TBI investigators have created a Data Use Agreement/Human Materials Transfer Agreement (DUA/HTMA) for TRACK-TBI Research Collaborations. This Agreement is for the use of clinical data, neuroimaging, and bio-specimens collected by the TRACK-TBI investigators. All Research Collaborators can submit a written request to the TRACK-TBI Executive Committee.&#xD;
This study involves research in the area of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Department of Defense, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, has developed the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System, a central repository and resource for sharing data to promote collaboration, accelerate research, and advance knowledge on the characterization, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TBI. The TRACK-TBI Investigators will share study data via FITBIR in accordance with FITBIR policy and procedures.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available after study completion.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>All Research Collaborations with TRACK-TBI begins with a written request submitted to the TRACK-TBI Executive Committee. The Research Collaboration Proposal form is attached as Appendix 1 in the Research Collaboration Policy available on the TRACK-TBI website.&#xD;
Access to FITBIR data will be according to FITBIR policies found at https://fitbir.nih.gov/jsp/about/policy.jsp</ipd_access_criteria>
