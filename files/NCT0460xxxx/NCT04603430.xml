    <textblock>
      The STEPS program is a wellness program where senior citizens are partnered with Doctor of&#xD;
      Physical Therapy (DPT) students, who design individualized fitness plans for each senior&#xD;
      participant. In both the Spring and Fall semesters, first- and second year DPT student teams&#xD;
      provide guided interventions based upon the fitness goals and initial examination findings of&#xD;
      each participant. Program sessions are held once a week for one hour at a local senior&#xD;
      wellness center located in Utica, NY. Facility membership requirements include a small annual&#xD;
      membership fee and stipulate that members must be 55 years of age or older. The STEPS&#xD;
      participants are recruited primarily by word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the STEPS program is to provide an accessible fitness service to improve the&#xD;
      health of the Utica community while also supplementing the clinical experiences of students&#xD;
      enrolled in the DPT program at Utica College. The program gives students an opportunity to&#xD;
      practice clinical skills and reasoning on a weekly basis, and establishes a mentorship&#xD;
      component between students. Second-year students are enrolled in a clinical education course&#xD;
      for both the Fall (DPT 689) and Spring semesters (DPT 699). Examination and interventions are&#xD;
      documented on the WebPT electronic medical record system. Participant reassessments are&#xD;
      conducted twice, halfway through the semester and again at the end of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF STUDY Clinics and health programs facilitated by students allow clinical&#xD;
      experiences to be interwoven throughout the curriculum and provide students with the&#xD;
      opportunity to learn and serve in their community. Research regarding these programs has&#xD;
      primarily centered around pro-bono clinics run by medical students, and has been limited to&#xD;
      the impact these programs have upon learning. No research has been conducted regarding how a&#xD;
      local senior wellness program, such as the STEPS program, impacts senior fitness and DPT&#xD;
      student engagement. This study will assess the effect that the STEPS program has upon the&#xD;
      health of local seniors, while also qualitatively investigating the impact that the program&#xD;
      has had upon the lives of local seniors and students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these research questions, a retrospective chart review will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate the functional outcomes of participating seniors. Additionally, qualitative focus&#xD;
      groups will be convened to reflect upon the impact that the STEPS program has had upon the&#xD;
      seniors and students.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN A mixed-method study design will be used to assess functional outcomes of the&#xD;
      Students Teaching Elderly Prevention and Safety (STEPS) program on senior participants, as&#xD;
      well as the impact of the program on both participants and students. In order to assess&#xD;
      functional outcomes, a retrospective chart review will be conducted on a convenience sample&#xD;
      of participants enrolled in the STEPS program from September 2018 to April 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore participant and student perspectives of the STEPS program, a Glaserian&#xD;
      grounded theory approach will be utilized. Grounded theory is a qualitative research&#xD;
      methodology commonly employed in healthcare research due to its inductive, systematic process&#xD;
      of gathering and interpreting data. Data gleaned from focus groups is continuously analyzed&#xD;
      for patterns, from which a thematic consensus emerges. Semi -structured interview questions&#xD;
      will be proposed to focus groups of students and senior participants who were involved in the&#xD;
      STEPS program during the study time frame. Prior to starting the focus group discussion,&#xD;
      subjects will be given a demographic survey to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEYS Demographic information will be collected from senior participants and&#xD;
      students via a written survey filled out prior to the focus group session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES To analyze the impact that the STEPS program has upon&#xD;
      participant health, functional outcomes will be obtained from a retrospective chart review of&#xD;
      included senior participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the initial evaluations, the mid-term evaluation, and the final evaluation&#xD;
      will be collected. Additionally, the total number of sessions each senior participant&#xD;
      attended will be collected. The data that will be extracted from the chart review will&#xD;
      include, vital signs, and physical outcome measures, which are discussed further below. We&#xD;
      are looking specifically for measures of aerobic capacity, balance, and indicators of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and pulmonary health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of aerobic capacity will include the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and the Two Minute&#xD;
      Step Test (2MST). The 6MWT assesses the distance an individual can walk in six minutes and it&#xD;
      is considered a valid and reliable test to assess exercise tolerance in community dwelling&#xD;
      seniors . The 2MST measures the number of high knees an individual can complete in a&#xD;
      two-minute timeframe, and it is also considered a valid means to evaluate aerobic capacity in&#xD;
      seniors. Measures of balance that will be analyzed will include the Timed-Up-and-Go Test, the&#xD;
      Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, the BERG Balance Scale, the Mini Balance&#xD;
      Evaluation Systems Test, the Dynamic Gait Index, the Functional Reach Test, the Single Leg&#xD;
      Stance Test, the Romberg Test, and the Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance.&#xD;
      Indicators of cardiovascular and pulmonary health will include vital signs, such as blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVIEW QUESTIONS Questions will be pilot tested with a purposive sample of eligible STEPS&#xD;
      participants and students. Questions will be used to direct the focus groups, however, focus&#xD;
      group discussion will be not restricted to these topics, as the Glaserian grounded theory&#xD;
      approach allows for focus group members to guide the discussion process. Depending on&#xD;
      feedback gained from pilot focus group sessions, questions may be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT INTERVIEWS In order to assess the construct validity of proposed focus group questions,&#xD;
      prospective questions will be pilot tested with a group of seniors and students who&#xD;
      participated in the STEPS program prior to the 2018-2019 academic year. Focus groups of pilot&#xD;
      testers will be conducted in a manner similar to their respective demographic cohort. Focus&#xD;
      groups of student pilot testers will be convened over a private virtual chat platform. Focus&#xD;
      groups of senior pilot testers will be convened in a private virtual chat room. Each pilot&#xD;
      sessions will last for fort-five to sixty-minutes, and will end when saturation is achieved.&#xD;
      One or two researchers will facilitate the focus groups and another researcher will observe&#xD;
      the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEPS PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS In order to assess the impact that the STEPS program has upon&#xD;
      seniors, focus groups of 4 to 6 subjects will be convened for forty-five to sixty-minute-long&#xD;
      sessions in a private virtual chat room. Sessions will end when saturation is met, meaning&#xD;
      that no new insights are being revealed by focus group members. One or two researchers will&#xD;
      facilitate the focus groups and another researcher will observe the focus group and take&#xD;
      field notes. All researchers will receive training regarding proctoring focus groups. Focus&#xD;
      groups will be conducted between June 2020 and November 2020 and will be audio-taped and&#xD;
      later transcribed by the researchers. After transcription is complete, transcripts will be&#xD;
      reviewed by research participants to confirm that transcription and initial interpretation&#xD;
      objectively captured participant insights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDENT INTERVIEWS In order to assess the impact that the STEPS program has upon students,&#xD;
      focus groups of 4 to 6 subjects will be convened for forty-five to sixty-minute-long sessions&#xD;
      in a private virtual chat platform. Sessions will end when saturation is met, meaning that no&#xD;
      new insights are being revealed by focus group members. One or two researchers will&#xD;
      facilitate the focus groups and another researcher will observe the focus group and take&#xD;
      field notes. The focus group facilitators have had no prior relationship with student&#xD;
      participants. No-one else, aside from focus group members and researchers, will be present&#xD;
      during the sessions. Focus groups will be conducted between June 2020 and November 2020 and&#xD;
      will be audio-taped and later transcribed by the researchers. After transcription is&#xD;
      complete, transcripts will be reviewed by research participants to confirm that transcription&#xD;
      and initial interpretation objectively captured participant insights.&#xD;
