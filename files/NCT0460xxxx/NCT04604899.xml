  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of repeat injection of human&#xD;
      retinal progenitor cells (jCell) in adult subjects with RP that have previously been treated&#xD;
      with jCell.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, Phase 2 study of human retinal progenitor&#xD;
      cells (jCell) for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The study will include only&#xD;
      subjects previously treated with jCell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess reinjection of a previously treated eye, subjects who have previously been treated&#xD;
      with jCell and desire a second treatment in the same eye will be enrolled. Subjects must have&#xD;
      completed at least 12 months of follow up since the prior injection of jCell. Subjects who&#xD;
      have had both eyes previously treated with jCell will only have one eye retreated; the eye to&#xD;
      be retreated will preferably be the better seeing eye, but exceptions may be made by the&#xD;
      study investigator, taking into consideration BCVA, prior response to treatment, and any&#xD;
      other medical conditions that may indicate which eye is the best candidate for retreatment.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 12 months for safety and efficacy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing to give written informed consent, able to make the required study visits and&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Completed the 12 months of follow up in the subject's most recent jCell study and did&#xD;
             not withdraw from the study for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate organ function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  blood counts (hematocrit, Hgb, WBC, platelets and differential) within normal&#xD;
                  range, or if outside of normal range, not clinically significant as judged by the&#xD;
                  investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  liver function: alanine transaminase [ALT] and aspartate transaminase [AST] ≤2&#xD;
                  times the upper limit of the normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range&#xD;
