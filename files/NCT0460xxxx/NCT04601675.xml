      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome after intraocular injections of&#xD;
      Ranibizumab or combination of Ranibizumab and Dexamethasone under pro re nata treatment&#xD;
      regimen for the patients with Diabetic Macular Edema patients. Mean change of logarithm of&#xD;
      the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA), central foveal thickness (CFT),&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity (CS) as well as predictive factors including best-corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCVA), vision related questionnaires and various other ocular parameters will be&#xD;

          2. Central retinal subfield thickness of &lt; 300 microns provided that intraretinal and/or&#xD;
             subretinal fluid is present in the central subfield (central 1 mm) related to diabetic&#xD;
             macular oedema AND&#xD;

             epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction, vein occlusion, or others&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The eye is ineligible for macular laser treatment, as judged by the treating&#xD;
             ophthalmologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The eye has DMO and central subfield retinal thickness (CST) of &gt; 400 microns.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The eye has activeA proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The eye has received intravitreal Anti- Vascular Endothelical Growth Factor&#xD;
             (Anti-VEGF) therapy within the previous two months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The eye has received intravitreal injection of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The eye has received cataract surgery within the previous six weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The eye has received panretinal photocoagulation within the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients on pioglitazone and the drug cannot be stopped 3 months prior to entering&#xD;
             into the trial and for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             preclude participation in the study (such as unstable medical status or severe disease&#xD;
             that would make it difficult for the patient to be able to complete the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has very poor glycemic control and started intensive therapy within the&#xD;
             previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The patient will use an investigational drug during the study&#xD;
