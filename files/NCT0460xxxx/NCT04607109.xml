  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thanks to the evolution in knowledge and technical advances in premature newborn intensive&#xD;
      care, the survival of very premature infants is now possible. However, prognosis remain&#xD;
      sometimes uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the Epipage 2 study showed a significant improvement as compared with the 1997&#xD;
      Epipage1 study with a decrease in mortality and an increase of the survival rate without&#xD;
      severe morbidity of 14% for preterm babies born between 25 and 29 weeks and 6% for babies&#xD;
      born between 30 and 31 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, surviving babies without initial major deficiencies, may later show problems in&#xD;
      terms of growth, sensory - motor and/or neuro-psychologic development. This untoward&#xD;
      evolution lead to social and family interaction disorders and school difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a perinatal care network was created for each Region in France, making it&#xD;
      possible to take care of these vulnerable children early on and all along their development.&#xD;
      A retrospective study will evaluate 97 pre-term babies born before 33 weeks in 2012 and who&#xD;
      are taken care of at Nancy as part of the Lorraine regional network program &quot;Rafael&quot; until&#xD;
      they are 7 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate objectively the neurocognitive and school abilities of these&#xD;
      children at the age of 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 8 years of age, a secondary measure of outcome will be the impact of the eventual&#xD;
      neurocognitive consequences on the quality of their family life, on the behavior of the child&#xD;
      and the parents' feelings. This way more options to improve the way they are taken care of&#xD;
      will be available.&#xD;
