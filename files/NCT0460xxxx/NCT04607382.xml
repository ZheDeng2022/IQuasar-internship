  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to gain more information on the treatment effect of Low-dose&#xD;
      Estrogen Progestin (a hormone treatment) on the health related quality of life and work&#xD;
      productivity in patients suffering from menstrual pain. The treating doctors will ask the&#xD;
      study participants to complete questionnaires at start of study, after 2 and 4 months (end of&#xD;
      study). The questions will be about participant's general and mental health, concentration,&#xD;
      behavioral and emotional changes, and work productivity and activity level. This study will&#xD;
      be conducted in Japan and enrols about 380 female participants in the age range of 16 to 39&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

        The study is a prospective, non-interventional study for patients being treated for primary&#xD;
        or secondary dysmenorrhea in real-world clinical practice. Patients will be recruited using&#xD;
        M3 group network. M3 is a company that provides a medical portal site for HCPs, and more&#xD;
        than 280,000 medical doctors are registered with M3 with 80% coverage in Japan. As many&#xD;
        patients with dysmenorrhea visit ob/gyn clinics rather than hospitals, patients diagnosed&#xD;
        as primary or secondary dysmenorrhea will be recruited by gynecologists who work in the&#xD;
        clinics enrolled in M3. When patients agree to participate in the study, the gynecologists&#xD;
        provide the QR code or URL to the patients enabling them to access the site from their&#xD;
        mobile communication equipment such as mobile phones and tablets, and answer the&#xD;
        questionnaire.&#xD;

        Indications and contraindications according to the local market authorization should be&#xD;
        carefully considered. Evidence of assessment of all eligibility criteria by the patients,&#xD;
