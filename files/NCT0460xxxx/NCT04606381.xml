    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the drug. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy that&#xD;
             is metastatic or unresectable and which may derive benefit from epidermal growth&#xD;
             factor receptor (EGFR) or mesenchymal-epidermal transition tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             receptor/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMet) directed therapy. Eligible tumor&#xD;
             types include non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
             and neck (SCCHN), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), renal cell&#xD;
             cancer (RCC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), gastroesophageal cancer (GEC),&#xD;
             mesothelioma, breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). Participants must have&#xD;
             either progressed after prior standard of care therapy for metastatic disease, be&#xD;
             ineligible for, or have refused all other currently available therapeutic options. In&#xD;
             cases where participants refuse currently available therapeutic options, this must be&#xD;
             documented in the study records&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at Screening and a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 24 hours before the first dose of study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             a condom and his partner must also be practicing a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (that is, established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal&#xD;
             methods of contraception; placement of an Intrauterine device [IUD] or Intrauterine&#xD;
             system [IUS])&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has uncontrolled inter-current illness, including but not limited to&#xD;
             poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes, ongoing or active systemic infection (that&#xD;
             is, has discontinued all antibiotics for at least one week prior to first dose of&#xD;
             study drug), or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements, including ability to self-care for anticipated toxicities (that&#xD;
             is. rash or paronychia). Participants with medical conditions requiring chronic&#xD;
             continuous oxygen therapy are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had prior chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapy, or treatment with an&#xD;
             investigational anti-cancer agent within 2 weeks or 4 half-lives, whichever is longer,&#xD;
             before the first administration of study drug; or participant has received prior&#xD;
             immunotherapy within 6 weeks before the first administration of study drug. For agents&#xD;
             with long half-lives, the maximum required time since last dose is 4 weeks. Toxicities&#xD;
             from previous anticancer therapies should have resolved to baseline levels or to Grade&#xD;
             1 or less, (except for alopecia [any grade], Grade less than or equal to [&lt;=] 2&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy, and Grade less than [&lt;] 2 hypothyroidism stable on hormone&#xD;
             replacement). Autoimmune toxicities from previous immunotherapy must be fully resolved&#xD;
             to baseline levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with untreated brain metastases. Participants with locally treated&#xD;
             metastases that are clinically stable and asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks and who&#xD;
             are off or receiving low-dose corticosteroid treatment (&lt;=10 milligrams [mg]&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has an active malignancy other than the disease under study requiring&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
