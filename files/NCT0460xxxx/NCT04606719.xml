  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, it was believed that successful regeneration cannot be achieved once tooth has&#xD;
      become infected. However, recent studies suggest that regenerative endodontics may in fact be&#xD;
      possible in teeth with pulpal necrosis and periapical pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal in regenerative procedure is to eliminate clinical symptoms and resolve&#xD;
      apical periodontitis. The blood clot acts as a scaffold, and the growth factors inside&#xD;
      recruit stem cells, most likely from periapical papilla. But unfortunately, the erythrocytes&#xD;
      in the clot of the blood column undergo necrosis, affecting its properties so the blood&#xD;
      column is augmented by the use of different types of scaffolds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet-rich fibrin is classified into four types (Standard PRF, Injectable PRF, Advanced&#xD;
      PRF and Concentrated Growth Factor CGF) according to speed and time of centrifuge with the&#xD;
      overall aim to increase the number of platelets and leucocytes&#xD;

    <description>Standard Platelet-rich fibrin will be prepared by drawing 5 mL of venous blood from the patient in dried glass test tube and immediately centrifuging it at 3000 rpm for 10 min. After centrifugation, three layers will formed in the test tube-base layer of RBCs, top layer of a-cellular plasma, and a PRF clot in the middle. This clot will then pressed between two gauze pieces to form a membrane.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically free patients who accept to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18-35 years old with no sex predilection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with good oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with necrotic pulp in mandibular &amp; maxillary single rooted permanent teeth&#xD;
             with mature apex that Symptomatic or Asymptomatic , Doesn't respond positively with&#xD;
             the electric pulp tester ,Associated with or without swelling /sinus tract, Has&#xD;
             radiographic evidence of periapical radiolucency, Has a straight, non-curved root,&#xD;
             Teeth with normal occlusal contact with the opposing teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Illiterate patient because they can't estimate the pain level on the pain scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with systemic diseases or on systemic corticosteroids therapy because they&#xD;
             have impaired healing and higher incidence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women to avoid radiation exposure during the treatment which may be hazardous&#xD;
             to the fetus and breasts from dental X-ray examinations shields.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have allergy to ciprofloxacin or metronidazole to avoid any allergic&#xD;
             reaction after placement of bi-antibiotic paste as intra-canal medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients reporting bruxism or clenching because this induce more pressure on teeth and&#xD;
             may initiate the post-operative pain in the treated tooth which is already have&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Teeth that, Have vertical root fracture, coronal perforation, and calcification, Are&#xD;
             indicated for retreatment because they have lower success rate , Have pocket depth&#xD;
