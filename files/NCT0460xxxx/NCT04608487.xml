    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel&#xD;
      (axi-cel), an anti-CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in treating&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, systemic lymphoma with concurrent&#xD;
      CNS lymphoma, or systemic lymphoma with a history of treated CNS lymphoma, and to better&#xD;
      understand what causes neurological toxicity following treatment with axi-cel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drug(s) involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ludarabine will be given with axicel to help axicel work more effectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cyclophosphamide will be given with axicel to help axicel work more effectively&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. This study will&#xD;
      examine the safety and efficacy of axi-cel in participants who either currently or previously&#xD;
      had had central nervous system involvement of their lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drug involved in this study is axi-cel. Axi-cel is a chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that is manufactured using a person's own white blood cells. A&#xD;
      virus is used to introduce a gene that creates a protein (called a CAR) on the surface of T&#xD;
      cells, a type of blood cell that fights infection and can eliminate cancer cells. The CAR on&#xD;
      the T cells may bind to and kill cells that express CD19, a molecule that is found on B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. CAR-T cells (including axi-cel) designed to target CD19, a protein present on B&#xD;
      lymphocytes have been used to treat patients with CD19+ tumors. This adoptive cell therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) approach has shown significant and durable clinical benefits in the treatment of CD19+&#xD;
      tumors. Axi-cel has been FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory aggressive&#xD;
      B cell lymphomas that occur outside the central nervous system and have recurred after two or&#xD;
      more prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive two chemotherapy medicines, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. These&#xD;
      drugs are not intended as direct cancer treatment but instead to help axi-cel work with less&#xD;
      interference from immune system cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      leukapheresis, evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be divided into groups (cohorts) based on the type of disease&#xD;
      they have and treatment history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Participants with relapsed/refractory primary CNSL (PCNSL) and secondary CNSL&#xD;
           without evidence of lymphoma outside the central nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Participants with relapsed/refractory lymphoma outside the central nervous&#xD;
           system, with either active, or previously treated, involvement of the central nervous&#xD;
           system by the lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment once and will be followed for up to 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 18 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kite Pharma, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing&#xD;
      axi-cel.&#xD;
