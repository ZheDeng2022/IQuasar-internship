      Epidural anesthesia may represent a safe and effective pharmacological tool in the management&#xD;
      of Ogilvie's Syndrome. This pilot study aims to demonstrate feasibility, safety, and efficacy&#xD;
      of epidural anesthesia to set the stage for adequately powered future randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) in order to assess the efficacy of epidural anesthetic as a pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment strategy for Ogilvie's Syndrome. Ultimately, this research may prompt further&#xD;
      investigation and establish standardized criteria for managing Ogilvie's Syndrome patients&#xD;
      with epidural anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, treatment pathways for Ogilvie's Syndrome suggest observation and attempted&#xD;
      correction of the potential precipitating factors for 24 to 72 hours following radiologic&#xD;
      assessment if the cecum is less than 12cm and abdominal imaging does not demonstrate signs of&#xD;
      impending perforation. Should symptoms fail to resolve beyond 72 hours, and the cecum remain&#xD;
      under 12cm without worsening clinical status, pharmacologic intervention with neostigmine is&#xD;
      indicated. Symptoms resolve in 60% to 90% of patients following administration of single dose&#xD;
      of neostigmine, however continued monitoring is required as up to 40% of these patients can&#xD;
      experience recurrent colonic dilation. Additionally, neostigmine can be associated with&#xD;
      serious adverse events such as bradycardia and bronchospasm. Altogether, there may be&#xD;
      potential for further optimization of the pharmacologic management of Ogilvie's Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the predominant theory that Ogilvie's Syndrome is caused by sympathetic overdrive, the&#xD;
      splanchnic sympathetic blockade provided by epidural anesthesia could be of theoretical&#xD;
      benefit. In 1988, a small, prospective cohort study evaluated the use of epidural anesthesia&#xD;
      in eight patients with Ogilvie's Syndrome. Symptoms were controlled and cecal dilation&#xD;
      resolved without recurrence in 62.5% of these patients, and the authors concluded that with&#xD;
      further study, the use of epidural anesthesia could be a reasonable alternative to&#xD;
      neostigmine. Yet, no subsequent studies were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed single-arm, single-center prospective cohort pilot study will examine the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, and efficacy of epidural anesthesia in patients with Ogilvie's Syndrome&#xD;
      refractory to conservative management. Adult patients with a documented diagnosis of&#xD;
      Ogilvie's Syndrome admitted as an inpatient to St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton (SJHH) who&#xD;
      failed conservative management will be included. Following assessment of eligibility and the&#xD;
      informed consent process, patients will be evaluated by the acute pain service&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. A low-dose bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion will commence following insertion&#xD;
      of an epidural catheter at the T11-12 interspace, with a loading dose of 5-10mL followed by a&#xD;
      3mL per hour infusion. Monitoring for resolution of disease will take place iteratively by&#xD;
      the general surgery team, and failed symptom resolution will mandate further treatment in the&#xD;
      form of colonoscopic decompression or surgical intervention. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      throughout their index hospital and stay and up to 30 days following discharge from hospital.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed through recruitment rate and rate of successful epidural&#xD;
      placement. The rate of epidural anesthesia-related morbidity within 30 days of treatment will&#xD;
      serve as the primary safety measure. The primary efficacy measure is clinical and radiologic&#xD;
      resolution without recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>The patient will be positioned appropriately and the T11-12 (if not accessible we will accept 1-2 spaces above or below) interspace landmarked using established ultrasound guidance techniques. The patient's back will be prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. An epidural catheter will be inserted into the T11-12 interspace with a midline or paramedian approach using a 17G Tuohy needle. Plain preservative free bupivicaine 0.25% will be the local anesthetic used. After a 2-3 mL test dose to rule out intrathecal catheter positioning, a loading dose of 5-8 mL will be administered over 5-10 minutes to further rule out intravascular positioning of the catheter. Successful epidural placement will be defined by catheter insertion and confirmed by sensory blockade assessed by ice or pin prick testing. When correct positioning is confirmed, a continuous infusion of 3 mL per hour of bupivacaine 0.25% plain solution will begin.</description>
