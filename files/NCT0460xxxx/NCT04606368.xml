      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential use of monopolar&#xD;
      radiofrequency on lower face and submental area, followed by cryolipolysis on the submentum&#xD;
      and submandibular area for fat reduction and improvement of skin laxity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will study subjects who have mild to moderate skin laxity on lower jaw&#xD;
      and submentum areas. This will be measured by conducting a treatment using the Thermage FLX&#xD;
      system on the lower face and submentum area of the participants. Biopsies will be done on&#xD;
      several locations throughout the 12 week trial to assess skin laxity through laboratory&#xD;
      measures. Finally, the subject will be asked to complete questionnaires to provide&#xD;
      satisfaction and tolerability feedback.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of improvement of skin laxity with the use of monopolar radiofrequency (Thermage FLX, Solta Medical) on lower face and submentum areas. Safety is defined as incidence of device- and/or procedure-related adverse events. Qualitative measurement of efficacy by independent blinded evaluators grading randomized baseline and 3 months follow-up photographs using a 4-point skin laxity rating scale.</description>

    <description>Quantitative measurement of efficacy by standardized 2-D and 3-D images with volume difference in cc, height difference in mm, and surface area reduction measures calculations in cm2 using VECTRA H2 (Canfield Scientific, Inc), as well as, by histochemistry evaluation of punch biopsies performed at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-procedure.</description>

    <description>Subject satisfaction data will be collected at the 12-week final follow-up visit via a written questionnaire. A validated questionnaire using a likert rating scale will be utilized . Score values are 1 to 5, with high numbers meaning better outcomes.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Presence of mild to moderate skin laxity on lower face and submentum area, which in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion may benefit from monopolar radiofrequency to improve the&#xD;
             skin laxity for a youthful, rejuvenated appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI under 35.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has severe skin laxity in the area of intended treatment which in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, may result in an unacceptable aesthetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction, surgery, lipolytic agents,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into&#xD;

             month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any dermatological conditions, such as scars, infection, in the location of the&#xD;
             treatment area that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;

             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data&#xD;
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;
