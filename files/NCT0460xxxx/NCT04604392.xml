  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is a commonly used orthodontic treatment in patients with&#xD;
      maxillary constriction to provide skeletal expansion, correct posterior crossbite and resolve&#xD;
      naso-respiratory problems by reducing oral respiration.The aim of this randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial was to evaluate the effects of tooth-borne, tooth tissue-borne and bone-borne RME&#xD;
      appliances on sleep quality with polygraphy. The null hypothesis was that there is no&#xD;
      difference for the sleep quality between the appliances.&#xD;

      Introduction. The aim of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of tooth tissue-borne (KBME), tooth-borne (Hyrax), and bone-borne (MIDME) rapid&#xD;
      maxillary expansion (RME) appliances on sleep quality with polygraphy. Methods. This study&#xD;
      was designed in parallel with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. 46 patients with narrow maxilla&#xD;
      and OSAS were included in this study and randomly assigned to three groups: tooth&#xD;
      tissue-borne, tooth-borne and boneborne expanders. Participants were congregated from the&#xD;
      Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey. In&#xD;
      all groups, the expansion appliance was activated one-quarter turn twice a day until the&#xD;
      desired suture opening was achieved. The primary outcome of this study was the correction of&#xD;
      posterior crossbite. Secondary outcomes included polygraphic assessment of sleep parameters.&#xD;
      Each subject participated in 1 overnight sleep test with polygraphy before the expansion (T0)&#xD;
      and after a 3- month retention phase of treatment (T1). According to the results of&#xD;
      polygraphy, 7 parameters; (apnea hypopnea index (AHI), number of apnea and hypopnea,&#xD;
      desaturation index, lowest desaturation, average saturation, supin AHI) were examined to&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in sleep scores. Kruskal-Wallis analysis and Dunn-Bonferroni test were&#xD;
      used for inter-group comparisons and Wilcoxon analysis was used for intra-group evalaution.&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically significant. Computer-generated randomization was used with&#xD;
      group allocation concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor was blinded&#xD;
      to group assignment. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not feasible to blind&#xD;
      either operator or patients.&#xD;

    <description>The patients were treated with KBME, Hyrax and MIDME maxillary expansion appliances, respectively. All expansion appliances containing a Hyrax expansion screw positioned parallel to the second premolars and were used to correct the posterior crossbite. In the MIDME group, two mini-screws with a diameter of 1.6 mm and a length of 10 mm are located on the right and left sides between the roots of the 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth with 60-70° angle. KBME and Hyrax expansion appliances were cemented with glass ionomer cement and MIDME was cemented with using the light-cured composite. Same protocol was applied to all patients during RME treatment. Expansion screws in all groups were activated by two turns a day.</description>
