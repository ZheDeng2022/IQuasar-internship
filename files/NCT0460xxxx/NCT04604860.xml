  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant-eligible patients with cirrhosis and ESLD, age 40-70, MELD &gt;/= 10 referred to&#xD;
      transplant physical therapy will be invited to participate. The investigators will exclude&#xD;
      those who lack a smartphone or the understanding of its functionality, lack home wireless&#xD;
      internet, or have recurrent/persistent overt hepatic encephalopathy. Following signing of&#xD;
      informed consent, each participant will be given a Fitbit Charge 3 and have EL-FIT and Fitbit&#xD;
      apps downloaded to their smartphone. After a brief session with a member of the research team&#xD;
      explaining the basic components and functionality of EL-FIT and Fitbit, patients will be&#xD;
      provided with general physical activity recommendations (as per our current standard of care)&#xD;
      and asked to explore all features of EL-FIT and Fitbit apps, up until their 12-week follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Phone calls to incentivize physical activity and exercise will be performed by members&#xD;
      of the research team.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two visits, baseline and 12-week follow-up, with at least one follow-up&#xD;
      phone call on a weekly basis. Visit one is expected to last for 30 minutes and visit 2 for 60&#xD;
      minutes, whereas each phone call should take no more than 15 minutes. Twice during the study&#xD;
      period, the investigators will draw serum and plasma samples for future translational&#xD;
      research. Daily, the physical trainer will review collected data on EL-FIT research database&#xD;
      and Fitabase. Each participant will have an exit interview by the end of week 12 with the&#xD;
      trainer and a member of the research team to talk about their impressions of using EL-FIT and&#xD;
      Fitbit, through a structured questionnaire assessing about how user friendly it was to use&#xD;
      the EL-FIT app. Finally, trainers will be asked to compare the type of prescription that they&#xD;
      provided to patients as part of the standard of care (based on liver frailty index or&#xD;
      6-minute walk test), to compare it with the allocation provided by EL-FIT stratification&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how to improve EL-FIT the investigators will ask patients and their caregivers&#xD;
      open-ended questions as part of their exit interview. This will allow us to identify barriers&#xD;
      precluding them from keeping up with physical trainer recommendations, and what would they&#xD;
      like to include to enhance motivation as part of a physical activity program. A member of the&#xD;
      research team will act as a facilitator during this session.&#xD;
