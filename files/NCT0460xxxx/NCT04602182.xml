      1. OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           General objective: Assess the effects of a music therapy intervention during the weaning&#xD;
           from the mechanical ventilation in a group of patients, and compare it to the usual&#xD;
           clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific objectives: Main objective: assess the effect of a music therapy intervention&#xD;
           on the length of the weaning in a group of critical patients, and compare it to a group&#xD;
           of critical patients who receive the usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the levels of sedo-analgesia required in critical patients receiving the&#xD;
                music therapy intervention during the process of weaning versus the levels of&#xD;
                sedo-analgesia required by the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the Anxiety-agitation level in critical patients receiving the music&#xD;
                therapy intervention during the process of weaning, versus the anxiety-agitation&#xD;
                leved felt by the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the level of pain in critical patients receiving the music therapy&#xD;
                intervention during the weaning versus the level of the pain felt by the control&#xD;
                group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the level of delirium in critical patients receiving music therapy during&#xD;
                the weaning versus the level of delirium of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare heart and breath frequency, blood pressure and oxygen saturation in&#xD;
                critical patients receiving music therapy during the mechanical ventilation&#xD;
                extubation (weaning) process, versus the index of control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the stress perceived in critical patients receiving music therapy&#xD;
                intervention during the mechanical extubation process, versus the level of the&#xD;
                control group, which receives the usual medical care (without intervention with&#xD;
                music therapy), 90 days after Inico of the process, Perceived the Stress Scale&#xD;
                (PSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe and analyze the experience by the patient of the intervention with music&#xD;
                therapy the weaning process and the coping strategies possible for&#xD;
                musicotherapeutic intervention, using a Semi-instructed interview that takes place&#xD;
                at 90 days beginning the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DESIGN: single blind clinical trial in parallel groups, single blind clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. POPULATION of this study are patients who initiate weaning for ventilation mechanics.&#xD;

      mecanichal ventilation.&#xD;

    <description>RASS scoring and interpretation should be based on the sedation protocol being used. For minimal sedation protocols (RASS -2 to 0), sedation should be modified or decreased for a RASS score of -3 or less.[3] Scores of 2 to 4 may indicate under-sedation. At minimum, the patient should be assessed for pain, delirium, and anxiety. In addition, other underlying causes of agitation should be investigated and treated as appropriate.&#xD;
In select cases, a deep sedation protocol (RASS -4 and -5) may be used.[3] For scores of -3 or higher, sedation should be modified to achieve the desired range</description>
