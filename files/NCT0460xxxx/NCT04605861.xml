      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect and safety of Liraglutide Injection on body weight loss compared with placebo in obese&#xD;
      or overweight adult patients with comorbidity of metabolic disorders.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
      The total study duration is 34~36 weeks, including 2-week screening period, 6~8-week dosage&#xD;
      titration, 24-week stable treatment and 2-week safety follow-up period. Subjects with obesity&#xD;
      or overweight with comorbidity of metabolic disorders receive subcutaneous injection of 3.0&#xD;
      mg Liraglutide or placebo every day. The primary endpoint is the change of body weight or the&#xD;
      percentage of body weight loss greater than 5%. The changes of body weight between&#xD;
      Liraglutide Injection group and placebo group will be compared. In the course of the trial,&#xD;
      the subjects are weighted on fasting state. Blood samples are collected according to the&#xD;
      protocol. All subjects receive lifestyle intervention, including a reductiong of calorie&#xD;
      intake by 500 kcal a day and physical exercise.&#xD;
