      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody injection&#xD;
      (ZKAB001) combined with Albumin-bound paclitaxel in the treatment of Advanced urothelial&#xD;

      This trial is designed to first include 6 subjects to confirm the dose safety. If the&#xD;
      toxicity is intolerable, the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs will be reduced depending on the&#xD;
      toxicity for further exploration.If it was tolerated, the recommended dose was determined,&#xD;
      and the dose was extended. 14 patients were enrolled to further observe the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
