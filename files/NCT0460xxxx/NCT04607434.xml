      Literature basis Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by respiratory&#xD;
      distress and progressive hypoxemia. Although the diagnosis, treatment and pathogenesis of&#xD;
      ARDS have made some progress, due to its numerous pathogenic factors and complex&#xD;
      pathogenesis, the traditional clinical practice still lacks effective treatment measures and&#xD;
      effective drug treatment. In the past two decades, the clinical and biological heterogeneity&#xD;
      of the syndrome has been gradually recognized. Through the secondary processing of the&#xD;
      large-scale clinical trial data of ARDS, it is found that two types of models (i.e., two&#xD;
      subtypes) are most suitable for the classification of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Neutrophils are reported to&#xD;
      be the main driver of this inflammatory state. At the same time, neutrophils in blood and&#xD;
      alveoli of ARDS patients were significantly different from that of healthy controls, and&#xD;
      neutrophil apoptosis was significantly delayed. In the past, neutrophils were considered as&#xD;
      functional cells, but recent studies have shown that there are different types of neutrophils&#xD;
      in the inflammatory response: neutrophils with traditional lobulated nuclei, neutrophils with&#xD;
      banded nuclei and cd62ldim neutrophils with a large number of T cell suppressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous studies, we have successfully obtained a new amino acid derivative of&#xD;
      ocotillol type-ginsenoside, which may have pharmacological activities of ocotillol type&#xD;
      ginsenoside and glycine, and have potential effects on improving the delay of neutrophil&#xD;
      apoptosis in ARDS, and have potential new drug development potential for the treatment of&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental steps are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, peripheral blood was collected from healthy adults and patients with ARDS as&#xD;
      inflammatory markers; then neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy adults&#xD;
      and patients with ARDS, and the proportion of neutrophil subtypes and the degree of&#xD;
      neutrophil apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Different doses of ginsenoside glycine&#xD;
      derivatives were used to culture neutrophils from patients with ARDS for 20 hours, and the&#xD;
      apoptosis rate was 28 hours. Finally, the mechanism of neutrophil apoptosis was explored&#xD;

      1. Literature basis Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more serious form, acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), is a clinical syndrome characterized by respiratory distress and&#xD;
      progressive hypoxemia. It is caused by a variety of extrapulmonary and extrapulmonary factors&#xD;
      other than cardiogenic, resulting in pulmonary capillary barrier damage, pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammatory cell infiltration, diffuse alveolar and interstitial edema. Although some&#xD;
      progress has been made in the diagnosis, treatment and pathogenesis of ARDS, due to its&#xD;
      numerous pathogenic factors and complex pathogenesis, there is still a lack of effective&#xD;
      treatment measures and effective drug treatment in traditional clinical practice. The&#xD;
      mortality rate of ALI / ARDS is still as high as 40%, which seriously affects the prognosis&#xD;
      of critically ill patients. In the past two decades, the clinical and biological&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the syndrome has been gradually recognized. Through the secondary processing&#xD;
      of the previous large-scale clinical trial data of ARDS, it is found that the two types (i.e.&#xD;
      two sub phenotype) models are the best for the classification of ARDS. These two phenotypes&#xD;
      have different natural history, clinical characteristics, biomarkers and clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of ARDS includes a variety of epithelial cells, macrophages and so on.&#xD;
      However, neutrophils have been reported to be the core driver of this inflammatory state. At&#xD;
      the same time, neutrophils in blood and alveoli of ARDS patients were significantly different&#xD;
      from that of healthy controls, and neutrophil apoptosis was significantly delayed.&#xD;
      Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of neutrophils involved in apoptosis in ARDS&#xD;
      patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls. Therefore, it is of great&#xD;
      significance to study the mechanism of neutrophil apoptosis delay in patients with ARDS /&#xD;
      Ali, and to seek effective treatment methods to improve neutrophil apoptosis delay. In the&#xD;
      past, neutrophils have been considered as functional cells in the end-stage, but recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that there are different types of neutrophils in inflammation: neutrophils&#xD;
      with traditional lobulated nuclei, neutrophils with banded nuclei, and CD62Ldim neutrophils&#xD;
      with a large number of nuclear lobes that inhibit T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous studies, we have successfully obtained a new amino acid derivative of&#xD;
      ocotillol type-ginsenoside, which may have pharmacological activities of ocotillol type&#xD;
      ginsenoside and glycine, and have potential effects on improving the delay of neutrophil&#xD;
      apoptosis in ARDS, and have potential new drug development potential for the treatment of&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The experimental steps are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy adults and patients with ARDS for&#xD;
           inflammatory markers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy adults and patients with&#xD;
           ARDS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of neutrophil subtypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The apoptosis of neutrophils in peripheral blood was detected by flow cytometry after&#xD;
           the neutrophils were cultured in vitro for 20 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with ARDS were incubated with different&#xD;
           doses of ginsenoside glycine derivatives (20,50,100 UM) for 20 h, and the apoptosis rate&#xD;
           was 28 H.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bax, Mcl-1 and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by Western blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. High throughput PCR and mapp-4 were used to detect the expression of apoptosis related&#xD;
           genes in akg38k pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Metabonomics analysis: peripheral blood of ARDS patients was collected for metabonomics&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic criteria: the diagnostic criteria of ARDS refer to Berlin standard in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusive criteria: (1) 70 ≥ age ≥ 18 years old; (2) diagnosis of acute lung injury&#xD;
           within 48 hours (Berlin diagnostic criteria for acute lung injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria: (1) age &gt; 70 years old or age &lt; 18 years old; (2) discharge or death&#xD;
           within 48 hours after admission; (3) pregnancy or puerperium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Test procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Methods: the ICU patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent process: sign informed consent after communicating with patients or&#xD;
           legal representatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. The beginning and end of the experiment The informed consent was signed from January 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Data security and monitoring plan The patient's medical records (study medical records /&#xD;
      CRF, test forms, etc.) will be kept completely in the hospital. The doctor will record the&#xD;
      results of laboratory tests and other examinations in his medical record. The researchers,&#xD;
      the ethics committee and the drug administration will be allowed access to his medical&#xD;
      records. No public report on the results of the study will reveal the individual identity of&#xD;
      the patient. We will make every effort to protect patient information to the extent permitted&#xD;
      by law. According to medical research ethics, except for personal privacy information,&#xD;
      experimental data will be available for public inquiry and sharing, and the query and sharing&#xD;
      will be limited to the electronic database based on the network to ensure that no personal&#xD;
      privacy information will be disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Abide by ethical principles and relevant laws and regulations Whether or not to&#xD;
      participate in the study depends entirely on the wishes of patients and their legal&#xD;
      representatives. Patients and their families may refuse to participate in the study or&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the study. This will not affect the&#xD;
      relationship between the patient and his doctor, nor will it affect the loss of medical or&#xD;
      other benefits for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Statistical analysis plan SPSS15.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The&#xD;
      measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, t test or nonparametric test&#xD;
      was used for comparison between groups, chi square test was used for counting data, and&#xD;
      linear correlation analysis was used for the relationship between variables, P &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
