  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the short- and long-term effects of two weeks of&#xD;
      intensive speech-language pathology intervention with additional physiotherapy, on aphasia&#xD;
      and apraxia of speech (AOS) and their neural correlates in thirty persons with chronic&#xD;
      stroke. Changes are studied following intensive treatment of aphasia and AOS with&#xD;
      standardised speech-language testing and testing of communication and with voxel-based&#xD;
      morphometry (VBM) analysis and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC).&#xD;

      This study explores structural and functional brain changes in relation to effects on speech,&#xD;
      language, communication and quality of life following an intensive speech-language program&#xD;
      with additional physiotherapy for persons with chronic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech. The&#xD;
      participants are consecutively recruited from a rehabilitation centre providing intensive&#xD;
      treatment for chronic conditions following stroke or other neurological injuries. The&#xD;
      speech-language pathologists (SLPs) involved in the rehabilitation programs perform the&#xD;
      testing directly before and after intensive intervention with an additional follow up after&#xD;
      16 weeks (+-2) with testing of speech-language, communication and quality of life. The SLPs&#xD;
      have more than five years of experience of working with aphasia and are specialised in&#xD;
      working with intensive treatment, they have acquired in-depth knowledge on how to evaluate&#xD;
      and treat aphasia and apraxia of speech in lectures and workshops. The test procedure is&#xD;
      recorded with camcorder and voice recorder to provide the opportunity to access data&#xD;
      retrospectively and to minimize bias by including an external SLP who makes a second blinded&#xD;
      evaluation on randomized participants' performance in ASRS, BNT and CAT by studying the video&#xD;
      and voice material. Structural and functional neuroplasticity is also investigated with&#xD;
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in&#xD;
      domain-specific (language processing) and domain-general (executive and attention&#xD;
      processing). This intensive neuro-rehabilitation program for speech and language deficits&#xD;
      named Multimodal Intensive Rehabilitation for Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech (MIRAA) is&#xD;
      defined as an ICAP (Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Program) with focus on both speech and&#xD;
      language function and communicative activity and participation. The program is intensive:&#xD;
      consisting of ten days of training (5 hours/day), with a minimum of three hours dedicated to&#xD;
      speech and language rehabilitation with additional physical therapy. The program includes&#xD;
      both individual treatment, group therapy and computer-based therapy. The therapy is&#xD;
      individually set up after the participant's goals together with the team including SLPs,&#xD;
      physiotherapists and a board-certified neurologist and/or specialist in rehabilitation&#xD;
      medicine. The goals are set by the participants, family members and clinicians the first day&#xD;
      of the program. The participant and their significant other are offered education with the&#xD;
      aim to enhance the knowledge on communication, the key concepts of neuroplasticity and other&#xD;
      functions and strategies important in everyday life. The treatment methods being used are&#xD;
      evidence-based and/or widely used multimodal programs covering the need for extensive&#xD;
      training programs targeting both impairment-based therapy and functional communication. The&#xD;
      specific questions are: Does ten days of with an intensive comprehensive aphasia/AOS program&#xD;
      result in any clinical significant improvements in speech and/or language function and other&#xD;
      cognitive skills for participants with chronic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech? Does the&#xD;
      intensive intervention have any effect on the quality of everyday life concerning speech and&#xD;
      language functions, activity and communicative participation for people with chronic aphasia&#xD;
      and apraxia of speech? Can functional and anatomical brain changes be detected following ten&#xD;
      days of intensive speech and language intervention for these participants?&#xD;
