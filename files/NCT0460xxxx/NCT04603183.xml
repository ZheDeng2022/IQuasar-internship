  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, 2 arm, open label, phase II study. It is designed to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant)&#xD;
      versus a short course with induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel followed by maintenance&#xD;
      therapy with abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant) in patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic HR positive/HER2 negative&#xD;
      breast cancer with aggressive disease criteria.&#xD;

             last dose and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: For limited-field radiotherapy, at least 7 days must have elapsed between the&#xD;
             last dose and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti cancer therapy to Grade ≤1 as&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: For patients who stopped receiving an investigational drug in another clinical&#xD;
             study, a washout period of 21 days or 5-half-lives (whichever is shorter) must be&#xD;
             observed before entering the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: Placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not&#xD;
             considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.&#xD;

             antibody [HBcAb] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA test) are eligible. Patients&#xD;
             positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is&#xD;
             negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Active bacterial or fungal infection at the time of enrolment (requiring antibiotics&#xD;
             or antifungal agents at time of initiating study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology,&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
