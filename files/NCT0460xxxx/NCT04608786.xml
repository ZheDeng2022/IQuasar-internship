  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label,single-arm, clinical study, aiming to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the&#xD;
      Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor ) combined with capecitabine as&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with biliary tract cancers after radical resection.After&#xD;
      completing 8 courses of combined treatment ,ZKAB001 was continued to be administered&#xD;
      separately once 3 weeks for a total of 16 cycles or 1 year.&#xD;

      This study includes two phases,the first phase is the dose exploration, 6 subjects were first&#xD;
      included at the initial dose to confirm the dose safety. If the toxicity is not tolerated,&#xD;
      the dose of the chemotherapeutic agent will be reduced depending on the toxicity(including&#xD;
      hematological toxicity and non-hematological toxicity) for further exploration. If it can be&#xD;
      tolerated, the recommended dose is determined and expanded on this dose. the second phase is&#xD;
      the dose expansion, 4 subjects will be enrolled to further observe the safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      The DLT(Dose limited toxicity) observation period is set as the first course of treatment(3&#xD;
      weeks). The end point is that the patient has been taking the drug for 16 cycles or 1 year,&#xD;
      or the patient dies or develops intolerable toxicity or confirmed disease recurrence or&#xD;
      distant metastasis or withdrawal of informed consent.&#xD;
