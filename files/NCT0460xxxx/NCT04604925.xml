      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic pilot test of a remote patient monitoring system&#xD;
      (RPM) for blood pressure measurement for Medicare patients with hypertension. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to better understand how patients' remote monitoring of blood pressure and the&#xD;
      direct transmission of this data to a healthcare system's EHR can be used by the patient and&#xD;
      the care team to support optimal hypertension care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study which we will conduct in two Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) primary care&#xD;
      practices will: evaluate the integration of Omron's remote monitoring system into&#xD;
      Northwestern Medicine's electronic health record (so that clinical data can flow directly&#xD;
      from the patient's monitor to the EHR), evaluate the use of billing work flows for covered&#xD;
      Medicare services, build and deploy clinical decision support to aid with patient&#xD;
      identification and ordering of the remote patient monitoring system, and evaluate the uptake&#xD;
      and clinical effects of this system in the pilot practices compared to matched patients&#xD;
      selected from non-pilot control practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study with&#xD;
      contemporaneous controls among NMG outpatient clinics that provide adult primary care. They&#xD;
      will make comparisons of data obtained through the course of routine care delivery from pilot&#xD;
      and non-pilot practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at Northwestern University will partner with Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Omron&quot;) to conduct a pragmatic pilot test of a remote patient&#xD;
      monitoring system (RPM) for blood pressure measurement for Medicare patients with&#xD;
      hypertension. The primary objective is to better understand how patients' remote monitoring&#xD;
      of blood pressure and the direct transmission of this data to a healthcare system's EHR can&#xD;
      be used by the patient and the care team to support optimal hypertension care. The procedures&#xD;
      that will be evaluated are routine healthcare services that are currently reimbursable by&#xD;
      Medicare. However, the optimal ways to: integrate these tools into primary care practice,&#xD;
      promote clinician and patient uptake, and put this information to use in the clinical&#xD;
      environment to best control hypertension are not fully understood. This pilot study which we&#xD;
      will conduct in two Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) primary care practices will: evaluate&#xD;
      the integration of Omron's remote monitoring system into Northwestern Medicine's electronic&#xD;
      health record (so that clinical data can flow directly from the patient's monitor to the&#xD;
      EHR), evaluate the use of billing work flows for covered Medicare services, build and deploy&#xD;
      clinical decision support to aid with patient identification and ordering of the remote&#xD;
      patient monitoring system, and evaluate the uptake and clinical effects of this system in the&#xD;
      pilot practices compared to matched patients selected from non-pilot control practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remote patient monitoring (RPM) system will be provided by Omron Healthcare to eligible&#xD;
      patients at no charge. This will include a Bluetooth enabled home blood pressure monitor, a&#xD;
      simplified smart phone connected to the Verizon network and, if requested, a Bluetooth&#xD;
      enabled scale. Patients who are agreeable to using this RPM system will have this service&#xD;
      ordered by their clinician will have this equipment mailed to their homes. Payments for&#xD;
      reimbursable remote monitoring services will be billed by Northwestern Medicine to Medicare&#xD;
      and supplemental insurance coverage in the fashion that is permitted under Medicare rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study with&#xD;
      contemporaneous controls among NMG outpatient clinics that provide adult primary care. We&#xD;
      will make comparisons of data obtained through the course of routine care delivery from pilot&#xD;
      and non-pilot practices.&#xD;

        This study will take place in several Northwestern Medicine Group outpatient primary care&#xD;
        clinic settings. Patients at these practices will be eligible for inclusion in the primary&#xD;
        study population if they have diagnosed hypertension, are 65 to 85 years old, have Medicare&#xD;
        insurance, and have their last two prior office blood pressures ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90&#xD;
        mm Hg diastolic. Patients at these practices will be eligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
        secondary study population if either they meet the inclusion criteria for the primary&#xD;
        population or they are 65 to 85 years old, have Medicare insurance and either have&#xD;
        diagnosed hypertension but do not have their last two office blood pressures prior ≥140 mm&#xD;
        Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic, or they do not have hypertension diagnosed and have&#xD;
        their most recent prior office blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic.&#xD;
