  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial (RCT) seeks to assess the mechanisms underlying Therapeutic&#xD;
      Horseback Riding's (THR) previously observed significant positive effects on ASD youth,&#xD;
      particularly those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and to refine information on the&#xD;
      durability, dose and sub-population effects of the intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial (RCT) will test the hypothesis that physiological response&#xD;
      patterns of salivary cortisol, cardiovascular, and electrodermal activity account for our&#xD;
      previously observed significant outcomes (i.e., reduced irritability and hyperactivity, and&#xD;
      improved social and communication), and additional outcomes (emotion regulation and caregiver&#xD;
      quality of life), in youth ages 6-16 yrs. with ASD and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses&#xD;
      randomized to a 10-week manualized THR intervention compared to a no-horse Barn Activity (BA)&#xD;
      control (Aim 1). We will evaluate the durability of Aim 1 outcomes in the THR group compared&#xD;
      to the BA control group six-months after the intervention period (Aim 2). Finally, we will&#xD;
      explore dose and sub-population effects of THR and BA interventions by comparing effect size&#xD;
      differences in THR and BA groups to (a) a 10-week wait-list control group; (b) a Hybrid&#xD;
      intervention group (five weeks BA followed by five weeks THR); and (c) a subsample of the THR&#xD;
      study population randomized following psychiatric hospitalization (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <description>This Arm is a 10 week one hour small group (2-4 participants) led by a THR instructor. The group will include a 45-minute mounted activity to learn horsemanship skills as outlined in the study's THR manual. Participants will have an assigned horse and volunteer(s) Group times will be between 1:00-5:00 PM to collect salivary cortisol. Weekly, participants will follow a consistent routine of wearing both their electro dermal activity and heart rate monitoring devices, sit at a group art table for five minutes, after this, study personnel will instruct participants to place the 10cm long foam swab rod under their tongue for two minutes while watching a 1-minute sand timer, then, participants will then don their riding helmets and enter the riding arena. Each week after conclusion of the THR intervention, participants will again sit with their group at an art table for 20 minutes followed by doing another saliva sample.</description>

    <description>This Arm is a 10 week one hour small group (2-4 participants) led by a THR instructor and co-led by a mental health counselor. Participants will have one assigned volunteer and will have no contact with horses at the riding center, just view horses at a distance. There will be a life-sized stuffed horse in for hands-on learning related to the weekly topic per the BA study manual. Group times will be between 1:00-5:00 PM to collect salivary cortisol. Weekly, participants will follow a consistent routine of wearing both their electro dermal activity and heart rate monitoring devices, sit at a group art table for five minutes, after this, study personnel will instruct participants to place the 10cm long foam swab rod under their tongue for two minutes while watching a 1-minute sand timer.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants who complete the Waitlist Arm and post assessments, will begin a Hybrid group that will consist of a 5- week one hour Barn Activity (BA) group condition that consists of a small group (2-4 participants) led by a THR instructor and co-led by a mental health counselor. Participants will have one assigned volunteer and will have no contact with horses at the riding center, just view horses at a distance. There will be a life-sized stuffed horse in for hands-on learning related to the weekly topic per the BA study manual. Group times will be between 1:00-5:00 PM. After the first 5 weeks of BA, participants will then complete 5-weeks of Therapeutic Horseback Riding small group (2-4 participants) led by a THR instructor. The group will include a 45-minute mounted activity to learn horsemanship skills as outlined in the study's THR manual. Participants will have an assigned horse and volunteer(s) Group times will be between 1:00-5:00 PM.</description>
