      Patients with chronic low back pain from Dr. Robert Edwards' study at the Brigham &amp; Women's&#xD;
      Pain Institute that examines sensory and pain perceptions in patients with chronic pain who&#xD;
      use opioids will complete quantitative sensory testing (QST) and current pain levels will be&#xD;
      obtained. Subsequently, 20-minutes of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) will be completed and&#xD;
      then QST testing will be completed again post-IVR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will partner with Dr. Robert Edwards at the Brigham &amp; Women's Pain Institute. Dr. Edward's&#xD;
      is an expert in testing central sensitization using quantitative sensory testing (QST).12 QST&#xD;
      involves cutaneous (skin) psychophysical (semi-subjective) testing to assess sensory and pain&#xD;
      perception pathways.13 QST identifies the intensity of stimuli (touch) is needed to feel&#xD;
      something (threshold of detection) and how perception of stimuli changes if it is repeated&#xD;
      many times (temporal summation).14 In people with central sensitization, even light intensity&#xD;
      of stimulation is perceived as pain and similar intensity stimuli becomes more painful with&#xD;
      multiple applications. We hypothesize that people with chronic pain will demonstrate&#xD;
      clinically important reductions in the threshold of detection and temporal summation after&#xD;
      IVR, which will demonstrate that IVR can affect central sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will complete two types of QST testing: Mechanical Pressure Pain Thresholds (MPPTh) to&#xD;
      test for threshold of detection, and Mechanical Temporal Summation of Pain (MTSP) to test for&#xD;
      temporal summation. In MPPTh we will measure the amount of pressure needed at the shoulder&#xD;
      and thumb (body sites that routinely do not have pain in people with low back pain) to elicit&#xD;
      a pain report from participants. In MTSP we will apply a train of 10 stimuli (light pinprick)&#xD;
      at the rate of 1 per second on the middle finger and have participants rate the painfulness&#xD;
      of the first, fifth, and tenth stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, we will recruit 20 patients with chronic low back pain from Dr. Edwards'&#xD;
      study examining sensory and pain perceptions in patients with chronic pain who use opioids.&#xD;
      We will complete QST testing and obtain current pain levels. We will complete 20-minutes of&#xD;
      IVR, and then complete QST testing again. We will compare pre-IVR MPPTh and MTSP with post&#xD;
      IVR levels. We anticipate short term, clinically important decreases in QST levels providing&#xD;
      initial confirmation that IVR can positively change central sensitization.&#xD;
