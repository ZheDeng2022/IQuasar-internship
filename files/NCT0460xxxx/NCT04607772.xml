  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, and safety of&#xD;
      various combinations with selinexor in participants with RR DLBCL. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two phases: Phase 1 and 2. The Phase 1 of the study will be a standard 3 + 3&#xD;
      dose escalation to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) for each treatment arm, and assess the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The Phase 2 of&#xD;
      the study will be a dose expansion study to assess the efficacy and safety of for RP2D&#xD;
      selected at the end of Phase 1 of the study for each treatment arm.&#xD;
