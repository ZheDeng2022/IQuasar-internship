  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Redo procedures after CLOSE-guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF) occur in 10% of patients. In case of pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection,&#xD;
      electrophysiologists may re-isolate the pulmonary veins with or without the ablation of other&#xD;
      commonly known PV-triggers. The superior vena cava (SVC) is one of the most common non&#xD;
      PV-triggers for atrial tachyarrhythmias. SVC electrical isolation can be reached by circular&#xD;
      radiofrequency-ablation under close monitoring of the phrenic nerve. However, it's added&#xD;
      value remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, mono-center study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the 1-year recurrence rate in paroxysmal AF patients with&#xD;
      reconnected pulmonary veins during a redo ablation with PV re-isolation or PV re-isolation&#xD;
      with SVC isolation.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>PVI</intervention_name>
    <description>PV re-isolation will be conducted according to the CLOSE-protocol. Point-by-point radiofrequency (RF) delivery will be performed aiming for a contiguous circle enclosing all PVs. RF will be delivered in a power-controlled mode (without ramping) using 35-40 Watt. The irrigation rate will be set at 30 ml/min. RF will be delivered until an ablation index (AI) of ≥400 is reached at the posterior wall and ≥550 at the anterior wall. In case of dislocation, a new RF application reaching the AI target will be applied. Maximal intertag distance between two neighboring lesions is 6 mm. In case of intra-esophageal temperature (T°) rise &gt;38.5°C during posterior LA wall ablation, RF delivery will stopped at an AI of 300. In the absence of first pass isolation, touch-up ablation was applied until PVI. In case of reconnection during the waiting time or during the adenosine test, the site of reconnection will be located and treated with touch-up ablation until adenosine proof PVI is reached.</description>

    <intervention_name>PVI + SVC</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in this group receive PVI according to the CLOSE protocol. In addition, they will receive an SVC isolation. The circular mapping catheter will be introduced in the superior vena cava to determine baseline electrical activity and to confirm definite entrance and exit block after ablation. Ablation will be performed proximally to the SVC/right atrial junction with the contact force-catheter using circular point-by-point radiofrequency delivery with a power setting of 35W, targeting an AI ≥400. High output (25 mA) pacing will be applied before each RF application to check for phrenic nerve stimulation. In areas of phrenic nerve capture ablation will be avoided even in case of incomplete isolation.</description>
