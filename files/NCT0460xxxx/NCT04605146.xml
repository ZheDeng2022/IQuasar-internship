  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination is now part of the standard of care for the&#xD;
      treatment of melanoma, renal and lung cancer patients. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occur&#xD;
      in 30 to 60% of patients included in clinical trials. Grade 3/4 AEs are more frequently&#xD;
      observed (50-60% of patients) in melanoma because ipilimumab is administrated at 3mg/kg in&#xD;
      this population. Among these AEs, early detection of immune related AEs is critical to an&#xD;
      adequate medical management. In this context, dedicated tools for remote monitoring of these&#xD;
      patients are crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed within the Immucare consortium a simplified medical questionnaire&#xD;
      which is addressed weekly to the patients. This questionnaire along with an algorithm gives&#xD;
      to the clinician regular feedback on their patients' general symptoms. The investigators&#xD;
      herein want to evaluate in a randomized prospective trial the efficacy of this remote&#xD;
      monitoring to reduce the time between the start of AE and the reporting to the medical team,&#xD;
      which could lead to detect and treat earlier AEs induced by nivolumab and ipilimumab in the&#xD;
      melanoma, lung and renal cancer patients' population.&#xD;

    <description>The tele-monitoring will consist in filling in a specific questionnaire once a week in the first 6 months, every 2 weeks until 12 months, and on-demand (in case of upcoming toxicity, at any time). These questionnaires will be reviewed by a coordinating nurse. According to the result of the questionnaire, the coordinating nurse will adapt patients' management, either by giving them a phone call, or inviting them to directly contact their medical department, or even plan an emergency hospitalization if necessary. The coordinating nurse will closely work with the investigator to adapt patients' management.&#xD;
Quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G) will also be filled in at inclusion, M3 and M12.</description>
