  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, is a major public health issue. Nowadays, very few&#xD;
      studies in France have evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, at the time of new treatments for HCV, it therefore seems essential to update the&#xD;
      available data by estimating the prevalence of chronic active hepatitis C in psychiatric&#xD;
      population. In addition to an update of epidemiological data, it is of high importance to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of the care pathway for patients in whom chronic active hepatitis C&#xD;
      is diagnosed, including the cascade of care, currently too inefficient despite treatments&#xD;
      that are themselves ultra-efficient. Indeed, it is essential that once hepatitis is detected,&#xD;
      it is formally diagnosed, then that the patient actually starts care and is adherent to&#xD;
      treatment (take his treatment according to the prescription and until the end: this implies&#xD;
      that the patient accepts his or her illness and understands the value of the prescribed&#xD;
      treatments), to hope to cure the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the SaPHIR study will allow to test a systematic screening of patients in an&#xD;
      adult psychiatric environment, through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The objective is to&#xD;
      promote the adherence of patients, and to assess possible obstacles in order to optimize the&#xD;
      screening (RDTs), diagnosis (confirmation of only positive RDTs by venous sampling) and care&#xD;
      management circuits in routine practice. In addition, the study envisages a combined&#xD;
      HCV-HBV-HIV screening, taking into account the cross-infection risk (same mode of&#xD;
      contamination, same risk population, frequent co-infections, more severe liver pathology in&#xD;
      case of co-infection, etc.), thus making it possible to take care of the patient as a whole.&#xD;
      The results of the SaPHIR study can ultimately be sent to the French health authorities to&#xD;
      improve screening and care circuits, and their coverage by social security.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Participation in the SaPHIR study will be offered to patients admitted to one of the&#xD;
      inpatient or outpatient adult psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study&#xD;
      (around Nantes), provided that the realization of the RDTs will be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cross-sectional assessment of prevalence : evaluation of the prevalence of HCV, HBV and&#xD;
           HIV viral infections All patients admitted to one of the inpatient or outpatient adult&#xD;
           psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study, whatever the psychiatric&#xD;
           diagnosis and without age limit, may be included in the study, provided that the&#xD;
           realization of the RDTs will be possible. Only patients who will accept the realization&#xD;
           of the HCV RDT will be included, in order to be able to respond to the primary objective&#xD;
           of the study. The agreement to realize the two other RDTs is optional. However, for&#xD;
           patients who already had a HCV serology performed less than 3 months before inclusion,&#xD;
           the HCV RDT will not be performed and the data collected for the study will be based on&#xD;
           the previous serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort follow-up of HCV positive patients : evaluation of care pathway and barriers to&#xD;
           care for hepatitis C Patients who are included in the cross-sectional assessment of&#xD;
           prevalence of the SaPHIR study and having a positive HCV RDT (or positive HCV serology&#xD;
           performed less than 3 months ago) will participate in the follow-up of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of prevalence HCV, HBV and HIV prevalence estimations. Sociodemographic and clinical data will be collected from the patient's medical record and through self-questionnaires completed by the patient. A systematic screening by 3 RDTs (HCV, HBV and HIV) will be proposed in the specific framework of the SaPHIR study.This is a screening performed on capillary blood (TOYO VHC ®, TOYO VHB ® and INSTI HIV 1 / HIV 2 ®), to obtain a result in less than 30 minutes.&#xD;
In case of confirmation of the diagnosis of viral hepatitis or HIV infection, the final result will be transmitted and explained to the patient by the referring doctor, who will organize the adapted care pathway and prescribe the DAA for the simple patients. The complex patients will be referred to the specialist to consider starting an appropriate treatment.&#xD;
