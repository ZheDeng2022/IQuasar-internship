      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Randomised Comparative Single Blinded Study was conducted at National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      Cairo University after approval by the institutional review board, scientific committee of&#xD;
      Anesthesia department Kasr Alainy Cairo University (02/10/2019 Code: N - 65\2019 ms) and&#xD;
      Ethical committee at Kasr Alainy Cairo University (1\ 12 \2019 code: MS-268-2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of consent of study participants: Written and verbal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of study: 60 Female patients ASA II, III scheduled for modified radical mastectomy&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned into two equal comparable groups using computer-&#xD;
      generated random numbers in opaque closed envelopes, each of which included 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done by a statistician and group of the patient was revealed only when the&#xD;
      included patient is transferred to the preanesthetic room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment; History, physical exam, laboratory and radiological investigations at&#xD;
      preoperative assessment clinic National Cancer Institute Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment at night of surgery. The patients were instructed how to report pain&#xD;
      by means of Numeric Pain Rating Scale, in which 0 = no pain and 10 =worst possible pain.&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative fasting; minimum of 6 hours for food and minimum of 2 hours for water and clear&#xD;
      fluids. 20G IV cannula was inserted. All patients premedicated with IV midazolam&#xD;
      0.01-0.02mg\kg 30 minutes preoperatively. Both blocks were done preoperative with the&#xD;
      patients at lateral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After allocation of the patient to a study group patients of group 1 received serratus&#xD;
      anterior plane block and patients of group 2 received erector spinae plane block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serratus Anterior Plane Block Technique;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block is performed with full aseptic precautions. Lateral Decubitus with arm abduction is&#xD;
      preferred. Ultrasound probe should be placed on the patient's midaxillary line in the&#xD;
      transverse plane, at the level of the fifth rib, with the indicator oriented toward the&#xD;
      operator's left. With the rib, pleural line, and overlying serratus anterior and latissimus&#xD;
      dorsi muscles visualized, the skin and subcutaneous tissue can be topicalized with 3 ml of&#xD;
      lidocaine 1%. Then, using ultrasound guidance, A 38-mm 22-gauge regional block needle is&#xD;
      advanced in-plane at an angle of approximately 45 degrees towards the fifth rib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct location of the needle tip in the fascial plane deep to serratus anterior muscle will&#xD;
      be confirmed by injecting 0.5-1 ml normal saline and seeing hydrodissection of fascial plane&#xD;
      between SAM and 5th rib. After aspiration to avoid intravascular injection 30 ml of&#xD;
      levobupivacaine 0.25% is injected anteriorly to the rib and deep to the serratus anterior&#xD;
      muscle. The entirety of the needle should be visualized at all times throughout the&#xD;
      procedure, and care should be taken to avoid any vessels while traversing the soft&#xD;
      tissue.6-13-MHz, linear transducer set for small parts and a depth of 1-4 cm was used for&#xD;
      this block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae plane block Technique; The block is performed with full aseptic precautions.&#xD;
      Block level at T5. Ultrasound probe placed on the back in a transverse orientation to&#xD;
      identify the tip of the T5 transverse process; these are recognizable as flat, squared-off&#xD;
      acoustic shadows with only a very faint image of the pleura visible. If the transducer is too&#xD;
      lateral, the ribs will be visualized instead; these are recognizable as rounded acoustic&#xD;
      shadows with an intervening hyperechoic pleural line. The tip of the transverse process&#xD;
      centered on the ultrasound screen and the probe will then be rotated into a longitudinal&#xD;
      orientation to produce a parasagittal view, in which the following layers will be visible&#xD;
      superficial to the acoustic shadows of the transverse processes: skin and subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue, trapezius, erector spinae muscle and T5 transverse process. A skin wheal using 3ml of&#xD;
      1% lidocaine is made , then echogenic block needle will be inserted in- plane to the&#xD;
      ultrasound beam in a cranial-to-caudal direction until contact is made with the T5 transverse&#xD;
      process. Correct location of the needle tip in the fascial plane deep to erector spinae&#xD;
      muscle will be confirmed by injecting 0.5-1 ml normal saline and seeing the fluid lifting the&#xD;
      erector spinae muscle off the transverse process without distending the muscle. After&#xD;
      aspiration to avoid intravascular injection 30 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% was injected and&#xD;
      separation was seen. 6-13-MHz, linear transducer set for small parts and a depth of 4-6 cm&#xD;
      was used (59-62).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both blocks Fujifilm Sonosite M-Turbo Ultrasound system was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing blocks lung ultrasound was performed to exclude pneumothorax, chest was&#xD;
      divided to 6 quadrants with the patient semi sitting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior upper and lower quadrants Lateral upper and lower quadrants Posterior upper and&#xD;
      lower quadrants All quadrants scanned especially upper quadrants was scanned looking for&#xD;
      signs of pneumothorax such as absence of lung sliding, presence of B lines, barcode or&#xD;
      stratosphere sign and lung-point sign. 6-13-MHz, linear transducer set for small parts and a&#xD;
      depth of 4-6 cm was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung us was done after performing block and post operative at PACU&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) where the Numeric Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale score, MAP and heart rate were noted immediately on arrival, where they will be&#xD;
      observed for 2 hours then discharged to the ward. Lung ultrasound was done once again at PACU&#xD;
      looking for signs of pneumothorax. Rescue analgesia was provided in the form of IV morphine 3&#xD;
      mg boluses when the patient indicates Numeric Pain Rating Scale score ≥ 4. The total amount&#xD;
      of morphine given in 24 hours was recorded for the two groups. A maximum dose of 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg/24hours of morphine was allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that Modified Radical Mastectomy is performed under GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients were transferred to their respective ward, Multimodal analgesia was&#xD;
      provided as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV paracetamol 500 mg \6 hours IV ketorolac 30mg\8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan was to study continuous response variable (post operative morphine&#xD;
      consumption in the1 st 24 hours) from independent control and experimental with 1 control per&#xD;
      1 experimental subject. The experimental group is Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) versus&#xD;
      control group Serratus Anterior Plane Block (SAP). In a previous randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      by Gupta et al (2017), comparing Analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided paravertebral block&#xD;
      with serratus anterior plane block for modified radical mastectomy mean postoperative&#xD;
      morphine consumptions in (SAP) group was found to be 9.2 ± 2.1 mg. In another study by Singh&#xD;
      et al (2019), which compares analgesic efficacy of Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) with&#xD;
      opioid based anaesthesia mean postoperative morphine consumptions in (ESPB) was 1.9 ± 2.01&#xD;
      mg. If the true difference in the control and experimental means is7.8, A sample size of 14&#xD;
      experimental subjects and 14 control subjects was needed to be able to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that the experimental and control groups are equal with probability(power) of 0.9.&#xD;
      Type 1 error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.01. To ensure&#xD;
      normal distribution of response variables 30 patients per group were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS version 23.0 was used in data analysis. Mean and standard deviation described&#xD;
      quantitative data with median and range when appropriate. Quantitative variables were tested&#xD;
      for normality to select appropriate statistical tests. Comparison of means (or medians) of&#xD;
      two independent groups was done using t test (parametric or non- parametric). To show the&#xD;
      effect of time on vitals, parametric repeated measures ANOVA (or non-parametric Friedman&#xD;
      tests) were used to show changes overtime both intra and post-operative. Post-hoc test were&#xD;
      used for pairwise comparisons and were Bonferroni adjusted. Chi-square and Fisher Exact were&#xD;
      used for testing proportion independence. P value was always two tailed and set significant&#xD;
      at 0.05 level.&#xD;
