  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a CNN-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for polyp characterization has been&#xD;
      developed by Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan. It works in conjunction with BLI system. In the&#xD;
      present study we prospectively evaluate whether the evaluation of the endoscopist combined&#xD;
      with the CAD system output achieve &gt; 90% accuracy in characterization (i.e. as adenomas or&#xD;
      non-adenomas) of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps having histopathology as reference standard.&#xD;
      Consecutive adult outpatients undergoing elective colonoscopy, in which at least one&#xD;
      diminutive (&lt;5 mm) rectosigmoid polyp is detected are included. During endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      all polyps identified by the endoscopist are documented for size, location and morphology.&#xD;
      All diminutive polyps are characterized by a three sequential steps process: I) endoscopist&#xD;
      prediction: the endoscopist evaluates the polyp by using BLI through the BASIC&#xD;
      classification; the confidence level (high vs. low) in histology prediction is recorded; II)&#xD;
      AI prediction: the AI system is switched on and the output of the automatic evaluation is&#xD;
      recorded; this outcome is rated as stable or unstable, depending of the consistency over time&#xD;
      of the outcome; III) combined prediction: a final classification is provided by endoscopist&#xD;
      in light of the results of the first and of the second step; the confidence level is&#xD;
      recorded. All polyps are resected and retrieved in separate jars and sent for pathology&#xD;
      assessment. Only polyps characterized with high confidence will be included in the per-polyp&#xD;
      analysis; the high-confidence characterization rate will be also calculated; the rate of&#xD;
      polyps characterized with a CAD stable outcome will be calculated. Operative characteristics&#xD;
      (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy) in&#xD;
      distinguishing adenomatous from non-adenomatous polyps, evaluated with high confidence, will&#xD;
      be calculated for each diminutive polyp and for each diminutive rectosigmoid polyp, having&#xD;
      histopathology report as reference standard. The post-polypectomy surveillance intervals will&#xD;
      be calculated on the basis of polyp histology (reference standard) in all patients according&#xD;
      to both USMSTF and ESGE guidelines.&#xD;
