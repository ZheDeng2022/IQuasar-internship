    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a longitudinal clinical trial to study the association of&#xD;
      preparation design on the internal and marginal adaptation of the resulting restorations and&#xD;
      the long-term clinical performance of chairside CAD/CAM endocrown restorations. Advanced&#xD;
      lithium disilicate chairside CAD/CAM endocrowns (CEREC Tessera/Dentsply Sirona) will be&#xD;
      adhesively bonded using a selective enamel etch technique with a universal adhesive (Prime&#xD;
      and Bond Elect/Dentsply Sirona) and a dual cure resin adhesive cement (Calibra Ceram/Dentsply&#xD;
      Sirona). All restorations will be followed over five years of clinical service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endodontically treated teeth commonly present with extensive tooth structure loss due to&#xD;
      caries, trauma, prior restorative treatment, and the endodontic access. These structural&#xD;
      deficiencies lead to an increase in cusp deflection, crown fractures, microleakage, and&#xD;
      decreased sensory feedback during function which greatly increases the possibility of tooth&#xD;
      fracture.As a result, endodontically treated teeth require a full cuspal coverage restoration&#xD;
      to prevent microleakage, restore function, and provide cuspal protection against tooth&#xD;
      fracture. The most common restoration for endodontically treated teeth is core build-up, with&#xD;
      or without a post, and full coverage crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process requires multiple appointments with many technical steps ultimately leading to&#xD;
      more chair time, treatment cost, and potential iatrogenic damage to the tooth. An alternative&#xD;
      treatment is the endocrown, which utilizes the internal walls of the pulp chamber for&#xD;
      macroretention and incorporates the core and crown in a monolithic restoration. The&#xD;
      restoration is fabricated utilizing chairside CAD/CAM technology and is adhesively bonded to&#xD;
      the tooth with resin cement. The EndoCrown restoration is more conservative relative to tooth&#xD;
      structure loss, less expensive, and requires less chair time to complete when compared to&#xD;
      conventional treatment while having comparable clinical longevity in molar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be a longitudinal clinical trial to study the association of&#xD;
      preparation design on the internal and marginal adaptation of the resulting restorations and&#xD;
      the long-term clinical performance of chairside CAD/CAM endocrown restorations. Advanced&#xD;
      lithium disilicate chairside CAD/CAM endocrowns (CEREC Tessera/Dentsply Sirona) will be&#xD;
      adhesively bonded using a selective enamel etch technique with a universal adhesive (Prime&#xD;
      and Bond Elect/Dentsply Sirona) and a dual cure resin adhesive cement (Calibra Ceram/Dentsply&#xD;
      Sirona). All restorations will be followed over five years of clinical service.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Restoration failure</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Restoration failure is scored by visual loss of the crown from the tooth requiring replacement of the study crown with a new crown at any time between delivery and five years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Restoration loss of retention</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of retention is measured as visual detachment or dislodgment of the crown from the tooth without fracture of the crown requiring recementation of the crown.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Margin staining</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Margin staining is categorized based on modified US Public Health Service criteria using a four point scale where 1 is no staining and 4 is penetrating stain involving more than 50% of the margin.</description>
