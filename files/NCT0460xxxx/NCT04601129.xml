  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shorten the time spent in the hospital (hospitalization duration) by optimizing the pre, per&#xD;
      and postoperative care is of major medical and economic importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive surgery allows a faster recovery than open surgery. However, we need to&#xD;
      ensure an early and secure return to normality in order to discharge patients safely from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and biological parameters need to be controlled post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work is going to evaluate the efficacity of a fast - recovery program with incoming&#xD;
      patients receiving minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic) of partial and total&#xD;
      nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a medical and surgical fast-recovery program could&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower the average duration of stay in hospital (at least by 1 day) with no increase of&#xD;
           morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insure the absence of complications after 6 months home&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study of a fast recovery program evaluating the impact on the hospitalization&#xD;
      length and the incidence of re-hospitalization for complications for 60 patients undergoing a&#xD;
      minimally invasive nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will beneficiate of an extra preoperative information about the enhanced recovery&#xD;
      after surgery program, they will benefit from a strategie of low morphine consumption during&#xD;
      the per end post operative phase, they should need no bladder or abdominal drainage, they're&#xD;
      encourage to eat and drink a few hours after surgery, the intravenous fluid is interrupted as&#xD;
      early as possible, and the patients are encourage to sit, stand up and get dressed as soon as&#xD;
      they are capable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A form completed by the patient registers their every day capabilities to eat, drink, move,&#xD;
      and their limitations due to pain, dizziness, and nausea. Their bowel and urine transit are&#xD;
      also registered. This form is complete until discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their laboratory test is monitored to identify kidney insufficiency or anemia and compared&#xD;
      with the preoperative laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital discharge is allowed after medical and surgical criteria are met in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surgical evaluation is planned a week, one month, and 6 months after surgery with&#xD;
      laboratory exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month after the discharge, a satisfaction questionnaire is filled up by the patient,&#xD;
      answered by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6 months post operative consultation, a questionnaire about chronic pain is submitted.&#xD;
      If the patient is eligible, a chronic pain consultation is further organized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result will be compared to those of a retrospective cohort (+/- 60 patients) with no&#xD;
      enhanced recovery after surgery program.&#xD;
