  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag to treat&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia（CIT）. These subjects have been treated with recombinant&#xD;
      human thrombopoietin（rhTPO） or interleukin 11（IL-11） before, the platelets can rise to normal&#xD;
      or reach the effective standard, but after the re-application, the effective standard is not&#xD;
      reached, or the effective standard is still not reached after the rhTPO 300U/kg/d treatment&#xD;
      for 14 days. The investigator will assess the changes of the platelet counts after the&#xD;
      treatment of eltrombopag from week 1 to week 24, and observe incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      during the treatment of eltrombopag.The investigator will complete the 4 weeks safety&#xD;
      visits（once a week），if the subjects end or withdraw from the clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will initiate treatment with 75 mg eltrombopag. Platelet counts is obtained weekly and dose adjustment should be done according to platelet counts, and maximum dose should not exceed 75 mg daily. Subjects whose platelet count ≤100×109/L，the eltrombopag dose will maintain. If platelet count &gt;100×109/L for 2 weeks, the subjects need to reduce the dose of eltrombopag to the next lower dose or lower frequency. If subjects whose platelet count exceeds 100×109/L for 4 weeks，already have reduced the dose of eltrombopag to 25mg once every other day during the treatment period, eltrombopag can be stopped for observation, until platelet counts fall below 100×109/L.</description>
