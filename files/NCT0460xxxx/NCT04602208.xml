    <description>The study primary outcome was retreatment-free survival (RFS) defined as any additional further treatment: local (FT/PGA for in-field or out-of-field recurrences or radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy or whole gland HIFU) or systemic salvage treatment, a positive biopsy revealing PCa with an ISUP grade≥ 2 in nontreated patients, PCa metastasis or PCa specific death.</description>

    <description>Between November 2009 and December 2016, at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France), 146 consecutive patients were treated with focal HIFU for primary localized prostate cancer. Focal therapy was offered for low or intermediate risk disease (inclusion criteria: one tumor localized by systematic and targeted biopsies based on MRI findings, Gleason ≤7). Treatment failure was defined as local or systemic salvage treatment, a positive biopsy Gleason score of 7 or greater in-field or out-of-field in nontreated patients, prostate cancer metastasis or prostate cancer specific death.</description>

    <description>This study concern the patients with localized prostate cancer treated by Focal HIFU for low or intermediate risk disease. Three surgeons experienced in HIFU performed the procedures. Patients were treated with the Ablatherm device [EDAP TMS S.A., Vaulx-en-Velin, France] until July 2013 and then with the Focal-One device [EDAP TMS S.A.]. The data of all the patients treated between November 2009 to December 2016, at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France), were prospectively maintain within a central database and retrospectively reviewed. The study primary outcome was retreatment-free survival (RFS) defined as any additional further treatment: local (FT/PGA for in-field or out-of-field recurrences or radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy or whole gland HIFU) or systemic salvage treatment, a positive biopsy revealing PCa with an ISUP grade≥ 2 in nontreated patients, PCa metastasis or PCa specific death. The adverse events and functional outcomes were also evaluated.</description>
