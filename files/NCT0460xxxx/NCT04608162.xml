  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic bone disease. Although osteoporosis is widely&#xD;
      considered to be much more prevalent in women approximately 39% of new osteoporotic fractures&#xD;
      estimated to have occurred worldwide in 2000 were in men. A number of studies investigate the&#xD;
      effect of physical therapy modalities in treatment of osteoporosis. The use of pulsed&#xD;
      electromagnetic field (PEMF) represents an attractive alternative for osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggested that pulsed electromagnetic field could be beneficial for increase&#xD;
      bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients, but there is a lack of knowledge about the&#xD;
      long term effect on several parameters.&#xD;

      Objectives: This randomized controlled study aims to investigate the long term effect of&#xD;
      pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers; also to&#xD;
      be used as treatment intervention of osteopenia or osteoporosis through studying the effect&#xD;
      of low intensity, low frequency, single pulsed electromagnetic fields. Methods: One hundred&#xD;
      and twenty male patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis will participate in this study,&#xD;
      their age ranges between 30-60 years. They have BMD T-scores ≤ - 1.5. All patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of three groups. Group one received PEMF and exercise (PEMF+EX), group&#xD;
      two received placebo PEMF and exercise (PPEMF+EX) and group three will be treated by PEMF&#xD;
      alone (PEMF). The exercise training program will include treadmill and aerobic exercises for&#xD;
      hip and upper limb will be performed for 50 minutes.PEMF was administered to the whole body&#xD;
      for PEMF groups using a 1.8×0.6m mat 30 minutes/day, 3 times/week for 3 months. Dual-energy&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) will assess Bone mineral density BMD (g/cm2), bone mineral&#xD;
      content (BMC), T-Score and Z-Score at the lumbar spine, proximal femur and forearm region,&#xD;
      bone markers (25-hydroxy Vit D , Total, undercarboxylated Ostocalcin, Parathyroid Hormone,&#xD;
      Total and Ionized calcium and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), also will be measured. The&#xD;
      assessment will be done at baseline, after treatment (12 weeks) and after 6 months as follow&#xD;
      up. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for&#xD;
      comparison between pre-treatment and post treatment measurement intervals. One-way ANOVA is&#xD;
      used to compare between each treatment interval in treatment groups at pre-test and post&#xD;
      treatment measurement intervals. The level of significance is set at 0.05 for all tests.&#xD;
