  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to establish a national cohort including all persons in the ages&#xD;
      from 15-20 years old with patellar instability (PI) or a prior knee injury (ACL-ruptur or&#xD;
      meniscus damage) . The cohort will be nicknamed &quot;The Faroese Knee Cohort&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to investigate two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patella instability group, in which we intend to investigate the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prevalence of patellar dislocation and trochlear dysplasia in the Faroe Islands.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risk factors for patellar dislocations-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heredity of trochlear dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If there is a specific gene responsible for the development of trochlear dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The development of retropatellar artrhosis, its onset and its impact on quality of&#xD;
                life and function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knee injury group (ACL-ruptur or meniscus injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The prevalence of ACL-rupture and/or meniscus injury in this specific group in the&#xD;
                Faroe Islands.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The impact on quality of life and function.&#xD;

      The Faroese Knee Cohort aims to consist of all persons in the Faroe Island between 15-20&#xD;
      years old with patellar instability* (PI) or a knee injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special focus will be on PI, Patella dislocation (PD) and Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), a&#xD;
      condition where the femoral trochlea has a dysplastic shape and lacks the lateral support of&#xD;
      the patella. The diagnosis will be set by MRI of the knees and is in this study defined as&#xD;
      the presence of one of the following: Crossing sign on a true lateral x-ray, lateral&#xD;
      trochlear inclination angle &lt; 11 degrees or a trochlear depth &lt; 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that abnormal values in the following measures will be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of patellar dislocation and worse patient reported outcome: Caton-Deschamps&#xD;
      index, Lateral Trochlear Inclination, Trochlear Facet Asymmetry, Trochlear Depth, Tuberostias&#xD;
      Tibia - Trochlear Groove distance, Patello-trochlear index and Tuberositas Tibia - Posterior&#xD;
      Cruciate Ligament distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we expect pivoting sports to be a behavioral risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is measured by the number of patellar dislocations or near-dislocation&#xD;
      the patient experiences (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint is the patient reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Definition: Patellar instability (PI) is the overall term encompassing both 1) recurrent&#xD;
      patella dislocations and 2) recurrent episodes of a clear sensation of the kneecap riding on&#xD;
      the outer border/aspect of the knee before popping back in track. The episodes must be a&#xD;
      severe complaint for the patient. PI usually follows after a first time patellar dislocation.&#xD;
