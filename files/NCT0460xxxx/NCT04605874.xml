  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of number of cigarillos per package on use&#xD;
      behaviors, intensity of use and biomarkers of exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This laboratory-based study will aim to enroll 50 current cigarillo users to complete a&#xD;
      20-day, randomized, parallel design protocol. After a 5-day period of smoking their own&#xD;
      preferred brand of cigarillos, participants will begin a 15-day experimental period when they&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two conditions, 2 cigarillos per pack versus 4 cigarillos per&#xD;
      pack, to examine how quantity per pack affects use patterns, including daily consumption and&#xD;
      cigar smoking topography. Participants will be asked to attend 2 in-person sessions on Days 5&#xD;
      and 20. On Days 0, 9, 12 and 16 participants will complete sessions with research staff&#xD;
      remotely (i.e. by phone or video call). Sessions will occur every 3-5 days, for a total of 6&#xD;
      sessions across 20 days.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Cigarillo Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Daily cigarillo consumption will be assessed by participant self-report throughout the 20-day study duration and verified through the collection of spent cigarillo &quot;tips/ends&quot; for all cigarillos smoked throughout the 15-day experimental period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Topography</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Topography data will be produced through a standardized video scoring procedure. Participants will video recorded to collect smoking topography data for all cigarillos smoked throughout the 15-day experimental period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Nicotine Equivalents</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at Day 5 and Day 20 will be assessed for changes in total nicotine equivalents, nicotine plus its primary metabolites, across the experimental study period (Days 5-20). Total nicotine equivalents will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total NNAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at Day 5 and Day 20 will be assessed for changes in NNAL, a biomarker of carcinogen exposure, across the experimental study period (Days 5-20). Total NNAL will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Cigarillo Ratings (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] of Cigarillo Characteristics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide subjective ratings of each cigarillo smoked during each session using a 14-item, 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) of cigarette characteristics. Anchors are item-specific (e.g., taste: 0 = &quot;very bad,&quot; 100 = &quot;very good&quot;), with lower scores indicating less favorable ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarillo Craving (Questionnaire on Smoking Urges [QSU])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarillo craving at the onset of each session. Craving will be assessed using a summary score and two factor subscales (i.e., desire to smoke and craving due to anticipation of negative affect relief) from a 32-item Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU). Participants will respond to each item along a 7-point scale (1=Strongly disagree; 7=Strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarillo Withdrawal (Withdrawal Symptom Checklist [WSC])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarillo withdrawal at the onset of each session. Withdrawal will be assessed using a summary score from the 20-item (21 items at Session 1 [Day 0]) revised version of the Withdrawal Symptom Checklist with a one-week frame of reference (WSC-W). Specifically, participants will respond regarding to how they felt in regards to each potential withdrawal symptom along a 4-point scale (0=Not Present; 3=Severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigar Evaluation (Cigar Evaluation Scale [CES])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete an 11-item questionnaire in regard to the cigarillo smoked during each session. Items on the questionnaire include subjective measures concerning taste, satisfaction, and physical effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory Measure (Sensory Questionnaire [SQ])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 through Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a 9-item questionnaire in regard to the cigarillo smoked during each session. Items on the questionnaire include subjective measures concerning puffs (e.g., satisfaction, perceived levels of nicotine, etc.) and puff sensations (i.e., how strong puffs were in a number of places such as the chest and nose).</description>
