  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Everyday Moments of Mindfulness (EMMI) study is to test whether brief&#xD;
      mindfulness-based practices will improve daily psychological stress responses in women (age&#xD;
      30-60) who report a history of early life adversity. Following a baseline visit (remotely or&#xD;
      in person), participants complete daily surveys and audio-guided mindfulness-based practices&#xD;
      in everyday life via the study app. Specifically, participants receive app-notifications&#xD;
      three times/day (morning, afternoon, evening) to complete daily surveys of current stressors&#xD;
      and psychological states. At each notification, each participant is then randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either receive a mindfulness-based intervention or not (max of 3 interventions/day). Thus,&#xD;
      participants are randomized many times over the course of this 30-day study. At the end of&#xD;
      the study, participants complete a follow-up visit (remotely or in person).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to test whether brief app-based mindfulness and compassion&#xD;
      practices will improve daily psychological stress responses in a sample of adult women (age&#xD;
      30-60) who report a history of early life adversity. The study will incorporate surveys and&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention practices into everyday life using mobile technology (study&#xD;
      app). Participants receive app-notifications three times/day (morning, afternoon, evening) to&#xD;
      complete Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) of current psychological stress states&#xD;
      (pre-EMA; e.g., stress appraisals, affect, perseverative cognitions, self-criticism, social&#xD;
      connection). At each notification, each participant is then randomized to either receive a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention (described in detail below) or no intervention. Thus, each&#xD;
      participant is randomized many times over this 30-day study (Micro-Randomized Trial, MRT).&#xD;
      Psychological stress states are again measured approximately 15 min post-randomization&#xD;
      (post-EMA; e.g., stress appraisals, affect, perseverative cognitions, self-criticism, social&#xD;
      connection) to assess a treatment effect by comparing psychological stress responses after a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention vs. no intervention. The MRT will continue for 30 days. All&#xD;
      study participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention&#xD;
      (after 30 days). Weekly measures of depressive symptoms are also obtained. A trained research&#xD;
      assistant will monitor participant adherence and address potential difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based intervention: The intervention consists of mindfulness and compassion-based&#xD;
      practices. For example, practices focus on the breath/body (e.g., 3 minute breathing space;&#xD;
      compassionate body scan; five senses mediation), on increasing participants' inner resources&#xD;
      (e.g., imaging a safe person or safe place), on reducing negative affect (e.g.,&#xD;
      self-compassionate and acceptance-based practices), or on increasing positive emotions (e.g.,&#xD;
      gratitude practice; metta practices). All interventions are brief (≤5 minutes) and&#xD;
      audio-guided.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) is a design that randomly assigns an intervention at each notification time point (similar to a crossover design in that each participant is randomized to both conditions at different times, except in the MRT the crossover occurs at multiple times): Participants use the study app for 30 days and receive three notifications per day. At each notification time point, participants complete an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of their current psychological stress states (pre-EMA). Then, at each notification, each participant is randomized (50 percent probability) to either receive a mindfulness-based intervention or not. Thus, participants are randomized many times over the 30-day study. Approximately thirty minutes post-randomization, an EMA is obtained again to assess psychological stress states (post-EMA). A treatment effect is examined by comparing psychological stress responses after a mindfulness-based intervention compared to no intervention.</intervention_model_description>

At each notification time point, participants complete EMAs of perseverative cognitions immediately prior to intervention randomization (pre-EMA) and approximately 15 minutes post randomization (post-EMA). Higher scores indicate greater perseverative cognitions (greater rumination/worry). Analyses will account for repeated measures within participants.</description>
