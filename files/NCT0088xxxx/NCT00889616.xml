      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Globally, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is responsible for at least 247 million&#xD;
           acute cases of malaria each year, resulting in about 1 million deaths. Approximately 90&#xD;
           percent of these deaths, the majority in children under 5 years of age, occur in Africa&#xD;
           due to infection with P. falciparum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People living in endemic areas develop natural immunity to P. falciparum as a result of&#xD;
           repeated infection. Consequently, children who survive to 5 years of age rarely succumb&#xD;
           to life-threatening disease despite frequent infection. This acquired immunity is&#xD;
           mediated in part by blood-stage parasite-specific antibodies. Thus, parasite proteins&#xD;
           expressed during the blood-stage have been proposed as good candidates for inclusion in&#xD;
           a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A number of P. falciparum merozoite antigens have been identified as promising&#xD;
           blood-stage vaccine candidates, including Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP 1) and Apical&#xD;
           Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA 1). This Phase I study is the first time that the combination&#xD;
           vaccine (BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG 7909) will be given to humans. The vaccine will be&#xD;
           administered in a randomized, open-label (U.S.)/single-blinded (Mali), dose-escalating&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety and reactogenicity of the combination vaccine (BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG&#xD;
           7909) in malaria-naive U.S. adults and semi-immune Malian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the antibody response of the combination vaccine to the AMA 1 and MSP 142&#xD;
           proteins, as measured by antibody levels and parasite growth inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the extent to which the antibody response to the individual antigens (AMA 1&#xD;
           and MSP 142) is correlated when the combination vaccine is given, and to determine T and&#xD;
           B cell responses to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  United States: Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years, inclusive. Available for the&#xD;
           52 weeks of the trial and willing to participate in the study as evidenced by signing&#xD;
           the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mali: Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years, inclusive, and a known resident of the&#xD;
           village of Bancoumana. Available for the 52 weeks of the trial; willing to participate&#xD;
           in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document or by fingerprinting&#xD;
           the consent document with the signature of a witness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants must meet extensive health and screening requirements to&#xD;
           participate in this study. Good general health is required as a result of review of&#xD;
           medical history and clinical testing at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 52-week study, participants will receive the first vaccine and complete the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination and patient education regarding the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
                potential adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine testing, and vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate,&#xD;
                and respiratory rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  United States: Education on the use of digital thermometer, injection-site reaction&#xD;
                measurement, and malaria vaccine side-effect memory enhancement tool (daily symptom&#xD;
                diaries).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mali: Additional blood draws for malaria smear and urine test for chloroquine&#xD;
                testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  U.S. and Mali participants will return to the study site on specified days throughout&#xD;
           the 52 weeks to receive two additional vaccines, record vital signs, complete additional&#xD;
           blood and urine testing, and review patient education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  U.S. participants will record oral temperature once during the day, as well as pain,&#xD;
           tenderness, redness, swelling at the injection site and any systemic signs or symptoms&#xD;
           for 6 days following each immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive financial compensation (United States) or food (Mali) to&#xD;
           compensate for their time.&#xD;

      This Phase I study will evaluate the blood stage P. falciparummalaria vaccine candidate&#xD;
      BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG 7909 in adults in the US and Mali. BSAM-2 contains a mixture of two&#xD;
      proteins found on the surface of merozoites, AMA1 and MSP1(42). The study is open label, dose&#xD;
      escalating in the US, and will be single-blinded and randomized with a comparator vaccine&#xD;
      (Euvax B - Hepatitis B) in Mali. All volunteers will receive three doses of vaccine, given at&#xD;
      0, 2, and 6 months and administered in the deltoid muscle. The US arm of the study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Center for Immunization Research (CIR), in Washington DC. Fifteen (15)&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will receive 40 (micro)g BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +500 (micro)g CPG 7909 at CIR,&#xD;
      followed by another 15 who will receive 160 (micro)g BSAM-2/Altlhydrogel +500 (micro)g CPG&#xD;
      7909. Safety data to at least one week after the second vaccination from all US volunteers&#xD;
      will be reviewed by a Safety Monitoring Committee prior to vaccinating volunteers in Mali.&#xD;
      The highest safe dose will be administered in Mali after safety data in US adults have been&#xD;
      reviewed by the SMC. The Mali arm of the study will be conducted in Bancoumana. Thirty (30)&#xD;
      volunteers will be randomized to receive either BSAM 2/Alhydrogel +CPG7909 or the licensed&#xD;
      comparator vaccine. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of the vaccine in both malaria naive and semi-immune adults. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the antibody response of the combination vaccine to the AMA1 and&#xD;
      MSPl(42) proteins, as measured by antibody levels and parasite growth inhibition. Study&#xD;
      endpoints are the incidence of local and systemic adverse events, antibody responses to AMA1&#xD;
      and MSP1(42) proteins, and in vitro growth inhibition of falciparum parasites. Exploratory&#xD;
      immunologic analyses will also be conducted.&#xD;
