  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women age 40 or older with moderate to severe dry eyes. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted to determine if signs and symptoms of dry eye will improve with the use of this&#xD;
      nutritional supplement.&#xD;

             change in dosage during course of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Topical ophthalmic medications within prior 4 weeks, or anticipated use of same during&#xD;
