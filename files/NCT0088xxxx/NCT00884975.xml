      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is a major cause of physician&#xD;
      visits and hospital admissions associated with acute respiratory failure, causing increased&#xD;
      morbidity and premature mortality and thus it can significantly affect Health Related Quality&#xD;
      of Life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggested that patients who have experienced frequent exacerbation present&#xD;
      worse HRQoL compared to patients with infrequent exacerbations. However, there are still&#xD;
      questions regarding the relationship between HRQoL and exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators will study a cohort of COPD patients over 6 years,&#xD;
      they will document exacerbations, they will assess lung emphysema by computed tomography of&#xD;
      the chest and they will evaluate health related quality of life in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the extend of emphysema in COPD patients is positively&#xD;
      correlated with worsen Health related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive loss of lung&#xD;
      function and recurrent exacerbations. COPD exacerbation is a major cause of physician visits&#xD;
      and hospital admissions associated with acute respiratory failure, causing increased&#xD;
      morbidity and premature mortality and thus it can significantly affect HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggested that patients who have experienced frequent exacerbation present&#xD;
      worse HRQoL compared to patients with infrequent exacerbations. However, there are still&#xD;
      questions regarding the relationship between HRQoL and exacerbations. Only few studies which&#xD;
      are not an integral part of a clinical trial investigated the relationship between&#xD;
      exacerbations and long-term impairment of HRQoL. Furthermore, a recent study failed to show&#xD;
      that exacerbations remain a significant determinant of HRQoL when several other prognostic&#xD;
      factors were taken into account. In addition, there is luck of data regarding differences in&#xD;
      HRQoL between patients with different phenotypes (i.e., emphysema or chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      predominance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect we prospectively study the long term effect of exacerbations on the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with COPD and we aim to investigate further the relationship between&#xD;
      exacerbations and HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the extend of emphysema is positively correlated with&#xD;
      worsen Health related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive sampling will be used to recruit patients with a diagnosis of COPD according to&#xD;
      the GOLD definition.Exacerbations will be identified as worsening of patient's respiratory&#xD;
      signs as recorded on diary cards. HQoL will be assessed using the Saint George Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionaire (SGRQ). Patients will undergo high resolution computed tomography of the&#xD;
      chest(HRCT). Multiple linear regression analysis will be used to identify factors which&#xD;
      explain SGRQ deterioration over the study period for the entire population and for smokers&#xD;
      and ex-smokers separately.&#xD;
