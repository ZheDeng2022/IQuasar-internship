      The purpose of this study is to assess toxicities of a 1-hr infusion of&#xD;
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) x 10 days (M-F) plus escalating doses of weekly&#xD;
      subcutaneous PEG-interferon-α (PEG-Intron) in patients with metastatic cancer and to identify&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose of PEG-Intron in this combination. The pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      samples will be evaluated to identify changes in molecular correlates.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have a biopsy proven cancer, which is metastatic or unresectable, for&#xD;
             which (in the opinion of the investigator), no curative or more effective treatment&#xD;
             exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must have biopsy accessible tumor and must indicate willingness to undergo&#xD;
             biopsies of tumor and normal skin on days 1, 15 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria by scans performed within 28&#xD;
             days of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient may not have untreated brain metastasis. Patients with previously treated&#xD;
             brain metastasis must no longer be receiving steroid therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
             their brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have a Zubrod performance status of 0 - 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy is allowed. The patient must not have&#xD;
             received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, biologic therapy or any other&#xD;
             investigational drug for any reason within 28 days prior to registration. Concomitant&#xD;
             treatment with other anti-cancer agents or radiotherapy, including investigational&#xD;
             agents during the course of study treatment is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with extensive pelvic irradiation or prolonged nucleoside analogue&#xD;
             pretreatment are excluded due to increased risk for hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient must have adequate liver function as defined by a serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), SGOT or SGPT ≤ 2.5 x the institutional&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (or ≤ 5 x the institutional upper limit of normal if hepatic&#xD;
             metastases is present) obtained within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient must have an adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x&#xD;
             the institutional upper limit of normal, as well as a calculated or measured&#xD;
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient must have an ANC &gt; 1,500/μl, platelet count &gt; 100,000/μl and hemoglobin &gt; 9&#xD;
             gm/dl (this may be achieved by transfusion if needed) obtained within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             provide written acknowledgment of informed consent in accordance with institutional&#xD;
             and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Class 3/4 cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria&#xD;
             (e.g., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 2 months of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes,&#xD;
             uncontrolled chronic renal or liver disease, or active uncontrolled infection, e.g.,&#xD;
             HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must not be pregnant or nursing mothers because PEG-Intron or decitabine may&#xD;
             be harmful to the developing fetus and newborn. Women/men of reproductive potential&#xD;
             must agree to use an effective contraceptive method. Women of reproductive potential&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration.&#xD;
             Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must&#xD;
             agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and&#xD;
             for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, make the&#xD;
             patient unable to tolerate or complete the treatment, or to grant reliable informed&#xD;
             consent are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             Stage I, II, or III cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission,&#xD;
             or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;
