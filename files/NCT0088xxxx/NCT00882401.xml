      Overall research aims: This study will examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the&#xD;
      function of the endothelium and microcirculation of patients with chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Vitamin D therapy in patients with CKD and concomitant vitamin D deficiency will&#xD;
      improve endothelial, and therefore microcirculatory function, reduce levels of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and thus reduce the risk of future CVS events in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research rationale: Cardiovascular (CVS) diseases are the major cause of death in patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), accounting for approximately half of all deaths. Patients&#xD;
      with CKD are far more likely to die of CVS disease than progress to end stage renal disease.&#xD;
      Recently, vitamin D deficiency has been identified as a non-traditional CVS risk factor.&#xD;
      However, vitamin D is not routinely prescribed in the early stages of CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous publications have established that endothelial, and therefore, microcirculatory&#xD;
      dysfunction is a marker of CVS health and a predictor of future CVS events. Studies have also&#xD;
      shown that clinical assessments of the microcirculation reflect the overall health and&#xD;
      function of the endothelium. Vitamin D has been shown to improve endothelial function in&#xD;
      diabetic patients with vitamin D deficiency and normal kidney function. However, no study has&#xD;
      examined endothelial dysfunction in patients with CKD and vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the prevalence of CKD and concomitant vitamin D deficiency increasing worldwide, there&#xD;
      is a pressing need to examine the effects of vitamin D therapy in the early stages of CKD.&#xD;
      This study involves the use of four, non-invasive, detailed assessments of the&#xD;
      microcirculation which could be used in a clinical setting to enhance CVS risk profiling. The&#xD;
      current study design includes novel clinical and in vitro work examining endothelial&#xD;
      function, oxidative stress levels and potential cellular mechanisms by which vitamin D&#xD;
      improves endothelial function. Early detection of endothelial dysfunction, before end stage&#xD;
      renal disease is reached, will provide a powerful tool for predicting future CVS events and&#xD;
      thus provide an opportunity to intervene with therapies, including vitamin D, at an early&#xD;
      stage of renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives: Primary study objective - to evaluate the effects of vitamin D therapy on&#xD;
      endothelial function in patients with CKD and vitamin D deficiency. Secondary study&#xD;
      objective: to evaluate the effects of vitamin D therapy on key clinical parameters in&#xD;
      patients with CKD and vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan: We will conduct a double blind, randomised control trial comparing oral&#xD;
      ergocalciferol to a placebo in adult, non-diabetic patients with CKD stages 3-4 and vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency (defined as &lt; 10ng/ml (&lt;30nmol/L)). Based on power calculations, 40 subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited in each arm as well as 15 healthy control subjects. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for 7 months in total.&#xD;
