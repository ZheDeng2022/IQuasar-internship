      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many people can learn to use feedback about brain activity to modify that activity, but&#xD;
           is it not known if people with Tourette syndrome can modify their brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers have evidence that certain areas of the brain are involved in causing tics&#xD;
           in people with Tourette syndrome. If people with Tourette syndrome can use feedback&#xD;
           about brain activity to modify activity in those parts of the brain, they may be able to&#xD;
           modify their brain activity to help control the tics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if people with and without Tourette syndrome can learn to use thought to&#xD;
           control brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test whether people who have Tourette syndrome can learn to control brain activities,&#xD;
           possibly helping to control tics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers ages 18 and older who are right-handed and are willing to not consume&#xD;
           caffeine or alcohol for 24 hours before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Tourette syndrome who have tics that can be observed and studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants must be able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers (two visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a 2- to 4-week period;&#xD;
           visit may last up to 3 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit, including physical examination and medical history, and a magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) scan if the individual has not had one performed at the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visit: Functional MRI (fMRI) scan to allow researchers to see if volunteers can&#xD;
           learn to control their brain activity during a scan. Volunteers will be asked to&#xD;
           complete tasks as directed during the fMRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Tourette syndrome (three or four outpatient visits over a 4- to 6-week&#xD;
           period; each visit may last up to 4 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit, including physical examination and medical history, and an MRI scan if&#xD;
           the individual has not had one performed at the National Institutes of Health in the&#xD;
           past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation visit to ask questions about Tourette symptoms and to have patients complete&#xD;
           questionnaires about their tics and their mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visit: fMRI scan to allow researchers to see if patients can learn to control&#xD;
           their brain activity during a scan. Patients will be asked to complete tasks as directed&#xD;
           during the fMRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final visit: Researchers will ask questions about tic symptoms, have patients complete&#xD;
           questionnaires, and perform a brief exam. Afterward, patients will have an fMRI scan&#xD;
           similar to the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be paid a small amount of money in compensation for their&#xD;
           participation in the study.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to see if healthy volunteers and patients with hyperkinetic&#xD;
      movement disorders such as Tic Disorders (TD) including Tourette Syndrome (TS) are able to&#xD;
      learn how to alter their brain activity using feedback during functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI), and whether such feedback training can lead to improvement in symptoms in TD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to be carried out in three phases. In Phase 1 we will study the feedback&#xD;
      technique using fMRI with right-handed adult healthy volunteers, in Phase 2 we intend to&#xD;
      study if adult patients with TD are also able to learn the feedback technique, and in Phase 3&#xD;
      we intend to study whether feedback training with fMRI leads to improvement in symptoms in TD&#xD;
      patients and whether patients were able to retain the ability to alter their brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have an initial screening visit to consent and assess their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the current study. All visits are outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a clinical MRI when required, a series of functional scans, and at least&#xD;
      one structural scan for image registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Feasibility Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of fMRI neurofeedback based on activation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform a neurofeedback fMRI visit, where they will attempt at modulating brain&#xD;
      activity level based on the observed feedback signal. Task include motor, motor imagery, or&#xD;
      mental thoughts. Functional localization of target regions will be done with a motor task or&#xD;
      a blink suppression paradigm. Completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of fMRI neurofeedback based on connectivity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will perform two fMRI visits, where they will attempt to learn to modulate&#xD;
           their own brain connectivity using feedback of connectivity patterns between two motor&#xD;
           regions during a real-time fMRI paradigm. Each session will include a performance&#xD;
           evaluation. Data acquisition completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feasibility of fMRI neurofeedback based on patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform one fMRI visit. A blink suppression paradigm will be used to create a&#xD;
      personalized model of urge . Using neurofeedback, subjects attempt to modulate the urge&#xD;
      pattern. In progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Pilot neurofeedback for brain modulation in TD&#xD;
&#xD;
      TD patients will have an evaluation visit, including clinical evaluations, scales and&#xD;
      videotaping and an fMRI visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fMRI visit, the model of urge will be created based on the brain pattern measure&#xD;
      before spontaneous tics. Patients will attempt towill be studied to see if they can learn to&#xD;
      alter their brain activity to decrease the fitting to the urge model, in a similar way as the&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. In progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Pilot neurofeedback fMRI for symptoms improvement in TD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      TD patients will have one evaluation, one scanning, and one follow-up) visit. No visit will&#xD;
      last more than 4 hours. The effect of altering brain activity in a specific brain area on&#xD;
      symptoms in TD patients will be studied. Patients will be asked to continue to focus their&#xD;
      thoughts as they did during feedback scanning any time that they feel an urge prior to a tic&#xD;
      or every hour while awake, whichever is more frequent, until a follow-up visit and fMRI scan&#xD;
      two or three days later. Require power analysis based on Phase 2.&#xD;
