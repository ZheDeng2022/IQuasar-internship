      Primary objective - to determine the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) of adult&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme/gliosarcoma treated with bi-weekly&#xD;
      temozolomide plus (Avastin) bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives - to determine radiographic response including specialized MRI&#xD;
      sequences, safety and overall survival of adult patients with with recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme/gliosarcoma treated with bi-weekly temozolomide plus bevacizumab (Avastin).&#xD;
      Additionally, tumor DNA (MGMT) analysis as it relates to survival will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of the combination of Avastin and temozolomide for patients with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Avastin is administered intravenously at a dose of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days and temozolomide is administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2&#xD;
      on days 1-5 and 15-19 every 28 days (one cycle). Patients will have a baseline MRI, an MRI&#xD;
      scan after the first cycle and every other cycle after that. If there is no evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients will receive one year of therapy. If&#xD;
      there is evidence of added benefit (eg: tumor regression), patients can stay on treatment&#xD;
      longer than one year, per investigator discretion.&#xD;
