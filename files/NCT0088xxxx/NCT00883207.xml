  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the project is to develop couple therapy for depression with special interest&#xD;
      in dialogical and narrative processes in therapy. Parenthood, and different psychosocial&#xD;
      phenomena, such as domestic violence, suicidal behaviour and alcohol abuse in relation to the&#xD;
      client's specific depressive state will be analysed. The second main aim of the study is to&#xD;
      analyse the effectiveness couple therapy for depression as a real world study. The good and&#xD;
      poor outcome of different therapy processes will be compared and thus information about&#xD;
      precise change processes will be reached. Owing to the real world setting, the inclusion&#xD;
      criterion is a broad one: a primary diagnosis of depression (F32 and F33 in ICD-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be conducted as a multicentre study so that in each centre the included&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into experiment and control groups. The study centres are (1)&#xD;
      Pohjois-Savon sairaanhoitopiiri in Kuopio, (2) LÃ¤nsi-Pohjan sairaanhoitopiiri in Tornio and&#xD;
      Kemi and (3) HUS/ Jorvin sairaala regional psychiatric polyclinics in Espoo. In each province&#xD;
      the entire adult population has free access to the psychiatric outpatient clinics in their&#xD;
      specific catchment area and thus no selection for the patients is done.&#xD;

      In each of these research centres qualified family therapists will conduct the couple therapy&#xD;
      in case of depressed patients in a team of two therapists. To be a responsible therapist in&#xD;
      this study the minimum criterion is three years specialist- level family therapy training and&#xD;
      thus a qualification as psychotherapist according to Finnish law. The therapist shall have&#xD;
      special experience and interest in dialogical and narrative processes in therapy. All the&#xD;
      family therapists will also have taken a training program that focuses on systemic family&#xD;
      therapy, narrative therapies and open dialogue in a family setting. No special therapy manual&#xD;
      has been written, but the treatment processes will be analyzed after the therapy in relation&#xD;
      to the outcome. The treatment processes are expected to last for as long as required&#xD;
      according to the specific needs of each couple. This will allow for the focus on external&#xD;
      validity: Clients will be recruited in the course of daily clinical practice without any&#xD;
      selection outside the diagnosis and the therapies are taking place for as long as needed. The&#xD;
      analyses of the treatment processes in relation to outcome, has termed as progress research&#xD;
      by Pinsof &amp; Wynne (2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In couple therapy some guidelines are followed. Since every family therapist has training in&#xD;
      systemic therapy, the therapy can be termed as systemic couple therapy with a special focus&#xD;
      on dialogues and narratives. The two therapists and the couple form a system in which the&#xD;
      first aim is to generate dialogue to increase understanding of couple's situation and the&#xD;
      role of depression in their lives. To this end, spouses are encouraged to speak of subjects&#xD;
      that they find most important. While one person is speaking, the other three take a&#xD;
      reflective position in their inner dialogues and afterwards describe their thoughts about&#xD;
      what was said. The shift between the speaking and listening positions in the topics that the&#xD;
      couple choose is the basic element in each therapy process. In these processes a new joint&#xD;
      language is created for experiences without words or experiences manifested in symptoms,&#xD;
      marital problems or in problematic behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of analysis will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effectiveness of systemic couple therapy will be analyzed by (a) the assessment of&#xD;
           depression by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale inventory and the BDI and SCL&#xD;
           self-report ratings scales; (b) the assessment of couple satisfaction by the Dyadic&#xD;
           Adjustment Scale (DAS) self-report rating scale; and (c) the assessment of the&#xD;
           psychological status of the patient by GAF rating. In addition to these, (e) domestic&#xD;
           violence, use of alcohol and other psychosocial factors will be analyzed in interviews.&#xD;
           Assessments will be conducted before the outset of the treatment, after 6 months, after&#xD;
           12 months and after 18 months from the beginning of the treatment. Changes in the scales&#xD;
           between experiment and control groups will be compared. Because of the small size of the&#xD;
           experimental group and the naturalistic design, no noteworthy differences in the results&#xD;
           are expected as such. To test hypothetical explanatory power a prove was conducted. In&#xD;
           the power calculation, a hypothetical sample of 35 received the value .82 in cases where&#xD;
           the mean difference between two measurements divided by the corresponding standard&#xD;
           deviation was 0.6. Similarly, if the difference in the means between two measurements&#xD;
           was 0.5, the explanatory power was .66. Differences that are strong enough cannot be&#xD;
           expected if only the group differences in the mean values between two measurements are&#xD;
           analyzed without relating the results to the therapy processes (point 2) and to the&#xD;
           processes of change (point 3). The explanatory power may be higher, however, after the&#xD;
           Swedish study site has been added to the sample. The entire sample size would then&#xD;
           consist of about 55 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment processes will be studied by analysing (a) video or audio recordings of the&#xD;
           dialogues and (b) the entire treatment processes in a specific follow-up interview three&#xD;
           months after termination of the couple therapy. This interview will be organized as a&#xD;
           learning forum, that is, the follow-up interviews will be conducted in a way that&#xD;
           enables the therapists to evaluate their work together with the couple and an outsider&#xD;
           interviewer. The aim is at developing the family therapists' therapeutic skills.&#xD;
           Reflective processes and learning on the part of the families are essential in this&#xD;
           co-research practice (Andersen 2006). The family and all staff members included in the&#xD;
           specific treatment process will be invited to this interview. First the therapy team&#xD;
           will be interviewed about their experiences of the treatment, and then the family&#xD;
           members will be interviewed about their experiences of the therapy and about their&#xD;
           thoughts regarding the therapists' experiences. The aim of this interview is to gain&#xD;
           information about the specific processes through which clients can perform their own&#xD;
           psychological work with their problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Processes of changes will be studied by conducting (a) a Outcome Ratings Scale among&#xD;
           clients before each session and a Session Rating Scale among both clients and therapists&#xD;
           after each therapy session and; and by (b) analyzing the qualities of the couple&#xD;
           therapies by Psychotherapy Q-Sort (PQS) categories (Jones &amp; Jones, 1985). In the PQS 100&#xD;
           characteristics in 9 categories will be analyzed for one therapy session. The&#xD;
           characteristics describe 1) attitude, behaviour and explicative experience of the&#xD;
           patient; 2) actions and attitudes of the therapists; and 3) the nature of the&#xD;
           therapeutic relationship, environment and atmosphere of the session (Sirigatti, 2004).&#xD;
           Although the PQS has mostly been used in analysing manualized psychotherapies (Ablon &amp;&#xD;
           Jones, 2002), implications has recently been developed for non-prescriptive therapies&#xD;
           (Ablon et al., 2005) and systemic therapy (Sirigatti, 2004). Both analyses will be&#xD;
           related to the outcome of the couple therapies and thus systematic information will be&#xD;
           obtained as to which type of dialogues are connected with good outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group is formed in each of the three centres. These clients will not have family&#xD;
      therapy sessions during the first 12 months; instead, according to the manner usual in each&#xD;
      centre they will visit a psychiatrist or other therapists. Clients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the experimental and control groups after the doctor admitting them has assessed their&#xD;
      inclusion by diagnosis and the Hamilton Rating Scale and after the first research interview&#xD;
      has been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period started in February 2006 and lasted until summer 2007. The first&#xD;
      follow-up interviews will continue until the end of 2009. In this specific project the&#xD;
      analysis of the data will begin in 2007 and continue to the end of 2010 concerning this&#xD;
      specific project. Thereafter the data will be available for post graduate and doctoral&#xD;
      students under the supervision of the principal investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Psychology at the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ is the study site, in which all the&#xD;
      data will be gathered. In each centre the research data will be stored outside of patient&#xD;
      records. Information of the ratings scales can be added to specific patient records.&#xD;
