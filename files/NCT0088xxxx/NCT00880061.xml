      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusely infiltrating pontine glioma (DIPG) or supratentorial high-grade glioma (HGG)&#xD;
           are brain tumors that are often difficult to treat. It is very difficult to get&#xD;
           chemotherapy agents to tumors in the brain, and researchers are looking for new methods&#xD;
           to directly treat these types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-13 is an immune molecule normally occurring in the body. Patients with gliomas appear&#xD;
           to have significant amounts of the IL-13 receptors in their brain tumors. An&#xD;
           experimental drug, IL13-PE38QQR, combines a bacteria toxin with human IL-13 to allow the&#xD;
           toxin to enter and destroy the tumor cell. Early clinical studies suggest this treatment&#xD;
           may prolong survival of patients with these types of brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A technique called convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses continuous pressure to push&#xD;
           large molecules through the membranes protecting the brain to reach brain tumors. This&#xD;
           technique can treat a tumor more directly than with traditional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the safety and feasibility of giving IL13-PE38QQR directly into regions of the&#xD;
           brain in pediatric patients with DIPG or HGG, using CED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the most appropriate dose of IL13-PE38QQR to treat DIPG or HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of this experimental therapy on the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the physical changes in the tumor before and after the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are less than 18 years of age and have been diagnosed with either DIPG or&#xD;
           with supratentorial HGG that has not responded well to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be admitted to the hospital and will receive a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI) scan to show the exact location of the tumor. A small plastic tube will be&#xD;
           inserted surgically into the tumor area, and IL13-PE38QQR and a MRI contrast agent&#xD;
           (gadolinium DTPA) will be infused into the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans will monitor the process, and the tube will be removed after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doses will be adjusted over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who respond well to treatment may be eligible to receive a second infusion, no&#xD;
           sooner than 4 weeks after the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits 4 and 8 weeks after the treatment, and then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination with neurological testing, an MRI, and standard blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;

      Objective: The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of giving&#xD;
      a new experimental agent, called IL13-PE38QQR, directly into regions of the brain in patients&#xD;
      with diffusely infiltrating pontine glioma (DIPG) or with recurrent or progressive&#xD;
      supratentorial high-grade glioma (HGG) using a technique called convection-enhanced delivery&#xD;
      or CED. CED uses continuous pressure to push large molecules through the membranes protecting&#xD;
      the brain to reach brain tumors. At the same time, we can watch where the molecules go in the&#xD;
      brain by attaching a tracer, gadolinium-DTPA, to the IL13-PE38QQR, which can then be seen in&#xD;
      the brain with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because we do not know the best dose to use&#xD;
      in patients with DIPG or HGG, we will give increasing amounts of IL13-PE38QQR to small groups&#xD;
      of patients with each type of brain tumor, known as a dose escalation study. Secondary&#xD;
      purposes of this study include determining the effects of this experimental therapy on the&#xD;
      tumor, and evaluating the physical changes in the tumor before and after the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Twenty-right pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG or&#xD;
      supratentorial HGG that have undergone standard treatment and who meet all the Inclusion and&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria may be enrolled. Eighteen patients will receive treatment; an additional&#xD;
      ten patients may be screening failures or unevaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We propose a Phase I single institution, open label, dose escalation (doses of 0.125,&#xD;
      0.25 and 0.5 micrograms/ml), safety and tolerability study of IL13-PE38QQR infused via CED&#xD;
      into patients with either DIPG (up to 9 patients) or recurrent HGG (up to 9 patients).&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR will be administered to regions of tumor determined by radiographic findings.&#xD;
      Escalating dose levels will be evaluated in the following dose cohorts (3 patients per&#xD;
      Cohort): Cohort 1 = 0.125 micrograms/ml, Cohort 2 = 0.25 micrograms/ml and Cohort 3 = 0.5&#xD;
      micrograms/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: To assess the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of CED of&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR, we will use detailed clinical and radiographic examinations. These will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and on post-infusion days 1, 28 and 60. After post-infusion day 60,&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic studies will then be performed every 8 weeks until imaging or&#xD;
      clinical evidence of recurrence/progressive disease or new treatment is initiated.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing surgical resection must have measurable/evaluable disease prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histopathologic Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A histopathologic diagnosis is not required for patients with DIPG but a biopsy&#xD;
                  may be recommended if the patient has an atypical presentation or atypical&#xD;
                  findings on MR-imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Histopathologic confirmation for patients with HGG is required. If necrosis is&#xD;
                  suspected based on MR-imaging and Nuclear Medicine scans, biopsy or surgical&#xD;
                  resection for confirmation of disease progression may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have received at least standard doses of radiation (i.e., greater&#xD;
                  than 54 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Surgery/biopsy - Patients must be more than 2 weeks from any neurosurgical&#xD;
                  procedure and cleared by the Principal Investigator before undergoing CED.&#xD;

                  chemotherapy must be greater than 2 weeks prior to CED and the patient must have&#xD;
                  recovered from any toxic effects of prior therapy (to less than Grade 2 or&#xD;
                  baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;

                  investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be healthy enough to tolerate surgery and general anesthesia in the&#xD;
             opinion of the primary investigator. This includes, but is not limited to:&#xD;

                  total bilirubin less than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and direct&#xD;
                  bilirubin within normal limits. Patients with elevated SGPT (up to 5 times ULN)&#xD;
                  will be eligible if the elevation is attributed to steroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If neurological deficits are present, they must be stable for at least 1 week&#xD;
                  prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to undergo MR-imaging with gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
             administration (e.g. no ferrous-containing implants, no pacemakers, no allergy to&#xD;
