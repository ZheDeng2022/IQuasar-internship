  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a coordinated regional approach to healthy&#xD;
      skin programs in six remote Aboriginal communities can demonstrate, not only a reduction in&#xD;
      the burden of scabies and streptococcal skin sores, but also broad health benefits, including&#xD;
      primary prevention of some chronic diseases that occur at particularly high rates in&#xD;
      Australian Aboriginal communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the Program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate a reduction in scabies and skin sores on a regional basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the broader public health effects of Healthy Skin Programs, particularly&#xD;
           those relating to chronic diseases such as rheumatic fever and renal diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build on the existing Indigenous capacity by assisting in the development of new&#xD;
           knowledge and skills to improve the health and well being of Indigenous communities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the feasibility of incorporating Healthy Skin Programs into existing health&#xD;
           service delivery&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are standard government recommendations for the conduct of healthy skin programs within&#xD;
      the Northern Territory (NT), where the key component involves a single mass treatment for&#xD;
      scabies of all residents in the region followed by regular monitoring of skin infections with&#xD;
      treatment of individuals as new cases arise. The key features of the guidelines include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Community planning and collaborative effort;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of local educational resources;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single whole community treatment day for scabies with permethrin (5%);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Community &quot;clean up&quot; involving house cleaning, linen and rubbish collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emphasis on housing functionality and &quot;washing kids&quot; to maintain low rates of skin&#xD;
           sores; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular monitoring of scabies and skin sores, usually in a target group such as children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous programs have been successful in controlling scabies and related skin infections in&#xD;
      the NT but have been limited to single communities with varying levels of success. In&#xD;
      collaboration with communities in the East Arnhem Region, we propose to conduct a coordinated&#xD;
      Healthy Skin Program. By concentrating on one region, the project has an increased likelihood&#xD;
      of success because reinfection due to mobility between communities will be minimised, and&#xD;
      because the project will be recognised as a collaboration between multiple communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is structured into three distinct components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of the program within the participating communities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the program against specific outcomes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Integration of the program into routine service delivery.&#xD;
