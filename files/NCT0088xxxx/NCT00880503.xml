  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to cancer chemotherapy develops in patients, rendering certain treatments&#xD;
      ineffective. Despite much research, the prevailing cause of drug resistance is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One mechanism for drug resistance involves a protein called P-glycoprotein, or Pgp, which&#xD;
      reduces the effectiveness of cancer treatments by &quot;pumping&quot; anti-cancer drugs out of tumor&#xD;
      cells where they are supposed to work against the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and evaluate more thoroughly the roles of Pgp and other substances in mediating&#xD;
      drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in clinical trials of cancer therapies at the Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh; Cancer Centers of Carolinas; Arizona Clinical Research Center; University of&#xD;
      Copenhagen; and Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen who have consented to the use of blood, tissue,&#xD;
      or tumor samples for laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, tumor, and tissue samples are collected from participants and sent to the NCI for&#xD;
      various laboratory analyses.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, patients who succumb to cancer do so because of drug resistance. Mechanisms of&#xD;
      drug resistance have been explored in the laboratory and in clinical samples for some time,&#xD;
      yet the prevailing cause of drug resistance, if indeed there is a single cause, is not known.&#xD;
      One mechanism of drug resistance is multidrug efflux, mediated by P-glycoprotein. Other&#xD;
      mechanisms have been proposed. Our laboratory has expertise in the analysis of drug&#xD;
      transporter expression and activity in clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine expression of P-glycoprotein and other multidrug transporters thought to mediate&#xD;
      clinical drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate inhibition of P-glycoprotein and other multidrug transporters through assessment&#xD;
      of efflux activity in cells obtained from patients enrolled on clinical trials at other&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and evaluate mechanisms of drug resistance using molecular assays such as cDNA&#xD;
      array, real-time PCR analysis, and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on clinical trials outside the NCI, and giving informed consent to the use&#xD;
      of blood, tissue, or tumor samples for evaluation of mechanisms of drug resistance or&#xD;
      evaluation of inhibition of multi-drug efflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future collaborations for similar studies will be added via the protocol amendment procedure;&#xD;
      molecular studies other than ABC transporter assays will be added via the protocol amendment&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human tumor biopsies or blood samples will be collected from cancer patients enrolled on&#xD;
      approved clinical trials, in accordance with the local protocol. These trials are being&#xD;
      conducted at outside institutions, and the samples will be sent to the NCI for&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis, cDNA array, PCR analysis, or for blood assays for detection of&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein inhibition.&#xD;
