      1. To evaluate the effects of a single oral (80 mg) dose of propranolol on the encoding of&#xD;
           emotional pictures as assessed by peripheral physiological and electrocortical&#xD;
           parameters in a healthy population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study is to combine two lines of research investigating the&#xD;
      interaction between emotional processing and memory performance and its modulation by&#xD;
      beta-blockade. As has been suggested by aforementioned lesion, pharmacological and&#xD;
      neuroimaging evidence, emotional stimuli are better remembered because they are better&#xD;
      encoded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ERP literature, there are a number of studies on emotion and memory, but few of them&#xD;
      have investigated the modulatory effects of emotion on memory, focusing on either during&#xD;
      stages of encoding (Palomba, Angrilli &amp; Mini, 1997; Dolcos &amp; Cabeza, 2002) or during memory&#xD;
      retrieval of emotional and neutral material (Maratos &amp; Rugg, 2001; Windmann &amp; Kutas, 2001).&#xD;
      It is assumed that emotionally arousing information gains privileged access to processing&#xD;
      resources. This means that emotional arousing stimuli guide attention for more elaborated&#xD;
      processing, leading to better memory formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning pharmacological manipulations with ß-blockers, there is no existing ERP study that&#xD;
      shows the effect of ß-blockade on encoding processes and memory retrieval of emotional&#xD;
      pictures. Therefore, the current investigation was designed to test whether recall and&#xD;
      recognition of emotional pictures can be reduced by administration of propranolol and whether&#xD;
      this reduction in memory performance is correlated with changes in event-related potentials&#xD;
      or peripheral physiological parameters (heart rate variability, heart rate, blood pressure&#xD;
      and electrodermal response). As a surrogate for sympathetic activity and/or activation by&#xD;
      noradrenaline, a salivary sample to measure activity of the alpha-amylase will be employed&#xD;
      (van Stegeren, Rohleder, Everaerd &amp; Wolf, 2006) In conclusion, we hypothesize (1) a memory&#xD;
      advantage for emotionally arousing stimuli but not for emotionally neutral pictures. (2) ERP&#xD;
      components associated with emotional effects and memory effects are pronounced for emotional&#xD;
      stimuli. (3) Peripheral physiological parameters should also be pronounced for emotionally&#xD;
      arousing stimuli. (4) Emotional processing and emotional memory will be impaired by the&#xD;
      beta-blocker propranolol as indicated by behavioral data and psycho-physiological parameters.&#xD;
