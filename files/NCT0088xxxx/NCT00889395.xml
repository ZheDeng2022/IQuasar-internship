      The Mediational Interventions for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) model developed by Professor&#xD;
      Pnina Klein is to enhance the cognitive and social development of children throughout the&#xD;
      developing world . Although MISC has proven effective in a longitudinal study in two poorer&#xD;
      communities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia , it has not been used with HIV households or in the&#xD;
      Ugandan context where there is desperate need for enhanced caregiving in HIV-affected&#xD;
      families. We propose to work with community leaders, healthcare workers, and&#xD;
      parents/caregivers in adapting MISC to the Ugandan cultural and social context in Kayunga.&#xD;
      For intervention families, MISC training will be added to an ongoing home health care visit&#xD;
      (HHCV) program already in place for HIV children in Kayunga district. We will then evaluate&#xD;
      whether MISC parent/caregiver training improves cognitive and psychosocial development in&#xD;
      their children, and whether clinical stability of the HIV child is an important modifier for&#xD;
      MISC training benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Uganda, about 110,000 children 0 to 14 years are living with AIDS however enhanced access&#xD;
      to ARV medications has changed the prognosis for infected children from a uniformly deadly&#xD;
      disease early in childhood to one in which survival well into adolescence is not uncommon.&#xD;
      However, these prognostic changes have made psychosocial, educational, and quality-of-life&#xD;
      considerations for the HIV child all the more critical. Studies on Ugandan HIV infected&#xD;
      children show that they have cognitive, motor and emotional problems. These findings support&#xD;
      the need for caregiving interventions with HIV children that extend beyond provision for&#xD;
      basic medical and nutritional care only. These findings support the urgent need for programs&#xD;
      that minister to the emotional and psychosocial needs of HIV-affected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MISC is one such intervention that has proven effective in improving the cognitive,&#xD;
      psychosocial and emotional needs of disadvantaged children. The MISC intervention is based on&#xD;
      the use of naturally occurring situations and objects in the home environment. The process of&#xD;
      training the caregivers in MISC theory and strategies is structured, whereas the process of&#xD;
      implementing MISC with the children in the household is individualized and unstructured. The&#xD;
      training of the caregiver is focused on the acquisition of knowledge and skills necessary for&#xD;
      effective intervention to enrich the child's home-based learning environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the feasibility of MISC for caregivers of HIV infected children in Kayunga.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether cognition and psychosocial functioning of HIV infected children&#xD;
           are improved by MISC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether cognitive and psychosocial gains for children of MISC-trained&#xD;
           caregivers is moderated by disease severity of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. METHODS Phase 1: Adaptation of the MISC Study design. Adaptation of the MISC will be done&#xD;
      using a cross sectional descriptive study. Prior to recruitment of participants, Prof. Klein&#xD;
      will hold a series of focus group discussions (FDGs) in Kayunga to critique the MISC&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. Community leaders, health workers and parents/caregivers in Kayunga&#xD;
      district, three FGDs will be held for each of these groups. They will partner with Dr. Klein&#xD;
      in revising and adapting the MISC curriculum for training the local MISC staff who will&#xD;
      accompany the CAI teams as they visit the HIV children and caregivers for the home health&#xD;
      care visitation (HHCV). These CAI nursing staff will then train the caregivers each month as&#xD;
      part of these HHCV visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: MISC intervention Study design. This will be a randomized control study where HIV&#xD;
      infected children younger than 6 yrs of age will be recruited and randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      MISC intervention or non- intervention. All children will be recruited from the Child Health&#xD;
      Advocacy International (CAI) project in Kayunga district during their routine home visits.&#xD;
      Consecutive sampling will be used till the sample size is reached.&#xD;
