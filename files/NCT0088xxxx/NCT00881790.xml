    <textblock>
      The behaviour of 12 dental nurses seeing 600 nursery school children in East Scotland will be&#xD;
      video-taped to determine the interaction patterns adopted by the staff in the application of&#xD;
      a fluoride varnish to the surfaces of the child's teeth. The aim is to test the benefit of&#xD;
      certain communication strategies used by the nurses to affect an efficient application&#xD;
      controlling for nursery school site, age of child and experience of dental nurse.&#xD;

      A preliminary study has shown the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethical permission for this work is attainable from a Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents are willing to give consent to their children participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dental nurses are willing to give consent for their behaviours to be video recorded&#xD;
           within their work settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Video recordings are feasible with nursery school children, EDDNs and parents present at&#xD;
           a nursery school setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The technical difficulties of collecting audio-visual materials from nursery school&#xD;
           settings (e.g., camera placement, storage of video data in the field setting) and&#xD;
           anonymising the video data using a specialist masking software can be overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Importing video files into the Observer XT coding software is successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Development of a coding system for nurse-child interaction involving a clinical&#xD;
           procedure has been achieved (see Appendix 1 for a brief version of the coding scheme).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have collected video recordings of more than 50 varnish application sessions in the pilot&#xD;
      study of separate children and 6 nurses in three nursery schools. The pilot study has&#xD;
      therefore successfully demonstrated the feasibility of collecting high quality data suitable&#xD;
      for intensive analysis to improve our understanding of some of the processes involved in the&#xD;
      fluoride varnish application in nursery school settings. One of the most interesting findings&#xD;
      from the pilot study was that the permission-seeking statements used by EDDNs were negatively&#xD;
      correlated with the treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of next phase of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the suitability of the preliminary coding scheme and to potentially refine&#xD;
           and improve the coding scheme using a larger set of observational data collected in&#xD;
           nursery school settings across three NHS Health Board regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further investigation to assess the generalisability of pilot study findings by&#xD;
           collecting a larger set of observations of children systematically across a wider set of&#xD;
           nurse pairings (with various levels of experience) and children (of different age&#xD;
           groups: 3yrs vs 4 yrs) and with or without previous receipt of fluoride varnish&#xD;
           application in the Childsmile programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the key features of the nurse-child interaction that can be used to predict&#xD;
           a full completion of the fluoride application and to test the hypothesis that frequent&#xD;
           targeted reinforcement is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore effects of some additional factors in relation to the relevant participants&#xD;
           (e.g., EDDN's level of experience, child's previous dental experience) and some&#xD;
           situational factors (e.g., general purpose room or specialist accommodation) on the&#xD;
           treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop additional training sessions for EDDNs using the findings of the study to&#xD;
           improve the Childsmile programme and to increase acceptability of the varnish&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics proposal preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We obtained ethics approval for the pilot study. We have successfully addressed and dealt&#xD;
      with the ethical issues that arose from the study in the pilot stage. We have experienced no&#xD;
      degree of difficulty in consenting staff or children for recruitment of the pilot. We believe&#xD;
      that obtaining further ethical approval for an extended study should be achievable due to our&#xD;
      previous experience. The difference between the pilot and this main study is an extension in&#xD;
      the numbers of child observations. This will require a multisite ethics proposal to be&#xD;
      entered into IRAS. In terms of ethical approval from NHS Research and Development (R &amp; D)&#xD;
      offices, we are working with the NHS Research Scotland (NRS), who will assist in obtaining&#xD;
      the approvals from different NHS R &amp; D offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been welcomed into the setting by the nursing staff and have had no adverse effects&#xD;
      in our work in the schools collecting the 50+ child observations. In the main study, we will&#xD;
      collect approximately 500 child observations across several NHS Health Board regions. We will&#xD;
      continue a positive working relation with EDDNs and nursery school staff developed in the&#xD;
      pilot stage. We will be very careful in the consenting and recruitment of nurse and child&#xD;
      participants without causing pressure for participation. Anonymity of personal details and&#xD;
      confidentiality of the information provided by participants will be dealt with carefully by&#xD;
      assigning a unique code to each of the participants and only the research team members will&#xD;
      have access to the codes. We do not foresee any additional new factors that will jeopardise&#xD;
      approval of an application to REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      All EDDNs who have been trained in the Childsmile programme and participated in the delivery&#xD;
      of the varnish application at nursery school settings in the three NHS Health Board regions&#xD;
      (Tayside, Fife and Forth Valley) are identified as potential staff participants. All newly&#xD;
      trained EDDNs who will be delivering the varnish application to nursery school children at&#xD;
      the three regions are also included. All nursery school children in the three regions&#xD;
      mentioned above whose parents have consented to the Childsmile varnish application programme&#xD;
      are identified as potential child participants. The parents of those children are potential&#xD;
      parent participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting up the recording and coding system&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Observer system consists of a powerful suite of programmes that integrates the input of&#xD;
      digital video files and sound to a platform on the computer screen for repeated playback and&#xD;
      real-time coding, diagrammatic display, simple categorical analysis and more complex&#xD;
      sequential analysis. Various options are available for collection of the recordings and these&#xD;
      may vary according to setting. Variables to determine the optimum system include:&#xD;
      obtrusiveness of the camera and microphone, quality of video image required, and ease of use&#xD;
      in the 'field'. The pilot study has shown that the materials collected from the 'field' can&#xD;
      be transferred onto a university computer hard disc to be ready for coding purpose. The&#xD;
      picture quality and positioning of the camera can be varied to optimise the study of the&#xD;
      nurse-child interaction during the varnish application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot observations&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to check the feasibility of the new recording system to be used in the main study (a&#xD;
      digital DVD camera instead of a web camera in the pilot stage), we will need to make a small&#xD;
      number of pilot observations of the nurse-child interactions. This process is important to&#xD;
      ensure that the recorded video data can be successfully digitalized and subsequently&#xD;
      transferred into the Observer XT8.0 for coding and analysis. Although we have had some&#xD;
      experience of dealing with this process in the pilot stage, taking additional pilot&#xD;
      observations is still an important step as we are using a new recording system and an updated&#xD;
      version of the Observer XT software in the main study. These pilot observations will be also&#xD;
      used to double check that the coding scheme developed from the pilot data is functioning&#xD;
      properly for a new set of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of coding scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of a coding scheme is a vital component of the study and will require&#xD;
      considerable effort and thought to develop a suitable system that is not too cumbersome but&#xD;
      also detailed enough to illustrate the various strategies that are adopted by the 'actors' to&#xD;
      progress the intervention. Of particular interest are the cases where there is unexpected&#xD;
      behaviour or events that require inclusion in the profiling of the interaction. For example&#xD;
      the child may refuse certain aspects of the varnish procedure and require coaxing through&#xD;
      reassurance or distraction. Interruptions of the procedure by outside events, e.g. parental&#xD;
      or nursery nurse involvement, fire alarms can all be present in the scheme and included or&#xD;
      ignored in subsequent analysis. The Observer XT system enables the accurate collection of&#xD;
      codes from video. The advantage of the updated version of the Observer XT system is the&#xD;
      modification of the coding scheme during the coding procedure itself. Previous versions of&#xD;
      the software did not allow this 'luxury'. Other available ('freeware') coding systems do not&#xD;
      have this capability. Therefore, the coding scheme developed from the pilot data can be&#xD;
      tested for fit using new datasets collected in the main study and the coding scheme can also&#xD;
      be potentially improved if certain behaviours need to be included and/or modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of observational data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations of nurse-child interaction will be recorded in the field using a digital DVD&#xD;
      camera. The video observation data, initially stored on a DVD, will be transferred in digital&#xD;
      format and then stored on a computer internal hard drive for coding and analysis. The&#xD;
      Observer XT system is more stable if digital video data is read directly from a computer than&#xD;
      from an external hard disc (e.g., DVD), the process of digitalizing video files and storing&#xD;
      in a computer is, therefore, an important step for successful behaviour coding and data&#xD;
      analysis. Each of the initial raw video files stored on DVDs will be assigned a unique code&#xD;
      for data protection purpose and will be locked in a secure place. All digitalized video files&#xD;
      stored on a computer internal hard disc will be permanently removed from the computer once&#xD;
      coding and analysis is complete. These digitalized video files will then be exported onto an&#xD;
      external hard drive that will have all data encrypted and access to data files password&#xD;
      protected. An audit record will be compiled to allow inspection of the progress of video data&#xD;
      files from video DVD to computer hard disc for coding and then exporting to external media&#xD;
      for safe long-term storage. Audit will be monitored by the School Ethics Committee on a&#xD;
      6-month basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coding of video data The research assistants will be responsible for the coding of the video&#xD;
      data. This task is labour- intensive and highly skilled. There will be approximately 500&#xD;
      video clips to be processed, which will require a period of about 9-10 months to complete. So&#xD;
      far, no specific coding schemes have been developed for this type of nurse-child interactive&#xD;
      behaviours. The new coding scheme (Appendix 1) that we have devised from the pilot study&#xD;
      consists of about 40 codes and we have just recently conducted a reliability analysis of the&#xD;
      scheme. There was 86% agreement using a tolerance window of 2 seconds for coded events. The&#xD;
      kappa statistic was 0.84 (p&lt;.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Observer XT has appropriate reliability (kappa) statistical routines built into the&#xD;
      software to provide estimates of agreement controlled for random chance. See 'Coding of video&#xD;
      data' above for reliability estimate for the coding scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main software used for coding and analysing video data is the Observer XT 8.0. The&#xD;
      rationale of the coding and analysis with The Observer system will be two-folded, a&#xD;
      descriptive element. After all verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both nurse and child have&#xD;
      been coded according to the coding scheme, the coded behaviours along with the time point&#xD;
      when the behaviour took place (if the behaviour is coded as an event) or the duration of the&#xD;
      time (if coded as a state behaviour) will be stored as a log file for one particular&#xD;
      nurse-child interaction. Frequencies of certain behaviours can then be calculated, for&#xD;
      example, nurse's use of praise or fantasy statements; and whether the use of these statements&#xD;
      is linked with positive application outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, there will be an explanatory element. Sequential analysis will be employed to explore&#xD;
      which behaviours tend to facilitate or impede the occurrence of other behaviours. The purpose&#xD;
      of this type of analysis is to understand more complex behavioural relationships in terms of&#xD;
      how nurses use motivational strategies to encourage cooperative behaviours of children in&#xD;
      receiving the varnish application.&#xD;
