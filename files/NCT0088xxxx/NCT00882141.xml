    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypotheses that there are ethnic and genetic&#xD;
      differences in the mechanisms and magnitude by which hypocaloric weight loss and aerobic&#xD;
      exercise affect body composition, glucose, lipid, muscle and adipose tissue metabolism in&#xD;
      overweight, insulin resistant postmenopausal women. This will be tested in a trial comparing&#xD;
      the effects of weight loss vs. aerobic exercise plus weight loss on glucose, lipid, fat and&#xD;
      muscle metabolism in overweight African American and Caucasian postmenopausal women.&#xD;

      The findings of this study will also determine whether there are racial differences in the&#xD;
      whole body and cellular mechanisms by which aerobic exercise training and weight loss affect&#xD;
      glucose, lipid, fat and muscle metabolism in African-American vs. Caucasian postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. The results also may provide a rationale for targeting specific populations of women&#xD;
      who might improve glucose, lipid, fat and muscle metabolism more from the addition of&#xD;
      exercise to dietary restriction than weight loss alone to reduce their risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol consists of the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1-Recruitment and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2-Weight and dietary stabilization for 4-6 weeks, where participants are taught the&#xD;
      principles of the American Heart Association &quot;Heart Healthy&quot; diet and provided food to&#xD;
      consume prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3-Participants will undergo research testing including glucose clamp and fat biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4-Participants select either weight loss only, or exercise plus weight loss. The&#xD;
      behavior diet modification weight loss sessions are held by a registered dietitian for 1 hour&#xD;
      once a week for 6-9 months where the recommended caloric intake for each participant is&#xD;
      adjusted by the dietitian to elicit a weight loss of approximately 0.2-0.4 kg per week. In&#xD;
      addition to the weight loss sessions, participants who select the aerobic exercise plus&#xD;
      weight loss intervention will exercise at the Baltimore Geriatric Research Education and&#xD;
      Clinical Center (GRECC) exercise facility 3 times a week for 6-9 months using treadmills and&#xD;
      other aerobic exercise equipment. Exercise sessions begin at low levels of VO2max (maximal&#xD;
      oxygen consumption) and progress in duration and intensity until the participant is able to&#xD;
      exercise at more than 75% VO2max for 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5-Following the 6-9 months of long-term weight loss or exercise plus weight loss, all&#xD;
      participants will undergo long-term metabolic testing.&#xD;
