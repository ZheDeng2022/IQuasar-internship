      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The brain needs sleep to function normally, but the purpose of sleep is not understood.&#xD;
           Brain activity decreases during sleep, so it may be that sleep is important to maintain,&#xD;
           repair, or reorganize brain cells. In animals, the formation of brain proteins increases&#xD;
           during sleep, and the same thing may happen in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is also evidence that learning and memory are helped by sleep, and that the&#xD;
           synthesis of proteins in the brain are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the formation of proteins in the brain while people are awake, deprived of&#xD;
           sleep, and during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look at the formation of proteins in the brain while awake or asleep and following&#xD;
           learning a task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 28 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers must not have psychiatric, neurologic, or sleep disorders or certain types of&#xD;
           vision problems, and must be able to undergo imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part I (protein formation in waking, sleep deprivation, and sleep):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear an actigraph (a unit to record motor activity) for 2 weeks prior&#xD;
           to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have physical and psychological examinations, along with a blood&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After admission participants will have three positron emission tomography (PET) scans to&#xD;
           study protein formation and one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan over the course of&#xD;
           two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to stay awake for as long as 20 hours and will be monitored&#xD;
           throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be able to sleep overnight after they complete the required scans and&#xD;
           monitoring, and will be discharged the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part II (protein formation in waking and sleep combined with a learning task):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear an actigraph (a unit to record motor activity) for 2 weeks prior&#xD;
           to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have physical and psychological examinations, along with a blood&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After admission participants may be asked to stay awake for as long as 20 hours and will&#xD;
           be monitored throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next morning, participants will be trained to perform a computerized visual&#xD;
           discrimination task, and will be tested 8 hours later (after sleep or after remaining&#xD;
           awake) on the visual discrimination task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have PET and MRI scans as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be able to sleep overnight after they complete the required tests and&#xD;
           scans, and will be discharged the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive financial compensation for their participation in these&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The importance of sleep is widely appreciated, but the actual function of sleep remains&#xD;
      unknown. Sleep occurs in much of the animal kingdom, in all mammals and birds and even in&#xD;
      some lower forms. Sleep deprivation impairs brain function, and in rats, total sleep&#xD;
      deprivation for 2-3 weeks results in death. One hypothesized role of sleep is for restoration&#xD;
      and reorganization of neuronal circuits. There is some indirect evidence that during sleep,&#xD;
      when cerebral energy requirements are reduced, cell resources are diverted to protein&#xD;
      synthesis for the restoration of structure and function. The objectives of the present study&#xD;
      are: 1) to further define the relationship between regional rates of cerebral protein&#xD;
      synthesis (rCPS) and sleep and 2) to ascertain whether sleep-dependent visual learning during&#xD;
      slow wave sleep (SWS) results in increases in rCPS in the primary visual cortex. We propose&#xD;
      to use a novel positron emission tomography (PET)-based technique to quantify regional rates&#xD;
      of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in young, adult, healthy volunteers. The first objective&#xD;
      will be addressed in Part I in which we will study each subject under the following three&#xD;
      conditions: 1) awake and sleep-sated, 2) awake and sleep-deprived, and 3) during SWS after&#xD;
      sleep-deprivation. Our aim is to complete fully successful studies in 15 subjects. The second&#xD;
      objective will be addressed in Part II in which we will assess the relationship between rCPS&#xD;
      and sleep-dependent visual learning on a retinotopically specific task. Each participant will&#xD;
      serve as his own control by comparing the trained primary visual cortex hemisphere with the&#xD;
      untrained hemisphere to which comparable visual information is presented but without&#xD;
      learning. In Part II we will study two groups of subjects: 1) One group will be studied&#xD;
      during SWS following the training session; 2) The second group will be studied at the same&#xD;
      interval following the training session but awake. Subjects will be monitored with&#xD;
      polysomnography to identify the stages of sleep. Our aim in part II is to complete fully&#xD;
      successful studies in 15 subjects in each of the two groups. We anticipate that the results&#xD;
      of Part I will identify changes in rCPS in specific brain regions which are characteristic of&#xD;
      SWS and results of Part II may reveal relationships between rCPS and memory consolidation&#xD;
      during SWS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy male and female volunteers who have no present or past diagnosis of neurologic,&#xD;
        medical or psychiatric conditions which may confound either learning trails, normal sleep&#xD;
        patterns or the ability to undergo sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy male and female subjects, 18-28 years of age, who do not meet any exclusion&#xD;
        criteria, with self-reported normal sleep patterns (i.e., 6-9 h per night) and no major&#xD;
        sleep disruptions during the four weeks prior to evaluation will be considered for&#xD;
        inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDE A HISTORY OF, OR CURRENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. chronic medical condition which is a contraindication for PET or MRI scanning,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. past or present diagnosis of psychiatric conditions (DSM-IV criteria) (many conditions&#xD;
             (e.g. depression), may confound performance on learning trails or be associated with&#xD;
             baseline sleep abnormalities),&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. chronic/degenerative/acquired neurologic disorder, (4) family history of genetically&#xD;
             transmissible neurologic disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
        (5) sleep disorders or medical conditions associated with chronically disordered sleep&#xD;
        which may confound performance on learning trails or interfere with the sleep requirements&#xD;
        of this study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        (6) visual impairments which may confound performance on learning trails,&#xD;
&#xD;
        (7) claustrophobic subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        (8) subjects who meet the above inclusion criteria, but are unable to cooperate with the&#xD;
        requirements of the study (e.g. refusal to wear actigraphs or maintain 10 hours time in&#xD;
        bed, reported difficulty sleeping away from home or on their backs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        (9) Subjects with chronic indicated or non-indicated use of any medications which interfere&#xD;
        with sleep architecture and/or learning trails will be excluded. Generally, we will&#xD;
        prohibit the use of medications/agents (e.g. anti-histamines, benadryl, melatonin,&#xD;
        cigarettes, chocolate, coffee, tea, caffeine drinks etc.), which have significant CNS&#xD;
        penetration, are alerting, and/or disrupt physiologic sleep-wake cycles or sleep&#xD;
        architecture, for the 72 hrs immediately preceding presentation for the study. To&#xD;
        acclimatize subjects, we will encourage patients to discontinue or minimize the use of&#xD;
        these agents/medications (e.g. less than or equal to 1 cup of coffee/day) at the time of&#xD;
        initial screening (at the same time as actigraphy application, approximately 2 wks prior to&#xD;
        the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Similarly, we ask subjects to minimize alcohol use for the 2 wks prior to the study and&#xD;
        will discontinue alcohol use for the 72 hrs immediately preceding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (10) Subjects who have used illicit drugs (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, etc.) within the&#xD;
        immediate 2 wks preceding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (11) Female subjects will be excluded if either clinical history is suspicious for, or&#xD;
        laboratory evaluation is consistent with pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (12) Subjects unwilling to undergo HIV testing, unless enrolling in Part IIa of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (13) Subjects who test HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (14) Patients with para- and/or ferro-magnetic prosthesis/implants/fragments in their body&#xD;
        will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
