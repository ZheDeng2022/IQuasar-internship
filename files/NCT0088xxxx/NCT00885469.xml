      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PillCam™ ESO-2 will demonstrate equivalent accuracy parameters as compared to blinded&#xD;
           esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in detecting suspected Barrett's esophagus, detecting&#xD;
           and grading esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PillCam™ ESO will demonstrate all safety parameters as compared to EGD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PillCam™ ESO-2 will demonstrate better patient's satisfaction as compared to EGD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper endoscopy (EGD) is employed to diagnose BE; however, the cost and invasiveness of this&#xD;
      diagnostic tool limits its utilization in many patients (17). There is a need for an&#xD;
      alternative, simple, and less invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating GERD patients and&#xD;
      screening for BE. Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is a novel technique that offers&#xD;
      non-invasive evaluation of esophageal pathology in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&#xD;
      patients. The potential benefits of screening patients by Capsule Endoscopy (CE) are several.&#xD;
      Detection of esophageal pathology during CE could select a subgroup of patients for upper&#xD;
      endoscopy avoiding the risks and costs of an upper endoscopy in the majority. Other benefits&#xD;
      include convenience, ability to perform the test on an outpatient basis in less than 30&#xD;
      minutes, patient acceptability, minimal loss of work time, safety, tolerability, the ability&#xD;
      of non-physicians to screen patients, and potentially, improved compliance with screening&#xD;
      recommendations. Recently, a new, high resolution capsule (ESO 2) with a larger field of view&#xD;
      and better illumination than the previous CE has been introduced. A simplified ingestion&#xD;
      protocol for CE that improves visualization of the Z-line has also been reported as well&#xD;
      (17).&#xD;
