      The purpose of this study is to assess whether therapy with Sorafenib reinduces radioiodine&#xD;
      uptake in thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with radioiodine (RaI) is the only curative therapy in non-medullary thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma. RaI uptake is frequently lost in this disease. Therapy with tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors may restore the susceptibility to RaI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sorafenib will increase the&#xD;
      accumulation of radioiodine (RaI) and decrease tumor progression in patients with recurrences&#xD;
      or metastases of non-medullary thyroid carcinoma with absent or insufficient accumulation of&#xD;
      RaI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, open study with patients with recurrences or metastases of differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid carcinoma who will undergo 6 months therapy with Sorafenib 800 mg/day. Patients in&#xD;
      whom RaI uptake will be restored will be offered high dose (6000 MBq) RaI together with an&#xD;
      additional 6 months treatment with Sorafenib. Patients in whom RaI is not be restored but in&#xD;
      whom Sorafenib had a favorable effect on tumor growth will be offered continued treatment&#xD;
      with Sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients will be included with recurrences or metastases of differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma that are unresponsive to RaI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, patients will undergo 131I scintigraphy as well as a CT scan. Thereafter,&#xD;
      therapy with Sorafenib 800 mg/day will be initiated, and continued during 6 months. After 6&#xD;
      months, 131I scintigraphy and CT scans will be repeated. Serum levels of thyroglobulin will&#xD;
      be used as tumormarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients with a favorable response to&#xD;
      Sorafenib defined as ONE OR MORE of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reinduction of RaI uptake by RaI scintigraphy: The appearance of one or more RaI&#xD;
           accumulating lesions at RaI scintigraphy, planar images and/or SPECT (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum thyroglobulin levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The absence of progression: no statistically significant positive slope at linear&#xD;
           regression of the log-transformed serum Tg levels, measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24&#xD;
           and 28 weeks after start of Sorafenib:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stable disease: The slope at linear regression of the log-transformed serum Tg&#xD;
                levels, measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks after start of Sorafenib&#xD;
                is not significantly different from 0 ln ug/L*time OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response: The slope at linear regression of the log-transformed serum Tg levels is&#xD;
                negative (statistically significantly below 0 ln ug/L*time).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CT Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of progression according to RECIST criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable disease-neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor&#xD;
           sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest&#xD;
           sum longest diameter since the treatment started.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial response-at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target&#xD;
           lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete response: the disappearance of all target lesions&#xD;
