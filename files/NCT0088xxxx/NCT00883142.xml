  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with neurological deficiencies such as those who have spinal cord injury, stroke,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis often lose their ability&#xD;
      to ambulate over ground. Loss of functional mobility not only impedes everyday life, but may&#xD;
      also affect many systems and organs in the body. The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      obtaining a wide variety of data in order to obtain a better understanding of changes that&#xD;
      occur as a result of receiving Lokomat therapy. The investigators will be studying body&#xD;
      composition, cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, and molecular changes after a 12-week&#xD;
      clinical therapy program.&#xD;

      Description of the Clinical Lokomat Therapy program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12-week program with 3 to 5 sessions per week. Each session includes: 15-20 minutes&#xD;
      of patient set-up (set-up time becomes about 5 to 10 minutes after a few sessions), 5-10&#xD;
      minutes of warm-up, 20-40 minutes of Lokomat therapy, 5-10 minutes of cool-down, and 5-10&#xD;
      minutes to remove the patient from the system. During the Lokomat sessions, heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure are monitored by the therapist and recorded. Work performed is measured and&#xD;
      recorded in the Lokomat computer for time, speed, amount of weight bearing, and distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Research Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre and post, prospective study design will be employed. Baseline measurements (Please see&#xD;
      below and Table 1 for detailed descriptions) will be performed prior to start of the Lokomat&#xD;
      therapy program and then again after completion of the 12-week program. A chart review will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline only for documentation of medical history and medications. In a&#xD;
      subset of patients a muscle biopsy will be performed for gene expression at baseline and week&#xD;
      12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of Clinical Care, during each of the Lokomat therapy sessions the following&#xD;
      information is collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Work (total time, speed, distance, amount of weight bearing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart rate (HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood Pressure (SBP, DBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perception of exertion (Borg Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lipid profile (pre and post)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Albumin (pre and post)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Research purposes the following is being proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review and record work, HR, BP, Borg Scale from all clinical sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Week 12 measurements (performed on a separate days or prior to the sessions):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting energy expenditure (REE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Body Composition [dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) ) - [scans include total body,&#xD;
           dual femur, and the knee], partial body potassium counting (PBKleg), bioelectrical&#xD;
           impedance analysis (BIA), anthropometric and skin fold measurements]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fasting blood draw for plasma glucose and insulin (FPG, FPI), lipid profile,&#xD;
           testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),&#xD;
           bone markers, coagulation factors, platelet aggregation, 2 hour standard oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance testing (OGTT) with insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Autonomic and blood pressure regulation studies [resting and tilt table provocation, for&#xD;
           heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV, BPV), arterial blood flow, and venous&#xD;
           occlusion]&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disability-specific quality of life (QOL) and activities of daily living surveys&#xD;
           [GI-Bowel survey, brief pain inventory (BPI), fatigue survey, spasticity scale, mini&#xD;
           mental status exam (MMSE)]. These disease-specific QOLs will include the question &quot;How&#xD;
           do you rate your general health and well-being over the past week?&quot; A Lickert scale&#xD;
           response will be incorporated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Functional Mobility Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Muscle biopsy for gene expression (subset of patients only).&#xD;
