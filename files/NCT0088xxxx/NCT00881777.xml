    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and potential effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      surgical procedure for treating heart failure. The experimental treatment is performed during&#xD;
      standard coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and applies radiofrequency energy to&#xD;
      heat a portion of the damaged heart muscle. The tissue heating reduces the enlarged heart of&#xD;
      patients suffering from ischemic heart failure, and may result in the heart pumping blood&#xD;
      more efficiently, thereby improving the functional status of the patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is an important health-care problem, resulting in significant numbers of&#xD;
      patients, hospitalizations, and economic costs. The etiology of heart failure is coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in approximately two-thirds of cases, and the majority of these patients have&#xD;
      experienced prior myocardial infarction. As a consequence of the myocardial infarction, the&#xD;
      ventricle undergoes changes in volume and shape, a process referred to as &quot;ventricular&#xD;
      remodeling&quot;. As the left ventricle enlarges, global systolic function worsens, resulting in&#xD;
      heart failure. There are a number of treatment options available to minimize symptoms and&#xD;
      somewhat slow disease progression. Unfortunately, even with best conventional drug and device&#xD;
      therapies, heart failure patients continue to have high morbidity and mortality rates. The&#xD;
      experimental therapy investigated in this study uses a surgical device which employs&#xD;
      radiofrequency energy to heat epicardial tissue. The application of heat to a myocardial&#xD;
      infarction scar causes it to shrink in size, and correspondingly reduces ventricular volume.&#xD;
      The volume reduction may &quot;reverse remodel&quot; the enlarged and dysfunctioning left ventricle to&#xD;
      a more normal size and shape. The intent of this clinical study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      radiofrequency heating of the myocardial infarct scar is safe, and determine if the resulting&#xD;
      ventricular volume reduction translates into improved clinical and functional outcomes in&#xD;
      patients suffering from ischemic heart failure.&#xD;
