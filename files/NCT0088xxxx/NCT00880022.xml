      No studies have tested the potential benefit of the Flexitouch® truncal/chest garments on&#xD;
      reducing truncal lymphedema in breast cancer survivors (BCS) or the theoretical added benefit&#xD;
      of applying truncal/chest pneumatic compression therapy to open lymph channels in individuals&#xD;
      who have only limb lymphedema or its impact on the trunk/chest. The purpose of this two-part&#xD;
      study is to fill gaps related to: 1) the impact of the Flexitouch® System on truncal&#xD;
      lymphedema, and 2) the therapeutic benefit of truncal /chest pneumatic compression therapy&#xD;
      for arm lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part One: BCS with arm and truncal lymphedema. H1: Arm swelling (as measured by bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance &amp; arm girth in cm) will be reduced after 10 sessions with the Flexitouch® System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Truncal swelling (as measured circumferentially) will be reduced after 10 sessions with&#xD;
      the Flexitouch® System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The number, severity, and intensity, of physical and psychological symptoms (as measured&#xD;
      by the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Scale: Trunk and Arm) will be reduced after&#xD;
      10 sessions with the Flexitouch® System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Functional assessment scores (as measured by the Functional Assessment Screening&#xD;
      Questionnaire [FASQ] will improve after 10 sessions with the Flexitouch® System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part Two: BCS with Arm Lymphedema H1: Arm volume (as measured by bioelectrical impedance &amp;&#xD;
      arm girth in cm) will be significantly reduced after one month of home use in participants&#xD;
      using the Flexitouch® System (truncal, chest, and arm compression) when compared to those&#xD;
      using the Flexitouch® System (arm compression only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Truncal measurements/volume (as measured circumferentially) will be less after one month&#xD;
      of home use with the Flexitouch® System (truncal, chest, and arm compression) when compared&#xD;
      to those using the Flexitouch® System (arm compression only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The number, severity, and intensity, of physical and psychological symptoms (as measured&#xD;
      by Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Scale - Arm ) will be significantly reduced&#xD;
      after one month of home use with the Flexitouch® System (truncal, chest, and arm garments)&#xD;
      when compared to individuals using the Flexitouch® System (arm compression only) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Functional assessment scores (as measured by the FASQ) will be significantly higher after&#xD;
      one month of home use with the Flexitouch® System (truncal, chest, and arm garments) when&#xD;
      compared to individuals using the Flexitouch® System (arm compression only).&#xD;

      Screening Procedures This study will have a three-phase screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened either in person or via the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the person being interviewed is eligible and interested, study staff will obtain phone&#xD;
      consent for a brief interview to obtain basic medical and treatment information and to share&#xD;
      this information with the study doctor, who will write prescriptions for treatment based upon&#xD;
      these data. After a prescription is obtained, study staff will contact participants by phone&#xD;
      and schedule the on-site visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Three:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the Vanderbilt University for measurement of arms and truncal&#xD;
      assessment. Phase Three Screening informed consent will be obtained prior to any&#xD;
      measurements. These measurements will serve as baseline entry into the study for those who&#xD;
      meet criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Interview All Participants: Once written informed consent is obtained, study staff&#xD;
      will interview the participants to obtain demographic and treatment (lymphedema and breast&#xD;
      cancer) history. Participants will complete symptom and quality of life forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part One Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a total of 10 treatments, one hour per day for 10 days&#xD;
      consecutively. Treatment One will be conducted under study staff supervision at VUSN or other&#xD;
      Vanderbilt location. Treatments Two through Ten will be self-administered, at home, as this&#xD;
      is an FDA approved at-home self-care device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will make an at home visit for Treatment Two in order to observe the application&#xD;
      and use of the device and to measure the participant's trunk and arms and examine arm and&#xD;
      trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Treatment One Observation and Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Assessment/Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will visually examine the affected and unaffected arms and truncal areas&#xD;
           (collarbone to navel and small of back).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to sit at their dining table with arms extended to the side&#xD;
           at shoulder height at shoulder level. A non-flexible tape will be used to measure girth&#xD;
           at the metacarpal shaft of the hand and then, starting at the ulnar styloid, in 10 cm&#xD;
           intervals to the shoulder. Each arm will be measured 2 times and the average used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will then measure the trunk twice at five locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During bioimpedance: Study staff will assist the patient onto a bed or sofa and measure&#xD;
           arm volume using bioelectrical impedance. Participants will be placed in a supine&#xD;
           position with legs not touching one another. An alcohol pad will be used to prep each&#xD;
           wrist next to the joint, the dorsal surface of each hand (1 cm proximal to the middle&#xD;
           knuckle), and the dorsal surface of one foot (1 cm proximal to the joint of the second&#xD;
           toe). These areas will be allowed to dry and lightly adhesive electrodes will be&#xD;
           applied. Measurement of affected and unaffected arms will be conducted as directed by&#xD;
           the computer software in each impedance device. This measurement will take less than&#xD;
           five minutes. The leads and electrodes will then be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will weigh the participant twice and record the average.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the treatment session, study staff will again measure the arms and trunk&#xD;
           of the participant. Using the same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff will observe for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants going to restroom, removing any compression garments, constrictive&#xD;
           clothing/undergarments or foot coverings they are wearing, and to removing any jewelry&#xD;
           prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants changing into scrub suits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of treatment record checklist to set dials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants resting in a supine position during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate placement of garments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressures will be set at manufacturers recommended levels of compression using program&#xD;
           UEO1/U1 and standard pressure (not intense pressure) only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active time on the device approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of treatment record checklist after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff will correct any errors noted and educate as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Visits (Between Treatment 5 and 6 (+ or - 1 treatment), and within 72 hrs after&#xD;
      Treatment 10, Exit from Study):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Assessment/Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will visually examine the affected and unaffected arms and truncal areas&#xD;
           (collarbone to navel and small of back) and document findings on the Skin Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to sit at their dining table with arms extended to the side&#xD;
           at shoulder height at shoulder level. A non-flexible tape will be used to measure girth&#xD;
           at the metacarpal shaft of the hand and then, starting at the ulnar styloid, in 10 cm&#xD;
           intervals to the shoulder. Each arm will be measured 2 times and the average used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will then measure the trunk at the five locations. During bioimpedance:&#xD;
           Study staff will assist the patient to lay flat on a bed or sofa and staff will measure&#xD;
           arm volume using bioelectrical impedance. Participants will be placed in a supine&#xD;
           position with legs not touching one another. An alcohol pad will be used to prep each&#xD;
           wrist next to the joint, the dorsal surface of each hand (1 cm proximal to the middle&#xD;
           knuckle), and the dorsal surface of one foot (1 cm proximal to the joint of the second&#xD;
           toe). These areas will be allowed to dry and lightly adhesive electrodes will be&#xD;
           applied. Measurement of affected and unaffected arms will be conducted as directed by&#xD;
           the computer software in each impedance device. This measurement will take less than&#xD;
           five minutes. The leads and electrodes will then be removed .&#xD;

&#xD;
      Dosage and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a total of 30 treatments lasting up to approximately one hour per&#xD;
      day for 30 days. Treatment One will be provided under study staff supervision . Treatments&#xD;
      Two through Thirty will be self-administered, at home, as this is an FDA approved at-home&#xD;
      self-care device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Initial On-Site Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Assessment/Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to void (for comfort during procedure), to remove any&#xD;
           compression garments, constrictive clothing/undergarments, or foot coverings they are&#xD;
           wearing, and to remove any jewelry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to change into scrub suits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have their height (using a portable stadiometer) and weight (using a&#xD;
           Pro-fit Electronic Scales) measured twice and the average will be recorded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will review the procedure in the manual for self-administration of the&#xD;
           device and ask for participants to demonstrate their ability to apply the device and use&#xD;
           the appropriate settings. Participants will view a video about the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will apply the Flexitouch® System garments (actual garment to be placed&#xD;
           will be determined by randomization to experimental or control group) over and scrubs in&#xD;
           the arm and trunk areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will rest supine on the massage table with their head on a pillow, if&#xD;
           necessary, during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects randomized to the Experimental Group: Pressures will be set at&#xD;
           manufacturers recommended levels of compression using the standard upper extremity&#xD;
           program (UEO1/U1) and standard pressure (not intense pressure) only. Active time on the&#xD;
           device will be approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects randomized to the Control Group: pressures will be set at manufacturers&#xD;
           recommended levels of compression using program for arm compression only (UE04/U4),&#xD;
           chest will not receive compression, and standard (not intense pressure) only. Active&#xD;
           treatment time for Group B patients will be approximately 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will remain present during the treatment. Should a participant experience&#xD;
           discomfort or request to stop the treatment, study staff will immediately turn off the&#xD;
           device and remove the garments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the treatment session study staff will measure the arms and trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trunk will be measured twice using a non-flexible tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectrical Impedance: Study staff will assist the patient onto a non-metal massage&#xD;
           table covered with clean linen and staff will measure arm volume using bioelectrical&#xD;
           impedance. Participants will be placed in a supine position with legs not touching one&#xD;
           another. An alcohol pad will be used to prep each wrist next to the joint, the dorsal&#xD;
           surface of each hand (1 cm proximal to the middle knuckle), and the dorsal surface of&#xD;
           one foot (1 cm proximal to the joint of the second toe). These areas will be allowed to&#xD;
           dry and lightly adhesive electrodes will be applied. Measurement of affected and&#xD;
           unaffected arms will be conducted as directed by the computer software in each impedance&#xD;
           device. The leads and electrodes will then be removed and cleaned with an alcohol pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circumferential: With arms extended to the side and at shoulder level, a non-flexible&#xD;
           tape will be used to measure girth at the metacarpal shaft of the hand and then,&#xD;
           starting at the ulnar styloid, in 10 cm intervals to the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Visits (After Treatment 14 (+or- 2 treatments) and within 72 hours after&#xD;
      Treatment 30 (Exit from Study) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant opts to come to Vanderbilt the measurement procedures for arms and weight&#xD;
      will be the same as in the first onsite. If the visit takes place at-home the following&#xD;
      procedures a will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Assessment/Measurement:&#xD;

           (Attachment C form 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to sit at their dining table with arms extended to the side&#xD;
           at shoulder height. A non-flexible tape will be used to measure girth at the metacarpal&#xD;
           shaft of the hand and then, starting at the ulnar styloid, in 10 cm intervals to the&#xD;
           shoulder. Each arm will be measured 2 times and the average used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will then measure the trunk at the five locations noted on Attachment C form&#xD;
           11. Study staff will assist the patient onto a non-metal massage table covered with&#xD;
           clean linen and staff will measure arm volume using bioelectrical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During bioimpedance: Study staff will ask the patient to lay flat on a bed or sofa and&#xD;
           staff will measure arm volume using bioelectrical impedance. Participants will be placed&#xD;
           in a supine position with legs not touching one another. An alcohol pad will be used to&#xD;
           prep each wrist next to the joint, the dorsal surface of each hand (1 cm proximal to the&#xD;
           middle knuckle), and the dorsal surface of one foot (1 cm proximal to the joint of the&#xD;
           second toe). These areas will be allowed to dry and lightly adhesive electrodes will be&#xD;
           applied. Measurement of affected and unaffected arms will be conducted as directed by&#xD;
           the computer software in each impedance device. This measurement will take less than&#xD;
           five minutes. The leads and electrodes will then be removed .&#xD;
