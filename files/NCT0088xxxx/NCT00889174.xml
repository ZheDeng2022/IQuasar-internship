      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A leukodystrophy is a disease affecting the white matter of the brain. The white matter&#xD;
      conducts electricity from one part of the brain to the other. If the insulation, or myelin,&#xD;
      is damaged, the brain s electrical pathways will not work properly. Researchers are trying to&#xD;
      identify what causes leukodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect detailed clinical characterizations, including histories, physical&#xD;
           examinations, biochemical tests, genetic studies, and neurophysiologic and neuroimaging&#xD;
           studies in patients with unclassified leukodystrophies to comprehensively characterize&#xD;
           such patients and obtain comparative clinical profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect detailed clinical characterizations, including histories, physical&#xD;
           examinations, biochemical tests, genomic and proteomic tissue, and neurophysiologic and&#xD;
           neuroimaging studies in patients with known leukodystrophies to investigate the&#xD;
           underlying pathogenesis of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand leukodystrophies of unknown cause and to identify the part of the&#xD;
           DNA of the patient with leukodystrophy that is causing the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any individual with a known or suspected leukodystrophy is eligible to participate in&#xD;
           this protocol, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with white matter disease that is unclassified or of unknown cause,&#xD;
                including but not limited to leukoencephalopathies with calcifications,&#xD;
                leukoencephalopathies with cysts, leukoencephalopathies with hypomyelination, and&#xD;
                leukoencephalopathies with brainstem involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parents or siblings of these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria include patients too ill to travel to the Clinical Center and&#xD;
           patients for whom the leukoencephalopathy is felt to be secondary to an acquired cause&#xD;
           (for example, traumatic or infectious).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be seen either as an inpatient or outpatient depending on the tests that&#xD;
           are planned. Patients may need to stay at the Clinical Center for 3 to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests will be conducted as part of standard clinical care:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical and neurological examinations, including blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Magnetic resonance based studies to produce a picture of the patient s brain (under&#xD;
                general anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Spinal tap to measure chemicals in the spinal fluid (under general anesthesia in&#xD;
                young children).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nerve biopsy, if the peripheral nerves are affected, or muscle biopsy, if the cells&#xD;
                called the mitochondria or the muscles are involved (both under general&#xD;
                anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following studies may be performed as part of participation in the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood, urine, spinal fluid, or muscle to understand the proteins, DNA, and&#xD;
                molecules in these tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skin biopsy to grow (in culture) skin cells and to analyze the skin&#xD;
                microscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DNA studies to find new genes responsible for leukodystrophies and to better&#xD;
                understand these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation should be based on an interest to help further the research on&#xD;
           leukodystrophies. Specific information about a patient s present or future health risks&#xD;
           may not be gained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic white matter disorders (leukodystrophies) are estimated to have an incidence of&#xD;
      1:5000 live births. As many as 50% of patients with white matter disease remain undiagnosed&#xD;
      after conventional neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic testing, and therefore have&#xD;
      unclassified leukodystrophies. Moreover, the mechanisms of disease in many leukodystrophies&#xD;
      of known cause are very poorly understood: many are systemic abnormalities that manifest only&#xD;
      in white matter. The purpose of this study is to: (a) define novel homogeneous groups of&#xD;
      patients with leukodystrophy and work toward finding the cause of these disorders and (b)&#xD;
      establish disease mechanisms in selected classified leukodystrophies. In order to achieve&#xD;
      these goals, patients with leukodystrophy will be analyzed by clinical, neurophysiological,&#xD;
      biochemical and genetic means. For goal (a), patients would have been diagnosed as having an&#xD;
      unclassified leukodystrophy or no known cause of their leukodystrophy at outside centers. At&#xD;
      the Clinical Center, such patients will undergo a series of neuropsychological, blood, urine,&#xD;
      spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue pathological tests. Some of these tests&#xD;
      will be part of a standard battery while others will be tailored to individual patients. For&#xD;
      goal (b), selected leukodystrophies with a defined genetic cause will be selected for further&#xD;
      mechanistic study, using clinical and laboratory tools to establish increased understanding&#xD;
      of the underlying pathophysiology. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify the&#xD;
      nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these diseases.&#xD;
