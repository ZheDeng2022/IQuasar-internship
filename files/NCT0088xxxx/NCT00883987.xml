  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty percent of Canadians experience low back pain (LBP) at some point in their life&#xD;
      (Waddell, 1987), with a point prevalence of up to 30 percent (O'Sullivan, 2005; Waddell,&#xD;
      1987). Low back pain has severe economic ramifications. Most incidents of low back pain occur&#xD;
      during the prime working years of life, with an estimated cost to the economy at $14,744&#xD;
      Canadian dollars per person per year (Health Canada, 1998). Indirect costs in the form of&#xD;
      long-term disability were highest for disorders of arthritis and chronic back pain (Health&#xD;
      Canada, 1998). It has been estimated that 12 percent of patients will experience disability&#xD;
      within one year after their first episode of low back pain (Banner, 2006). Evidence based&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment is important for desirable outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that there will be changes in A) trunk muscle electromyographic&#xD;
      patterns and in temporo-spatial gait patterns following osteopathic treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has outlined trunk muscle activation patterns in patients with LBP are different&#xD;
      from those who do not suffer from low back pain (Clarke-Davidson and Hubley-Kozey, 2005;&#xD;
      Hodges, 1996 and 1997; McGill, 2001 and 2002). Osteopathic research has documented the&#xD;
      effects of osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) on EMG activity in patients with low back&#xD;
      pain (Beckman, Harrington, Dostert, et al., 1991; Ellestad, Nagle, Boesler, et al.,1988;&#xD;
      Krpan, Harrington, Beckman, 1992; Steiner, Park, Guzels, 1991) however these studies were&#xD;
      limited in design and methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a controlled trial which measured levels of cellular enzymes to monitor tissue damage&#xD;
      during OMT, blood serum enzyme levels did not change as a result of manipulation. More&#xD;
      important, EMG levels decreased. OMT did not damage tissue but changed motor neuron activity&#xD;
      (Rowane, Horner, Warner, et al., 1989). Beckman, et al., (1991) observed a reduction in EMG&#xD;
      activity following OMT in patients with low back pain and found increased skin blood flow as&#xD;
      measured by laser doppler flow meter. Steiner et al. (1991), reveal reduction to muscle spasm&#xD;
      as measured by EMG in patients with low back pain following OMT. A further study (Ellestad,&#xD;
      et al., 1988) noted decreased EMG activity during motion in patients with chronic low back&#xD;
      pain. Thus there is preliminary work providing support for reduced EMG activity following OMT&#xD;
      within low back pain treatment groups. However there is a need for further research in this&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to determine the role of manual therapy (osteopathy) in the management of gait&#xD;
      dysfunction in this patient population. Patients with LBP present with reduced gait speed,&#xD;
      poor thoraco-pelvic coordination and increased erector spinae activity (Lamoth et al. 2002&#xD;
      and 2006), altered weight bearing (Ellen Lee et al., 2007) and reduced single leg stance&#xD;
      balance in static conditions (Louto et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced thoraco-pelvic coordination leads to muscular stabilizing effects, altered&#xD;
      kinematics, trunk rigidity, and reduced walking velocity (Lamoth et al., 2002). Specific&#xD;
      impairments of body structure and function can reduce gait speed in older adults (Kerrigan,&#xD;
      Todd, Della Cruce, 1998). Osteopathic intervention targets movement impairments of body&#xD;
      structure and should change gait speed in patients with chronic LBP. Mal-alignment&#xD;
      contributes to pathology in the pelvis and lumbar spine which can lead to degenerative&#xD;
      changes, instability and pain (Aebi, 2005; Gurney, 2002; Steinburg, Luger, Arbel, et al.,&#xD;
      2003). The focus of osteopathy is to restore mobility and alignment throughout the whole&#xD;
      kinetic chain (Kutchera and Kutchera, 1991; Seffinger, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in gait speed and joint motion is shown after mobilization exercises to the ankle&#xD;
      and hip in the elderly (Christiansen, 2003). A kinetic relationship links the ankle and&#xD;
      pelvis (Gurney, 2002; Khamis &amp; Yizhar, 2007; Pinto, Souza, Tede, et al., 2008).&#xD;
      Cephalo-caudal (pelvis affects ankle), caudal-cephalo (ankle affects pelvis) and&#xD;
      ipsilateral-contralateral (one leg affects the other via the pelvis) alignment and kinematic&#xD;
      relationships occur when lower extremity joints are maintained in altered positions (Pinto,&#xD;
      et al., 2008). Can movement dysfunction secondary to impaired mobility and mal-alignment&#xD;
      contribute to pain and antalgic gait?&#xD;
