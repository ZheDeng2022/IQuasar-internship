      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the secretion of glucose, insulin, glucagon,&#xD;
      C-peptide and lipid profile after isocaloric diets with different nutritional compounds (fat,&#xD;
      protein and carbohydrate food) in drug näive tipo 2 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that there is a progressive deterioration in beta-cell function over time in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (DM2), as indicated by the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study),&#xD;
      regardless of therapy allocation, albeit conventional (mainly diet), insulin, chlorpropamide,&#xD;
      glibenclamide or metformin treatment. Moreover, the pancreatic islet function was found to be&#xD;
      about 50% of normal at the time of diagnosis, independent of the degree of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, with the reduction in function probably commencing 10-12 years prior to diagnosis&#xD;
      and aggravated by increasing fasting plasma glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal metabolic control, especially early intensive glycemic control, plays a role in the&#xD;
      prevention of progressive beta cell dysfunction and possibly destruction of the betacells&#xD;
      with worsening of diabetes. Many reports have shown that induction of normoglycemia in DM2&#xD;
      results in both improved beta cell function and insulin resistance.The major therapeutic&#xD;
      drawback using native GLP-1 is its very short half-life of less than 2 minutes, following&#xD;
      exogenous administration, as previously indicated due in part to the protease DDP-IV a&#xD;
      result, preventing the degradation of native GLP-1 by inhibiting the active of the DDP-IV&#xD;
      enzyme has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing endogenous GLP-1 action in&#xD;
      vivo.Considering that, sitagliptin is the first FDA and ANVISA authorized dipeptidyl&#xD;
      peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor for diabetes treatment and considering the lack of data about&#xD;
      DPP-IV inhibitor effect over glucose, glucagon, insulin, C -peptide and fats after isocaloric&#xD;
      diets with different nutritional composition in drug näive patients with type 2 diabetes, we&#xD;
      designed this study.&#xD;

    <description>This arm will begin taking the placebo by a month, after a month will be tested the diets (the same caloric amount with different composition on fat, protein and carbohydrates)making curves of insulin, glucagon, C peptide and glp 1 and lipid when diets are tested (three acute tests with diets). After that, the patient will begin the drug by month (Januvia, 100 mg a day)and repeat all the three curves using the prepared diets to compare with the first month.</description>
