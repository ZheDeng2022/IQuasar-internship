      Phase: Exploratory Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To collect drug bio-distribution data, begin collection of baseline and&#xD;
      tumor/background imaging data, acquire experience to improve study design and the conduct of&#xD;
      future studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Exploratory, open label, nonrandomized, multi-center study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Three visits - one screening, one imaging, and one follow-up visit at 24 hours&#xD;
      post-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Informed consent, collection of demographic information and medical history,&#xD;
      physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, routine blood tests to assess major organ&#xD;
      functions, complete blood counts and clinical chemistries for safety, blood sample for CA-IX&#xD;
      assay, pre-dose and post-dose blood samples for metabolite analysis, dosing with&#xD;
      [F-18]VM4-037, PET imaging scan, dosimetry estimation (normals), urine collections (normals),&#xD;
      tumor immunohistochemistry with CA-IX biomarker, follow up to imaging to collect adverse&#xD;
      events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Approximately sixteen (16) adult subjects including four (4) healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      twelve (12) cancer subjects who have confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of head &amp; neck,&#xD;
      lung, large solitary hepatic and renal cell cancer, as defined by protocol criteria&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [F-18]VM4-037 is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMI is seeking to determine if [F-18]VM4-037 might be useful as a PET ligand for the in vivo&#xD;
      imaging of CA-IX levels in human tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA-IX is a very active enzyme which may acidify the extracellular microenvironment of tumor&#xD;
      cells in response to hypoxia. Its expression usually promotes tumor growth and invasion, and&#xD;
      thus impairs prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VM4-037 presents no known risks from either in vitro study in cell lines or in vivo study in&#xD;
      animals according to in-house preclinical investigations of this compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied consists of a total of approximately sixteen (16) adult&#xD;
      subjects, which includes four normal, healthy volunteers and twelve cancer subjects with a&#xD;
      confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      large solitary hepatic carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma as defined by the protocol&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial trial will be an Exploratory, Phase 0 study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      biodistribution, collect baseline and tumor/background imaging data, and gather preliminary&#xD;
      safety data for this investigational product. The study results will be analyzed and&#xD;
      considered in the design of future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain information on the bio-distribution of [F-18]VM4-037, to evaluate the PET images&#xD;
           of [F-18]VM4-037 for resolution and signal to background ratio for tumors, and to&#xD;
           determine CA-IX expression in tumor tissues by CA-IX antibody with immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect safety data, and to use this eIND in order to obtain the necessary&#xD;
           information to file an IND (Investigational New Drug) application with the FDA (Food and&#xD;
           Drug Administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives for this exploratory study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To begin collection of baseline imaging and metabolism data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain information to improve study design for the conduct of future trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is expected to begin subject enrolment in approximately April, 2009 and end subject&#xD;
      participation in approximately September, 2009, depending on the rate of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is expected to attend three visits, adding up to several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Product (IP) being tested in this study is [F-18]VM4-037. The&#xD;
      [F-18]VM4-037 will be administered to each qualified subject via a bolus intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      injection. For normal volunteers, the dose will not exceed 20 mCi, as the imaging time for&#xD;
      dosimetry is a minimum of four hours. For cancer subjects, the dose will be closer to 10 mCi&#xD;
      (total imaging time for cancer subjects is about 2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures for this study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtain Informed Consent, Assign Study Subject Number, Obtain Medical History, Perform&#xD;
      Eligibility Blood Labs, Take Pre-Dose Blood Sample for CA-IX Test, Perform Pre-Dose ECG,&#xD;
      Monitor and Collect Adverse Events, Collect Concomitant Medications, Perform Pre-Dose&#xD;
      Physical Exam, Perform Pre-Dose ECG, Insert IV Line, Take Pre-Dose CBC and Chemistry Blood&#xD;
      Labs, Take Pre-Dose Blood Sample for Metabolite Analysis (if applicable), Take Pregnancy Test&#xD;
      (if applicable), Take Pre-Dose Vital Signs, Prepare and Administer IP, Perform [F-18]VM4-037&#xD;
      PET Imaging, Take Post-Dose Blood Samples for Metabolite Analysis (if applicable), Take&#xD;
      Post-Dose Vital Signs, Perform Post-dose ECGs, Collect Urine Sample and Count for Dosimetry&#xD;
      (normal only), Monitor Adverse Events, Collect Concomitant Medications, Perform Physical Exam&#xD;
      24 hr Post-Dose, Take Blood Sample for CBC and Chemistry Labs 24 hr Post-Dose, Perform ECG 24&#xD;
      hr Post-Dose, Take Vital Signs 24 hr Post-Dose, Monitor and Collect Adverse Events, Collect&#xD;
