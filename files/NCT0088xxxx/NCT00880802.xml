      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following items will be prospectively assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), high&#xD;
           sensitivity-cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI) provides improved diagnostic accuracy for ACS&#xD;
           (including Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and/or Unstable Angina (UA)) within the&#xD;
           first two (2) hours after emergency department presentation when compared to currently&#xD;
           available troponin assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved&#xD;
           prognostic information with regard to 180 day event rates of Major Adverse Cardiac Event&#xD;
           outcomes, including cardiac deaths which are defined as all deaths except those that are&#xD;
           clearly non-cardiac in nature (e.g. trauma), when compared to a currently available&#xD;
           troponin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, using the rate of rise of&#xD;
           hs-cTnI over time between presentation and 2 hours (delta hs-cTnI) allows for the&#xD;
           differentiation between ACS and other disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved&#xD;
           sensitivity for detecting AMI within the first two (2) hours after presentation when&#xD;
           compared to a currently available troponin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved&#xD;
           negative predictive value for ruling out ACS (AMI or UA) within the first 2 hours after&#xD;
           presentation when compared to a currently available troponin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For alternative endpoints of cardiac mortality, and for alternative censor time points&#xD;
           of 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year, hs-cTnI provides improved prognostic information when&#xD;
           compared to the currently available troponin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In cases where the emergency physician has limited diagnostic confidence, hs-cTnI AMI&#xD;
           diagnostic accuracy will be superior to local hospital standards for AMI determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In cases where the emergency physician has limited diagnostic confidence, the slope for&#xD;
           the hs-cTnI between presentation and 2 hours will add diagnostic accuracy for ACS&#xD;
           diagnosis over and above local hospital standards for ACS determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, the difference in diagnostic&#xD;
           accuracy for ACS (including AMI and/or UA) using hs-cTnI measurement from time of onset&#xD;
           of symptoms to emergency department presentation (e.g. 3 hours instead of 6 hours) will&#xD;
           be evaluated to assess any variation.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the ability of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay&#xD;
      to detect and to rule-out high-risk ischemic cardiac injury in emergency room patients&#xD;
      experiencing signs and symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is still the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      industrialized nations. In the U.S., there are nearly 100 million adults who suffer from&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Over 5 million patients present to emergency departments (EDs)&#xD;
      annually with a chief complaint consistent with ACS. A majority of these patients are found&#xD;
      to be experiencing non-cardiac chest pain (about 70-82% of patients). Myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI, including non-ST-segment elevation MI [NSTEMIs = about 6-10% of patients] and ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation MI [STEMIs = about 2-5% of patients]) occurs in about 8-15% of these patients.&#xD;
      Unstable angina (UA), which is often a precursor condition to MI, accounts for 10-15% of&#xD;
      patients. Together, MI plus UA combine to define ACS (= about 18-30% patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI is caused by rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery, leading to&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and thrombus formation to an extent that oxygenation of the myocardial&#xD;
      tissue is completely interrupted (i.e., total occlusion), with the occurrence of some degree&#xD;
      of myocardial necrosis. High concentrations of cardiac enzymes and proteins (e.g., cardiac&#xD;
      troponin I or T [cTnI or cTnT], CK-MB, myoglobin) are observed in blood as the result of&#xD;
      significant irreversible injury to cardiac tissue distal to the site of rupture and secondary&#xD;
      to arterial occlusion. Current assays can detect STEMIs and NSTEMIs but, by definition of the&#xD;
      2007 AHA/ACC updated guidelines for NSTEMI and UA, the NSTEMI threshold is defined as the&#xD;
      99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] of a cardiac troponin (cTn) assay's reference&#xD;
      range in a healthy subject population, and they cannot detect what is currently labeled&#xD;
      &quot;unstable angina (UA)&quot; or ischemia without necrosis. In addition, it typically takes 4-6&#xD;
      hours, after ischemic symptoms begin, for the cardiac troponin to rise above the current&#xD;
      commercial assay NSTEMI threshold (i.e., the upper reference limit [URL] = the 99th&#xD;
      percentile upper reference limit). These issues expose a sensitivity problem with current&#xD;
      generation cTn assays, including the most sensitive tests available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UA is also associated with plaque rupture but only partial coronary artery occlusion occurs,&#xD;
      resulting in ischemic pain but no (or unmeasureable) necrosis. No rise is observable in&#xD;
      cardiac marker levels on currently available assays (best limit of detection [LOD] of ~0.01&#xD;
      ng/mL [10 pg/mL] and best URL of ~0.03 ng/mL [30 pg/mL]). Since there is no test currently&#xD;
      available that accurately diagnoses UA, many UA patients are discharged home in the midst of&#xD;
      a high-risk ischemic event. (Note: Ischemia modified albumin [IMA] is on the market but is&#xD;
      not widely used due to its poor specificity.) The negative predictive value of the diagnostic&#xD;
      test is important in this regard, as increases in sensitivity may be offset if there are also&#xD;
      increases in false positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As many as 2% (30,000 patients) to 4% (60,000 pts) of patients with MI or UA (~750,000 MI&#xD;
      patients + ~750,000 UA patients = ~1.5 million total patients at risk) are inadvertently&#xD;
      discharged from the ED with an associated short-term mortality of 10% to 26% (Duseja and&#xD;
      Feldman 2004). Missed acute cardiac ischemia is one of the major causes of malpractice&#xD;
      litigation against emergency physicians (Duseja and Feldman 2004). Even though chest pain&#xD;
      (and other symptoms consistent with ACS) patients represent only 6% of the ED patient volume,&#xD;
      it has been estimated that 20% of ED-related malpractice dollars are expended for ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease complications (Rusnak, et al 1989). Therefore, the misdiagnosis of ischemic&#xD;
      cardiac injury is of great importance from a human-life and economic perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the typical hospital ED today, cardiac biomarkers are drawn and the results are back to&#xD;
      the ED physician within about 1.5 hours (i.e., therapeutic turnaround time [TTAT]; &quot;vein to&#xD;
      brain&quot; time). Some hospitals have moved to point-of-care devices (with relatively low&#xD;
      sensitivity [URL = 0.080 ng/mL]) that can give results within 10-15 minutes and, on the other&#xD;
      extreme, some EDs that are still dependent on the central laboratory have a therapeutic&#xD;
      turnaround time of 2-4 hours. Most chest pain patients that continue to have discomfort and&#xD;
      other cardiac symptoms are held in the ED or chest pain (observation) unit for 6 to 23 hours,&#xD;
      before discharge, allowing serial cardiac markers to be drawn. Therefore, keeping these time&#xD;
      points in mind, a highly sensitive (e.g., URL = 0.003 ng/mL) and precise cTn assay (e.g.,&#xD;
      &lt;20-30%CV) that takes &lt; 1 hour to give a result may be very useful for any hospital ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time is important but, in the case of ischemic heart disease, accurate information is more&#xD;
      important and is potentially life-saving. The information that the assay would give to the ED&#xD;
      physician would allow for accurate diagnosis of what is currently labeled &quot;UA&quot; and not&#xD;
      discharge a patient who actually requires close monitoring, treatment, or follow-up at a&#xD;
      cardiologist's office. Also, the diagnosis of an MI could be made much earlier (with high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity) than the 4-6 hours after ED presentation that it takes for cTn&#xD;
      to be detected by current assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With no cardiac marker assay available that can diagnose &quot;UA&quot; with appropriate accuracy and&#xD;
      precision, development of a cost-effective, timely (&lt; 1 hr assay time) cardiac troponin assay&#xD;
      that allows accurate measurement of cTn at concentrations that are 10-100 fold below the best&#xD;
      of the current assays' detection limits has the potential to improve ACS patient care. It&#xD;
      will allow diagnosis of ischemic injury in &quot;UA&quot; patients in the ED so they can be admitted&#xD;
      appropriately to the hospital instead of being sent home to experience a possible cardiac&#xD;
      event or death. With current therapeutic capabilities (e.g., LMWHs, beta-blockers,&#xD;
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, other anti-platelet agents) that are known to lower the&#xD;
      risk of future cardiac events and mortality, it can be expected that the earlier detection of&#xD;
      MI and diagnosis of &quot;UA&quot; may lead to reductions in morbidity and mortality in ACS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for a highly sensitive assay for cardiac troponin is predicated on the observation&#xD;
      that the URL of the true reference range in nominally healthy subjects is significantly below&#xD;
      the concentrations that current assays can measure. A new nanoparticle-based, highly&#xD;
      sensitive cTnI assay (i.e., nano-assay) appears to offer a significant technological&#xD;
      advantage over the current macroparticle-based, sensitive assays. The new highly sensitive&#xD;
      assay's LOD is ~800 fg/mL (800 fg/mL = 0.8 pg/mL = 0.0008 ng/mL) for cardiac troponin I, as&#xD;
      compared to 10 pg/mL (0.010 ng/mL) for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market.&#xD;
      The new assay has an imprecision (%CV), at the LOD, of &lt;20-30%, as compared to &gt;&gt;30% at the&#xD;
      LOD for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market. The URL of the reference range&#xD;
      in healthy subjects for the new assay is about 2.8 pg/mL (0.0028 ng/mL), compared to 30 pg/mL&#xD;
      (0.030 ng/mL) for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market. Under these&#xD;
      differences in analytical performance, it is likely that the majority of patients with what&#xD;
      is currently labeled &quot;UA&quot; will reveal detectable troponin concentrations that exceed the&#xD;
      nano-assay's threshold limit (i.e., 2.8 pg/mL = 0.0028 ng/mL) on the nanoparticle-based,&#xD;
      highly sensitive cTnI assay but non-detectable levels of troponin on the current&#xD;
      macroparticle-based, sensitive cTnI assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study, banked serial serum samples of ten NSTEMI patients from the Hospital of the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania ED were evaluated on a research version of the nano-assay. These&#xD;
      serial samples were &quot;troponin-negative&quot; on an older laboratory assay (laboratory assay URL =&#xD;
      0.6 ng/mL = 600pg/mL) for the first 1-3 blood draws. Samples from these patients at&#xD;
      presentation, 90min, and 180min were measured by a current sensitive assay (Siemens [Dade&#xD;
      Behring] Stratus CS) sensitive assay URL = 0.070ng/mL = 70pg/mL) and by the experimental&#xD;
      highly sensitive assay (highly sensitive assay URL=0.0028 ng/mL = 2.8 pg/mL). None (0%), two&#xD;
      (20%), and ten (100%) of the ten NSTEMI patients were found to be cTnI positive at&#xD;
      presentation on the laboratory, sensitive, and highly sensitive assays, respectively. All 10&#xD;
      patients measured at &gt;35pg/mL on the highly sensitive assay at presentation. Three of the&#xD;
      patients remained &quot;cTnI negative&quot; for &gt;180 min on the current sensitive assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another research study, samples from 100 chest pain patients with known ACS (i.e., 50&#xD;
      NSTEMI and 50 &quot;UA&quot; patients) were evaluated. Comparison was made between the laboratory&#xD;
      device and the highly sensitive nano-assay with a URL of 0.0028 ng/mL (2.8 pg/mL). Using the&#xD;
      current laboratory assay (Siemens [Dade Behring] Dimension; URL = 0.100 ng/mL = 100 pg/mL),&#xD;
      the 50 NSTEMI patients were cTnI negative on the first draw, and the 50 &quot;UA&quot; patients were&#xD;
      cTnI negative throughout their stay in the ED and/or hospital. At presentation (t = 0 hrs), 7&#xD;
      hrs, and 24 hrs, none (0%) of the &quot;UA&quot; patients were found to be positive for cTnI on the&#xD;
      laboratory instrument. Using the nano-assay with the same &quot;UA&quot; patients' serum samples, 48%,&#xD;
      64%, and 82% were positive for cTnI at presentation, 2 hrs, and 7 hrs, respectively. For the&#xD;
      NSTEMI patients at presentation (t = 0 hrs), 7 hrs, and 24 hrs, none (0%), 56%, and 98%,&#xD;
      respectively, of the patients were found to be positive for cTnI on the laboratory&#xD;
      instrument. Using the nano-assay with the same NSTEMI patients' serum, 76%, 98%, and 100%&#xD;
      were positive for cTnI at presentation, 2 hrs, and 7 hrs, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary results demonstrate the potential strength of this highly sensitive cTnI&#xD;
      assay to reveal an abnormal [cTnI] at ED presentation that may progress to MI (i.e., NSTEMI&#xD;
      or STEMI) and to detect acute ischemic insult that may not progress to MI (i.e., &quot;UA&quot;). This&#xD;
      high sensitivity protein assay may enhance the clinical utility of testing for ACS in the ED&#xD;
      and other cardiac care settings (e.g., earlier detection leading to directed therapies,&#xD;
      improve risk stratification, earlier rule-out of non-cardiac-related chest pain [NCCP],&#xD;
      detection of re-infarction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of myocardial infarction used in this study will be the meaning that was&#xD;
      recently updated and published in the November 27, 2007 issue of Circulation (Thygesen, et al&#xD;
      2007). Page 18 of this study protocol contains this definition. The definition is based on&#xD;
      cardiac troponin as the biomarker of choice with any value above the 99th percentile of an&#xD;
      assay's reference range population considered abnormal. Therefore, if the nano-assay's URL is&#xD;
      much lower than the current assay's URL, all values that are above the nano-assay's URL but&#xD;
      below the current assay's URL that were considered &quot;UA&quot; on the current assay should now be&#xD;
      considered myocardial infarction when measured on the nano-assay. This may result in the &quot;UA&quot;&#xD;
      category being removed as an ACS categorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also recent studies (Zethelius, et al 2006; Waxman, et al 2006) that show very low&#xD;
      cTnI values (&lt;30-40 pg/mL) can predict future cardiac events and mortality in the&#xD;
      asymptomatic elderly male population (&gt;70 years) and in symptomatic ED patients with cTnI&#xD;
      levels that remain in the reference (normal) ranges of current assays. A highly sensitive&#xD;
      assay that could detect &quot;silent&quot; cardiac damage in these cTnI ranges in the cardiologist's&#xD;
      office and ED settings could be a predictor of future risk that could direct appropriate&#xD;
      therapeutics and preventative care.&#xD;
