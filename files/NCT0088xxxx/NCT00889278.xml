      The purpose of this study is to determine if higher absolute lymphocyte count in the infused&#xD;
      stem cell autograft (A-ALC) will lead to an improved antibody response to post-transplant&#xD;
      immunization with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and permit effective immunization at 6&#xD;
      months post-transplant in lymphoma patients receiving Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation.&#xD;

      Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who receive&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation&#xD;
      (APBSCT). Infectious disease complications of transplantation might be reduced by effective&#xD;
      post-transplant immunization but reconstitution of the immune system may take months to years&#xD;
      after transplantation and responses to immunization are often attenuated in this setting.&#xD;
      Correlates of improved immune reconstitution and response to immunization after&#xD;
      transplantation would be important to identify. It has been recently shown that higher&#xD;
      absolute lymphocyte count in the infused stem cell autograft (A-ALC) and higher ALC at day&#xD;
      +15 after stem cell infusion (ALC-15) are independently associated with improved overall&#xD;
      survival after APBSCT. The mechanism of this association is unclear, but this finding&#xD;
      suggests that improved immune responses to immunization might also be achieved with this&#xD;
      approach making it possible to immunize at 6 months instead of at one year. This hypothesis&#xD;
      has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival following APBSCT is improved with a higher A-ALC and ALC-15. It is postulated that&#xD;
      the higher lymphocyte numbers correlate with improved immune surveillance and destruction of&#xD;
      minimal residual disease. Thus, one must consider the probability higher A-ALC will confer&#xD;
      improved response to T-cell dependent immunization early after transplant.&#xD;
