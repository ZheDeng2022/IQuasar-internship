      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone when&#xD;
      given together with sunitinib malate in treating patients with progressive advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and toxicity profile of ixabepilone in combination with&#xD;
           sunitinib malate in patients with progressive, advanced non-hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of ixabepilone given weekly versus once every&#xD;
           three weeks in combination with a fixed dose of sunitinib malate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the combination of ixabepilone and sunitinib&#xD;
           malate and correlate them with activity and/or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary efficacy data (complete response, partial response, or stable&#xD;
           disease) of these treatment combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate changes in angiogenesis biomarkers with clinical (safety and efficacy) and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic parameters in patients treated with these drug combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the optimal biological dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ixabepilone. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedule A: Patients receive ixabepilone IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning on day 8 of&#xD;
           course 1, patients also receive oral sunitinib malate once daily. Courses repeat every&#xD;
           28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedule B: Patients receive ixabepilone IV on day 1. Beginning on day 8 of course 1,&#xD;
           patients also receive oral sunitinib malate once daily. Courses repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker and pharmacokinetic studies by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days and every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
