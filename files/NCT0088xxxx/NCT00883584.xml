  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a lung disease in which the lung is damaged, making it hard to breathe. In COPD, the&#xD;
      airways/tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs are partly obstructed, making it&#xD;
      difficult to get air in and out. COPD gets gradually worse over time. At the moment there is&#xD;
      no cure for COPD. The best way to slow the disease is to stop smoking. Current medications&#xD;
      are used to alleviate shortness of breath and cough, and to treat infections of the lungs&#xD;
      that can worsen COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institute of Medicinal Molecular Design, Inc. (IMMD), a Japanese Drug Discovery Company is&#xD;
      developing a compound code named IMD-1041. IMD-1041 is an investigational drug, meaning it is&#xD;
      not yet on the market. It is an IKKb inhibitor developed for the treatment of COPD. Unlike&#xD;
      most other medications used for COPD currently, IMD-1041 is in capsule form and needs to be&#xD;
      taken twice a day. It is also unlike all other drugs in use because it treats the underlying&#xD;
      cause of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if IMD-1041 has the ability to reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      derived symptoms and airway remodelling (changes) by looking at certain changes in chemical&#xD;
      levels in the blood and sputum (phlegm).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose level of IMD 1041 has been selected based on previous clinical trials. The dose to&#xD;
      be studied, 400mg, is considered to be efficacious, and is supported by the clinical data in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single oral doses of 800 mg and multiple oral doses of 400 mg twice daily of IMD-1041 have&#xD;
      been shown to be safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice daily doses of 200 mg of IMD-1041 have been shown to be safe and well tolerated when&#xD;
      given to diabetic patients for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo (dummy medication) arm has been selected as it is considered the most reliable&#xD;
      method to minimise patient and investigator bias and current COPD guidelines suggest the most&#xD;
      useful comparison would be with placebo. Exposure placebo will allow a reliable evaluation of&#xD;
      IMD 1041, as well as the adverse events caused by the drug compared to those resulting from&#xD;
      the COPD natural course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be able to remain on the current medications apart from theophylline which&#xD;
      is expected to have effects on IKK beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatments for COPD do not include a medication of this mechanism of action,&#xD;
      who's main aim is to reduce inflammatory and fibrotic changes which cause the symptoms which&#xD;
      current standard COPD medications treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 12-14 weeks, including a 7 day screening period, visit 0&#xD;
      baseline/randomisation visit, visit 1 and visit 3 for all study spec tests, visit 2 and&#xD;
      4/follow up as either a site or telephone contact to check subject compliance and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to selection the Investigator will evaluate the eligibility of patients for entry into&#xD;
      the trial by reviewing the patients' medical records against the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a potential pre-screening visit up to 3 weeks prior to randomisation. This&#xD;
      visit will only be applicable for patients who need to stop the medication theophylline which&#xD;
      need to be stopped 2 weeks prior to screening. At this visit potential patients will be&#xD;
      provided with the information about study activities and requirements. After signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form the patient will be asked to stop the medication and return to the&#xD;
      study site for screening at least 2 weeks after the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will attend the clinical site for initial screening up to 7 days prior to&#xD;
      randomisation. If the patient has not been 'pre-screened' as described above, they will be&#xD;
      given information pertaining to study activities and requirements. After signing the informed&#xD;
      consent form evaluations will be performed to confirm the patients' eligibility according to&#xD;
      the study protocol. The patients' medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing, blood pressure, pregnancy screening (women of child&#xD;
      bearing potential only) will be performed. Blood will be taken for routine clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following successful screening, patients will return to the site up to seven days (but at&#xD;
      least 1 day) after the screening visit for randomisation. There will be a 50:50 chance of the&#xD;
      patient being randomised to either IMD 1041 or placebo of whichever they will remain on for&#xD;
      the duration of the study. The following will then happen prior to randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient asked about current health problems, adverse events and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications since screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitals signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be taken for clinical lab evaluations and biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum for biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 questionnaires completed Following all of the above evaluations the patient will be&#xD;
           randomised and medication dispensed. (A total of 280 tablets will be dispensed, which&#xD;
           equates to 4 weeks supply, plus 56 tablets as spares in case of loss or delayed next&#xD;
           visit.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will occur 4 weeks after visit 0 (+/- 2 days). At this visit the following will&#xD;
      occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient asked about current health problems, adverse events and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications since screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vitals signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be taken for clinical lab evaluations, PK analysis and biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum for biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication will be dispensed. A total of either 4(224) or 8(448) weeks supply will be&#xD;
           dispensed depending on whether or not you will attend the clinical site for visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will occur 4 weeks after visit 1 (+/- 3 days). This visit will be either on site or&#xD;
      over the telephone and will be decided by the Principal Investigator on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
      At this visit the following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient asked about current health problems, adverse events and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications since screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication dispensed. A total of 4 weeks supply (224 tablets) will be dispensed for&#xD;
           patients who attend the site for this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will occur up to 4 weeks after visit 2 (+/- 3 days). At this visit the following will&#xD;
      occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient asked about current health problems, adverse events and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications since screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vitals signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be taken for clinical lab evaluations, PK analysis and biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum for biomarker sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 questionnaires completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All medication return and final accountability documented&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4, the follow up visit will be via telephone and will occur 2 weeks after visit 3 (+/-&#xD;
      3 days). The following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient asked about current health problems, adverse events and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications since screening.&#xD;
