  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurological basis of tinnitus is uncertain when there is no evidence of damage to the&#xD;
      peripheral auditory system. However, neuroimaging studies of tinnitus patients show&#xD;
      hyperactivity in several cortical regions, especially the auditory cortices and middle&#xD;
      temporal regions. A potentially promising treatment modality for tinnitus is repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS involves the application of frequent, repeated&#xD;
      magnetic stimuli to the skull to induce electrical activity in the underlying cortical areas&#xD;
      of the brain. When the magnetic device is placed on the skull, the resultant magnetic field&#xD;
      passes through the skull and induces a small secondary current in the cortex. It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that the effect of the frequency used in rTMS differentially influences cortical&#xD;
      activity with low-frequency (1Hz) stimulation decreasing and high-frequency stimulation&#xD;
      (10-20 Hz) increasing cortical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, reports on treating tinnitus with rTMS have focused on low-frequency stimulation&#xD;
      of the left auditory cortex, an area that has been demonstrated to be hyperactive in&#xD;
      tinnitus. The benefits of low-frequency auditory cortex stimulation are time limited however.&#xD;
      Converging data implicate structures of the brain that are important for mood and attention&#xD;
      as playing a role in the maintenance of tinnitus; suggesting an alternative rTMS treatment&#xD;
      approach that targets these structures. A growing number of studies demonstrate involvement&#xD;
      of the prefrontal cortex in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. rTMS stimulation in&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in association with stimulation in the temporoparietal&#xD;
      cortex has been shown to increase the durability of the TPC stimulation. The independent&#xD;
      effect of rTMS stimulation to the DLPFC is not known. Studies in depression suggest that&#xD;
      increasing the intensity and duration of stimulation has beneficial treatment effects.&#xD;
      However, the field is new and more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment, predictors and correlates of response, and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, we propose an open-label pilot study investigating the effectiveness of rTMS&#xD;
      stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area known to be important for mood and&#xD;
      attention, in the treatment of tinnitus&#xD;
