  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done because we want to learn if hemin can increase the production of&#xD;
      heme oxygenase 1. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an enzyme which protects cells from physical,&#xD;
      chemical, and biologic stress. Hemin is produced from red blood cells and is approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration for treating acute porphyria, which is an inherited condition&#xD;
      caused by an enzyme deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) degrades heme, protects cells against oxidative stress, and is&#xD;
      beneficial in several experimental models but has not been pharmacologically activated in&#xD;
      humans. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of hemin on HO-1 activity&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. Hemin is the most powerful inducer of HO-1. Hemin is FDA-approved to&#xD;
      treat acute intermittent porphyria. In addition, hemin has also been used to treat&#xD;
      thalassemia intermedia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and to control liver allograft failure due&#xD;
      to recurrence of erythropoietic prototheria. Our hypothesis is that compared to placebo,&#xD;
      hemin will increase HO-1 in humans. Ten healthy subjects will be randomized to hemin (n = 5,&#xD;
      Panhematin®, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, 3 mg/kg i.v. in 25% albumin) or placebo (n = 5, 25%&#xD;
      albumin) infusion. HO-1 activity will be assessed before and after (4, 6, 24, and 48 hours)&#xD;
      infusions.&#xD;

    <description>Hemin (Panhematin®, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL) will be administered through a large-caliber peripheral vein at a dose of 1.25 mL/kg and at a rate of 60 mL/hour. To enhance stability, Panhematin® will be diluted in ~ 132 mL of 25% albumin to obtain a hemin concentration of 2.4 mg/mL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Healthy non pregnant not breast feeding, and non-smoking subjects aged 18 - 65 years&#xD;
             old without clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             hematological, neurological, psychiatric or other disease that may interfere with the&#xD;
             objectives of the study and/or pose safety concerns. No symptoms of functional GI&#xD;
             disorder as assessed by a validated questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No medications except for stable doses of oral contraceptives or thyroid&#xD;
             supplementation. Because ascorbic acid can induce HO-1 activity, multivitamins will&#xD;
             need to be discontinued for 1 week before and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No intolerance or allergy to eggs&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to provide written informed consent before participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
