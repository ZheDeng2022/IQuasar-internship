      This is a phase II study to evaluate the effectiveness of study drug sunitinib malate in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinomas of the salivary gland.&#xD;
      There currently is not standard of care for this type of cancer and it has hoped that&#xD;
      sunitinib will have antitumor effects on patients with this type of cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of sunitinib malate in patients with recurrent and/or&#xD;
      metastatic adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of major or minor salivary gland origin. Sunitinib&#xD;
      is a novel, multi-targeted small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),&#xD;
      including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFs), platelet derived growth&#xD;
      factor receptors (PDGFRs) and stem cell factor receptor (KIT), that are involved in tumour&#xD;
      proliferation and angiogenesis. VEGF expression has been associated clinically with disease&#xD;
      prognosis in many different types of cancers and a number of studies have suggested that VEGF&#xD;
      may play an important role in the pathogenicity of ACC. Sunitinib is expected to inhibit&#xD;
      PDGF- and VEGF-driven angiogenesis and, as a consequence, limit solid tumour growth.This&#xD;
      study will determine the anti-tumour activity of sunitinib in ACC of the salivary glands&#xD;
      using objective response rates (partial and complete responses) as its primary objective.&#xD;
