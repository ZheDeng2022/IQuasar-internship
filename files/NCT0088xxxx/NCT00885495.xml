      This is a phase I, open-label, controlled drug interaction study to determine the effects of&#xD;
      darunavir plus ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A&#xD;
      (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in HIV-1-seronegative subjects.&#xD;

      Twelve HIV-negative healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 would&#xD;
      receive rosuvastatin 10mg daily (Treatment A) in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 7 days. In interval 2, darunavir/ritonavir 600/100mg bid (Treatment B)&#xD;
      would be administered for 7 days, followed by another 7 day washout period. Lastly, in&#xD;
      interval 3 subjects will administer darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin (Treatment C) for&#xD;
      total of 7 days. Group 2 will administer Treatment B in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a&#xD;
      washout period of 7 days, then treatment A in interval 2 for 7 days followed by another 7 day&#xD;
      washout period. Group 2 would then co-administer rosuvastatin and darunavir/ritonavir for the&#xD;
      last 7 days. Intensive PK sampling will be performed on day 7, 21 and 35 following a meal.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Absence of HIV-1/HIV-2 infection as documented by a licensed ELISA test kit within 21&#xD;
             days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weight ≥50 kg and a Body Mass Index ([BMI], weight in kg divided by the square of&#xD;
             height in meters) ≥18.0 and ≤ 35.0 kg/m2. Refer to Appendix I.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily before the first trial-related&#xD;
             activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence of any&#xD;
             clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             vital signs, and the results of blood tests and a urinalysis carried out at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine, recreational&#xD;
             or narcotic drug use, which in the investigator's opinion would compromise subject's&#xD;
             safety and/or compliance with the trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Currently active significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic,&#xD;
             psychiatric, metabolic, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, or infectious&#xD;
             disease, that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to&#xD;
             study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Creatinine clearance of ≤ 60mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. eruptions, drug allergies, food allergy, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria,&#xD;
             that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previously demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of&#xD;
             the excipients of the medications administered in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulphonamides and&#xD;
             penicillins. Prezista is a sulphonamide. The potential for cross-sensitivity between&#xD;
             drugs in the sulphonamide class and Prezista in HIV-negative subjects is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of concomitant medication, including investigational, prescription, and&#xD;
             over-the-counter products and dietary supplements with the following exceptions:&#xD;
             aspirin, acetaminophen, anti-histamines such as diphenhydramine, inhalers for asthma,&#xD;
             daily multivitamins, mineral supplements and hormonal oral contraceptives. Concomitant&#xD;
             medication other than those listed above must have been discontinued at least 7 days&#xD;
             before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential without use of effective nonhormonal birth&#xD;
             control methods, or not willing to continue practicing these birth control methods for&#xD;
             at least 30 days after the end of the treatment period; Note: Estrogen-based hormonal&#xD;
             contraception may not be reliable when taking Prezista, therefore to be eligible for&#xD;
             this trial, women of childbearing potential should either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e., using a condom with&#xD;
                  either diaphragm or cervical cap);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  use non-estrogen hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier&#xD;
                  contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  use a intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male&#xD;
                  condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  be not sexually active, or have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women with tubal ligation are required to use one non-hormonal contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women who are postmenopausal for at least 2 years, and women with total hysterectomy&#xD;
             are considered of non-childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A positive pregnancy test or breast feeding at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in an investigational drug trial within 90 days prior to the first&#xD;
             intake of trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Donation of blood or plasma within 60 days preceding the first trial-related blood&#xD;
             drawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the&#xD;
             Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events&#xD;
             (&quot;DAIDS grading table&quot;) and in accordance with the normal ranges of the trial clinical&#xD;
             laboratory:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  platelet count grade 1 or greater (≤ 124.999 x 109/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count grade 1 or greater (≤ 1.3 x 109/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) grade 1 or&#xD;
                  greater (≥ 1.25 x ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x ULN),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any other laboratory abnormality of grade 2 or above&#xD;
