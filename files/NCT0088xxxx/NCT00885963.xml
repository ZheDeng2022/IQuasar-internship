      This is an open label, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral&#xD;
      sapacitabine administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days every week for 2 weeks followed&#xD;
      by 7-day rest in patients who have had one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced Non-Small&#xD;
