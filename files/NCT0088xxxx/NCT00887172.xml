  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common illnesses in primary medical&#xD;
      services but there is no established cure for these conditions in Western medicine. In Hong&#xD;
      Kong, many patients use Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for the treatment of URTIs but there is&#xD;
      little research evidence on their effectiveness or side effects. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      test whether two commonly used Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) formulae guided by Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis will significantly increase recovery rate, and reduce the&#xD;
      duration and/or severity of symptoms, and improve the quality of life of patients with URTIs&#xD;
      in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient consents to take part in the study and is found eligible, he/she will be invited&#xD;
      by the consulting doctor, and then be assessed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner&#xD;
      for whether the illness satisfies the TCM diagnosis of the two major TCM types of URTIs:&#xD;
      Group A (Wind-cold syndrome) and Group B (Wind-heat syndrome). Subjects in Group A (Wind-cold&#xD;
      syndrome) will be randomised to receive the Jing Fan Bai Du san or placebo. Subjects in Group&#xD;
      B (Wind-heat syndrome) will be randomised to receive Ying Qiao san or placebo. Both group A&#xD;
      and B treatments and placebo will be given in sachets of granules that are identical in&#xD;
      appearance. Neither the Chinese medicine practitioner, the recruiting doctors, nor patient&#xD;
      know whether a subject is taking CHM or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      328 subjects (164 in each diagnosis group) will be recruited from patients consulting the Ap&#xD;
      Lei Chau Government General Outpatient clinic for URTIs. Each subject is required to return&#xD;
      to the clinic for follow-up assessment by the Chinese medicine practitioner on day 7&#xD;
      post-treatment and all subjects will be contacted by telephone on Day 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13,15&#xD;
      and 20 after treatment to assess their symptoms and to find out if they have developed any&#xD;
      side effects or adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is any difference in the proportion of subjects who have resolution&#xD;
      of the URTI on Day 7 between the treatment and placebo groups. The secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      are the reduction in the duration and severity of symptoms, quality of life during the&#xD;
      illness and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide scientific evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      commonly used CHM formulae in the treatment of URTIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common diagnoses made in the&#xD;
      primary medical services, which consisted of 34.6% of all diagnoses in Hong Kong. It accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 100 million visits per year in the US. It was estimated that an adult has&#xD;
      an average of 3 to 4 times while children has an average of 6 to 8 times each year. WHO has&#xD;
      pointed out that URTIs have a great impact on personal and economical aspects although they&#xD;
      are rarely lethal It was estimated that 60% of the working class has contracted URTIs each&#xD;
      year, and a loss of 8.8 days of perfect health for each worker on average each year, and a&#xD;
      loss of up to HK$ 31.3 billion of economic output each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no established curative treatment in Western medicine for URTIs except for selected&#xD;
      cases of influenza. Studies have shown that the average duration of illness of an URTI is&#xD;
      around 7 days, and most URTIs resolve by the 10th day. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is&#xD;
      commonly used by people in Hong Kong on its own or along side with Western medicine for the&#xD;
      treatment of URTIs. The Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong was established in September&#xD;
      1999, the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is expected to increase and there is an urgent&#xD;
      need for research evidence on their effectiveness and side effects. TCM follows a theoretical&#xD;
      and methodological pathway, which leads to its diagnosis and treatment. Most URTIs can be&#xD;
      differentiated into two types according to the theory of TCM: Wind-cold syndrome and&#xD;
      Wind-heat syndrome. The theory leads to two classical herbal formulae that are very popular&#xD;
      in Hong Kong: the Jing Fang Bai Du san for treating the Wind-cold syndrome whiles the Ying&#xD;
      Qiao san for treating Wind-heat syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Jing Fang Bai Du san can relieve external symptoms and effectively clear up the&#xD;
      pathogenic cold. It contains 13 herbs including, Radix Angelicae Pubescentis, Radix&#xD;
      Peucedani, Radix Ginseng, Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Fructus Aurantii,&#xD;
      Radix Platycodi, GlycyrrhizaeRadix, Herba Schizonepetae, Fructus Arctii, MenthaeFolium, Radix&#xD;
      Saposhnikoviae, Rhizoma et Radix Notopterygii. Previous clinical studies conducted in China&#xD;
      showed mixed results on the effectiveness of Jing Fang Bai Du san on Wind-cold syndrome. One&#xD;
      study showed that it was no better than no treatment while another study showed that&#xD;
      concentrated granules of Jing Fang Bai Du san was more effective (80%) than Western medicine&#xD;
      (10%) in improving and resolving symptoms of Wind-cold syndrome within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ying Qiao san can relieve external symptoms and effectively clear up the pathogenic heat.&#xD;
      It contains 10 herbs: Fructus Forsythiae, LoniceraeFlos, Radix Platycodi, MenthaeFolium,&#xD;
      GlycyrrhizaeRadix, Herba Schizonepetae, Sojae Semen praeparatum, Fructus Arctii,&#xD;
      PhragmitisRhizoma and LophatheriHerba. From pharmacological studies, it showed&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, anti-bacterial and antiviral actions. A clinical&#xD;
      trial also showed the concentrated granules of Ying Qiao san was more effective (66.13%) than&#xD;
      Western medicine (40%) in resolving the symptoms of Wind-heat syndrome within 1 week. These&#xD;
      two CHM formulae have been used for many years and have not been associated with any serious&#xD;
      adverse reactions. The common side effects are mild diarrhoea and headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are some data from Mainland China suggesting the effectiveness of these two&#xD;
      formulae for URTIs but most of these previous studies were observational and the few clinical&#xD;
      trials were not placebo-controlled and of poor quality. Furthermore, results of trials from&#xD;
      Mainland China may not be generalisable to the people in Hong Kong. Most previous studies on&#xD;
      CHM focused on individual herbs, which is against the TCM principles as pointed out by the&#xD;
      WHO. The WHO recommends that future clinical studies should attempt to integrate TCM&#xD;
      diagnosis pattern with traditional CHM treatments. In this proposed study, the integrated TCM&#xD;
      approach of using traditional formulae of multiple herbs, guided by the TCM diagnosis, will&#xD;
      be used in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
