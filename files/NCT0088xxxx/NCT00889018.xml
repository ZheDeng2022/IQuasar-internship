  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an increase in the dose of carboplatin in&#xD;
      treatment of advanced intraocular (group C and D) retinoblastoma helps in avoiding&#xD;
      radiotherapy and improves the rate of globe salvage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemoreduction has become an important method in management of retinoblastoma. This technique&#xD;
      has been employed in an effort to avoid enucleation and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for&#xD;
      children with intraocular retinoblastoma, especially those with bilateral disease. Although&#xD;
      an ideal regimen for chemoreduction has not been determined, most authors use a combination&#xD;
      of vincristine, etoposide and carboplatin for 2- 6 cycles along with local treatment&#xD;
      including cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermotherapy and plaque radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Chemoreduction along with local treatment has been shown to have high treatment success in&#xD;
      groups A and B of retinoblastoma allowing globe salvage without need of EBRT. But globe&#xD;
      salvage rates remain low in groups C and D, which mostly need enucleation, or EBRT in a large&#xD;
      number of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In bilateral retinoblastoma where one eye is already lost owing to enucleation or both the&#xD;
      eyes have advanced retinoblastoma (group C/D) globe salvage assumes a significant role in the&#xD;
      overall treatment. Recurrences of the vitreous seeds or the sub retinal seeds are the main&#xD;
      causes of treatment failure with chemoreduction and local treatment, ultimately requiring&#xD;
      enucleation or EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence of vitreous or subretinal seeds do not necessarily mean a tumor resistance, it&#xD;
      may reflect an inadequate penetration of the chemotherapeutic agents in these relatively&#xD;
      avascular sites i.e the vitreous cavity or the subretinal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The penetration to these sites could be enhanced by (a) increase in the dose of the&#xD;
      intravenous chemotherapeutic agents. The IInd Toronto protocol that was started in 2000&#xD;
      explores this option. The initial reports are encouraging but they have used high doses&#xD;
      chemotherapy in combination with cyclosporin A. Therefore the effect of high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy on the globe salvage rates in groups C and D cannot be evaluated as an&#xD;
      independent factor. (b) Periocular carboplatin injection has proven to deliver much higher&#xD;
      levels of the drug in to the vitreous cavity, but several studies have revealed local side&#xD;
      effects of this apparently harmless technique.The National Collaborative Retinoblastoma Study&#xD;
      funded by the Children's oncology group plans to carry out a single arm trial of 6 cycles of&#xD;
      systemic high dose chemotherapy and subtenon carboplatin injections in groups C and D of&#xD;
      retinoblastoma. (c) Use of Cryotherapy/thermotherapy along with chemotherapy, has shown to&#xD;
      increase the penetration of the chemotherapeutic agents into the vitreous cavity probably by&#xD;
      disrupting the blood retinal barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shield's et al has already shown that the 6 cycle chemotherapy regimen achieves better&#xD;
      long-term control of vitreous and subretinal seeds as compared to a 2 cycle regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We planned this study to compare two different dose schedules of carboplatin and compare the&#xD;
      rate of globe salvage in group C and D retinoblastoma and also to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      subtenon Carboplatin injections in cases that fail to respond to primary chemotherapy.&#xD;
