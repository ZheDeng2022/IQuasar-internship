    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is associated with hypersensitivity of the central nervous system. The drug&#xD;
      under investigation (tropisetron) has been shown in animal studies to attenuate central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. It has therefore the potential to be effective in chronic pain. We compare&#xD;
      two doses of tropisetron with placebo in patients with chronic pain. We measure pain&#xD;
      intensity and parameters that assess central hypersensitivity.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged afferent nociceptive input induces an increase in the excitability of central&#xD;
      sensory neurons. The hyperexcitable neurons amplify the nociceptive signal, thereby producing&#xD;
      an exaggerated pain response. This state of central hypersensitivity very likely contributes&#xD;
      to pain and disability in patients, even in the presence of limited tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT-3) receptor is involved in spinal nociceptive transmission.&#xD;
      After experimentally induced inflammation, the selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      ondansetron inhibited the electrically evoked responses of dorsal horn neurones, but had no&#xD;
      effect on these responses in the absence of inflammation. Importantly, the origin of this&#xD;
      pathway is a spino-brainstem-spinal loop that includes areas of the brain involved in&#xD;
      emotional and affective responses to pain. This suggests that the 5-HT-3 receptors have no&#xD;
      significant role under normal conditions, but are activated by peripheral inflammation and&#xD;
      contribute to spinal cord hyperexcitability. Their activity could be driven by anxiety and&#xD;
      fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord hyperexcitability elicited by trauma, inflammation or surgery is influenced by&#xD;
      descending facilitatory and inhibitory pathways. The periaqueductal grey and endogenous&#xD;
      opioid peptides play a central role in the inhibition of spinal cord neuronal responses.&#xD;
      Release of enkephalin at supraspinal and spinal levels is evoked by noxious stimulation.&#xD;
      Further inhibitory modulation is exerted by serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. These&#xD;
      mechanisms may underlie a possible role of psychological disturbances in the spinal cord&#xD;
      processing of nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While central hypersensitivity mechanisms have been extensively investigated in the animal,&#xD;
      data in patients are sparse. In patients, direct measurements at spinal cord or brain neurons&#xD;
      can not be made. Therefore, it is impossible to provide direct evidence for neuronal&#xD;
      hyperexcitability. However, hypersensitivity can be investigated indirectly by quantitative&#xD;
      sensory tests. Typically, hypersensitivity is detected when sensory stimulation evokes pain&#xD;
      at stimulus intensities that do not induce pain in normal subjects (lower pain threshold) or&#xD;
      when a standardised painful stimulus evokes stronger pain in patients than in normal&#xD;
      subjects. Other methods to explore the sensory system are available, but a detailed&#xD;
      description is beyond the scope of this section. Whenever pain hypersensitivity is observed&#xD;
      after sensory stimulation of healthy areas, its cause must be a hyperexcitability of the&#xD;
      central nervous system. Indeed, there is no evidence that peripheral mechanisms could account&#xD;
      for a higher pain sensitivity at healthy tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the sensory tests, central hyperexcitability has been detected in different chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as neck pain after whiplash injury, fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and temporomandibular disorders. Objective electrophysiological evidence for&#xD;
      spinal cord hypersensitivity has recently been provided for patients with neck pain after&#xD;
      whiplash injury and in fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few attempts have been made to modulate central hypersensitivity in patients. Infiltration of&#xD;
      the local anaesthetic into the painful and tender muscles of patients with chronic neck pain&#xD;
      did not reduce either neck pain nor pain thresholds. This indicated that the source of pain&#xD;
      was not located in the infiltrated muscles and central hypersensitivity was not maintained by&#xD;
      a nociceptive input arising from these muscles, at least in the patient population&#xD;
      investigated. Selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists have proven effective in patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia. Because fibromyalgia is associated with central hypersensitivity, one can&#xD;
      postulate an activation of the spinal 5-HT-3 system as one of the mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of this pain syndrome. The facilitatory pathway mediated by this receptor&#xD;
      involves parts of the brain associated with emotional and affective responses to pain. An&#xD;
      effect of selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists on other musculoskeletal pain syndromes&#xD;
      associated with central hypersensitivity, such as whiplash or osteoarthritis, can not be&#xD;
      ruled out. In a recent placebo-controlled study, a single intravenous injection of the&#xD;
      selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist Ondansetron produced pain relief in patients with&#xD;
      neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will address the following main hypotheses. A. Reduction in pain and central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity is accomplished by administration of the 5-HT-3 antagonist tropisetron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The analgesic effect of Tropisetron is predicted in individual patients by the&#xD;
      electrophysiological measurements that assess central hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain intensity is assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS). The following measures of&#xD;
      central hypersensitivity will be employed: pain detection and pain tolerance threshold to&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, heat and cold stimulation, spinal nociceptive reflexes, assessment of&#xD;
      reflex receptive fields and temporal summation.&#xD;
