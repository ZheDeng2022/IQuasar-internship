  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MDMA releases dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the brain. Serotonin uptake&#xD;
      inhibitors have been shown to interact with 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and to&#xD;
      decrease its psychoactive and cardiovascular stimulant effects. This finding indicates that&#xD;
      MDMA acts in part by releasing serotonin through the serotonin uptake site. However, in vitro&#xD;
      studies show that MDMA binds more potently to the norepinephrine uptake site that to the the&#xD;
      serotonin or dopamine uptake transporter. In addition, norepinephrine uptake site blockers&#xD;
      such antidepressant drugs attenuate some of the behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. These&#xD;
      preclinical data indicate that norepinephrine may also contribute to the response to MDMA in&#xD;
      humans. To test this hypothesis this study evaluates the interacting effects of the selective&#xD;
      norepinephrine transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the subjective and cardiovascular&#xD;
      stimulant effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a randomized double-blind cross-over design with four experimental&#xD;
      sessions. Reboxetine (8 mg) or placebo will be administered the night before the experimental&#xD;
      session and 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the highly selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine will&#xD;
      attenuate subjective and especially heart rate and blood pressure responses to MDMA. Such a&#xD;
      result would indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in the pharmacology of MDMA&#xD;
      and may provide helpful in the use and development of treatments for Ecstasy intoxications.&#xD;
