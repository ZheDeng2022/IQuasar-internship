  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to perform a safety and dose-determination efficacy&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients having a degree of partial-thickness burn wounds. The trial will&#xD;
      be a prospectively randomized and double-blind trial of ST266 compared with standardized care&#xD;
      using 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) solution in the same three treatment regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I/II multi-center clinical trial will be performed in 99 adults with&#xD;
      partial-thickness burns. Two similar partial-thickness burn areas in a single patient will be&#xD;
      selected. One burn will be randomly assigned to receive either test drug ST266 or normal&#xD;
      saline in one of three treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three treatment arms will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ST266 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different preclinical studies of partial-thickness burns on guinea pigs have demonstrated&#xD;
      accelerated epithelialization with topical treatment with ST266. Similarly, preclinical&#xD;
      studies in Yorkshire pigs have demonstrated more rapid maturity of epithelialization and&#xD;
      better quality healing of partial-thickness skin graft donor sites with ST266 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preclinical studies, ST266 given in a dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 wound area appeared to&#xD;
      saturate the wound adequately without excess and simultaneously improve healing. In&#xD;
      preclinical toxicity studies, the dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 was shown to be safe.&#xD;

    <description>ST266 is a clear liquid containing more than 200 proteins, cytokines, and growth factors in solution. Patients will be treated for 21 days unless both wounds have healed prior to 21 days, at which time a punch biopsy of the epithelialized area of each wound will be performed. A study evaluation visit for assessment of the biopsy site will occur on day 28 or within 7 days of the punch biopsies, whichever occurs first. Six months after the punch biopsy, the patient will return to the burn center for a final examination and photographs of the study wounds.</description>
