  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In persons with SCI, because of inherent considerations, the use of mechanical stimulation&#xD;
      has not been studied to determine improvement in bone mass. To achieve maximum transmission&#xD;
      of the vibration from a vibrating plate to the lower body, the legs must be extended and the&#xD;
      feet firmly placed against the surface plate of the device. Thus, these logistical&#xD;
      considerations must be addressed to perform this mechanical intervention in persons with SCI.&#xD;
      In those with complete or almost complete motor injury, there is lack of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      function below the level of the lesion, which would prevent rigid straight leg extension and&#xD;
      pressing one's feet against a surface, regardless of the angle of tilt that would permit&#xD;
      adequate transmission of impulse in an able-bodied individual (preliminary data). However, in&#xD;
      one subject with SCI, there was measurable, albeit low level, transmission of vibration with&#xD;
      increasing angles of tilt (preliminary data). Because of the ability to transmit some signal&#xD;
      in an individual with complete SCI, the possibility exists that with forms or mechanical&#xD;
      support/manipulation, greater signal transmission may be possible. The study will be able to&#xD;
      determine the best angle to transmit mechanical vibration through the lower body of SCI&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiments will be performed in 12 persons with SCI and 10 healthy able-bodied to optimize&#xD;
      the methodology for transmission of the mechanical impulse to the lower extremities in&#xD;
      persons with SCI. This will entail the following combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. positional modification (sitting, lying or standing if tolerable);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. bracing the knee to prevent flexion/extension;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. bracing the legs above and/or below the knee;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. supporting the ankle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. tilting the surface (tilt table) to a maximum angle of 45 degrees;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Standing with the assistance of a standing frame if subject can tolerate standing for 5&#xD;
           minute time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. increasing the magnitude of the plate acceleration (0.2-0.6g); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. mechanically pressing the legs (ankle and knee joints relatively fixed in position by an&#xD;
           orthotic device) against the plate by a spring-loaded method (it is envisioned that a&#xD;
           padded belt-like article will be worn around the waist and would be attached with bungee&#xD;
           cords (or springs) to each side of the vibrating plate; the maximum force delivered&#xD;
           would be equal to 50 lbs or one-third of total body weight, whichever is less).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An accelerometer for the measurement of impulse generation will be placed on the surface of&#xD;
      the vibrating plate between the feet; a second will be placed on the shin about 4 inches&#xD;
      below the knee (attached with double sided tape and athletic bandage wrap); a third&#xD;
      accelerometer will be placed in the mouth as a bite-bar. Measurements would be acquired with&#xD;
      combinations of body position, joint/leg fixation, magnitude of plate acceleration (&quot;g&quot;&#xD;
      force), and mechanical force pressing the feet against the plate to determine the optimal&#xD;
      transmission of impulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the optimal of the methodology for using the vibrating plate to&#xD;
      transmit an impulse in persons with chronic SCI, with the anticipation of its application to&#xD;
      increase bone mass in individuals with acute or chronic SCI. It is anticipated that each&#xD;
      session will be between 30 and 120 minutes. An individual may voluntarily participate in as&#xD;
      many as 5 sessions. The knowledge gained from the first sets of studies will obviate the need&#xD;
      to perform less effective methods of mechanical signal transmission in subsequent studies. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that once the most effective, as well as clinically applicable, form of&#xD;
      mechanical stimulation is identified, it will be performed in most of the subjects. This&#xD;
      preliminary study will also provide the information required to determine practical aspects&#xD;
      of the length of each session and number of sessions per week in a future intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this research may have adverse effects on an unborn child and should not be done during&#xD;
      pregnancy, we will administer a pregnancy test when appropriate. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      avoid becoming pregnant and use contraceptives, take precautions against becoming pregnant.&#xD;
