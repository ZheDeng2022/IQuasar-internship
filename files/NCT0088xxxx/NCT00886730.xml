      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test two interventions that lead to at&#xD;
      least 30% of individuals with depression presenting to primary care engaging with an&#xD;
      Internet-based depression support group. The investigators will identify primary care&#xD;
      patients with depression who state they have access to the Internet and are willing to&#xD;
      consider treatment for depression. In the primary care office they will be given one of three&#xD;
      interventions introducing them to the Internet depression support group site. The major&#xD;
      outcome will be accessing the depression Internet support group at least once in the&#xD;
      following four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide important information on whether it is possible to&#xD;
      recruit a substantial proportion of primary care patients to engage in a potentially useful&#xD;
      and inexpensive addition to standard depression care. If this is not possible, the likelihood&#xD;
      of successfully completing a RCT of the effectiveness of depression Internet support groups&#xD;
      utilizing primary care patients would be low. Researchers trying to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of depression Internet support groups would have to go to alternative designs such as&#xD;
      recruiting patients with depression as they try to join the depression Internet support&#xD;
      groups and randomizing some to a delay in joining the group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our specific aim is to develop and pilot test two interventions that lead to at least 30% of&#xD;
      individuals with depression presenting to primary care engaging with an Internet-based&#xD;
      depression support group. We will identify primary care patients with depression who state&#xD;
      they have access to the Internet and are willing to consider treatment or are currently in&#xD;
      treatment for depression. In the primary care office they will be given one of three&#xD;
      interventions introducing them to the Internet depression support group site. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to three experimental groups: 1) simple card with only the name of the web&#xD;
      address; 2) 8&quot;x11&quot; paper with screen shots of the Internet site home page, a list of features&#xD;
      provided by the site, and two patient stories describing how the Internet site helped them;&#xD;
      and 3) the 8&quot;x11&quot; announcement (from intervention 2) plus endorsement of the site by the&#xD;
      primary care provider. The last two interventions will also ask patients to provide an email&#xD;
      address so one email reminder can be sent to them. The major outcome will be accessing the&#xD;
      depression Internet support group at least once in the following four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide important information on whether it is possible to&#xD;
      recruit a substantial proportion of primary care patients to engage in a potentially useful&#xD;
      and inexpensive addition to standard depression care. If this is not possible, the likelihood&#xD;
      of successfully completing a RCT of the effectiveness of depression Internet support groups&#xD;
      utilizing primary care patients would be low. Researchers trying to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of depression Internet support groups would have to go to alternative designs such as&#xD;
      recruiting patients with depression as they try to join the depression Internet support&#xD;
      groups and randomizing some to a delay in joining the group. We will also use this study to&#xD;
      learn more about what patient characteristics are associated with engaging with an internet&#xD;
      depression support group. While the focus of this study is Psychobabble, the intent of the&#xD;
      study is to explore ease of referral, predictors of use and participant experiences as may&#xD;
      relate to the general concept of Internet-based social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific AIM 1: We believe that participants randomized to the either that 8 x 11&quot; brochure&#xD;
      or the recommendation by the primary care physician will be more likely to visit and use the&#xD;
      site than those who receive only a recommendation card (50% versus 35% versus 10%). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that greater levels of encouragement/recommendation will be associated with&#xD;
      higher levels of internet site usage. A sample size of 225 (N-110 at University of Chicago&#xD;
      and N=115 at Johns Hopkins) will have power of 0.8 to detect the difference between either&#xD;
      the card group or the brochure or physician recommendation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: We believe that those with higher self-efficacy and greater levels of trust&#xD;
      in their primary care physician will be more likely to visit the site one time. We will&#xD;
      conduct a logistic regression analysis to determine whether base self-efficacy and greater&#xD;
      levels of trust predict use of the internet site after adjusting for group assignment. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that higher levels of self-efficacy and physician trust will be associated with&#xD;
      greater internet site use. Will believe a total N=225 will be sufficient to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between 10 independent variables and the outcome of site usage (&lt;15&#xD;
      cells/variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: We will determine if an internet based social support group is acceptable and&#xD;
      feasible for primary care patients. Specifically, we will evaluate whether the internet site&#xD;
      increased their knowledge of, or motivation for, depression treatment (Change in level of&#xD;
      agreement to with regard to &quot;accepting my doctors diagnosis of depression&quot;, strongly disagree&#xD;
      1, strongly agree 5). We hypothesize that levels of agreement will increase pre to&#xD;
      post-study. A sample size of 225 (N=110 at University of Chicago and N=115 at Johns Hopkins)&#xD;
      will have power of 0.8 to detect the difference of agree (4) pre-study to (5) strongly agree&#xD;
      post study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: We believe that social support and knowledge gained on the internet may&#xD;
      influence subsequent care seeking or coping behaviors. Specifically, we will evaluate whether&#xD;
      they have sought care or adopted coping skills 6 weeks after study entry. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      both these behaviors will increase from pre to post study. A sample size of 225 (N=110 at&#xD;
      University of Chicago and N=115 at Johns Hopkins) will have power of 0.8 to detect the&#xD;
      difference of treatment participation pre-study of 0.4 versus 0.65 post study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: We believe that social support or knowledge gained on the internet site&#xD;
      leading to changed behaviors may results in lower levels of depressed mood. Specifically, we&#xD;
      will compare levels of depressed mood at baseline and at 6 week follow-up. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that their will be modest decline in depressed mood from pre study baseline to post study. A&#xD;
      sample size of 225 (N=110 at University of Chicago and N=115 at Johns Hopkins) will have&#xD;
      power of 0.8 to detect the difference of treatment participation pre study CES-D score of 24&#xD;
      post study score of 20.&#xD;

             treatment for depressed mood,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. does not reject all treatment for depression,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. has not viewed or posted messages more than once in the last month on any Internet&#xD;
             depression support group website,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. does not self-report diagnoses of bipolar disorder by a health professional,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. age 18 years or older,&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. has Internet access for the next four weeks, has been on the Internet at least three&#xD;
             times, and has used email by him/herself. We are slightly lowering the PHQ score from&#xD;
             the usual 10 (cutoff for major depression) to 8 because we know treatment for&#xD;
             depression is frequently initiated for those who do not meet formal criteria for major&#xD;
             depression. However we are only including patients with PHQ scores below the usual&#xD;
             cutoff for major depression if they are currently receiving or are considering some&#xD;
             form of depression treatment. University of Chicago students will need to identify&#xD;
             their primary care provider to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. active bipolar disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. those with no access to the internet,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. those who state they are not under treatment nor would they consider any form of&#xD;
             treatment, OR&#xD;
