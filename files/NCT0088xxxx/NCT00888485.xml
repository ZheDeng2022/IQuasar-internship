    <textblock>
      According to a recent Cochrane report there is little evidence so far that psychological&#xD;
      interventions affected total or cardiac mortality, but had a reduction in the number of&#xD;
      non-fatal recurrent AMI and small effect on anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were recruited among consecutive patients discharged from Uppsala University&#xD;
      Hospital. Inclusion criteria were age 75 years or younger, discharged from the hospital after&#xD;
      a myocardial infarction (AMI) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG), living in the hospital primary catchment area, referred back to the&#xD;
      general practitioner (GP) within one year after the hospital admission, not having previously&#xD;
      participated in similar programs, being Swedish speaking, being willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study, and accepting the random group allocation to be. All subjects fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were informed about the study during the first outpatient visit to the hospital two&#xD;
      weeks after discharge. During a visit to the cardiology outpatient department three months&#xD;
      after discharge the informed subjects were formally invited to participate and verbal&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained, standard requirement at the time. A written invitation letter&#xD;
      to a baseline examination in the study was then mailed to the subjects and those who accepted&#xD;
      the invitation were eventually included. The recruitment period lasted from may 1996 to&#xD;
      august 2001 and the follow-up data collection was completed in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the recruitment period 812 consecutive patients had been considered for&#xD;
      inclusion, of which 302 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, and 148 subjects declined to&#xD;
      participate, in most cases because of long distance from home to the hospital or lack of&#xD;
      time. The remaining 362 subjects (71.0% of eligible cases), 85 (23%) women, 277 (77%) men&#xD;
      gave informed consent to participation, of whom 185 (51.1%) had been admitted for an AMI, 122&#xD;
      (33.7%) for a CABG, and 55 (15.2%) for a PCI. Seventy-one AMI subjects had a PCI performed&#xD;
      during the course of events and three had a CABG. At the time of the study more than 95% of&#xD;
      the Swedish population in these age groups was Caucasians and about 90% were native Swedes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group allocation was based on the SAS &quot;ranuni&quot; function that provides random numbers with&#xD;
      equal probability. The randomization procedure was based on pre-prepared sealed envelopes&#xD;
      with a serial number on the outside and containing a paper sheet with the group allocation on&#xD;
      the front side and a blinding print on the back to eliminate the possibility to read the&#xD;
      group allocation sheet from the outside of the envelope. The envelopes were kept in sorted&#xD;
      ascending serial number order in a safe. After inclusion of a subject the study monitor (the&#xD;
      only person with access to the randomization envelopes and information) drew the next&#xD;
      envelope in order and inserted the allocation paper sheet in the study protocol. Of those&#xD;
      included, 192 were allocated to behavioral intervention and 170 to the reference group. The&#xD;
      included subjects were informed about the group allocation after the baseline measurement.The&#xD;
      subjects received an invitation letter for a first (baseline) examination and a first postal&#xD;
      questionnaire. The procedure was repeated at the 6th, 12th, 18th and 24th month after&#xD;
      baseline. The examination included anthropometry (height, weight and sagittal diameter), and&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement, and blood sampling for blood lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on marital status, educational level, smoking habits, job status (including&#xD;
      retirement or on sick leave), social background and lifestyle factors was obtained by&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gothenburg Quality of Life Instrument, previously validated and used in many studies, was&#xD;
      used to measure quality-of-life aspects. Information on medical history until the baseline&#xD;
      measurement was obtained from the baseline questionnaire. The subjects were asked whether&#xD;
      they had experienced angina pectoris, hypertension, hyperlipemia, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      stroke, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, or asthma/congestive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Responses were given as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital admission data were obtained by linking the study data set to the National Hospital&#xD;
      Discharge Register and the National Cause of Death Register to include non-fatal as well as&#xD;
      fatal events. The record linkage was based on the unique personal identification number (PIN)&#xD;
      given to all Swedish residents at birth or immigration and used in all official registers,&#xD;
      including the population register. The PIN is based on year, month and day of birth, and a&#xD;
      four-digit serial number. The second last serial number digit refers to subject sex and the&#xD;
      last digit is a control digit, by which the correctness of the PIN easily can be checked and&#xD;
      if necessary corrected against the population register. Data from the National Hospital&#xD;
      Discharge Register included all hospital admissions from 1971 until 31 December 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival data were obtained from the Cause of Death Registry, including all deaths in the&#xD;
      study population until 31 December 2006. The overall autopsy rate was 23%, and the autopsy&#xD;
      rate among those who had a first fatal cardiovascular event as outcome in the trial was 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnoses in the Hospital Discharge Register and the Cause of Death Register were coded&#xD;
      according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Cardiovascular disease was&#xD;
      defined as ICD-8 codes (until 1986) and ICD-9 codes (1987-1996) 401-459, and ICD-10 codes&#xD;
      (from 1997 on) I00-I99. Acute myocardial infarction was defined as ICD-8 code 410, ICD-9 code&#xD;
      410, and ICD-10 code I21-I22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data the number of AMIs per subject prior to baseline was identified. In&#xD;
      addition, all death irrespective of its cause, first cardiovascular disease event, fatal or&#xD;
      non-fatal was identified, as well as the first AMI post baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects entered the intervention program within a year after the index coronary event. The&#xD;
      intervention was based on cognitive behavioral therapy focused on stress management aimed to&#xD;
      help CHD patients cope with stress and reduce experience of daily stress, time deadlines and&#xD;
      hostility. For this purpose they were randomized to behavioral intervention or no behavioral&#xD;
      intervention (usual care). The intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), adapted to&#xD;
      CHD patients, was performed in group-sessions, including 5-8 participants, separate groups&#xD;
      for women and men, altogether 20 two-hour sessions per group during one year. An experienced&#xD;
      psychologist, expert in CHD patient CBT, formed a team of trained psychologists and nurses,&#xD;
      and together they performed the sessions. To secure continuity, all groups were treated by&#xD;
      the same group leader. Attendance rate in sessions was monitored and the adherence to the&#xD;
      program was excellent. Median attendance rate was 85%, and less than 5% attended less than&#xD;
      50% of the sessions. The program had specific goals and 5 key components; education,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, skills training, cognitive restructuring and spiritual development.&#xD;
