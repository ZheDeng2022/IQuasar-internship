      The primary goal of this study is to identify factors which may put a person that has used&#xD;
      methamphetamine at greater risk for mental and physical health problems and social problems&#xD;
      and factors that may lessen the risk for these problems. This study will also compare&#xD;
      methamphetamine use between Latino and non-Latino persons and those that live in a rural area&#xD;
      or urban area. The investigators hypothesis is that rural persons with methamphetamine&#xD;
      dependence will have greater socio-demographic, bio-psychosocial and behavioral risk factors&#xD;
      than their urban counterparts.&#xD;

      Methamphetamine (meth) is second only to alcohol as the primary drug of abuse in persons&#xD;
      entering substance use disorders (SUD) treatment in rural Nebraska 1 . The National Survey on&#xD;
      Drug Use and Health 2002-2005 (NSDUH) found meth use increased as the setting became more&#xD;
      rural 2 . In a previous study comparing rural and urban persons with meth use disorders&#xD;
      (MUD), we found significant differences, with rural persons reporting earlier first regular&#xD;
      use of meth, greater meth-related psychotic symptoms, more alcoholism, and more intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) use 3 . No studies have compared frequency of other behavioral risk factors in rural and&#xD;
      urban meth users. Similarly, no studies have compared risk factors for methamphetamine&#xD;
      dependence in this uniquely rural drug use disorder. It is critical that other high risk&#xD;
      behaviors (in addition to IV use) be identified in rural persons with MUD and that risk&#xD;
      factors for MUD be identified as a crucial first step in providing resources to tailor&#xD;
      prevention efforts in rural populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the need for further research on risk factors, scholars have called for more&#xD;
      studies on protective factors to develop more effective intervention programs 4 . Researchers&#xD;
      have identified factors that mitigate negative outcomes among individuals at high risk. In&#xD;
      general, active coping and high levels of social support and empathy have been linked to&#xD;
      better health outcomes whereas avoidance coping and low levels of social support and empathy&#xD;
      have been associated with worse health outcomes 4, 5 . However, no factors have been&#xD;
      identified in rural meth users which are protective for worse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meth distribution has been linked to &quot;Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations&quot; and &quot;Hispanic&#xD;
      polydrug trafficking organizations&quot; 6, 7 , but there is little research examining meth use in&#xD;
      Latinos. In a previous study of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white individuals with MUD,&#xD;
      Hispanics reported less education and more employment problems, 8 but the study did not&#xD;
      address rural MUD. This proposed study of rural and urban Latinos with meth dependence will&#xD;
      provide initial data to begin to inform prevention efforts targeting rural Latinos with MUD&#xD;
      and may be useful in rural Latinos with other SUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our interdisciplinary investigative team proposes to address the following Specific Aims over&#xD;
      a two-year period: 1) compare socio-demographic, bio-psychosocial and behavioral risk and&#xD;
      protective factors between rural and urban persons with methamphetamine dependence (Year&#xD;
      One); 2) identify factors that place persons with methamphetamine dependence at risk for&#xD;
      greater psychopathology and identify factors that mitigate those persons from psychopathology&#xD;
      (Year One); 3) compare severity of methamphetamine dependence between Latino and non-Latino&#xD;
      populations and urban and rural Latino populations (Year Two). Our hypothesis is that rural&#xD;
      persons with methamphetamine dependence will have greater socio-demographic, bio-psychosocial&#xD;
      and behavioral risk factors than their urban counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted populations will be adults with methamphetamine dependence. We will enroll 150&#xD;
      individuals (75 rural and 75 urban) 75 of whom will be Latinos from substance abuse treatment&#xD;
      sites. Data analyses will focus on comparing MUD across urban/rural and Latinos/non-Latinos.&#xD;
      Thus, this study will identify factors which may place rural, urban, Latino, and non-Latino&#xD;
      persons with MUD at greater risk for, or protect them from, psychopathology, infectious&#xD;
      complications, and poorer treatment outcome. The long-term goals of this study are to: a)&#xD;
      provide data that will strengthen a re-submission to the National Institute on Drug Abuse&#xD;
      (Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities,&#xD;
      PAR-07-379 ); b) establish relationships with providers of substance abuse treatment to&#xD;
      Latinos facilitating enrollment of Latinos in future research studies; and c) identify&#xD;
      specific factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies in underserved&#xD;
      populations (e.g. Latinos, rural populations).&#xD;

        This is a study of 150 rural and urban persons in treatment for methamphetamine dependence.&#xD;
        We propose to enroll 150 participants (75 rural and 75 urban) over a two year period. Of&#xD;
        these 150 participants, 75 will be Latino and 75 non-Latino (approximately 37 rural and 37&#xD;
        urban for each group).&#xD;
