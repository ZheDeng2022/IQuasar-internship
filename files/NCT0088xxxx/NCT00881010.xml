  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this psychosocial research study is to learn about treating pain and other&#xD;
      symptoms of minority patients who have breast cancer. The study will test how well a special&#xD;
      telephone system works for improving the pain and symptom management of these patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The special telephone system used in this study calls patients on a regular basis and asks&#xD;
      them to report their symptoms. The patient's doctor or nurse is notified by a page or e-mail&#xD;
      when one or more of these symptoms is severe: pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      drowsiness, sadness, and emotional distress. Researchers want to find out if using the&#xD;
      telephone system is a better way to manage a patient's pain and symptoms than the normal&#xD;
      method, in which the doctor and nurse would simply ask about pain and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete several questionnaires during a visit to the oncology clinic.&#xD;
      These questionnaires measure pain and other symptoms, quality of life, and mood. Completing&#xD;
      the questionnaires takes about 1 hour. These will be completed during your first study visit&#xD;
      (called the &quot;baseline&quot; visit.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a&#xD;
      coin) to receive 1 of 2 treatment plans: telephone intervention or usual care. You have an&#xD;
      equal chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are picked to be in the &quot;telephone intervention&quot; group, the research nurse will teach&#xD;
      you how to use the telephone system for measuring symptoms. The research nurse also will ask&#xD;
      you to practice using the telephone system. The telephone system will call you 2 times a week&#xD;
      for 10 weeks and ask you to rate your pain and other symptoms and how much the symptoms&#xD;
      interfere with your life. You can set up the most convenient times for the telephone calls.&#xD;
      Rating your symptoms using the telephone system takes less than 5 minutes for each call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your symptom information from the telephone system will be given to your doctor and nurse at&#xD;
      M. D. Anderson. The doctor or nurse will be notified right away by page or e-mail when one or&#xD;
      more of these symptoms is severe: pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness,&#xD;
      sadness, and emotional distress. Patients in this group will also receive education from the&#xD;
      telephone system about pain and pain treatments. If for some reason the telephone system is&#xD;
      not working, the research staff will report your severe symptoms to your doctor of nurse, and&#xD;
      give you the education about pain and pain treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the &quot;usual care&quot; group, then you will not be asked to report symptoms&#xD;
      using the telephone system, and your symptom information from the questionnaires will not be&#xD;
      given to your doctor and nurse at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter what group you are assigned to, you will be asked to report all symptoms to your&#xD;
      doctor and nurse during your visits to the oncology clinic. You will also be asked to call&#xD;
      your doctor or nurse when symptoms are severe. The doctors and nurses will give you&#xD;
      instructions about calling when your symptoms are severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to fill out questionnaires during 2 regularly-scheduled clinic visits--at&#xD;
      the visit 4-6 weeks after the study begins and at the visit 8-10 weeks after the study&#xD;
      begins. These questionnaires measure pain and other symptoms, quality of life, and mood.&#xD;
      Completing the questionnaires takes about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to participate in the companion caregiver study, the study staff will use your&#xD;
      demographic and clinical data to study the influence of your symptoms on your caregiver's&#xD;
      physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your total participation in this study will be up to 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 patients will take part in this multicenter study.&#xD;
      About 10 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
