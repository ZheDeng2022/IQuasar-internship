  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called NHL, Multiple Myeloma (MM) or CLL that has come back or&#xD;
      has not gone away after treatment. There is no standard treatment for the cancer at this time&#xD;
      or the currently used treatments do not work completely in all cases like these. This is a&#xD;
      gene transfer research study using special immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells, that investigators hope will work together. Antibodies are types of&#xD;
      proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including&#xD;
      tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they&#xD;
      have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study recognizes a protein on the lymphoma, MM or CLL cells called&#xD;
      kappa immunoglobulin. Antibodies can stick to lymphoma, MM or CLL cells when it recognizes&#xD;
      the kappa molecules present on the tumor cells. For this study, the kappa antibody has been&#xD;
      changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When&#xD;
      an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These&#xD;
      chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and&#xD;
      so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells work better if they also add a protein&#xD;
      that stimulates T cells to grow called CD28. By joining the anti-kappa antibody to the T&#xD;
      cells and adding the CD28, the investigators expect to be able to make cells that will last&#xD;
      for a longer time in the body (because of the presence of the CD28). They are hoping this&#xD;
      will make the cells work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, when patients enrolled on this study, they were assigned to one of three&#xD;
      different doses of the kappa-CD28 T cells. We found that all three dose levels are safe. Now,&#xD;
      the plan is to give patients the highest dose that we tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These chimeric T cells (kappa-CD28) are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the lymphoma, MM or CLL specific T cells investigators will take 240 ml (up to 16&#xD;
      tablespoonfuls)of blood from the patient. This would be drawn as 2 (two) separate blood&#xD;
      collections of 120 ml (up to 8 tablespoonfuls) of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get the kappa antibody (with CD28) to attach to the surface of the T cell, investigators&#xD;
      inserted the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus&#xD;
      that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This&#xD;
      virus also helps investigators find the T cells in the patient's blood after they're&#xD;
      injected. Because the patient has received cells with a new gene in them patients will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to grow and accomplish&#xD;
      their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in&#xD;
      circulation. Because of that, if the level of circulating T cells is relatively high or the&#xD;
      patient has B-CLL, the patient may receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine&#xD;
      (Cy and Flu) prior to the infusion of the T cells. This drug will decrease the numbers of the&#xD;
      patients own T cells before infusion of the kappa-CD28 T cells. Although investigators don't&#xD;
      expect any effect on the tumor with the dose that the patient will receive, this drug is part&#xD;
      of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma, MM or CLL. If you are already receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy, this may not be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line. If s/he&#xD;
      receives Cy and Flu as stated above, the T cells will be given no sooner than 24 hours&#xD;
      afterwards. If the patient has recently received other chemotherapy, the T cells will be&#xD;
      given at least 24 hours after their last chemotherapy. The injection will take about 20&#xD;
      minutes. Investigators will follow the patient in the clinic after the injection. The&#xD;
      treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital&#xD;
      or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be&#xD;
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),&#xD;
      the patient may be able to receive additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These&#xD;
      additional infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level they&#xD;
      received the first time or a lower dose. If the patient's circulating T cells are relatively&#xD;
      high prior to any additional doses of T cells, they may receive Cy and Flu beforehand.&#xD;
