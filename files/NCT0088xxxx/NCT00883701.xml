    <textblock>
      COPD exacerbations are characterized by an excessive accumulation and activation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells in the airways. It is not known whether this phenomenon represents a risk&#xD;
      for for lung damage via the release in the extracellular environment of potent cytolitic&#xD;
      cellular granular contents such as granzymes and perforin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assess the intracellular expression of granzymes and perforin in&#xD;
      neutrophils and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) at the onset of exacerbations compared to&#xD;
      stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a greater release of intracellular perforin and granzymes&#xD;
      from neutrophils and LGL into the extracellular environment occur at exacerbations compared&#xD;
      to stable condition and that these changes are more pronounced in COPD patients than in&#xD;
      subjects without COPD who undergo respiratory infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The course of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by exacerbations&#xD;
      which lead to significant clinical deterioration and morbidity.COPD exacerbations are&#xD;
      characterized by an augmentation of the inflammation that is observed in the airways in&#xD;
      stable condition, particularly by excessive accumulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and&#xD;
      activation of lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that this abnormal increase of inflammatory cells in the airways of&#xD;
      COPD patients during exacerbations, might represent a significant risk for excessive&#xD;
      proteolytic activity in the airways via the release of their granule contents into the&#xD;
      extracellular environment. Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) which include NK and cytotoxic T-&#xD;
      cells and neutrophils contain cytolytic molecules such as, granzymes and perforin. Therefore,&#xD;
      the inflammatory process during exacerbations might be potentially toxic to the lung.&#xD;
      Notably, it was showed that sputum T-lymphocytes (CD8+) from patients with stable COPD&#xD;
      express more perforin and are more cytotoxic compared to normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few previous investigations questioned the role of these cytolytic molecules in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of COPD. Moreover, despite the considerable progress that has been made in&#xD;
      understanding the underlying mechanisms in COPD, there have been no studies investigating the&#xD;
      expression of perforin or granzymes during COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present prospective investigation we assess the intracellular expression of granzymes&#xD;
      and perforin in neutrophils and LGL cells at the onset of sputum of COPD patients by using&#xD;
      flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD subjects will be examined at the onset of an exacerbation and in stable condition. The&#xD;
      definition of an exacerbation will be based on the criteria described by Anthonisen,&#xD;
      requiring either the presence of at least two major symptoms (increase in dyspnea, sputum&#xD;
      production, purulence) or of one major symptom in addition to at least one minor (wheeze,&#xD;
      cough, nasal discharge, sore throat, fever), for two consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we will assess the expression of granzymes and perforin in neutrophils and LGL&#xD;
      cells of subjects without COPD(controls) who will be recruited by consecutive sampling among&#xD;
      those subjects who seek medical assistance at the clinic during the study period and they&#xD;
      satisfy all the following criteria: i) absence of COPD, Asthma, pneumonia, evidence of lung&#xD;
      cancer, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease or other respiratory disease ii) initiation&#xD;
      of symptoms diagnostic for respiratory infection in the past 72 hours, iii) abstention from&#xD;
      any new therapeutic intervention, and iv) absence of any signs suggestive of condition&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization. Control subjects will be examined at the onset of respiratory&#xD;
      infections and at stable condition. The definition of a respiratory infection require the&#xD;
      presence of one of the following symptoms such as dyspnea, sputum production, purulence,&#xD;
      cough, ± fever, for two consecutive days. Stable condition for controls will be defined as&#xD;
      absence of respiratory infection/exacerbation based on symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital . Sputum induction and&#xD;
      processing Sputum will be induced at exacerbation or respiratory infection and in stable&#xD;
      condition (at least 8 weeks after exacerbation) of the same patient and control subject&#xD;
      respectively; samples will be processed for analysis of inflammatory cells and cytokines and&#xD;
      microbiology. Sputum will be induced via inhalation of a hypertonic saline solution aerosol&#xD;
      (Ultraneb 2000; DeVilbiss; Somerset, PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody labeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies will be used for labeling sputum cells:&#xD;
      phycoerythrin-conjugated antiCD3 (PE-CD3), phycoerythrin-5-conjugated (antiCD4-PCy5),&#xD;
      fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-perforin-antibody, (antiperforin-FITC) and&#xD;
      fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate will be also used for competitive detection of&#xD;
      intracellular perforin and granzymes. The &quot;a intraprep kit&quot; (Beckman-Coulter Inc Fullerton&#xD;
      Ca, USA). Isotyping antibodies mouse antimouse IgG will be used as controls (Immunotech;&#xD;
      Marseille, France). For labeling cell surface antigens 1x106 cells in suspension will be&#xD;
      incubated with normal bovine serum to block the unspecific binding (blocking reagent), and&#xD;
      then the monoclonal antibody/ antibodies will be added in excess (according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instruction) for 45 min at 10°C in the dark and washed three times with PBS plus 10% FCS. For&#xD;
      intracellular perforin and granzymes staining, cells will be subsequently incubated in a&#xD;
      permeabilization reagent (Intraprep; Beckman Coulter; Fullerton, CA) for 10 min. As a&#xD;
      control, unlabeled antiperforin (or antigranzyme) at molar excess will be used after&#xD;
      permeabilization and then antiperforin (or antigranzyme) FITC will be added without washing&#xD;
      and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (competitive labeling). After staining, the&#xD;
      samples will be washed with PBS plus 10% FCS and will be immediately analyzed using flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow Cytometric analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sputum samples prepared as described above will be analyzed on a fluorescence activated&#xD;
      cytometer (EPICS ELITE; Coultronics; Louton, UK). Cells will be tightly gated by volume and&#xD;
      complexity on a forward (0o) and side-light scattering (90o) mode. At least 105 cells were&#xD;
      analyzed in each session. PCy-5-conjugated anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibodies (Dako; Ely,&#xD;
      UK) will be used as pan-leukocyte stain to exclude non leukocyte events by logical gating.&#xD;
      The percentage of one-color, two-color, and three-color positive cells will be measured and&#xD;
      the mean channel value as well as the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) corresponding to&#xD;
      the antigen density will be estimated. The QC-Combo Kit (FCSC; San Jun, Puerto Rico) will be&#xD;
      used for quantification of antibody binding and day-to-day instrument calibration&#xD;
      (amplification and compensation settings of the flow cytometer) will be routinely carried&#xD;
      out. Gating will be performed according to forward and side scattering and CD45 expression.&#xD;
      Positive cells within the neutrophilic and lymphocytic population will be measured as&#xD;
      percentages of each cell population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the above methodology we will asses the expression of perforin in neutrophils and&#xD;
      LGL cells and the expression of granzymes in neutrophils and LGL cells both in exacerbation&#xD;
      and in stable COPD.&#xD;
