  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown to be associated with the development of gastric&#xD;
      cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection could reduce the&#xD;
      occurence or recurrence of these diseases. However, it was estimated that 15-20% of patients&#xD;
      would fail from first line standard eradication therapy and need second line rescue therapy.&#xD;
      About 15-30% of patient would fail from second line therapy and need to be rescued with third&#xD;
      line therapy. The commonly used salvage regimens include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bismuth based quadruple therapy (combined with ranitidine or proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
           plus two antibiotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin or rifabutin based triple therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Bismuth is not available in many countries and the administration method is complex.&#xD;
      Its usage is limited by the high pill number and low compliance rate. In recent years, the&#xD;
      concept of sequential therapy has been advocated in the treatment of H. pylori infection. The&#xD;
      regimen includes a PPI plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin&#xD;
      and metronidazole for another five days. The eradication rate in the first line treatment of&#xD;
      sequential therapy had been reported to be as high as 90%. More importantly, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that the eradication rate among patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains&#xD;
      could be as high as 89%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Therefore, the investigators aim to assess the efficacy of levofloxacin-based&#xD;
      sequential therapy as second line therapy for those who fail from one standard eradication&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
