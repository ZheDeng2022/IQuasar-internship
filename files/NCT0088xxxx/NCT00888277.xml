  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify a brief screening evaluation for MS patients that is&#xD;
      sensitive and specific to the MS population and which correlates with the findings of our&#xD;
      standard-of-care neuropsychological assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy five randomly identified patients will be evaluated. Consenting patients will perform&#xD;
      a Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and have the MS Center´s standard neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment performed. Tests comprising the standard assessment will be the RBANS (Randolph,&#xD;
      1998), Multiscore Depression Inventory, Cross and Clock Drawings. The selfreported Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II) will also be obtained. An Expanded Disability Status Scale&#xD;
      (EDSS) will be recorded for each patient. The RBANS consists of six scales labeled (1)&#xD;
      Immediate Memory, (2) Visuospatial/ Constructional, (3) Language, (4) Attention, (5) Delayed&#xD;
      Memory, and (6) Total. Depression will be assessed by the BDI and the MultiScore Depression&#xD;
      Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SDMT will be administered using standard instructions either orally or in writing. Use of&#xD;
      the established norms for the SDMT will be used to determine if the MS patient is&#xD;
      demonstrating some cognitive dysfunction. Scores less than 1.0 to 1.5 standard deviations&#xD;
      below mean are suggestive of cerebral dysfunction. The results will be controlled for age,&#xD;
      gender, and educational level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the results of the 75 patient assessments will be reviewed to see the&#xD;
      concordance between the results of the SDMT and the Neuropsychological Battery. The&#xD;
      association of cognitive dysfunction as identified by the SDMT will be correlated with each&#xD;
      of the six RBANS scales and other parameters of the cognitive aspects of the Battery.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the SDMT in&#xD;
      determining abnormalities as well as an optimum cutpoint. This analysis will indicate&#xD;
      possible cognitive problems and the need for further testing and, potentially, intervention.&#xD;
