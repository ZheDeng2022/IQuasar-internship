  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have advanced stage cancer. This study is a gene transfer research study using&#xD;
      special immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Investigators hope that both will work better together. Antibodies&#xD;
      are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused from infectious diseases and possibly&#xD;
      cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that&#xD;
      can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have shown&#xD;
      promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there are normally not enough of them or they are not&#xD;
      able to kill all the tumor cells. We have done research in which we have grown &quot;extra&quot; T&#xD;
      lymphocytes. We have added genes to those T lymphocytes to help them to recognize tumor&#xD;
      cells. Although the results have been promising, we are still doing more research in this&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibodies usually circulate in blood and are secreted by other cells of the immune system in&#xD;
      response to the presence of germs or abnormal cells in the body. The antibody used in this&#xD;
      study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to&#xD;
      HER2-positive cancer cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The patient will give blood to grow T cells on either one to two separate occasions. Then,&#xD;
      the EBV-specific T cells will be made. These cells will be grown and frozen. To get the HER2&#xD;
      antibody (and the CD28) and the DNR to attach to the surface of the EBV-T cells, the antibody&#xD;
      gene and the DNR gene will be inserted into the EBV-T cell. This is done with two viruses&#xD;
      called retroviruses that have been made for this study. One will carry the antibody gene into&#xD;
      the T cell and the other the DNR gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is enrolled on the study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-DNR EBV-T&#xD;
      cells. The subject will be given one dose of cells into the vein through an IV line. The&#xD;
      injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic&#xD;
      after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and&#xD;
      Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
