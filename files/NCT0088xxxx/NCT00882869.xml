  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AEG35156 is a second generation antisense which targets XIAP mRNA to lower XIAP levels and&#xD;
      the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells, enhancing their sensitivity to intrinsic death and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Advanced HCC is an attractive target for AEG35156 since XIAP is highly&#xD;
      expressed in HCC and may prevent cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis. Second generation&#xD;
      antisense molecules are known to accumulate in liver where AEG35156 may down regulate XIAP&#xD;
      protein expression in HCC cells thus promoting their apoptotic death.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Histology, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AASLD Criteria in which the diagnosis is made clinically in a patient with a&#xD;
                  known hepatitis B or cirrhosis of other etiology has a liver mass of &gt; 2cm with&#xD;
                  typical features of HCC (i.e., hypervascular with washout in the portal/venous&#xD;
                  phase) on a dynamic imaging study (contrast CT / USG / MRI) or alternatively if&#xD;
                  the AFP is &gt;200 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor is not suitable for curative treatment (resection / transplant / local&#xD;
             ablative therapies) or the patient is medically inoperable or refuses such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (please refer to Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-Pugh score A or B (please refer to Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ functions defined as:&#xD;

&#xD;
