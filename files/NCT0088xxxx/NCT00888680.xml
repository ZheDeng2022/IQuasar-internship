    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to explore the safety and effectiveness of a new chemical&#xD;
      entity, BGC20-1531, in subjects with a history of migraine. In this study subjects will treat&#xD;
      a total of three migraine attacks with two different doses of BGC20-1531 and placebo, with at&#xD;
      least one week wash out period between doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is estimated to affect 10-20% of the world population and is listed by the&#xD;
      World Health Organisation in the top 20 causes of disabling conditions, and in the top four&#xD;
      neurological disabling conditions. The most common therapies for acute migraine are&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans. However, many migraine sufferers&#xD;
      do not experience sufficient relief from these treatments or cannot tolerate their&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and other side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostaglandin PGE2-induced sensory nerve sensitisation, neuropeptide release and cerebral&#xD;
      vascular dilatation is thought to underlie migraine pain, particularly via activation of the&#xD;
      EP4 receptor subtype. BGC20-1531 is an orally available EP4 receptor antagonist which&#xD;
      inhibits prostaglandin-induced vasodilation of cranial blood vessels via a selective blockade&#xD;
      of EP4 receptors reducing inflammation and migraine pain. As EP4 receptors are discretely&#xD;
      localised, the overall safety profile of EP4 receptor antagonists may be improved compared to&#xD;
      triptans and NSAIDs.&#xD;
