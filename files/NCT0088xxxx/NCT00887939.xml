      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urticaria is a common itchy skin disorder that may occur spontaneously or on exposure to&#xD;
           a physical trigger (called physical urticaria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are studying the genetic basis of a physically induced urticarial syndrome.&#xD;
           Once called familial cold urticaria, this condition is now called familial cold&#xD;
           autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS). FCAS is an autoinflammatory disease, a group of&#xD;
           inherited disorders characterized by unprovoked episodes of inflammation. Patients with&#xD;
           FCAS often have hives, joint pain, and fever following general exposure to cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with FCAS have a mutation in a gene that makes a protein called cryopyrin.&#xD;
           Cryopyrin seems to be involved with the production of a proinflammatory mediator called&#xD;
           interleukin-1 (IL-1). Patients with FCAS and others with autoinflammatory syndromes have&#xD;
           benefited from medication that blocks the effects of IL-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate mechanisms that may cause physical hives or urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To reproduce urticaria through challenge testing (procedures to test the skin for a&#xD;
           reaction to a stimulus), followed by mast cell studies, measurement of IL-1, genetic&#xD;
           studies, and other molecular studies to lead to a better understanding of urticaria and&#xD;
           to design safe and more effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients between 6 months and 65 years of age with a documented history of clinically&#xD;
           reproducible physical urticaria that triggers hives and that has been evaluated by a&#xD;
           physician. Patients should have a letter of referral, including copies of pertinent&#xD;
           medical history and laboratory studies, from a referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affected and nonaffected family members of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria include (1) the presence of conditions that may put the subject at&#xD;
           undue risk, such as acute infection, severe thrombocytopenia (a lower than normal number&#xD;
           of platelets in the blood), or significant cardiovascular disease; (2) any condition&#xD;
           that would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in this study; and (3) a history&#xD;
           of HIV, other known immunodeficiency, or evidence of chronic Hepatitis B and/or C&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will conduct the following tests to verify which triggers cause the hives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History and physical exam to determine the relationship between the trigger and&#xD;
                appearance of the hives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples for baseline screening (additional samples may be taken within 8&#xD;
                hours of triggering hives).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Verification of hives using standard challenge testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures to trigger urticaria (the challenge testing) include dermatographism&#xD;
           (stroking the skin), delayed pressure urticaria (direct pressure), cold-induced&#xD;
           urticaria (cold exposure), cholinergic urticaria (exercise, hot water), solar urticaria&#xD;
           (sun exposure), localized heat urticaria (direct heat exposure), aquagenic urticaria&#xD;
           (room temperature water), and vibratory angioedema (direct vibratory stimulus exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have a positive history for hives and failed challenge testing (that&#xD;
           is, hives resulted from the triggers) will be asked to provide a skin biopsy and&#xD;
           additional bloods samples for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return to the clinic within 1 month if multiple triggers&#xD;
           could not be verified during the initial visit, or to return for additional research&#xD;
           evaluations, which may include a skin punch biopsy and blood sample collection. Patients&#xD;
           may have to stay at the hospital overnight, if required to document the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonaffected family members who enroll in this protocol will provide samples for&#xD;
           comparison with the family member who has a history of hives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a small financial compensation for the skin biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urticaria is a common skin disorder that is classified according to its chronicity into acute&#xD;
      and chronic forms. It may occur spontaneously or on exposure to a physical factor. In the&#xD;
      latter case, the urticaria is classified as a physical urticaria . Physical urticaria may be&#xD;
      induced by mechanical and applied pressure, exercise, or exposure to cold, heat, sun, water,&#xD;
      or vibration. The urticarial lesions are generally thought to be the result of mast cell&#xD;
      activation and degranulation, which is supported by the finding of increased levels of serum&#xD;
      histamine during some urticarial flares. Passive transfer experiments, whereupon serum from&#xD;
      affected donors is transferred into recipient s skin followed by physical stimulation with&#xD;
      resultant urticaria at the site of challenge, have been positive in some instances. This&#xD;
      suggests the presence of an intrinsic factor in serum, such as IgE, which then mediates&#xD;
      activation of tissue mast cells. However, the pathogenesis in general remains unclear and a&#xD;
      genetic basis for these disorders has not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is thus to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      physical urticaria through the investigation of subjects with severe and unusual phenotypes&#xD;
      and/or inherited patterns of disease. Subjects will undergo a clinical evaluation that will&#xD;
      include verification of their urticaria. Blood and tissue samples, if available, will be&#xD;
      collected for analysis. The analysis will be targeted toward the determination of novel serum&#xD;
      mediators, mast cell activation and mutational analysis in families with inherited patterns.&#xD;
