      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the depth of focus and visual outcomes&#xD;
      after implantation of the Acrysof IQ SN60WF aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) and the Acrysof&#xD;
      Natural SN60AT spherical IOL.&#xD;

      Cataract is prevalent throughout the world and IOLs are routinely implanted after the&#xD;
      extraction of the cataractous lens. It is the most frequently performed surgery in the United&#xD;
      States with an estimated 2-3 million procedures performed annually. With the aging population&#xD;
      on the rise, as well as the increasing popularity of refractive intraocular lenses, the&#xD;
      number of intraocular surgeries continues to rise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the years, evolution of IOLs has broadened surgeon's armamentarium following cataract&#xD;
      extraction. Traditionally spherical IOLs have been routinely implanted following cataract&#xD;
      extraction for the correction of aphakia. Even though these IOLs improved the patient vision&#xD;
      to 20/20 in most of the times, they did nott address the spherical aberration of the optical&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally the cornea has a positive spherical aberration. Spherical aberration means that the&#xD;
      light rays falling on the eye's periphery are either more (positive spherical aberration) or&#xD;
      less (negative spherical aberration) refracted than the axial rays. Such aberration usually&#xD;
      affects the functional vision of the patient such as contrast sensitivity, depth of focus&#xD;
      (ability to see far, near and intermediate) and the perception of glare and haloes. Corneal&#xD;
      spherical aberration is adequately neutralized by the negative spherical aberration of the&#xD;
      crystalline lens until the age of 40. (1) When the cataractous lens is removed, the corneal&#xD;
      spherical aberration is no longer neutralized and the optical system will have now a net&#xD;
      positive spherical aberration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional IOLs implanted after phacoemulsification result in a spherical aberration of&#xD;
      approximately 0.08 µm adding to the already positive corneal aberration of the eye. (2, 3) In&#xD;
      order for the patient to reach the optimal functional vision, efforts have led to the&#xD;
      development of the aspheric IOLs. Aspheric IOLs compensate for the positive spherical&#xD;
      aberration of the cornea. They have been shown to improve the functional vision and optical&#xD;
      quality in pseudophakic patients. (4, 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acrysof IQ, an aspheric IOL was introduced after gaining FDA approval in May 2006. Its shares&#xD;
      the basic design features of the Acrysof Natural IOL with the modifications of its optic&#xD;
      design to acquire a posterior prolate surface reducing its central thickness. Unlike the&#xD;
      cornea, it introduces negative spherical aberration (0.2 µm) that lowers the spherical&#xD;
      aberration of the eye.(6) It has been reported to provide better contrast sensitivity,&#xD;
      quality of vision and fewer aberration with the aspheric IOL compared to the conventional&#xD;
      (spherical) IOL.(6,7,8) However, some studies have found that conventional (spherical) IOLs&#xD;
      have better depth of focus than aspheric IOLs allowing the patient to achieve better&#xD;
      intermediate and near vision.(5) Conversely, Mester et al found no difference in depth of&#xD;
      focus between both IOLs.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare depth of focus and visual outcomes in&#xD;
      eyes receiving the aspheric Acrysof IQ and those receiving the spherical Acrysof Natural IOL&#xD;
      after routine cataract extraction.&#xD;
