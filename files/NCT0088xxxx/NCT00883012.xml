    <textblock>
      Influenza associated pneumonia causes significant morbidity in young HIV-infected children.&#xD;
      Although annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for HIV infected children, it&#xD;
      has not been implemented as routine care, due to the lack of data on disease burden and&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at determining the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in HIV infected&#xD;
      children in South Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus infects 30 to 50% of children under five years of age during the course of&#xD;
      any epidemic. The attack rates of influenza virus associated illness during infancy remains&#xD;
      high, and at least 50% of influenza associated hospitalisation amongst children occurs in&#xD;
      infants &lt;6 months of age. Approximately 33% of children would have been infected at least&#xD;
      once during their first year of life. The estimated attack rates in children aged 0-5 and&#xD;
      6-12 months for influenza illness is 12.4/100 and 20.3/100 child years respectively.&#xD;
      Influenza virus causes LRTI amongst 89% of children infected in the 6-12 month age group. The&#xD;
      risk of influenza infection is higher amongst older children (2-5 years of age); however, the&#xD;
      risk of developing LRTI (78 versus 2.5 per 100 child years) is greater amongst younger&#xD;
      children (&lt; 2 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In South Africa, the burden of influenza associated pneumonia has been characterized in HIV&#xD;
      infected children. The incidence of severe pneumonia in which influenza virus was identified&#xD;
      was 8.03 fold (95%CI 5.05-12.76) greater in HIV infected compared to HIV non-infected&#xD;
      children (1 268 versus 148 per 100 000 child years) aged &lt; 2 years. These rates however&#xD;
      provide a very conservative estimate as to the burden of influenza illness, since it excludes&#xD;
      children with influenza illness that were hospitalized for syndromes other than pneumonia as&#xD;
      well as children managed as outpatients. Furthermore, although the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization for influenza associated pneumonia was similar between HIV infected and HIV&#xD;
      uninfected children (median 4-5 days), there was a statistically non-significant increased&#xD;
      risk of mortality among HIV infected children (8.0% versus 2.2%; P=0.20). Much of the&#xD;
      differences in morbidity and mortality in HIV infected individuals with influenza-associated&#xD;
      pneumonia may be due to contribution of other co-existing pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advocating&#xD;
      the annual use of the subunit influenza vaccine in HIV-1 infected children are largely&#xD;
      founded on the theoretical concern regarding the potential severity of influenza disease in&#xD;
      HIV-1 infected children. Although vaccination with the subunit influenza vaccine is&#xD;
      recommended for HIV-1 infected children &gt;6 months of age, there are concerns regarding the&#xD;
      benefits of vaccination in these children. These include that in addition to a poor immune&#xD;
      response to the vaccine, particularly in severely immunocompromised HIV-1 infected children,&#xD;
      increases in plasma HIV RNA following vaccination have been described. The increase in plasma&#xD;
      HIV RNA was transient and does not appear to be of any long-term clinical significance.&#xD;
      Recently a few studies, with partly conflicting results, have been undertaken evaluating the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in children on antiretroviral therapy. However, no&#xD;
      such studies have been undertaken in Africa or Asia where the burden of paediatric HIV is the&#xD;
      greatest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine use of influenza vaccine in HIV infected children remains low, partly related to&#xD;
      the lack of adequate data regarding the burden of influenza associated disease in these&#xD;
      children as well as the lack on any vaccine-efficacy data in HIV infected children.&#xD;
      Determining the burden of disease and effectiveness of influenza vaccine in HIV infected&#xD;
      children will have a bearing on routine immunization recommendations as well as planning for&#xD;
      future influenza pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the epidemiology of HIV between developing and developed countries in which&#xD;
      the prevalence of HIV is low to that of high-burden sub-Saharan African countries makes it&#xD;
      necessary to be cautious in extrapolating data and recommendations of developed countries to&#xD;
      developing countries. These differences may include: i. differences in standard of care,&#xD;
      including access to prophylaxis against opportunistic infections and use of highly active&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (HAART); ii. differences in risk for disease from opportunistic&#xD;
      pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc. These differences may all contribute to&#xD;
      differences in the risk and severity of influenza illness among HIV infected individuals from&#xD;
      these communities as well as possibly responsiveness and effectiveness of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is within this context that this study aims at determining the effectiveness of influenza&#xD;
      vaccination in HIV infected children in South Africa. The significance of the findings from&#xD;
      this study will help quantify the burden of influenza illness in African HIV infected&#xD;
      children, in the era of HAART, as well as assist in making more informed recommendations for&#xD;
      the use of influenza vaccine in HIV infected children and in guiding national policy for&#xD;
      preparing for a future influenza virus-pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      350 Patients will be recruited at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto, South Africa onto&#xD;
      this prospective, double-blind, placebo randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy&#xD;
      of a tri-valent sub-unit influenza vaccine in HIV infected children. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either two doses of Influenza sub-unit vaccine or placebo one month&#xD;
      apart, preceding the 2009 Influenza season. 100 children will be included into the&#xD;
      immunogenicity cohort, and have blood drawn to evaluate baseline influenza strain specific&#xD;
      antibody levels and subsequent levels one-month following the first and second doses of study&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed up during the course of the influenza season, which will&#xD;
      be defined as starting 1st May 2009 and ending 30th September 2009. Subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted weekly to determine whether they fulfill the criteria for Influenza-like illness.&#xD;
      Subjects who fulfill the criteria for diagnosing ILI will be requested to come into the&#xD;
      clinic within 48 hours for further investigation, which will involve a nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      aspirate (for identification of respiratory viruses), nasopharyngeal swab (for identification&#xD;
      of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization) and blood draw (for culture and Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae testing).&#xD;
