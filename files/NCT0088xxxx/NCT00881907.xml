  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigators study is to characterize the composition of the hard and&#xD;
      soft tissues present in root canals of teeth previously diagnosed with necrotic pulps and&#xD;
      incomplete root formation and treated with a triple antibiotic regeneration protocol. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that treatment of teeth with necrotic pulps and immature apices&#xD;
      with triple antibiotic paste will stimulate continued root formation by the deposition of&#xD;
      dentin at the root apices. The primary outcome measure will be histological identification of&#xD;
      mineralized tissue and adherent cells in the apical third of these teeth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      'Regeneration' as referred to in this protocol refers to the stimulation of continued root&#xD;
      formation by the deposition of apical tissues subsequent to disinfection of a necrotic root&#xD;
      canal and its contents and creation of a scaffold upon which cells can proliferate. While the&#xD;
      proposed treatment protocol is currently being used in clinical practice and has been shown&#xD;
      to be successful in case reports and case series, the nature of the proliferating apical&#xD;
      tissues remains unknown. Thus, this study is uniquely positioned to address a critical gap in&#xD;
      knowledge in the regeneration of a functional pulp-dentin complex. Moreover, results obtained&#xD;
      from pediatric cases may well provide the essential foundation of knowledge for endodontists&#xD;
      to apply this knowledge to the more difficult situation of regenerating the pulp-dentin&#xD;
      complex of the full mature permanent tooth.&#xD;
