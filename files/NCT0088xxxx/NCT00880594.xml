  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience abdominal pain as a result of&#xD;
      pain signals in the bowel and how these signals are processed in the brain. Studies using&#xD;
      brain imaging (pictures) have shown that IBS patients with more pain diagnoses (i.e.&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, migraines, etc.) have greater activity in the regions of the brain responsible&#xD;
      for the emotional and thought processing of pain signals. This could possibly make bowel&#xD;
      sensations and bowel difficulties feel abnormal or more noticeable, in turn causing more&#xD;
      severe IBS symptoms. The purpose of this protocol is to explore the role of pain diagnoses&#xD;
      and their affect on brain activity in IBS patients. The investigators will also examine the&#xD;
      use of a medication, desipramine, which is known to affect these brain regions, in IBS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Desipramine 25 mg/day administered in the evening. Dosing may be increased dependent upon side-effects and clinical response to a maximum of 100 mg/day. Absent significant side-effects, all patients are increased at the one week visit to 50 mg/day at bedtime if they have not achieved a report of &quot;Adequate relief&quot;. Thereafter, up to week 4, the daily desipramine dose may be increased weekly by 25 mg up to the 100 mg/d maximum.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IBS subjects with- and without comorbid somatization features will be recruited from&#xD;
             the sources highlighted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible, subjects will have to be between 18 and 90 years of age (inclusive)&#xD;
             and qualify for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome according to the criteria set&#xD;
             forth in the Rome III criteria for the Diagnosis of Functional GI Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IBS patients will then be assessed in terms of comorbid somatization as determined&#xD;
             using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For this particular study, only subjects with high somatization (PHQ ≥ 10 or low&#xD;
             somatization (PHQ ≤5) will be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Verification of somatization status will be performed using a formal structured&#xD;
             interview process (Diagnostic Interview Schedule, DIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons are eligible to participate without regard to race or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Given sex differences in cerebral responses to noxious stimuli and the greater&#xD;
             prevalence of IBS in women, only female participants will be sought in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Also, in view brain hemispheric differences between left- and right-hand dominant&#xD;
             individuals and the greater prevalence of right-handedness, all participants must be&#xD;
             right-handed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons are excluded from participation for having various psychiatric, medical, and&#xD;
             other characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric/cognitive exclusions include any of the following: active suicidal or&#xD;
             homicidal ideation or a history of attempted suicide, current excessive alcohol use or&#xD;
             other substance abuse disorders, active major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar&#xD;
             depression or any psychotic disorder, unwillingness to be randomized or provide&#xD;
             informed consent, inability to communicate with staff or significant cognitive&#xD;
             impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical and other exclusions include any of the following: renal or hepatic disease or&#xD;
             impairment, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrythmia, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             disease, or breastfeeding, pregnant, or imminent intention of pregnancy, history of&#xD;
             seizures or primary neurological disorder, head trauma, brain damage, hyper- or&#xD;
             hypothyroidism, history or abdominal surgery (other than&#xD;
             cholecystectomy/appendectomy), or known structural GI disorder (Crohn's disease,&#xD;
             etc.), contraindication to MRI (metallic implant, pacemaker), or rectal balloon&#xD;
             distention (e.g., proctitis/colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusions related to medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Analgesics (narcotics, NSAIDs; acetaminophen OK)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Muscle relaxants&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Psychoactive agents (antidepressants, antipsychotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Other medications (phenytoin; amphetamines, prescription weight-loss drugs, or&#xD;
                  benzodiazepines)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Thyroid medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Anticholinergic medications or other IBS medications (hyoscyamine, dicyclomine)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Cytochrome p450 substrates&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Participation in any clinical trial using any other drug.&#xD;
