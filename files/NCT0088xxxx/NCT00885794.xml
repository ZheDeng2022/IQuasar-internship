    <textblock>
      Diabetic maculopathy is the leading cause of visual impairment in the working-age population&#xD;
      in developed countries. Diabetic macular edema can cause impaired visual acuity and so far is&#xD;
      treated by laser, vitreous surgery, and intravitreal cortisone application. Still 50% of the&#xD;
      cases do not respond to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently intraocular anti-VEGF-treatment with ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Novartis) in diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema has proven efficacy to last over a period of 3 to 6 months. Still, the optimal&#xD;
      dosage for those intravitreal injections still has to be found, because frequent injections&#xD;
      are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of visual acuity is inadequate to quantify in detail the visual impairment.&#xD;
      Using the newest technology of a high-definition optical coherence tomography (Cirrus-OCT,&#xD;
      Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc.) to determine the retinal thickness, and a miroperimetry (MP-1, Nidek&#xD;
      Technologies) to determine retinal sensitivity, we hope to find the optimal dosage of&#xD;
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment in diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: To determine the dose response of 0.5mg and 1.0mg ranibizumab (Lucentis®,&#xD;
      Novartis Pharma) intravitreal injection in subjects with resistant diabetic macular edema and&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic maculopathy due to diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of visual&#xD;
      impairment in the working-age population in developed countries. DME is the swelling of the&#xD;
      retina resulting from the exudation and accumulation of extracellular fluid and proteins in&#xD;
      the macula. Structural changes in the endothelium of retinal vessels lead to a breakdown of&#xD;
      the blood-retina barrier and increase vascular permeability, resulting in exudation. The&#xD;
      standardized treatment of DME is a focal laser or GRID-laser treatment with or without&#xD;
      combined triamcinolone intravitreal injections. Those laser treatments produce scars in the&#xD;
      central retina and are not always very effective. In cases of macular traction or taut&#xD;
      posterior hyloid vitrectomy and retinal surgery are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as an important factor in the&#xD;
      occurrence of vascular permeability in DME. In patients with DME, VEGF levels are&#xD;
      significantly elevated, compared to patients without ocular disease. Therefore, anti-VEGF&#xD;
      treatment has been implicated as an important treatment of DME and recently intraocular&#xD;
      anti-VEGF-treatment with ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Novartis Pharma) in diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      has proven to be very effective. Just like in patients with age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD), anti-VEGF treatment was given 3 times every 4-6 weeks. The same treatment was repeated&#xD;
      at a relapse of the disease, again 3 times every 4-6 weeks. One study group treated DME with&#xD;
      0.5mg ranibizumab intravitreal injections and the other compared 0.3mg to 0.5mg of&#xD;
      ranibizumab intravitreal injections. An optimal treatment dose has not been found yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity assessment is currently used to determine the functional damage caused by&#xD;
      edema, although it may not completely describe the functional condition of the patient.&#xD;
      Furthermore, visual acuity alone does not seem to be the best parameter to define the effect&#xD;
      and continuation of treatment. Retinal thickness, as measured by the noninvasive optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) can deliver detailed information about the retinal situation&#xD;
      during and after treatment. Also a fundus related perimetry, known as microperimetry (MP), is&#xD;
      a useful noninvasive examination method in determining the site of relative and absolute&#xD;
      scotomas and also fixation characteristics. With MP the macular sensitivity can be measured&#xD;
      to further assess the macular condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the newest technology of a high-definition OCT (Cirrus-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc.) to&#xD;
      determine the retinal thickness, and a MP with automated correction for eye movements (MP-1,&#xD;
      Nidek Technologies) to determine retinal sensitivity, we intend to analyze this new treatment&#xD;
      option for DME, and find the optimized dose for intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in&#xD;
      cases of ineffective laser treatment.&#xD;
