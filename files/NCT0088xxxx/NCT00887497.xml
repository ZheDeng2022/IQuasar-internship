      One of the major complications of surgical excision of colorectal cancer includes improper&#xD;
      healing of the anastomosis (reconnection of the remaining, cancer free intestine). This can&#xD;
      result in anastomotic leak, abscess then abdominal and/or pelvic sepsis and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal surgery has suffered from complications. Recently, an innovation in esophageal&#xD;
      surgery has seen a relatively drastic decrease in complications during distal esophagectomies&#xD;
      using a technique called &quot;ischemic conditioning&quot;. This technique involves dividing the blood&#xD;
      supply to the stomach that would be performed during a 1-stage esophagectomy but returning&#xD;
      days later to complete the resection. Bench results have shown improved angiogenesis,&#xD;
      vasodilation, less anastomotic collagen deposition and minimized ischemia at the time of&#xD;
      surgery while clinical results have included improved stricture rates, leak rates and&#xD;
      mortality in esophageal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Ischemic conditioning is universal to the intestinal tract and a similar technique&#xD;
      can be applied in colon and rectal surgery. The investigators plan evaluating this hypothesis&#xD;
      by performing a pilot study comprised of the following: performing an endovascular&#xD;
      embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) followed by interval laparoscopic or&#xD;
      open rectosigmoid resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Part 1 - Endovascular Procedure Patients will be admitted and undergo endovascular&#xD;
      embolization of their IMA as an outpatient following diagnostic angiography. They will&#xD;
      undergo sigmoidoscopy throughout the embolization and a laser probe will indirectly measure&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation. The patient will be released home that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Colorectal Procedure Patients will then return 2-4 days later for their definitive&#xD;
      laparoscopic or open rectosigmoid resection. They will undergo sigmoidoscopy before and after&#xD;
      surgery and a laser probe will indirectly measure tissue oxygenation. The patient will then&#xD;
      be released home on average 3-5 days later.&#xD;

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ischemic conditioning of the&#xD;
      colon prior to resection. Colon and rectal resections require the removal of a section of&#xD;
      colon or rectum with re-attachment (anastomosis) of the two ends. This joining together of&#xD;
      the intestine is at risk for leaking if healing does not occur appropriately. Factors&#xD;
      postulated to lead to anastomotic leak include ischemia as well as tension and infection&#xD;
      among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of ischemic conditioning is based upon the innate ability to compensate and&#xD;
      increase the blood flow to a section of the intestine which is locally ischemic. By inducing&#xD;
      ischemia to a segment of intestine prior to resection, one could theoretically increase blood&#xD;
      flow via collateral vessels prior to resection. This would then, in turn, lead to more&#xD;
      initial blood flow to an anastomosis at the time of surgery via these collaterals, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing ischemia to a new, healing anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic conditioning was first described in animal models proving its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      In the rat model, ischemic conditioning demonstrated a return to baseline of tissue perfusion&#xD;
      by the time of resection, improved anastomotic leak rate and higher anastomotic wound&#xD;
      breaking strength. The first time this idea was implemented in the human model was in a study&#xD;
      by Akiyama et. al. where preoperative embolization was shown to be safe and improved blood&#xD;
      supply to the distal end of anastomosis after esophagectomy (remaining stomach). Further&#xD;
      basic science studies have shown improved angiogenesis, vasodilation, less anastomotic&#xD;
      collagen deposition and minimized ischemic injury. Further clinical studies demonstrated&#xD;
      improved stricture rates (0% from 40%), leak rates (0-6% from 5-15%) and mortality (0% from&#xD;
      5-10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major complications in colon and rectal surgery is improper healing of the&#xD;
      anastomosis (connection between the remaining, cancer free rectum with the remaining colon).&#xD;
      This results in an anastomotic leak or dehiscence leading to abscess, abdominal sepsis&#xD;
      requiring longer hospital stays, IV antibiotics, reoperation or possibly even death. It can&#xD;
      also lead to the late complication of stricture impairing function and often requiring repeat&#xD;
      dilations or operative revision. Recent reviews show rates of anastomotic complications in&#xD;
      upper rectal resection at 8-17% for leaks, and an average hospital stay of 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, preoperative embolization of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA) is&#xD;
      performed for patients scheduled to undergo colon or rectal resection. The surgery is then&#xD;
      performed in the standard fashion (either laparoscopically or open) several days later (1-5&#xD;
      days). The study is designed as a prospective, non-randomized, safety (pilot) study. Since&#xD;
      there are no reports of performing this exact procedure, we feel it is necessary to initially&#xD;
      proceed with safety study without a comparative arm prior to a large scale, multicenter trial&#xD;
      evaluating outcomes. Therefore, in this study we will not be evaluating morbidity or&#xD;
      mortality outcomes to any statistical significance.&#xD;
