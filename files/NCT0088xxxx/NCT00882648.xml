      Previous studies by this team of investigators has determined that male infants are more&#xD;
      likely to display more severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) as a result of maternal&#xD;
      opioid use during pregnancy (Jansson, 2007)and there is appears to be a gender-related&#xD;
      biologic vulnerability to NAS expression (Jansson, 2009, submitted). The proposed study&#xD;
      explores the relationship between fetal gender and substance abuse treatment outcomes among a&#xD;
      population of women in comprehensive substance abuse treatment to explore the possibility of&#xD;
      a psychosocial vulnerability among drug exposed male fetuses as opposed to female fetuses.&#xD;
      Women in substance abuse treatment are a group at high risk for current exposure to violence,&#xD;
      usually at the hands of significant others, and having a history of sexual abuse as a child,&#xD;
      usually resulting from contact with a male family member. Therefore, they often have&#xD;
      difficult relationships with men. At the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy (CAP), a 2006&#xD;
      study revealed that among a group of 715 pregnant women, reports of the exposure to violence&#xD;
      was very high. Their rates of lifetime abuse ranged from 72.7% for physical abuse to 44.5%&#xD;
      for sexual abuse. Rates of abuse remained high during their current pregnancy, ranging from&#xD;
      20% for physical abuse to 7.1% for sexual abuse (Velez, 2006). The abuse was very often at&#xD;
      the hands of partners or other male family member perpetrators. We hypothesize that women&#xD;
      carrying male fetuses will be less likely to remain complaint in drug treatment or abstinent&#xD;
      from illicit drug use, while women carrying female fetuses may be more likely to remain drug&#xD;
      abstinent and treatment compliant. If supported, this theory has the potential to inform&#xD;
      fetal gender specific treatment for pregnant drug dependent women. Additionally, we seek to&#xD;
      support the previously documented link between male gender and more severe expression of NAS,&#xD;
      and explore the relationship between other maternal prescribed drug use (i.e. psychotropic&#xD;
      medications) and severity of NAS expression.&#xD;
