      The aim of the proposed study is to determine if specific training in management of general,&#xD;
      obstetric, neonatal and pediatric emergencies results in a change in practice of doctors&#xD;
      working in emergency departments of public sector hospitals in three districts of Pakistan.&#xD;
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to test the ability of a standard course (5-days&#xD;
      training) to promote the provision of effective and evidence based practices in public sector&#xD;
      hospital settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is the 6th most populous country of the world 1 and has the largest population in&#xD;
      the Eastern Mediterranean Region, accounting for about 30 percent of the regional population.&#xD;
      The level of socio-economic development is still low - GDP per capita is US$ 7302; HDI is&#xD;
      142nd in the world 1; and, one fourth of the entire population lives below the poverty line&#xD;
      2. The health profile of Pakistan is characterized by high population growth rate, high&#xD;
      infant and child mortality rate, high maternal mortality ratio, and high burden of&#xD;
      communicable diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with neonatal, infant and child mortality, maternal mortality ratio is also&#xD;
      extremely high as 350 per 100,000 population in Pakistan 3. In addition, only 23 percent of&#xD;
      the deliveries are being conducted by skilled birth attendants and major causes of mortality&#xD;
      include hemorrhage, hypertensive diseases, sepsis and other obstetrical complications 4.&#xD;
      Although the health facilities are available ubiquitously, but these facilities lack proper&#xD;
      equipments and trained health workers. Health worker also lacks necessary skills and training&#xD;
      to manage the children, newborns and mothers in emergency situations. Management in the first&#xD;
      few hours - the Golden hours 5 of the presentation of obstetric, neonatal and pediatric&#xD;
      emergencies, including major trauma (if not given immediate attention are likely to result in&#xD;
      death or severe brain damage in 6 hours) is a major determinant of the eventual outcome. If&#xD;
      the vast majority of these potentially avoidable deaths and long-term or permanent morbidity&#xD;
      are to be avoided, a continuity of care with particular emphasis on golden hours management&#xD;
      and safe transfer has to be established starting from the communities to health facilities 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that if structured life support trainings are introduced in a systematic&#xD;
      method it helps in reducing mortality and morbidity during the emergency phase in a very cost&#xD;
      effective manner 4. Local public sector hospitals need to be configured to serve a community&#xD;
      and not just to provide episodic care for the few patients who transiently pass through their&#xD;
      doors during an acute episode. It is mandatory to upgrade the knowledge of first line health&#xD;
      worker in managing emergency situations. It is also necessary to elevate their capacity to&#xD;
      recognize the common emergencies and manage accordingly. By instituting accredited structured&#xD;
      training for these skills we can dramatically decrease mortality and morbidity rates in&#xD;
      Pakistan 6. The training activities of Essential Surgical Skills with emphasis on Emergency&#xD;
      Maternal and Child Health (ESS-EMCH) are based on two tried and tested structured training&#xD;
      methodologies of Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS) and Management of Obstetric&#xD;
      Emergencies and Trauma (MOET). The ESS-EMCH training programme is being conducted by Child&#xD;
      Health Advocacy International (CAI) in Pakistan and Gambia 6. The Advanced Life Support&#xD;
      Group-UK (ALSG-UK) and World Health Organization (WHO) provide technical support for the&#xD;
      training and the programme has been endorsed as a first ALSG-UK certified training course&#xD;
      targeted specifically for developing countries 7. These courses have been used for some years&#xD;
      in various developed countries as essential requirements for all health workers involved in&#xD;
      emergency care in these specialties. In Pakistan these training activities have been modified&#xD;
      according to local needs and conditions 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to determine, if and what degree, specific training in&#xD;
      management of general, obstetric, neonatal and pediatric emergencies results in a change in&#xD;
      practice of doctors working in emergency departments of public sector hospitals in three&#xD;
      districts of Pakistan. The overall goal of the proposed study is to test the ability of a&#xD;
      standard course (5-days training) to promote the provision of effective and evidence based&#xD;
      practices in public sector hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving mortality and morbidity during the emergency phase presents a major challenge in&#xD;
      many developing countries including Pakistan. It is important that health workers working at&#xD;
      public health facilities at district level have necessary skills and equipment to provide&#xD;
      effective management during an emergency phase. Research has shown that structured life&#xD;
      support trainings can help in reducing mortality and morbidity during the emergency phase in&#xD;
      a very cost effective manner 4. However, the evaluation of course participants poses a major&#xD;
      problem, because it is rarely possible to develop a perfect testing method, and awareness of&#xD;
      the inherent limitations of evaluation methods used in life support courses is important 8.&#xD;
      Jabbour and colleagues reviewed the effectiveness of life support courses and found that the&#xD;
      majority of studies on evaluation of the ability of life support courses have focused on less&#xD;
      direct outcomes like health workers' knowledge and silks 9. Such surrogate outcomes may not&#xD;
      necessarily reflect practice changes, which is a more useful and direct way of measuring the&#xD;
      effectiveness of life support training courses 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are not aware of any previous randomized controlled trials determining the effect of&#xD;
      ESS-EMCH training on health workers practices in a true clinical setting. Therefore, our&#xD;
      intention is to test the ability of ESS-EMCH training on practices by randomly assigning&#xD;
      pediatric ward, labor room and emergency department staff at district level to either&#xD;
      providing ESS-EMCH training or no training, considering the health worker as a unit of&#xD;
      cluster. Although, our primary outcome will only able to capture the initial steps in&#xD;
      effective practice, but we believe it will indicate an important behavior change effect.&#xD;
