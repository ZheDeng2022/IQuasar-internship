    <description>The Verathon Transurethral RF System (Lyrette® System) is indicated for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence (SUI) due to hypermobility in women who have failed conservative treatment and who are not candidates for surgical therapy.&#xD;
The treatment is a 9 minute non-surgical procedure completed using local anesthesia during a single office visit. Women are discharged home with no incisions, dressings, or catheters immediately following treatment.</description>
