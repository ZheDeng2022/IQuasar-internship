    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to work with prosthetists to fit the novel conformable socket&#xD;
      material developed by Infoscitex, to subjects, and determine if it is a viable alternative to&#xD;
      current prosthetic socket liners. During this task, the research team will travel to the&#xD;
      prosthetists locations to have them fit the subject with the conformable woven socket and a&#xD;
      check socket, and provide subjective feedback with regard to comfort and fit for the amputee,&#xD;
      its ease of use, and breathability. The subject will also wear the woven socket for gait&#xD;
      analysis and provide his/her feedback as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern prosthetics have improved significantly with regards to control and functionality, but&#xD;
      the fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket is a primary concern for many&#xD;
      amputees. A poor fit can lead to skin irritation, tissue breakdown, and pain. The volume of&#xD;
      the residual limb of an amputee changes throughout the course of a day and throughout the&#xD;
      year. Volume fluctuation within the socket can lead to issues for the amputee, including&#xD;
      decreased comfort, increased shear forces, increased pressure on bony prominences, as well as&#xD;
      a poor gait pattern. An uncomfortable or non-performing socket/residual limb interface&#xD;
      decreases user compliance with the prosthetic and therefore decreases the activity level of&#xD;
      amputees who want to remain active in their civilian and military lives. The investigators&#xD;
      are developing a multilayered socket that takes advantage of a novel braided material for&#xD;
      strength and passive conformability with thin layers dedicated to wearer comfort. This new&#xD;
      socket provides ultimate fit for improvement in the performance of the prosthesis. The socket&#xD;
      adapts itself to the changing physical shape of the residual limb as the prosthesis is worn.&#xD;
      The adaptation is a natural result of the material properties, so is done passively and in&#xD;
      real time. The materials are lightweight, breathable, and ultrasound transparent, allowing&#xD;
      the prosthetic to function in a variety of environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken to have prosthetists fit subject lower limb amputees with the&#xD;
      woven inner socket, with a check socket for evaluation in a gait lab setting. At the&#xD;
      completion, the subject and prosthetists will be asked to complete a questionnaire and give&#xD;
      their opinions regarding the material of the woven inner socket.&#xD;
