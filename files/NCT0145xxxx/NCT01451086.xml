      Pneumococcal infection is a leading cause of death throughout the world and a major cause of&#xD;
      pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that purified pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides induce antibody&#xD;
      production and such antibody is effective in preventing pneumococcal disease. Clinical&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity of each of the 23 capsular types when tested in&#xD;
      polyvalent vaccines. Studies of 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine in children of two years old&#xD;
      and older and in adults of all ages have showed immunogenic response. In order to provide&#xD;
      more evidence for the immunogenicity and the safety of the vaccine, a phase III clinical&#xD;
      trial is planed to conduct.&#xD;

      Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Pneumonia is&#xD;
      predominantly bacterial in origin: isolation rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and&#xD;
      Haemophilus influenzae were 34% and 40%, respectively, in a series of lung aspirates&#xD;
      collected from children under 5 years of age (Shann et al., 1984).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal infection is a leading cause of death throughout the world and a major cause of&#xD;
      pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strains of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae have become increasingly common in China and in other&#xD;
      parts of the world. In some areas as many as 35% of pneumococcal isolates have been reported&#xD;
      to be resistant to penicillin. Many penicillin-resistant pneumococci are also resistant to&#xD;
      other antimicrobial drugs (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and&#xD;
      extended-spectrum cephalosporins), therefore the importance of vaccine prophylaxis should be&#xD;
      emphasized against pneumococcal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology Pneumococcal infection causes approximately125,000 deaths annually in China. At&#xD;
      least 2,500,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia are estimated to occur annually in the United&#xD;
      States; S. pneumoniae accounts for approximately 25-35% of cases of community-acquired&#xD;
      bacterial pneumonia in persons who require hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and intensive medical care, the overall&#xD;
      case-fatality rate for pneumococcal bacteremia is 15-20% among adults, and among elderly&#xD;
      patients this rate is approximately 30-40%. An overall case-fatality rate of 36% was&#xD;
      documented for adult inner-city residents who were hospitalized for pneumococcal bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive pneumococcal disease (e.g., bacteremia or meningitis) and pneumonia cause high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in spite of effective antimicrobial control by antibiotics. These&#xD;
      effects of pneumococcal disease appear due to irreversible physiologic damage caused by the&#xD;
      bacteria during the first 5 days following onset of illness, and occur regardless of&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy. Vaccination offers an effective mean of further reducing the mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Factors In addition to the very young and persons 65 years of age or older, patients&#xD;
      with certain chronic conditions are at increased risk of developing pneumococcal infection&#xD;
      and severe pneumococcal illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases (e.g., congestive heart failure or&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy), chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or&#xD;
      emphysema), or chronic liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism or&#xD;
      asthma (when it occurs with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or long-term use of systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids) have an increased risk of pneumococcal disease. In adults, this population&#xD;
      is generally immunocompetent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at high risk are those who have a decreased responsiveness to polysaccharide antigen&#xD;
      or an increased rate of decline in serum antibody concentration as a result of:&#xD;
      immunosuppressive conditions (congenital immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      infection, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, or generalized&#xD;
      malignancy); organ or bone marrow transplantation; therapy with alkylating agents,&#xD;
      antimetabolites, or systemic corticosteroids; chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the highest risk of pneumococcal infection are those with functional or anatomic&#xD;
      asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy), because this condition leads to reduced&#xD;
      clearance of encapsulated bacteria from the bloodstream. Children who have sickle cell&#xD;
      disease or have had a splenectomy are at increased risk of outbreak pneumococcal sepsis&#xD;
      associated with high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity It has been established that purified pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides&#xD;
      induce antibody production and that such antibody is effective in preventing pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity of each of the 23 capsular&#xD;
      types when tested in polyvalent vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of 23-valent pneumococcal vaccines in children of two years old and older and in&#xD;
      adults of all ages have showed immunogenic responses. Protective capsular type-specific&#xD;
      antibody levels generally develop in the third week following vaccination.&#xD;
