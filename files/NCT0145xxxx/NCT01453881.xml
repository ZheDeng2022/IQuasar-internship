  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate pharmacological treatment controls symptoms in most asthmatics. Pressurized metered&#xD;
      dose inhalers (pMDI)are the most used drug delivery devices. Valved holding chambers of&#xD;
      different types and sizes have also been developed for use in combination with pMDI. The&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of treatment depends on the amount of inhaled particles. The chambers&#xD;
      can optimize lung deposition as it obviates lung-hand coordination and retain larger&#xD;
      particles. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the fine particle combination&#xD;
      pMDI Beclomethasone/Formoterol in asthma control,with or without the aid of a spacer in&#xD;
      patients without adequate asthma control on medium to high-dose inhaled steroids associated&#xD;
      with long acting beta adrenergic drugs. The hypothesis is that there is no clinical efficacy&#xD;
      difference between the two forms of drug administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel controlled study with blind outcome evaluation to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the fine particle combination Beclomethasone/Formoterol administered with or&#xD;
      without valved holding chamber (Vortex, Pari Innovative Manufacturers, VA - USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible asthma patients will begin a 2-weeks run-in period to optimize their control&#xD;
      medication use and to learn the correct relief pMDI use without holding chamber. After the&#xD;
      run-in, patients with non-controled asthma symptoms (ACT score 19 or under)in spite the use&#xD;
      of medium to high dose inhaled steroids and LABA association and able to use correctly the&#xD;
      pMDI will be randomized (block-randomization) to receive the test medication combination to&#xD;
      be used with or without the spacer device (VORTEX). Patients will be evaluated after 30 and&#xD;
      60 days. At days 15 (+,- 2) and 45 (+,- 2) they will have an incentive phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT score (translated and validated to portuguese - Brazil), FEV1 (Kit-Micro spirometer,&#xD;
      Cosmed, Italy), pMDI use and clinical evaluation will be obtained at initial visit (visit 0),&#xD;
      randomization visit (visit 1)and at 30 and 60 days (visits 2 and 3). Extra-medication allowed&#xD;
      at run-in period will be inhaled beta-2 bronchodilators for relief an at treatment period&#xD;
      inhaled beta-2 agonists for relief and systemic steroids for exacerbations, with antibiotics&#xD;
      as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint evaluations will be proceeded by a treatment blinded investigator.In order to keep&#xD;
      the concealment, the evaluations will be held in a different room and the patients instructed&#xD;
      not to comment on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded at the treatment period in case of severe asthma exacerbation&#xD;
      (hospital or ICU recovery or systemic steroid used for more than 5 days). They will be&#xD;
      excluded also in case of concomitant ailments at discretion of the attending physician. These&#xD;
      patients will be excluded from the per-protocol evaluation but will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated taking into account a relevant ACT score difference of 3 points&#xD;
      and a SD of 4.4 (SCHATZ M et all. Asthma Control Test: reliability, validity, and&#xD;
      responsiveness in patients not previously followed by asthma specialists. J Allergy Clin&#xD;
      Immunol 2006;117:549-56). In order to be able to detect this difference with α and β errors&#xD;
      of 5% and 20% respectively, the investigators calculated 32 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried according to data distribution by a professional&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
