  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past many authors have reported the abnormal contact between the rotator cuff and&#xD;
      coracoacromial arch, but the exact etiology was not clearly understood. Thus, the objectives&#xD;
      of this study relate specifically to improve the symptoms and rehabilitation of shoulder&#xD;
      function of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the effectiveness of magnet therapy in the treatment of impingement of the&#xD;
           rotator cuff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess whether the application of magnetic therapy 3 times a week for three weeks, may&#xD;
           be effective as a single treatment of impingement of the rotator cuff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess whether the combination of magnetic therapy with therapeutic exercises is more&#xD;
           effective than magnetic therapy only;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the benefits of magnetic therapy associated with therapeutic exercise in the&#xD;
           short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the effectiveness of the modulation of pulsed electromagnetic field at 25 Hz and&#xD;
           20 mT in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.&#xD;

      1. Randomization of the patients 1.1) Duration of wash-out Having made the proper screening&#xD;
           of patients undergoing the study, all pre-selected patients should discontinue any&#xD;
           medications that might influence the symptoms of impingement syndrome (such as&#xD;
           analgesics, antiinflammatory, chondroprotective, etc.) for a period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2) Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators have chosen a total sample of 30 patients undergoing the study. Only&#xD;
           one will be treated the shoulders of patients, if there are cases of bilateral&#xD;
           impingement syndrome (IS). Patients will be equally distributed in two groups, receiving&#xD;
           first place:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1: treatment with magnetic therapy, three times per week lasting 30 minutes each&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2: placebo of magnet therapy (MT), three times per week lasting 30 minutes each&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization will be done as follows: initially 10 patients will be selected to be&#xD;
           evaluated by a blinded evaluator and by the end of the evaluation, the patient will&#xD;
           randomly choose a paper folded into 2 parts, which will be inside a plastic bag. Inside&#xD;
           this bag there will be 10 paper folded in the same way and with the same color and size,&#xD;
           where in three of them will say &quot;A&quot;, two of them written in &quot;B&quot;, three of them written&#xD;
           in &quot;C&quot; and two of them &quot;D&quot; . Patients were drawn papers written &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; will be&#xD;
           selected for group 1 and patients to raffle papers written &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; will be selected&#xD;
           for group 2. After the drawing paper, the same can not be placed back in the bag.&#xD;
           Randomization will be done this way so that all patients can also be divided into two&#xD;
           groups and for the blind assessor does not know which group the patient was allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PLAN OF STUDY 2.1) Assessment 1: Patients selected for study are those referred to our&#xD;
           outpatient musculoskeletal physiotherapy with a diagnosis of impingement syndrome grade&#xD;
           II and grade III. All will be evaluated by a blinded investigator, who uses the Visual&#xD;
           Analogue Scale (VAS), the rating scale of Constant and University of California, Los&#xD;
           Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale, and measurement of rotator cuff muscle force&#xD;
           (external and internal rotation) and shoulder elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2) Assessment 2: After 3 weeks of treatment only with the applications of magneto therapy,&#xD;
      a new assessment will be equal to an evaluation made by an assessor blinded, who do not know&#xD;
      which patients are exposed to placebo or not. After the third evaluation, all patients will&#xD;
      continue with the sessions of magnetic therapy (placebo or not), but now associated with&#xD;
      specific therapeutic exercises for the treatment of impingement syndrome of the shoulder. The&#xD;
      assessment consists of two re-evaluation of all parameters previously in an evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3) Evaluation 3: The third evaluation will happen after three weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      magnetic therapy and exercises over again a blind assessor will evaluate patients in the same&#xD;
      manner as in evaluation 1 and 2. After this evaluation, patients receive high treatment and&#xD;
      receive a booklet of exercises to help them to practice proper exercises for the shoulder at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4) Evaluation 4: The fourth review will occur six months after the third evaluation, where&#xD;
      the main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment without the guidance of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist and without weekly applications of magnetic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application of methods: The investigators have chosen a total sample of 30 patients&#xD;
           undergoing the study. Only one will be treated the shoulders of patients, if there are&#xD;
           cases of bilateral impingement syndrome. Patients will be equally distributed in two&#xD;
           groups, receiving first place: Group 1: treatment with magnetic therapy, three times per&#xD;
           week lasting 30 minutes each session. Group 2: placebo of magnet therapy, three times&#xD;
           per week lasting 30 minutes each session.After the first 3 weeks of application of&#xD;
           magnetic therapy, will begin a program of therapeutic exercises (kinesiotherapy) equally&#xD;
           to all patients in both groups. These exercises will be conducted after each application&#xD;
           of magnetic therapy and all patients will receive a brochure guiding them to perform&#xD;
           exercises at home. The applications of magnetic therapy will continue to be 3 times per&#xD;
           week with 30 minutes duration each application, but this time associated with exercise,&#xD;
           treatment will be done for another 4 weeks. After these four weeks, patients will be&#xD;
           reassessed by the scale of Constant and UCLA to evaluate the overall function of the&#xD;
           shoulders that received placebo treatment and the magneto.&#xD;
