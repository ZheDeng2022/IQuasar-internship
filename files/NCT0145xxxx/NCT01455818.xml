  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots in lung arteries (pulmonary embolism) are usually detected using a radiological&#xD;
      test called computed tomography (CT scan). As technology advances, the CT scans are able to&#xD;
      detect smaller and smaller blood clots. Over time, the frequency of blood clots in the&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries has increased significantly (CT scan are now detecting very small blood&#xD;
      clots that the investigators could not see before). As a result, more and more people are on&#xD;
      blood thinners to treat these small blood clots but their true clinical significance is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of blood thinners is costly and also utilizes scarce healthcare resources.&#xD;
      These blood thinners need to be monitored with frequent blood work. Furthermore, every year,&#xD;
      approximately 3 percent of patients on blood thinners will have a major bleeding event&#xD;
      requiring medical attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators don't think that treating these small blood clots in the pulmonary arteries&#xD;
      detected on CT scan is worth the risk of bleeding from the blood thinners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to find out if it is safe to not treat very small blood clots&#xD;
      in the pulmonary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to follow 300 patients with small blood clots in their lungs for 90&#xD;
      days. These patients will not be treated with blood thinners but will be followed closely&#xD;
      with other non-invasive tests to avoid progression or recurrence of blood clots.&#xD;
