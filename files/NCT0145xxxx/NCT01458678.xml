      Goal directed volume therapy means that bolus doses of 150-250 ml colloid fluid is&#xD;
      administered to the patient during contemporary measurement of the patients stroke volume.&#xD;
      The fluid status is considered optimized when stroke volume no longer increases with more&#xD;
      than 10%, indicating that the patient is close to the top of the Frank-Starling curve.&#xD;
      Several studies show that volume optimization reduces hospital stay and reduces the amount of&#xD;
      surgical complications. The overall purpose is to investigate if the much more simple non&#xD;
      invasive technique Pleth Variability Index can replace oesophageal doppler to guide volume&#xD;
      therapy in routine health care, and to analyse if a volume kinetic test can be used to&#xD;
      evaluate hypovolemia before surgery and make specific rehydration possible by analysing the&#xD;
      correlation between this test and fluid optimization using stroke volume measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: 1. The volume of colloids that is given to volume optimise an&#xD;
      anesthetized patient using Pleth Variability Index shows a good correlation to the volume&#xD;
      used if volume optimisation is undertaken by the guidance of oesophageal doppler. 2. Data&#xD;
      from the two methods correlate and discriminates similarly volume responders from non&#xD;
      responders. 3. A volume kinetic model that indicates dehydration can predict the need for&#xD;
      rehydration in order to achieve a well hydrated patient at start of surgery.&#xD;

      The patients are not allowed to eat after midnight. Routine premedication is given with&#xD;
      paracetamol and oxynorm/oxycontin. Thrombosis and antibiotic prophylaxis is given according&#xD;
      to surgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight of the patient is notices on the morning of surgery (day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient arrives in the morning to the preoperative area. A urinary analysis is taken for&#xD;
      urinary colour, creatinine, specific weight, osmolality, microalbuminuria and electrolytes.&#xD;
      For 30 patients a volume kinetic analysis of 5 ml/kg infusion of acetated Ringers solution is&#xD;
      undertaken between 6.30 and 8.00 am on the morning of surgery. During 15 minutes 5 ml/kg&#xD;
      acetated Ringers solution is infused intravenously. Hb is continuously measured noninvasively&#xD;
      by Masimo Radical 7 pulse oximeter (MasimoHb) and invasively with maximum 13 samples a 4 ml&#xD;
      during 80 minutes (0, 10, 15, 25, 40, 50, 60 and 70 min. Double samples at start and 60 min.&#xD;
      The volume kinetic part of the study is finished after 70 min when the patient urinates and&#xD;
      the volume is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is taken to the operating theatre and MasimoHb, NT-proBNP, Troponin T hs,&#xD;
      pl-lactate, PI och PVI (stable value during 5 min) is registered before anaesthesia. Avoid&#xD;
      having blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter for PVI analysis on the same arm. Aim at PI &gt; 1&#xD;
      to get a reliable registration of PVI, otherwise try another finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia: Epidural anaesthesia according to clinical praxis (activated after the first&#xD;
      volume optimisation and kept activated during surgery) and anaesthesia according to clinical&#xD;
      practise. The ventilation during anaesthesia is maintained using volume controlled mode,&#xD;
      tidal volume 7 ml/kg (ideal weight, using the formula: men 50 + 0.91(height in centimetre&#xD;
      -152.4); women 45.5 + 0.91(height in centimetre -152.4)), PEEP 5 - 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate&#xD;
      to achieve normocapnia. Tidal volume and PEEP is maintained during surgery. The Doppler sond&#xD;
      is placed after anaesthesia induction and after that the gastric sond is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During induction of anaesthesia an amount of u to 500 ml colloid solution as well as&#xD;
      intermittently ephedrine in small doses of 2.5 - 10 mg can be given for circulatory&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are given according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative fluid regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grupp OD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic infusion: Buffered glucose 2.5% 1000 ml 2 ml/kg/h. The first volume optimization of&#xD;
      stroke volume (SV) takes place after anaesthesia induction and a stable baseline of&#xD;
      measurement is achieved. Note SV (mean value during 1 min), Flow time corrected (FTC),&#xD;
      MasimoHb and PVI (mean value during 1 min). The PVI value is only visualised to the research&#xD;
      nurse and not to the attending anaesthesiologist. Administer 3 ml/kg (actual weight) maximum&#xD;
      250 ml hydroxyethyl starch during 5 minutes. Wait for 5 minutes. Note SV, FTC, MasimoHb and&#xD;
      PVI. If SV increases more than 10 % a new colloid bolus is given. This is repeated in cycles&#xD;
      until SV not increases &gt; 10%, or DO2i &gt; 600 ml/min/m2. For every cycle SV, FTC, MasimoHb and&#xD;
      PVI are noted. The first optimization is undertaken before start of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SV, FTC, MasimoHb and PVI are followed during surgery. If SV is reduced &gt; 10% from the value&#xD;
      after the last bolus dose a new volume optimization is repeated as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 30 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch 60 mg/ml is given, colloid solution is changed to&#xD;
      albumin 4% or plasma. Bolus doses of albumin 4% and plasma are also 3 ml/kg with a maximum of&#xD;
      250 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside infusion of colloids, acetated Ringers solution 0-1000 ml can be given according to&#xD;
      the decision from the attending anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss is replaced ml by ml with colloid until Hb 90 g/l (100 if the patient has an&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease or any other condition at the discretion from the attending&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist). Thereafter replacement is given1:1 using SAG and colloid/albumin/plasma.&#xD;
      If blood loss exceeds half the blood volume replacement is given only using SAG/plasma.&#xD;
      Thrombocytes are given according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery pl-lactate and Hb is measured invasively and non-invasively (HB).&#xD;
      Estimated blood loss is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grupp PVI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic infusion: Buffered glucose 2.5% 1000 ml 2 ml/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first volume optimization of stroke volume (SV) takes place after anaesthesia induction&#xD;
      and a stable baseline of measurement is achieved. Note PVI ( mean value during 1 min),&#xD;
      MasimoHb, SV (mean value during 1 min) and Flow time corrected (FTC). Data from the&#xD;
      oesophagus doppler is only visualised to the research nurse and not to the attending&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist. Administer 3 ml/kg (actual weight) maximum 250 ml hydroxyethyl starch&#xD;
      during 5 minutes. Wait for 5 minutes. Note SV, FTC, MasimoHb and PVI. If PVI is &gt;10 % and&#xD;
      reduced give a new colloid bolus. For every cycle SV, FTC, MasimoHb and PVI are noted. The&#xD;
      first optimization is undertaken before start of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If PVI &gt;10 % the volume optimization is repeated as described above. If more than 30 ml/kg&#xD;
      hydroxyethyl starch 60 mg/ml is given, colloid solution is changed to albumin 4% or plasma.&#xD;
      Bolus doses of albumin 4% and plasma are also 3 ml/kg with a maximum of 250 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside infusion of colloids, acetated Ringers solution 0-1000 ml can be given according to&#xD;
      the decision from the attending anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss is replaced ml by ml with colloid until Hb 90 g/l (100 if the patient has an&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease or any other condition at the discretion from the attending&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist). Thereafter replacement is given1:1 using SAG and colloid/albumin/plasma.&#xD;
      If blood loss exceeds half the blood volume replacement is given only using SAG/plasma.&#xD;
      Thrombocytes are given according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery pl-lactate and Hb is measured invasively and non invasively (HB).&#xD;
      Estimated blood loss is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: If the patients' perioperative course demands that the anaesthesiologists in&#xD;
      charge deviate from the study protocol the reason for this is registered in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have a urinary bladder catheter or cystofix as decided by the surgeon. The&#xD;
      temperature of the patient is measured. Hot air blanked is used to prevent hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively after 12-24 hours and 36-48 hours pl-NT-proBNP and pl-troponinThs are&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients weight is registered the morning on the day after surgery (day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date for end of hospital stay is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded team registers postoperative complications on the 3d day after surgery according to&#xD;
      a preset protocol. The record is also reviewed retrospectively to document all complications&#xD;
      during the first 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients 1-75 Doppler and PVI are recorded simultaneously to allow analysis of&#xD;
      concordance between PVI and Doppler as guide to fluid optimization. Also biochemical analyses&#xD;
      of cardiac enzymes as part of the study are undertaken in patients 1-75. For patients 1-150&#xD;
      the outcome measure postoperative complications is registered.&#xD;
