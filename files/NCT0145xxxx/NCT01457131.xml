    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A new cancer treatment involves collecting white blood cells from an individual, modifying&#xD;
      them to secrete IL-2 and target the ESO-1 protein expressed on some cancers, and returning&#xD;
      them to the body. The cells may then be able to seek out the cancer cells and destroy them.&#xD;
      Some kinds of cancer contain a protein called ESO-1, which is found on the surface of the&#xD;
      cells. Doctors want to modify white blood cells to have an anti-ESO-1 effect, and use them to&#xD;
      treat the cancer that has the ESO-1. In addition to adding genes that target the ESO-1&#xD;
      protein to the cells, the genes for IL-12 are added to the cells. IL-12 is a protein that&#xD;
      stimulates the immune system. This type of therapy is called gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of anti-ESO-1/IL-12 white blood cells against&#xD;
      metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have metastatic cancer that expresses ESO-1 and&#xD;
      has not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have leukapheresis about a month before the treatment to collect white&#xD;
           blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have chemotherapy 5 days before the treatment to suppress the immune system,&#xD;
           and prepare the body for the anti-ESO-1/IL-12 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anti-ESO-1/IL-12 cells will be given as an infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored in the hospital during their recovery from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular followup exams every 1 to 6 months. The exams will&#xD;
           include blood tests, imaging studies, and other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to toxicities seen with the regimen, it was decided not to pursue the phase 2 portion of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In prior trials we have shown that adoptive transfer of lymphocytes, transduced with a T&#xD;
           cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 antigen, can mediate regression of&#xD;
           metastatic cancer, though responses are often transient, and complete responses are&#xD;
           rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important immunostimulatory cytokine. We have constructed a&#xD;
           retroviral vector that contains an inducible single chain IL-12 driven by an NFAT&#xD;
           responsive promoter which can be used to mediate transfer of this gene into anti-tumor&#xD;
           lymphocytes. This construct enables the secretion of IL-12 following stimulation of the&#xD;
           TCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction of the IL-12 gene into mouse anti-tumor lymphocytes results in a profound&#xD;
           increase in the ability of these lymphocytes to mediate tumor regression following&#xD;
           administration to tumor bearing mice. These cells have a profound advantage in inducing&#xD;
           anti-tumor responses because very few cells are needed and there is no requirement for&#xD;
           the concomitant administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as is the case for conventional&#xD;
           cell transfer immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on these studies we have now used a retrovirus that encodes an inducible human&#xD;
           single chain IL-12 driven by an NFAT responsive promoter and a retrovirus that encodes&#xD;
           an anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR to cotransduce autologous lymphocytes for the treatment of patients&#xD;
           with metastatic cancer that expresses the NY-ESO-1 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of IL-12 and anti-NY-ESO-1 engineered&#xD;
           lymphocytes in patients receiving a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the administration of the transduced lymphocytes to patients following a&#xD;
           nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical&#xD;
           tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the in vivo survival of cotransduced gene-engineered cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the ESO antigen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autlogous lymphocytes will be cotransduced with retroviral vectors, encoding IL-12 and&#xD;
           anti- NY-ESO-1 TCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of&#xD;
           IL-12/anti-ESO TCR gene-transduced lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, CT of the&#xD;
           chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four to six weeks after&#xD;
           treatment. If the patient has SD or tumor shrinkage, repeat complete evaluations will be&#xD;
           performed every 1-3 months. After the first year, patients continuing to respond will&#xD;
           continue to be followed with this evaluation every 3-4 months until off study criteria&#xD;
           are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design. The protocol will proceed&#xD;
           in a phase 1 dose escalation design. Initially, the protocol will enroll 1 patient in&#xD;
           each of the first 3 dose cohorts unless that patient experiences a dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicity (DLT). Following cohort 3, all subsequent cohorts will proceed in a phase 1&#xD;
           dose escalation design, with 5 cohorts of n=3. Should a single patient experience a DLT&#xD;
           due to the cell transfer at a particular dose level, additional patients would be&#xD;
           treated at that dose to confirm that no greater than 1/6 patients have a DLT prior to&#xD;
           proceeding to the next higher level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs in 3-6 patients has&#xD;
           been identified, three additional patients will be accrued at the next-lowest dose, for&#xD;
           a total of 6, in order to further characterize the safety of the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) prior to starting the phase II portion. If a DLT occurs in the first cohort, that&#xD;
           cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If 2 DLTs are encountered in this cohort, the&#xD;
           study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD has been determined, the study then will proceed to the phase II portion&#xD;
           using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled&#xD;
           in each of 2 cohorts. If 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then&#xD;
           no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients&#xD;
           enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41&#xD;
           evaluable patients have been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of lymphocyte depleting&#xD;
           chemotherapy, and IL-12/ESO TCR gene engineered lymphocytes is associated with a&#xD;
           complete response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR&#xD;
           rate (p1=0.20).&#xD;
