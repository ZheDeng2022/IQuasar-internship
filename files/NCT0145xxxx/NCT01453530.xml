      Rationale: Recovery from outpatient anesthesia includes dissipation of anesthetics agents,&#xD;
      normalization of physiological function, observation for medical or surgical complications,&#xD;
      treatment of immediate side effects of anesthesia and surgery and, ultimately, discharge and&#xD;
      return home. Street fitness implies that the patient is not only ready to go home, but is&#xD;
      also capable of safely taking part in the traffic. A full recovery of cognitive functions is&#xD;
      part of this stage. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are commonly used during surgery to&#xD;
      facilitate endotracheal intubation, allow assisted or controlled ventilation, and let surgery&#xD;
      proceed easily. Sugammadex is approved in Europe for routine clinical use to reverse&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade induced by steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Several&#xD;
      anesthesiologists from all over the world, have independently reported that patients seem to&#xD;
      be more alert in the early phase of recovery after reversal of NMB with sugammadex compared&#xD;
      to reversal with a cholinesterase inhibitor or spontaneous recovery. However, these&#xD;
      observations have not been substantiated in a clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main aim of the present study is to assess whether sugammadex has a positive&#xD;
      effect on the post-operative alertness of the patients, to assess the nature, magnitude and&#xD;
      the time of onset of this effect and if a clinically relevant effect has been observed to&#xD;
      enable the sample size calculation for a formal well-powered efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, controlled observer-blind single centre phase IV study. Upon After&#xD;
      stratification for type of surgery and age patients will be randomized to receive sugammadex&#xD;
      (arm A), neostigmine/glycopyrrolate (Arm B) or no reversal agent (arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: A total of 30 evaluable subjects, aged 18-65 years, with a medical need for&#xD;
      general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Anesthesia will be standardized according to the usual protocol. At the end of&#xD;
      the surgery when TOF ratio is ~0,9, and approximately 70-80% of nicotine receptors are still&#xD;
      blocked by rocuronium, patients will receive either sugammadex, neostigmine plus&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate, or no reversal agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: At 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the TOF ratio of ~0,9 has been&#xD;
      reached, the following commonly used, and non-invasive cognitive evaluations/scoring lists&#xD;
      will be carried out in a subsequent order to assess recovery and psychomotor function:&#xD;
      Modified Aldrete Score, the trail making test, the Maddox wing test, and visual analogue&#xD;
      scales from both observer and patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of ambulatory surgical procedures is increasing rapidly. Surgery without one or&#xD;
      more overnight stays in hospital is appreciated by most patients and has considerable&#xD;
      economic and efficiency advantages. It is facilitated by new anesthetic and analgesic drugs&#xD;
      with a more rapid onset and shorter and more reliable duration of action. Paramount for&#xD;
      successful ambulatory surgery is the timely discharge of a patient who is at the time of&#xD;
      discharge fit to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early discharge Release of patients, who later experience postoperative complications&#xD;
      requiring unanticipated hospital re-admission, should not occur. Fatigue, nausea, vomiting or&#xD;
      pain can delay the patient's discharge.2 Patients with psychomotor impairment may be prone to&#xD;
      accidents while travelling or at home.3 Short stays are an acceptable practice only if the&#xD;
      patient can return home safely and comfortably with minimal side effects from anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of recovery Recovery from outpatient anesthesia includes dissipation of anesthetic&#xD;
      agents, normalization of physiological function, observation for medical or surgical&#xD;
      complications, treatment of immediate side effects of anesthesia and surgery and, ultimately,&#xD;
      discharge and return home.4 Recovery from anesthesia may be divided into three main stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early recovery Awakening and recovery of vital reflexes. Intermediate recovery Intermediate&#xD;
      clinical recovery, home readiness. Late recovery Full recovery. Psychological recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home readiness and street fitness Intermediate recovery implies that the patient is ready to&#xD;
      go home (accompanied by a care taker). Street fitness means that the patient is not only&#xD;
      ready to go home, but is also capable of safely taking part in the traffic.6 Part of this is&#xD;
      full recovery of cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests Scoring systems developed to guide the transfer from the hospital recovery room to the&#xD;
      ward may be used to assess the early recovery of ambulatory surgical patients. The most&#xD;
      commonly used method, described by Aldrete and Kroulik provides objective information on the&#xD;
      physical condition of patients arriving in the recovery room after anesthesia.7 This test was&#xD;
      modified in 1995 and assigns a score of 0, 1 or 2 to activity, respiration, circulation,&#xD;
      consciousness and oxygenation. A score of 9 or 10 indicates adequacy of early recovery and&#xD;
      enable discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).8 Intermediate recovery to home&#xD;
      readiness cannot be determined only with early recovery tests.9 Chung suggested a&#xD;
      post-anesthetic discharge scoring system (PADSS), which may provide a reliable measure of&#xD;
      anesthetic recovery.10 PADSS is based on vital signs, ambulation and mental status, pain,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, surgical bleeding and fluid intake and output. The qualifications for&#xD;
      discharge include a postoperative discharge score of 9 or more and the presence of a&#xD;
      competent adult to accompany the patient home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of late recovery (e.g. when the patient is ready to drive a car or resume normal&#xD;
      daily activities) requires sophisticated laboratory tests that cannot be used in normal&#xD;
      clinical practice.11 Many tests have been applied to assess recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Human Performance Measurement/Basic Elements of Performance (HPM/BEP) system® (Human&#xD;
      Performance Measurement, Inc, Arlington, TX, USA) collects motor performance data. The HPM&#xD;
      module for hands (BEP 1) has been used by e.g. Haavisto.12 BEP 1 is a multifunction system&#xD;
      designed to measure different aspects of the upper extremity, including visual spatial memory&#xD;
      capacity, simple reaction time, choice reaction time, movement speed, wrist tapping and&#xD;
      co-ordination. The test-retest reliabilities of HPM/BEP tests were described in detail by&#xD;
      Kauranen, and the reliability of the system was acceptable.13 The BEP1 module includes visual&#xD;
      spatial memory capacity, simple reaction time, one-choice reaction time 1 speed of movement,&#xD;
      two-choice reaction time 1 speed of movement, index finger-tapping speed, co-ordination test,&#xD;
      digit-symbol substitution and the Maddox Wing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular blocking agents Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are commonly used during&#xD;
      surgery to facilitate endotracheal intubation, allow assisted or controlled ventilation, and&#xD;
      let surgery proceed easily. Although neuromuscular function will recover spontaneously, such&#xD;
      recovery is frequently only partial. However, a rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade (NMB) is desirable in the surgical setting to avoid residual paralysis and related&#xD;
      adverse outcomes, amongst them impaired motor behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reversal of NMB Traditionally, reversal of NMB has been accomplished with a cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitor (e.g. neostigmine, pyridostigmine, edrophonium) that acts by inhibiting the&#xD;
      breakdown of ACh in the neuromuscular junction.14 Although effective once some recovery has&#xD;
      already taken place, cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with a number of limitations,&#xD;
      including the induction of cholinergic adverse events (e.g. bradycardia, bronchospasm,&#xD;
      bronchial secretions, abdominal cramping) and incomplete reversal of NMB under certain&#xD;
      circumstances.15, 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex Sugammadex (Bridion®) has a novel approach to the rapid reversal of steroid based&#xD;
      NMBA's.17, 18 The drug has been developed in The Netherlands by Organon, which is now part of&#xD;
      Schering-Plough, which is part of Merck. The drug is a modified gamma-cyclodextrin that is&#xD;
      water soluble but has a lipophilic cavity that traps the NMBA. The formation of this&#xD;
      sugammadex/NMBA complex results in a reduction in the amount of free circulating NMBA,&#xD;
      leaving the receptor available for binding to Ach.19 Sugammadex acts selectively against the&#xD;
      steroidal NMBAs rocuronium and vecuronium but has little or no activity against nonsteroidal&#xD;
      NMBAs (eg, succinylcholine, atracurium, cisatracurium). There is no evidence that sugammadex&#xD;
      is metabolized; the drug is primarily eliminated via the renal route as unchanged drug. The&#xD;
      drug is in Europe approved for routine clinical use to reverse neuromuscular blockade induced&#xD;
      by steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In surgical patients, sugammadex produces dose-dependent reversal of NMB induced by&#xD;
      rocuronium or vecuronium.20-22 In comparative studies, sugammadex has demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness superior to cholinesterase inhibitors for NMB reversal at several time points&#xD;
      after the administration of rocuronium or vecuronium. This includes routine reversal of deep&#xD;
      or moderate NMB and immediate reversal of NMB.23-25 For example, in the routine reversal of&#xD;
      deep NMB, sugammadex was associated with a 15-fold shorter median time to recovery of the&#xD;
      T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 compared with neostigmine under sevoflurane anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex is very well tolerated with no significant cardiovascular or hemodynamic adverse&#xD;
      events.26 Dysgeusia (metallic or bitter taste) was the most common adverse event, but this&#xD;
      was primarily seen at doses ≥32 mg/kg; there were only a few reports of dysgeusia in surgical&#xD;
      patients receiving the drug. Age, gender, race, and ethnicity do not appear to influence the&#xD;
      safety of sugammadex.27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study Sugammadex has been registered in The Netherlands since October 2008.&#xD;
      Several anesthesiologists from all over the world, have independently reported that patients&#xD;
      seem to be more alert in the early phase of recovery after reversal of NMB with sugammadex&#xD;
      compared to reversal with a cholinesterase inhibitor or spontaneous recovery. However, these&#xD;
      observations have not been substantiated in a clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proven that at a TOF ratio of 0,9, i.e. when clinical muscle relaxation has&#xD;
      nearly disappeared and the patient can be safely extubated, 70-80% of the nicotine receptors&#xD;
      are still blocked by the NMBA. An explanation for the possible increase of alertness after&#xD;
      reversal with sugammadex could be that sugammadex very efficiently and quickly reverses this&#xD;
      rest blockade, resulting in a quick return of alertness and cognitive functions due to an&#xD;
      arousal from incoming signals from the γ-motor system. Because sugammadex is inert, it is&#xD;
      less likely that an unknown pharmacological effect of sugammadex, a cyclodextrin, is&#xD;
      responsible for this supposed effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased alertness immediately after anesthesia has a positive effect on patient safety and&#xD;
      wellbeing and would enable earlier discharge from the PACU. Earlier discharge contributes to&#xD;
      an efficient use of the PACU in general and might allow earlier hospital discharge for&#xD;
      patients who had surgery in the daycare setting, because they meet the street fitness&#xD;
      criteria sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study has been designed to assess whether sugammadex indeed has, compared with&#xD;
      neostigmine or placebo, a positive effect on the street fitness of patients and to assess the&#xD;
      nature, magnitude and the time of onset of this effect (if any). 30 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in three groups of 10 patients each (sugammadex, neostigmine/glycopyrrolate and no&#xD;
      reversal). These numbers are based on practical considerations, as there are no data&#xD;
      available to base a sample size calculation on. The data for this study will enable a sample&#xD;
      size calculation for a formal well-powered efficacy study. If a supposed effect on alertness&#xD;
      can be demonstrated, it may be worthwhile to investigate the mechanism of action as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have chosen for a trial design in which sugammadex will be used to reverse&#xD;
      the neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Sugammadex in the first,&#xD;
      neostigmine/glycopyrrolate in the second, and placebo in the third study arm, will be&#xD;
      administered post surgery when clinical neuromuscular function has recovered to the level of&#xD;
      TOF ratio ~ 0,9 (i.e. when 70-80% of the receptors are still occupied). It is supposed that&#xD;
      sugammadex will efficiently and quickly reverse this &quot;subclinical&quot; rest blockade, leading to&#xD;
      an increased alertness. Since a higher alertness has never been described from the&#xD;
      traditional drug neostigmine or from placebo is it not expected that they have such an&#xD;
      effect. The post surgery cognitive evaluations will be performed 30 minutes after this TOF&#xD;
      ratio has been reached. This first 30 minutes time point is considered clinically relevant.&#xD;
      In case an effect can only be demonstrated later, the relevance becomes questionable. TOF&#xD;
      will only be measured until it reaches approximately 0.9, thereafter only cognitive functions&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of commonly used cognitive tests have been selected to assess recovery and&#xD;
      psychomotor function, including the Modified Aldrete Score, the trail making test, the Maddox&#xD;
      wing test and visual analogue scales. With these tests any positive effect of sugammadex on&#xD;
      recovery and alertness should be demonstrable.&#xD;
