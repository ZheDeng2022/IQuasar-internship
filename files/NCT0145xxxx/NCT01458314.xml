  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and chronic respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency (CRI) have severe dyspnoea during exercise at low load. Physiological studies&#xD;
      performed in these patients during a unique session of training have shown a positive effect&#xD;
      on exercise tolerance if non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) was added during&#xD;
      incremental effort test or endurance. Menadue and coworkers (2009) have shown in CRI patients&#xD;
      with hypercapnia, secondary to COPD or cifoscoliosis, that combination of NIV during arm&#xD;
      effort test improved ability to perform the exercise. Similar result was not reached using&#xD;
      NIV during walking. Further studies have underlined a positive effect of the ventilation&#xD;
      therapy during exercise within specific programs of pulmonary rehabilitation (Corner 2009).&#xD;
      Moreover, the addition of NIV to an exercise training (ET) program in COPD patients may&#xD;
      produce greater benefits in exercise tolerance and quality of life than exercise training&#xD;
      alone (Garrod 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great improvement in health-related quality of life, functional status and gas exchange in&#xD;
      COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with nocturnal NIV compared with&#xD;
      patients in pulmonary rehabilitation alone has been also shown by Duieverman (2008). However,&#xD;
      in the same study Duieverman did not show any significant difference between groups in terms&#xD;
      of tolerance to effort test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate if application of daily NIV during physical training may&#xD;
      increase the benefits of rehabilitation in CRI patients with nocturnal NIV compared with&#xD;
      patients with nocturnal NIV performing training under spontaneous breathing.&#xD;

      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (NIV during training + nocturnal NIV): This group of patients will use the usual NIV&#xD;
      during night and will perform a rehabilitative program of at least 20 sessions of training at&#xD;
      cycloergometer under NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (training in Spontaneous Breathing [SB] + nocturnal NIV): This group of patients will&#xD;
      use the usual NIV during night and will be trained in a rehabilitative daily program without&#xD;
      NIV. This group will be considered the &quot;control&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions: 30 minutes/session, 2 times/day, 4-5 times a week for a total of 20-25 session in 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity: each patient will start at 50% of each individual's maximum work capacity&#xD;
      (cycloergometer) increasing up to the maximum tolerated, according to Maltais's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Facial mask with usual setting (Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure [IPAP] 10-15;&#xD;
      Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure [EPAP] 4-6 cmH20) with a possible adjustment in agreement&#xD;
      with the comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjustment of ventilation during training will be only within the first 3 sessions&#xD;
      according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients: increase up to 3 cmH2Os of EPAP and decrease up to 3 cmH2Os of IPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restricted patients: increase up to 3 cmH2Os of IPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal ventilation: mask and usual setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is evaluation of effort tolerance measured by 6 minutes&#xD;
      Walking Test (6-min Walking Test). The hypothesis is to verify a percentage of variation&#xD;
      between the two groups equal to 10% after the rehabilitative program. To get a study power of&#xD;
      80% and an alpha error &lt;5% 25 patients for group had to be enrolled.&#xD;
