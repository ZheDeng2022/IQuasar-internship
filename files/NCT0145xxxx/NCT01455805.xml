  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), is a common disorder of narrowing of the spinal canal in the&#xD;
      lower part of the back. This causes discomfort in the legs when standing or walking because&#xD;
      of pressure on the spinal nerves.There are several treatment options for LSS including&#xD;
      physiotherapy, lumbar surgical decompression procedures such as laminectomy, Foraminotomy,&#xD;
      Discectomy and more recently devices for interspinous distraction such as the XSTOP® and from&#xD;
      May 2011 Minuteman™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical decompression for LSS involves the removal of excess bone, ligament, and soft-tissue&#xD;
      allowing more room for the nerves. The operation is usually preformed under general&#xD;
      anaesthetic and with an average stay in hospital for 2-3 nights. Whereas the Minuteman™&#xD;
      implant is preformed as a day case under local or general anaesthetic and involves implanting&#xD;
      the device into the space between two back bones to relieve pressure on the nerves and,&#xD;
      therefore, pain in the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi centred (four sites) randomised controlled trial with a total sample of 50&#xD;
      participants after obtaining their informed consent. Participants will attend the pain clinic&#xD;
      at the Hospitals for a baseline visit where they will be randomised with a ratio of 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive either the Minuteman™ Interspinous interlaminar fusion Implant or standard surgical&#xD;
      decompression for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Following randomisation&#xD;
      arrangements will be made for the participant to receive the randomised treatment. If&#xD;
      allocated to Minuteman™ Implant, the treatment will be conducted by the Pain Specialist&#xD;
      identified at the site. If allocated to surgical decompression, the treatment will be&#xD;
      conducted by the neuro/spinal-surgeon identified at the site. Participates will be followed&#xD;
      up regularly for 60 months post implant to assess clinical efficacy, safety, participants&#xD;
      function and quality of life of each treatment.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomised study monitoring patients for up to 5 years post treatment.&#xD;
      Only patients who have an appropriately diagnosed Lumbar Spinal Stenosis with intermittent&#xD;
      claudication with/without low back pain, with no adequate symptomatic relief after at least 6&#xD;
      months of conservative treatment will be asked to give consent to be involved. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be approached for enrollment 17days before the planned baseline visit.&#xD;
      Patients will be given oral and written information about the trial as well as the patient&#xD;
      information leaflet for the study. If informed consent is given their participation in this&#xD;
      study will be for a maximum of 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>The Minuteman™ interspinous interlaminar fusion device consists of a central threaded portion that has a two-part wing plate hinged near its proximal end, with spikes on the extended distal end of the wing plate, and a multi-spiked end cap plate that is located at the distal end of the device and is retained and tightened in place with a locking hex nut. Compression between the spiked wing plate and the spiked end cap plate serves to fix the spinous processes in place and to facilitate fusion, together with bone graft fusion material placed within the device. The threaded external body has been designed to provide ease of distraction and insertion via a minimally invasive surgical procedure.</description>
