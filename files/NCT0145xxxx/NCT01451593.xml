  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis is caused by inflammation of the optic nerve and causes loss of vision in the&#xD;
      affected eye. It is often associated with multiple sclerosis. Loss of vision after an attack&#xD;
      of optic neuritis is caused by damage to the nerve fibres in the optic nerve. There are a&#xD;
      number of factors that contribute to nerve fibre damage including increased levels of sodium&#xD;
      within them, so blocking sodium entry could help to protect them against damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is determine whether phenytoin (which blocks sodium entry into&#xD;
      cells) can protect against loss of nerve fibres and prevent loss of vision after optic&#xD;
      neuritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demyelinating optic neuritis is the most common cause of acute reversible visual loss in&#xD;
      young adults of Northern European Origin. There is a strong association with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and up to 75% of British adults with acute clinically isolated optic neuritis go on&#xD;
      to develop MS during long term follow up. Equally, 70% of MS patients have clinical evidence&#xD;
      if optic nerve involvement during the course of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology of the acute inflammatory lesion is comparable to the plaques found elsewhere&#xD;
      in the CNS in MS. The retina and optic nerve therefore represent a discrete compartment of&#xD;
      the CNS affected by the disease process that can be easily studied using a combination of&#xD;
      clinical, electrophysiological and imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good evidence that axonal and neuronal degeneration are the primary pathological&#xD;
      processes leading to irreversible disability in MS. Experimental models have demonstrated&#xD;
      numerous mechanisms of axonal loss including adaptive changes in the demyelinated axonal&#xD;
      membrane, in particular increased density of sodium channels leading to increased&#xD;
      concentrations of intraaxonal sodium ions. Partial blockade of voltage gated sodium channels&#xD;
      with drugs such as phenytoin has been shown to be neuroprotective in several experimental&#xD;
      models of inflammatory axonal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retinal nerve fibre layer is unique in the CNS in that it is not myelinated and therefore&#xD;
      is an ideal biomarker for the processes of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of the retinal nerve fibre layer using optical coherence tomography and of the optic&#xD;
      nerve using MRI both demonstrate that acute optic neuritis is associated with significant&#xD;
      volume loss, and this correlates well with impaired visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to assess whether sodium channel blockade with phenytoin has&#xD;
      a neuroprotective effect on axonal loss after an attack of acute demyelinating optic&#xD;
      neuritis. Secondary aims are to assess whether phenytoin improves visual outcome and&#xD;
      remyelination and to assess the safety of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 patients with acute optic neuritis will be recruited into a double blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial in which patients will be randomly allocated to receive either phenytoin or&#xD;
      placebo for 3 months. Recruitment will take place at two trial sites in Sheffield and London.&#xD;
      The trial is powered to detect a 50% beneficial effect on the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
      Outcome will be measured at entry and after 6 months.Bias will be minimized by blinding&#xD;
      assessing physicians and patients using active and placebo treatment of identical appearance.&#xD;
