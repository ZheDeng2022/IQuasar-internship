      INTRODUCTION Addressing the high costs involved in new medical technology (biotechnology) is&#xD;
      a problem that has led individuals and public health services to feel increasingly powerless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many authors say that not even an efficient use of resources can ensure better care and&#xD;
      health care, a true bottomless pit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem is the conceptual and ideological bases of thinking and acting of the&#xD;
      professionals involved. The first misunderstanding is the &quot;narrow approach&quot; and the second is&#xD;
      the &quot;process of medicalization.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curative model and the restricted approach The curative model gets this name because it&#xD;
      is not concerned with the causes of the disease process (prevention), only with the effects&#xD;
      (the disease). As the effects can be mitigated or even extinct, it is only temporary, because&#xD;
      sooner or later they will return with the same format or not, in the same individual or&#xD;
      another. It is extremely costly for individuals and for society, because the solutions are&#xD;
      palliative. The approach is limited and so are results too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of medicalization Medicalization is the ultimate expression of the distortions of&#xD;
      thinking and consequences of the model of health care regulations. It can be understood as&#xD;
      the increasingly high dependence on individuals and society overestimating the role that&#xD;
      biotechnology could play, and creating a dependency in which one believes that for any&#xD;
      problem, regardless of its severity or causal links, there will be a life-saving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wrong postures and maintenance of unhealthy habits The model of health care can lead to&#xD;
      wrong postures. Many of today's health problems have a direct causal relationship with the&#xD;
      passive attitude of individuals, who delegate (to health care and biotechnology) full&#xD;
      responsibility for treating their ailments, are reluctant to bring about changes in habits&#xD;
      and behaviors because the &quot;curative medicine holds that the doctors can take a magic bullet&#xD;
      and get our problems solved.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong interest in maintaining the healing model The curative model has a tendency to&#xD;
      concentrate on the application of biotechnology to strengthen the multinational&#xD;
      pharmaceutical industry and large firms in highly sophisticated biomedical equipment. This&#xD;
      has generated a stunning increase of expenditure on health as well as strong interest in this&#xD;
      market maintaining its hegemonic space through emphasis on &quot;cure(medicalization of life&quot;,&#xD;
      rather than the emphasis on prevention and changing habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study This study will aim to test, in patients with functional dyspepsia, a model&#xD;
      example of medical care based upon the biopsychosocial model (called: the therapeutic&#xD;
      encounter) compared with standard medical care based upon the biomedical model (called:&#xD;
      medical consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the biopsychosocial model The biopsychosocial model does not focus exclusively on&#xD;
      organic disease. It considers the thinking process of becoming ill with multiple causalities.&#xD;
      It tries to understand the man, their psychological, biological, socio-cultural and spiritual&#xD;
      interconnections. It argues that the way of being and becoming ill are constructions of the&#xD;
      life history of each individual, where the psychological and physiological are inextricably&#xD;
      linked. In this perspective, disease becomes an expression of internal conflicts, has a&#xD;
      personal character and is linked to the person's relationship with his world (its&#xD;
      environment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach has important consequences in medical practice as the doctor's focus of&#xD;
      attention shifts to the individual diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical care based upon the biopsychosocial model conserves the characteristics of art of&#xD;
      medicine. Art in the sense of craftsmanship (the &quot;tailored&quot;) as opposed to biomedical&#xD;
      technique that is (to systematize, generalize). In fact one must know deeply the technique to&#xD;
      apply it with art.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus continues to be what the patient has in common with others, but in its&#xD;
      quirks (it is the art of medicine). It is considered less important if a particular treatment&#xD;
      will work, thinking of the majority of patients (the technique), but whether it will work for&#xD;
      this particular patient, with his personal problems at the moment of his life in this&#xD;
      environment, this location in this country and this region of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why test it in functional dyspepsia patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia is part of a group of diseases called &quot;Functional Disorders of the&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Tract&quot; that goes beyond the biomedical model:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are defined as variable combinations of symptoms, not explained by structural or&#xD;
           biochemical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnostic criteria and parameters for better or worse are based on symptoms&#xD;
           reported by patients, this causes some skepticism in the face of more traditional&#xD;
           medical view. There are no objective criteria for assessing these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why to use placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of placebo in this study is justified due to the facts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of functional dyspepsia have a high rate of improvement with placebo.&#xD;
           Comparative studies with some drugs show that the placebo effect is up to the order of&#xD;
           30 to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  can not rule out the placebo effect, if the magnitude of this drug therapies are not&#xD;
           compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the study This study is justified for several reasons, but mainly by the&#xD;
      limitations of the biomedical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The changes in the epidemiological profile (which has been occurring in recent decades)&#xD;
           are increasingly leaving very clear the role of psychological, socio-cultural and&#xD;
           spiritual factors, as expressed by the personality and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same biomedicine with its progress and sophistication is showing its inability to&#xD;
           provide satisfactory or conclusive answers to many problems, especially for the&#xD;
           subjective components that come into greater or lesser degree in any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomedicine is too limited in its explanatory power. Many medical professionals realize the&#xD;
      psychological reactions of patients and their socioeconomic problems involved in the disease&#xD;
      but do not see how to incorporate this information in formulating diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      decisions. The idea of ilness as a phenomenon more or less accidental, originating in the&#xD;
      biochemical processes of the body is very restricted, and therefore produces restricted&#xD;
      results too.&#xD;
