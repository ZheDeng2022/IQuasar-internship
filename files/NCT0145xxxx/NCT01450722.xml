      Chronic lower limb ischemia due to atherosclerosis causes significant morbidity especially in&#xD;
      elderly: the prevalence of asymptomatic obstructive peripheral atherosclerosis among 40-74&#xD;
      old is 4-22%. The prevalence of its milder symptomatic manifestation, intermittent&#xD;
      claudication among 40 years old men is about 1% and among 70 years old it is 7%. In about 10%&#xD;
      of the patients the ischemia worsens to threat the vitality of the limb. Although&#xD;
      intermittent claudication has a benign prognosis and can often treated conservatively, more&#xD;
      severe forms with extensive arterial obstructions require revascularization, either open&#xD;
      surgical or endovascular. Surgical bypass operations are currently the standard reference for&#xD;
      treating long femoral artery obstructions. Surgical bypass operations are accompanied by&#xD;
      significant acute complications and late adverse effects, especially in patients with&#xD;
      associated cardio-cerebrovascular and pulmonary diseases, and less invasive, safe, and&#xD;
      effective endovascular therapies are seeked for. The long term patency rates of infrainguinal&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty (PTA) vary largely in different studies but they are mostly poor when&#xD;
      long femoral arterial obstructions have been treated. Drug eluting stents have shown great&#xD;
      promise in coronary artery interventions. The purpose of this study is to compare Paclitaxel&#xD;
      eluting Zilver PTX nitinol stent (Cook INC) with bypass surgery using PTFE graft to proximal&#xD;
      popliteal artery in the treatment of long femoral artery obstructions (total length of 10-25&#xD;
      cm) in a prospective, randomized, Finnish multi center trial with consecutive claudicant and&#xD;
      chronic critical ischemia patients. The aim is to randomize altogether 400 patients during&#xD;
      about two years in five universities and in 2-3 central hospitals. The primary end point is&#xD;
      patency at 24 month follow up. Secondary end points are primary success at patient discharge,&#xD;
      complications, 30-day mortality, target lesion revascularization, quality of life, and&#xD;
      economical analysis.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Chronic lower limb ischemia due to atherosclerosis causes significant morbidity&#xD;
      especially in elderly: the prevalence of asymptomatic obstructive peripheral atherosclerosis&#xD;
      among 40-74 old is 4-22%. The prevalence of its milder symptomatic manifestation,&#xD;
      intermittent claudication among 40 years old men is about 1% and among 70 years old it is 7%.&#xD;
      In about 10% of the patients the ischemia worsens to threat the vitality of the limb.&#xD;
      Although intermittent claudication has a benign prognosis and can often treated&#xD;
      conservatively, more severe forms with extensive arterial obstructions require&#xD;
      revascularization, either open surgical or endovascular. Surgical bypass operation is&#xD;
      currently the standard reference for treating long SFA obstructions. Up to 81% two-year&#xD;
      patency can be appreciated after bypass with a good quality sapheneous vein. If synthetic&#xD;
      graft is used the long term patency is somewhat lower, up to 67% according to a systematic&#xD;
      review (Klinkert et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term patency rates of infrainguinal balloon angioplasty (PTA) vary largely in&#xD;
      different studies. At 1 year, primary patency rates of 47% to 86%, at three years 27% to 69%,&#xD;
      and at six years 23% to 36% are reported in the literature. Highly variable and mostly poor&#xD;
      patency rates, between 22 to 64% at 6-12 months have been reported by using subintimal&#xD;
      angioplasty for the treatment of femoral and femoropopliteal lesions. (Met et al. 2008) In&#xD;
      the femoropopliteal region, highly variable 1-year primary patency rates between 22% and 81%&#xD;
      with various stents have been reported (Matsi et al 1994, Sapoval et al 1992, Grimm et al&#xD;
      2001, Lugmayr et al 2002). In three randomised studies, although the primary success rate of&#xD;
      stent placement was higher than that after balloon angioplasty alone, the long-term patency&#xD;
      was not improved by using stents (Cejna et al 2001, Grimm 2001). A meta-analysis revealed&#xD;
      similar patency rates after balloon dilation and stent implantation (34). The authors of the&#xD;
      largest randomized multicenter comparison of femoropopliteal PTA and balloon expanded stent&#xD;
      placement with 154 treated limbs summarised that the beneficial effect of stents is to rescue&#xD;
      PTA failures (54). In one study three year primary patency rate of 76% was obtained after&#xD;
      primary stenting of relatively short, less than 6 cm long lesions (Lugmayr et al 2002).&#xD;
      However, midterm restenosis after long-segment femoropopliteal stenting remains a problem. In&#xD;
      recent single-center observational study in which long segments (median length 16 cm) were&#xD;
      covered by nitinol stent after initial failure of PTA, the primary patency was only 54% at&#xD;
      one year. Stent in the femoropopliteal artery are exposed to unique long term stress in the&#xD;
      form of repeated compression, flexion and torsion and it is probably the reason why recent&#xD;
      studies have revealed stent fractures in up to 50% of nitinol stents 1 year after placement&#xD;
      (Schneinert et al 2005) and in 19% of Wallstents a mean of 43 months after placement (Sclager&#xD;
      et al 2005). The fractures seem to be associated with poorer patency and they are more common&#xD;
      in longer stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug eluting stents have shown great promise in coronary artery interventions. One of these&#xD;
      drugs, sirolimus, that is a natural macrocyclic lactone with potent immunosuppressive and&#xD;
      antimitotic action, has been tried also at femoral arteries. Sirolimus-eluting self-expanding&#xD;
      nitinol SMART stent was compared in a small (57 patients) randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      multi-center study with the bare metal stent (SIROCCO II trial) in treating femoral artery&#xD;
      lesions with average length of 8 cm (Duda et al 2005). Exceptionally low angiographically&#xD;
      verified binary restenosis rate of 7.7% was registered at the bare metal stent group.&#xD;
      Although the restenosis rate was zero and there was less mean late loss in diameter in the&#xD;
      drug stent group the difference did not reach statistical difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor and another antiproliferative agent and widely used,&#xD;
      effective agent in drug eluting stents to reduce restenosis in coronary circulation.&#xD;
      Paclitaxel binds specifically to the beta-tubulin subunit of microtubules and appears to&#xD;
      antagonize the disassembly of this key cytoskeletal protein; this action results in&#xD;
      accumulation of microtubule bundles and aberrant microtubular derived structures in the&#xD;
      mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Zilver PTX (Cook Medical) paclitaxel-eluting stent is&#xD;
      designed for the SFA. It is a nitinol stent coated with paclitaxel only, with no polymer or&#xD;
      binder. A recent prospective, randomized trial reported significantly better 24-month&#xD;
      event-free survival among patient receiving PTX stent than among those treated with PTA&#xD;
      (86,6% vs. 77.6%, p&lt;0.01). Primary patency at 24 months of the PTX stent group was 74.8% vs&#xD;
      32.4% for the PTA group. (Dake , LINC 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND STUDY RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Paclitaxel eluting Zilver PTX stent (Cook INC) with bypass surgery using PTFE&#xD;
      graft to proximal popliteal artery in the treatment of long SFA obstructions in a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, Finnish multi center trial with consecutive claudicant and chronic&#xD;
      critical ischemia patients. Bypass with a synthetic graft instead of autogeneous vein is used&#xD;
      as a reference standard because of the difficulty to standardize the quality of available&#xD;
      vein and because the bypass done to the proximal popliteal artery with the graft types gives&#xD;
      very similar results. The aim is to randomize altogether 400 patients during about two years&#xD;
      in five university and in 2-3 central hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power analysis of study is based on non-inferiority hypothesis, i.e. to show that&#xD;
      paclitaxel eluting stent is not inferior to bypass surgery in 24 month patency. With accepted&#xD;
      marginal for equality 5%, assuming surgical group patency 75% and non-inferiority margin 10%&#xD;
      and using 1:1 randomization the sample size for a power of 80% to detect non-inferiority of&#xD;
      the test treatment is 590 (295/295).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be asked to the study by vascular&#xD;
      surgeon or interventional radiologist after the diagnostic imaging study. A consensus of a&#xD;
      vascular surgeon and interventional radiologist is required: for an elective patient this is&#xD;
      acquired in a weekly vascular meeting and for an urgent patient by consultation. The patient&#xD;
      will be provided no additional compensation for participation but normal travel expenses for&#xD;
      clinical visits will be paid. The patient's identity and personal study data will be&#xD;
      available only for the researchers of the trial. Normal clinical patient insurance is&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREOPERATIVE IMAGING AND VASCULAR LAB&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-angio, CT angio, or catheter angio (DSA) is performed for planning of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle brachial index is measured..&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon angioplasty is performed before and after stent placement. Stenting is done from&#xD;
      healthy-to-healthy segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
