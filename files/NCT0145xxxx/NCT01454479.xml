  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the 8th most common female cancer in Taiwan. Its incidence is&#xD;
      increasing in the recent few years, around 1,200 new cases per year. The outcome of recurrent&#xD;
      EC is disappointing, except focal recurrences that could be irradiated or removed.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is currently the most common salvage treatment for recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
      However, the response rate (RR) to 2nd-line treatment is approximately 0-27.3%, with short&#xD;
      median time to progression, 2-3.9 months and low overall survival, 6.4-11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to progress of studies on the molecular and genetic basis of cancer and cellular&#xD;
      signaling pathways, targeted therapy has been developed for various cancer treatments. A&#xD;
      Gynecologic Oncology Group study found 44% of advanced endometrial cancer had HER&gt;=2+ and the&#xD;
      ratio of HER2:chromosome 17 (CEP17) &gt;=2. Another study showed that HER&gt;=2+ was seen in 47% of&#xD;
      carcinosarcoma. These evidences indicated HER2 gene amplification and HER2 overexpression&#xD;
      occur in endometrial cancer and carcinosarcoma, especially in those of high grade and&#xD;
      recurrence. Lapatinib (L), an oral inhibitor of both EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor)&#xD;
      and HER2(human epidermal growth receptor), has been shown to be an effective treatment in&#xD;
      HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analog of&#xD;
      the natural product epothilone B, and recently has been approved by US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration as a treatment option in metastatic breast cancer. It was also observed that&#xD;
      lapatinib + ixabepilone killed more breast tumor cells than trastuzumab + paclitaxel in&#xD;
      vitro. Two GOG(Gynecologic Oncology Group) studies had reported that weekly Ixabepilone as&#xD;
      2nd-line chemotherapy provided a similar RR to 3-weekly regimen of 14.3% in platinum- and&#xD;
      taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer with less severe toxicities. The combination of&#xD;
      lapatinib and ixabepilone is expected to become an effective treatment for recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer and carcinosarcoma, but the ideal dose is yet to be surveyed.&#xD;

      Patients receive weekly Ixabepilone 32 mg/m2 (D1) and a 4-level of oral Lapatinib 500-1250 mg&#xD;
      once daily continuously. The recommended duration of treatment for each patient 21 days a&#xD;
      cycle of total 6 cycles or until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity or patient's&#xD;
