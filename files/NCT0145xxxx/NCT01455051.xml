  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A good proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be managed&#xD;
      effectively with palliative chemotherapy. However, there is a group of younger patients with&#xD;
      poor risk disease whose life expectancy is significantly reduced. As a result, reduced&#xD;
      intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has&#xD;
      been investigated as a potentially curative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) published a set of&#xD;
      guidelines suggesting situations where allo-HCT might be considered a therapeutic option for&#xD;
      CLL patients. Their conclusions were that allo-HCT was reasonable for younger CLL patients&#xD;
      refractory to fludarabine, relapsing within two years of intensive treatment, or with p53&#xD;
      abnormalities requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the results with RIC allo-HCT are not entirely satisfactory, and progression-free&#xD;
      survival after allo-HCT revolves around 35-40% at 3-5 years following allo-HCT. This is due&#xD;
      to non-relapse mortality, which is significantly associated with the development of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but also due to disease relapse. These relapses may occur&#xD;
      early in the course of the transplantation, like any other hematological malignancy, but late&#xD;
      relapses have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strategies have been tested in order to improve these results. The anti-CD20&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody rituximab, given concomitantly with allo-HCT or donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusions, may reduce graft-versus-host disease and facilitate disease control. This may be&#xD;
      due, not only to direct cytotoxicity, but also to modulation of GVHD and the graft-versus CLL&#xD;
      effect (GVCLL). Interestingly, rituximab has been shown to promote the cross-presentation of&#xD;
      tumor-derived peptides by antigen-presenting cells, thus enhancing the formation of cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-cell clones and a GVCLL effect. With the addition of rituximab to the conditioning regimen,&#xD;
      rates at 4 years for current progression-free survival (CPFS) and overall survival were 44%&#xD;
      and 48%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that ofatumumab, having a more potent anti-CLL activity and&#xD;
      complement-dependent cytoxicity than rituximab, could improve disease control and modulate&#xD;
      the GVCLL effect more effectively, thus reducing the GVHD rate and subsequently improving the&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality and progression-free survival in the long term.&#xD;
