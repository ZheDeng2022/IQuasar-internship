  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human body has a natural stress response to surgery, including the formation of blood&#xD;
      clots. This response to surgery has been shown to increase metastases (the spread of cancer&#xD;
      cells to other organs in the body). These metastases cannot be seen at the time of surgery&#xD;
      but when they grow into new tumors, the cancer has recurred (come back). A blood thinner&#xD;
      called &quot;low molecular weight heparin&quot; (LMWH) can suppress the development of metastases after&#xD;
      surgery in animal experiments. The investigators want to see if giving patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer the blood thinner, LMWH, around the time of surgery can decrease the chance&#xD;
      of their cancer spreading to other organs (metastases) and coming back (recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators need 1075 patients to answer our scientific question. Patients who give&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomly put into one of two groups, the experimental group and the&#xD;
      control group. The patients in the control group will be treated with LMWH starting a few&#xD;
      hours after surgery and every day until they leave the hospital. This is how most patients&#xD;
      are treated after colon cancer surgery (standard care). The patients in the experimental&#xD;
      group will be treated with LMWH for a longer period of time, starting on the day they agree&#xD;
      to have surgery and continuing for two months after surgery. All the patients will be&#xD;
      followed for at least three years after surgery to find out if their cancer has recurred&#xD;
      (come back). If LMWH treatment around the time of surgery reduces the chance of recurrence in&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer, it would improve the health and quality of life for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
