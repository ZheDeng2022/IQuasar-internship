  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe drug concentrations in blood plasma, rectal fluid,&#xD;
      rectal tissue, and seminal fluid in HIV negative men following single and multiple doses of&#xD;
      an investigational HIV medication known as GSK1349572 (dolutegravir).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to determine first dose and steady-state concentrations of&#xD;
      GSK1349572 in seminal fluid, rectal mucosal fluid, and rectal tissue compared to blood plasma&#xD;
      (BP) in HIV-1 negative males. GSK1349572 is an investigational next generation integrase&#xD;
      inhibitor currently in Phase III trials. Understanding the concentrations of GSK1349572 in&#xD;
      multiple male biological compartments will inform its role in preventing HIV infection by&#xD;
      making an HIV-infected person less likely to transmit the virus, and protecting uninfected&#xD;
      persons from acquiring the virus.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will take a GSK1349572 (dolutegravir) 50mg tablet by mouth once daily for 8 days. GSK1349572 concentrations will be measured in blood plasma, seminal fluid, rectal fluid, and rectal tissue over 24 hours after a single dose and over two 24 hour periods once steady state is reached. Blood plasma will be collected pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours after dosing.
