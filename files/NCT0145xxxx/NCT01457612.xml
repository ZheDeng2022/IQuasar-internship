  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to investigate the potential chronic beneficial effect of&#xD;
      polyphenolics derived from strawberry on impaired insulin signaling in insulin resistant&#xD;
      individuals through their ability to modulate oxidative- and inflammatory-markers that lead&#xD;
      to devastating disease, including, but not limited to, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized and single blinded, placebo-controlled, 6-week,&#xD;
      parallel design study with follow-up to evaluate strawberry-associated chronic improvements&#xD;
      in insulin action resulting in reduced whole body insulin resistance and improved glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. This study will take approximately 11~12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will follow an extremely limited polyphenolic diet throughout the duration of their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limited diet will begin 7 days before the first study visit and end before the last study&#xD;
      visit. Following the polyphenol-free 7-day run in period, at Week 0, subjects will be&#xD;
      scheduled to return to the Center for sequence randomization, an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test&#xD;
      (OGTT) as well as a Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) procedure to measure endothelial function.&#xD;
      Subjects will incorporate either one of tow Placebo Beverages (PBO1, n=15; PBO2, n=15) or&#xD;
      Strawberry Beverage (STR, n=15, an optimal strawberry test dose of 40 g/d) into their diet&#xD;
      daily for a period of 6 weeks. Subjects will consume randomly assigned beverage twice per day&#xD;
      with their breakfast and dinner meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to come to the Center once a week where they will receive a week's&#xD;
      supply of beverages. Additionally, fasting clinical and laboratory variables,&#xD;
      anthropometrics, and vital sign measurements will be assessed at each bi-weekly visit at Week&#xD;
      3 and Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the same procedures at the end of Week 6: fasting blood sample&#xD;
      collection for analysis of insulin, glucose, oxidative and inflammatory markers, an OGTT to&#xD;
      assess glucose handling, as well as a FMD procedure to assess endothelial function in&#xD;
      response to 6 weeks of either the Placebo or Strawberry treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to visit the Center 4 weeks after the end of their intervention&#xD;
      period (Week 10), at which time they will undergo their last anthropometrics and vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, a 4 hour OGTT, and the FMD procedure.&#xD;
