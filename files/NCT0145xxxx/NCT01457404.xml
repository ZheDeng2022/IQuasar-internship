      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and practicality, feasibility and efficacy&#xD;
      of ICBT for co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders within the OEF/OIF/OND Veterans&#xD;
      population, as delivered by routine clinicians at the Veterans Affairs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will evaluate the safety and practicality, feasibility, and efficacy of&#xD;
      a relatively simple, manual guided integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). ICBT (a&#xD;
      revised edition of what was formerly called cognitive behavioral therapy for posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder [CBT for PTSD]) has been designed and developed for delivery by counselors&#xD;
      employed in community addiction treatment programs and offered in conjunction with standard&#xD;
      community addiction treatment. The investigators have completed a Stage I Safety &amp;&#xD;
      Practicality Study, Feasibility Study and Pilot Randomized Controlled Study (comparing ICBT&#xD;
      versus a control condition) in community addiction treatment and for all studies found that&#xD;
      ICBT was safe and effective in reducing PTSD symptoms, improving retention, and in reducing&#xD;
      substance use. The present study proposes to conduct a Stage I study of ICBT among Operation&#xD;
      Enduring Freedom (OEF) Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) Veterans&#xD;
      within the Veterans Affairs treatment setting. The investigators will modify the existing&#xD;
      ICBT for testing in a VA setting, and use a combined individual and group modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 specific aims for this study, and hypotheses for each aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the feasibility of ICBT with OEF/OIF/OND Veterans diagnosed with PTSD and&#xD;
      substance use disorders, and assess substance use and PTSD outcomes at 3- and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up (Stage I Phase I: Safety and practicality testing; Feasibility Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This aim is to test the effect of ICBT on symptoms of PTSD and substance use disorders&#xD;
           among returning OEF/OIF/OND Veterans seen in a VA clinic. ICBT will be tested with 16&#xD;
           Veterans who meet criteria for both PTSD and substance use disorder at the PTSD or SATP&#xD;
           clinics. The investigators propose that ICBT will result in significant reductions in&#xD;
           PTSD and substance use severity from baseline to follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Participants receiving ICBT will have significant reductions in PTSD&#xD;
           symptom severity as assessed by their Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score&#xD;
           from baseline to a 6-month follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Participants receiving ICBT will have significant reductions in substance&#xD;
           use as assessed by their Addiction Severity Index (ASI) drug and alcohol severity&#xD;
           composite scores from baseline to a 6-month follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To revise the ICBT materials and protocol based on Stage I Phase I findings (Stage I&#xD;
      Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Based on experience and lessons learned in Stage I Phase I, the investigators will refine&#xD;
      and improve the ICBT approach and study methods for teh Stage I Phase III randomized pilot&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial comparing ICBT plus standard Substance&#xD;
      Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) or PTSD care versus standard SATP or PTSD care alone, with&#xD;
      OEF/OIF/OND Veterans diagnosed with PTSD and substance use disorders, and assess substance&#xD;
      use and PTSD outcomes at post treatment and 3-month post treatment follow-up (Stage I Phase&#xD;
      III: Randomized Pilot Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of ICBT will be tested among 64 Veterans who screen positive for both&#xD;
           disorders and are randomly assigned to either ICBT or standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Participants receiving ICBT plus standard care will have greater&#xD;
           reductions in PTSD symptoms, as assessed by their CAPS score from baseline to follow-up,&#xD;
           than participants receiving standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Participants receiving ICBT plus standard care will have greater&#xD;
           reductions in substance use, as assessed by their ASI drug and alcohol severity&#xD;
           composite scores from baseline to follow-up, as compared to participants receiving&#xD;
           standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be receiving PTSD or substance use treatment services at the&#xD;
      Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC), and will be referred by clinicians in&#xD;
      these respective clinics for participation in the study. Patients will be approached by the&#xD;
      clinic staff about potential interest in the study. If they wish to learn more about the&#xD;
      study, the research coordinator (an on-site employee) is contacted, a suitable time arranged,&#xD;
      and the patient is engaged in the process of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If consent is granted, the subjects completes the baseline assessment. The baseline&#xD;
      assessment consists of measures gathered via interview by a member of the research team,&#xD;
      self-administered surveys completed directly by the subject, and review of the subject's&#xD;
      medical record to extract demographic, substance use, and treatment history information, as&#xD;
      well as chart diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview portion of the assessment consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized interviews designed to assess PTSD and Axis I DSM-IV substance use&#xD;
           disorders: Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Structured Clinical&#xD;
           Interview for DSM-IV-TR, Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) Section E.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine screen and breathalyzer to test for alcohol and other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized follow-back method for gathering data on recent alcohol and drug use:&#xD;
           Time-line Follow-back Calendar (TLFB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-administered portion of the assessment consists of measures designed to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol and drug use, as well as associated problems in other life areas such as&#xD;
           medical, employment, legal, social, and psychiatric: Addiction Severity Index (ASI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject continues to meet criteria for PTSD (i.e. the CAPS interview confirms&#xD;
      diagnosis of DSM-IV PTSD, with symptom severity at 44 or higher), he or she is eligible to&#xD;
      participate. For Stage I Phase I, the patient would receive the ICBT therapy. For Stage I&#xD;
      Phase III, the patient would be randomized to receive either the ICBT therapy plus standard&#xD;
      treatment, or standard treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research assessments are then also conducted at three months and six months post baseline&#xD;
      assessment. This follow-up assessment will consist of the same measures administered at&#xD;
      baseline, with the exception of the SCID interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll approximately 16 subjects in the Stage I Phase I and to&#xD;
      randomize approximately 64 subjects in the Stage I Phase III of the study. The subject&#xD;
      outcome and program experiences with the protocol will be used in planning the subsequent&#xD;
      federal grant application for a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) is a non-exposure based, manual-guided individual or group therapy. ICBT consists of 3 learning and skill components designed to improve PTSD symptoms and substance use: 1) Patient education about PTSD and its relation to substance use and treatment; 2) Mindful relaxation: A behavioral anxiety reduction skill including centering and breathing techniques; and 3) Cognitive restructuring/flexible thinking: A cognitive approach and functional analysis of the link among emotions, cognitives and situations.</description>
