      This project expects the integrated database of terminally renal ill patients combines&#xD;
      clinical and files of Health Insurance and renal medical society database. It will provide&#xD;
      valuable actual evidence data to quality monitoring of dialysis treatment and related&#xD;
      academic research. Besides, using the cohort study of chronic renal disease --「epidemiologic&#xD;
      research of chronic renal disease」, we can trace the patient continually and analysis&#xD;
      different risk factors of chronic renal disease in Taiwan. Taken together, the results of&#xD;
      this project --1.1「Integrate the current database of renal disease and establishment of&#xD;
      national monitor system」and 1.2「Epidemiologic study in chronic renal disease」-- will provide&#xD;
      the basic rules of prevention and treatment, basic research and clinic application in chronic&#xD;
      renal disease.&#xD;

      The main source of patient in this study sub-plan 1.2 will collect the patient from medical&#xD;
      center in Taiwan. We assume collect 7 groups in study period -- First：【CKD stage I】.&#xD;
      Second：【CKD stage II】. Third：【CKD stage III】. Forth：【CKD stage IV】. Fifth：【CKD stage V】.&#xD;
      Sixth：【CKD high-risk group】. Seventh：【health control group】to study case report；Total collect&#xD;
      11500 people. At the same time, we collect the sample of blood and urine and personal health&#xD;
      survey to provide the basic data base for each patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Collection of CKD patient group： The patients who will select into this plan are&#xD;
             chosen from the hospital (This hospital is defined as the renal disease improving&#xD;
             institute) in Taiwan. New case in this hospital will be collected into the CKD patient&#xD;
             group. In order to separate those patients into five stages of CKD, we are going to&#xD;
             calculate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by using the formula of GFR. Stage I --&#xD;
             Renal function is normally and protein was detectable slightly in urine&#xD;
             (GFR：≧90ml/min/1.73M2). Stage II -- Slight renal function failure was observed&#xD;
             (GFR：60~89ml/min/1.73M2). Stage III -- Moderate renal function failure&#xD;
             (GFR：30~59ml/min/1.73M2). Stage IV -- Severe renal function failure&#xD;
             (GFR：15~29ml/min/1.73M2). Stage V -- End stage renal disease (GFR：&lt;15ml/min/1.73M2).&#xD;
             The age is from fourteen to eighty-five and whatever they are male or female will be&#xD;
             taken into this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Collection of CKD high-risk group： The CKD patient's relative will be considerately&#xD;
             incorporated into the CKD high-risk group. If CKD patient being confirmed, their&#xD;
             relative who had chronic disease including DM, hypertension and CVD will be chosen&#xD;
             into CKD high-risk group. The age is from fourteen to eighty-five and whatever they&#xD;
             are male or female. This plan will select five thousand people into CKD high-risk&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Collection of healthy control group： According to the characteristic of CKD patient&#xD;
             group, we will select the health control group carefully (paired selection of CKD&#xD;
             patient group, 1:1). The rules of paired selection : 1. Sex 2.Age ± 5 years 3.Location&#xD;
             -- CKD patient and health people are get from the same hospital. Health people who had&#xD;
             no any chronic disease and required a physical checkup which get from the hospital&#xD;
             (This hospital should be qualified to the renal disease improving institute) will be&#xD;
             chosen into this project. Fifteen hundred people will be taken in this plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This plan divide into three groups：1. CKD patient group -- CKD patient group have no&#xD;
             exclusion criteria. 2. CKD high-risk group -- CKD high-risk group exclude the patient&#xD;
             who had renal disease. 3. Heath control group -- Heath control group exclude the&#xD;
             patient who had any chronic disease. Test of liver residual function will exclude the&#xD;
             patient who had allergic reactions to galactose. It will exclude the person including&#xD;
             galactosemia patient, DM patient, pregnant woman, children and disabled people.&#xD;
