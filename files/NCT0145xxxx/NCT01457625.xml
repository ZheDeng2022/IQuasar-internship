      Background Fetuin A, synthesized in hepatocyte, is a circulatory inhibitor of precipitation&#xD;
      of calcium and phosphate and links to cardiovascular calcification and mortality in dialysis&#xD;
      patients; besides, it is associated with insulin resistance in general population. Hepatic&#xD;
      fat accumulation enhanced fetuin A secretion in animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objects This study is designed to investigate the association of fetuin A level, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and hepatic fat content in dialysis patients. Besides, we planed to observe the&#xD;
      survival of dialysis patient with different hepatic fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This is a prospective observational study. Three hundred and fifty ESRD patients&#xD;
      undergoing maintenance HD or PD will be recruited for this prospective investigation. All the&#xD;
      participants will receive baseline abdominal ultrasound for estimation of hepatic fat&#xD;
      content. Hepatic fat content will be estimated as minimal, mild, moderate or severe according&#xD;
      to the Hepburn classification. Besides, all participants also check baseline fetuin A,&#xD;
      HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, adiponectin, leptin and lipid profiles (T-CHO, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C),&#xD;
      nutritional parameter and other biochemical parameters. All participants will be followed for&#xD;
      4 years for survival analysis. The outcomes are all-cause mortality and composite CV&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Dialysis patients with higher hepatic fat may have higher fetuin A levels&#xD;
      which may lead to long-term survival benefits.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetuin A is a protein secreted by hepatocytes that inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      of adipose and muscle cells (1, 2). Recently, its inhibitory potency on calcium phosphate&#xD;
      precipitation has been linked to cardio-vascular (CV) calcification and has predicted CV and&#xD;
      non-CV mortality in dialysis patients (3, 4). In most investigations, fetuin A deficiency is&#xD;
      associated with higher mortality, worse CV outcomes in dialysis patients. In our recent&#xD;
      study, fetuin A deficiency is also linked to vascular access failure in hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      patients (5). The pathogenesis of worse survival in these fetuin A deficiency dialysis&#xD;
      patients is not well-known. Nevertheless, the associations of fetuin A deficiency and&#xD;
      progression of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis are thought to be the possible&#xD;
      mechanism of the high CV mortality (6, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general population, fetuin A is associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      obesity, that is, human with higher fetuin A concentration has higher insulin resistance (8).&#xD;
      Insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic syndrome are all important predictors of long-term&#xD;
      CV outcome in general population (9, 10). In an interventional study performed in diabetic&#xD;
      human with normal kidney function, treatment with pioglitazone seems to decrease fetuin A&#xD;
      levels and enhance insulin sensitivity (11). In an animal model, mice with fatty liver&#xD;
      presented up-regulated fetuin A (Ahsg) mRNA expression (1, 2). In non-diabetic subjects,&#xD;
      fetuin A is associated with hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance (12). Moreover,&#xD;
      in a recent investigation, fetuin A concentration was associated with body fat mass in&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not yet receiving dialysis (13). In our previous&#xD;
      investigation, we also found HD patients with higher fetuin A concentration have higher risk&#xD;
      to be truncal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia (14). These studies suggested this&#xD;
      liver-secreted protein rapidly responds to hepatic fat accumulation which inhibits generation&#xD;
      of adiponectin in adipose tissue; therefore higher fetuin-A and lower adiponectin may&#xD;
      contribute to obesity-induced insulin resistance and development of diabetes in general&#xD;
      population and CKD patients (15). However, this relationship has not been shown in dialysis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although obesity, metabolic syndrome contributed to higher CV mortality in general population&#xD;
      (9, 10); patients under dialysis with higher BMI experienced short-term survival benefit&#xD;
      (16). It is so-called &quot;reverse epidemiology&quot; in dialysis patients. Generally speaking,&#xD;
      well-nutrition dialysis patients experienced less malnutrition-inflammation complex and&#xD;
      therefore, their short-term survival benefit from being well-nutrition overcomes the&#xD;
      long-term survival disadvantage brought from over-nutrition such as obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. However, ESRD patients with abdominal obesity still have higher CV mortality risk&#xD;
      (17).The interesting part of the results these investigations is that, fetuin A deficiency in&#xD;
      dialysis patients have worse CV outcome; on the contrary, higher fetuin A level leads to&#xD;
      insulin resistance and thereafter higher CV mortality in general population. It is not clear&#xD;
      that whether the fetuin A concentration is another &quot;reverse epidemiology&quot; in dialysis&#xD;
      patients. But dialysis patients with well-nutrition, presented with higher BMI, more hepatic&#xD;
      fat accumulation have better survival. We hypothesize the survival disadvantages of fetuin A&#xD;
      deficiency, which is frequently present in dialysis patients, may have a major impact on&#xD;
      mortality in a shorter period of time; and increased hepatic fat-accumulation&#xD;
      (over-nutrition) may leads to fetuin A secretion and overwhelms the short-term negative&#xD;
      effects of fetuin A deficiency on survival, finally, leading to a protective effect of high&#xD;
      BMI, hepatic fat accumulation or over-nutrition on overall survival in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the association of hepatic fat content and fetuin A concentration in&#xD;
           maintenance HD/PD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the association of fetuin A concentration and insulin resistance markers in&#xD;
           HD/PD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the overall survival (4-year) of HD/PD patients with different content of&#xD;
           hepatic fat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study designs and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study. Three hundred and fifty ESRD patients undergoing&#xD;
      maintenance HD or PD for more than 6 months will be recruited for this prospective&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will receive baseline abdominal ultrasound for estimation of hepatic fat&#xD;
      content. Hepatic fat content will be estimated as minimal, mild, moderate or severe according&#xD;
      to the Hepburn classification: absent (affecting 0% to 2% of the hepatocytes), minimal (2% to&#xD;
      10%), mild (10% to 30%), moderate (30% to 60%), and severe (more than 60% of the&#xD;
      hepatocytes). We choose abdominal ultrasound as the method of hepatic fat estimation rather&#xD;
      than MRI and CT which are the gold standard of hepatic fat estimation, because the limited&#xD;
      use of MRI in dialysis patients and increased cancer risk receiving screening CT. Besides,&#xD;
      all participants also check baseline fetuin A, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, adiponectin, leptin and lipid&#xD;
      profiles (T-CHO, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C), nutritional parameter and other biochemical parameters.&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for 4 years for survival analysis. The outcomes are&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and composite CV mortality.&#xD;
