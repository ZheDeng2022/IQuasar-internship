  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a three dose level, cross-over vegetable feeding study using&#xD;
      expertise from nutritional sciences and plant sciences to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement a randomized vegetable feeding trial among overweight post- menopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Produce, in a controlled environmental setting, vegetable crops which provide a selected&#xD;
           variety and quantity of carotenoid and nutrient exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess changes and hopefully demonstrate a significant reduction in oxidant stress and&#xD;
           inflammation in this population at risk for developing chronic disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women were randomly assigned a vegetable feeding dose order of consuming 2,5 &amp; 10&#xD;
      servings/day of vegetables for 3 week periods, with feeding periods separated by 4 week&#xD;
      washout periods, during which time a limited number of low biological value fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables were eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide important and relevant information to fill several gaps in our&#xD;
      current knowledge including a more thorough description of the oxidant stress and&#xD;
      inflammatory status of overweight, postmenopausal women, assessment of the relevant daily&#xD;
      &quot;dose&quot; of vegetables necessary to modulate biomarkers of oxidant stress and inflammation in&#xD;
      overweight postmenopausal women and evaluation of the association between plasma nutrient and&#xD;
      carotenoid levels in relation to changes in oxidant stress and inflammation in this&#xD;
      population. Our long-term goal is to reduce chronic disease risk among &quot;at-risk&quot;&#xD;
      post-menopausal females.&#xD;
