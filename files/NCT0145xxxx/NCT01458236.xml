    <textblock>
      A multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III study&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of BPS 314d-MR in subjects with pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension currently receiving treatment with an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA)&#xD;
      and/or a Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor (PDE-5 inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 centers will be participating in the study. Approximately 630 eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups, BPS-314d-MR (active) or placebo study drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BPS-314d-MR in subjects with&#xD;
      PAH who are treated with background therapy such as ERA and/or a PDE-5 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consent to the study will be assessed at the Screening and Baseline visits to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for the study. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at the Baseline&#xD;
      visit will be enrolled into the study and treated by either active or placebo study drug. The&#xD;
      subject, the clinical site staff and the Sponsor will be blinded to the treatment assignment.&#xD;
      Treatment assignment will be random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinical site at Week 6, Week 12,&#xD;
      Week 20 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects will undergo all scheduled efficacy and&#xD;
      safety assessments, as defined by the protocol. Between scheduled clinical site visits, the&#xD;
      clinical site staff will be required to contact the subject by a telephone call to assess&#xD;
      tolerability to study drug and change subject's dosage as appropriate. Telephone calls should&#xD;
      occur at least once weekly for the first 20 study weeks when dose changes will occur most&#xD;
      frequently and subjects are becoming familiar with the study procedures. Telephone calls will&#xD;
      occur at least once monthly thereafter. Subjects will be provided with an electronic diary to&#xD;
      record doses taken and help in tracking of health issues for conversations with the clinical&#xD;
      site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue their participation in the study until the Sponsor formally closes the&#xD;
      study. At that time the subject will return to the clinical site for an End of Treatment&#xD;
      visit to complete all scheduled tests. Subjects who are participating in the study at its&#xD;
      conclusion may be offered the opportunity to enroll in a long-term extension study. Subjects&#xD;
      who do not continue into an extension study are required to discontinue from study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be urged to remain in the study for long-term follow-up even if study drug is&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a subject withdraws consent for participation in the study or the&#xD;
      Investigator terminates the subject from the study the subject will return to the clinical&#xD;
      site for an End of Treatment visit to complete all scheduled tests. After study drug has been&#xD;
      permanently discontinued, and if the subject is terminated from the study, the subject will&#xD;
      return to the clinical site after 30-37 days for a final Safety Follow-up visit and to return&#xD;
      any remaining study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optional Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be offered to all study subjects at&#xD;
      clinical sites. Subjects within those sites will decide if they wish to participate in the&#xD;
      optional PK evaluation. For those subjects electing to participate, two blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at three clinical site visits (Weeks 6, 12 and 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optional hemodynamic sub-study will be offered to all study subjects at clinical sites.&#xD;
      All subjects at the selected research centers will be offered the opportunity to volunteer in&#xD;
      the sub-study. Hemodynamic measurements will be assessed by Right Heart Catheterization&#xD;
      (RHC). For those subjects who consent to the RHC, the RHC procedure will be performed at the&#xD;
      Baseline visit and during Week 20.&#xD;

             capillary hemangiomatosis, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;

             Baseline visit demonstrating a total lung capacity ≥70% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a history of obstructive lung disease, unless subject has had pulmonary function&#xD;
             testing conducted within 6 months of the Baseline visit demonstrating a forced&#xD;
             expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 50% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;

             left ventricular shortening fraction &lt;22% as assessed by echocardiography. Note that&#xD;
             subjects in whom abnormal left ventricular function is attributed entirely to impaired&#xD;
             left ventricular filling due to the effects of right ventricular overload (i.e., right&#xD;
             ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation) will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has creatinine clearance &lt;30 (using the Crockroft-Gault formula) or requires&#xD;
             hemodialysis.&#xD;

             interpretation of the study data.&#xD;
