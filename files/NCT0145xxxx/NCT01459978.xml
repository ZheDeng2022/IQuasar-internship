      Hypothesis: Continuously monitor quality indicators with a specific method (CUSUM: Cumulative&#xD;
      Sum) will increase the awareness of health care staff in maternity and permit rapid detection&#xD;
      of a small dip in performance in order to enable prompt investigations and corrective&#xD;
      measures when necessary , which decrease maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the impact of Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts used as a maternity&#xD;
      dashboard to decreases maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Step-wedge cluster-randomized trial with prospective analyses of collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: ten Maternity departments in France. Population: Data from 60 000 women and infants&#xD;
      could be collected over 2 year's period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts were used to monitor the rate of quality indicators&#xD;
      previously selected by Delphi method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: Composite outcome that considers multiple clinical events : mortality,&#xD;
      adverse outcomes for women and newborn.&#xD;

      1. RATIONAL Quality improvement has become a central tenet of health care. In obstetrics&#xD;
           and gynaecology departments, each admission may affect the health of not one, but two&#xD;
           individuals, making high quality of care particularly important. In addition, most women&#xD;
           admitted for obstetric reasons are healthy individuals in whom the goal is full&#xD;
           preservation of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement plays an important part in improving quality of care and promoting&#xD;
           beneficial changes. Therefore, over the last decade much effort has gone into developing&#xD;
           and using measures of quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first step towards measuring quality of care in obstetrical departments is to select&#xD;
           quality indicators. Conventional quality indicators are severe events such as maternal&#xD;
           death and neonatal death. However, advances in obstetrical management have made such&#xD;
           events extremely rare, and other quality indicators must now be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once quality indicators are identified, the best means of monitoring them must be&#xD;
           determined. The use of statistical methods to monitor and control a process, known as&#xD;
           Statistical Process Control (SPC), seems particularly promising for monitoring quality&#xD;
           indicators. SPC uses rigorous time-series analysis methods, whose results are reported&#xD;
           as a graph of changes in outcome rates over time. Moreover, SPC can help to determine&#xD;
           whether these changes are real (i.e., related to a causative factor) or merely a&#xD;
           manifestation of natural variability. Among SPC tools, CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) charts are&#xD;
           widely used for industrial quality control and have been found effective for measuring&#xD;
           and monitoring healthcare outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In obstetrics, Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts have been used to monitor Apgar scores or&#xD;
           the performance of sonographers in assessing nuchal translucency in the first trimester&#xD;
           of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite Establishing Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts for relevant quality indicators holds&#xD;
           considerable promise for continuously assessing and improving the quality of care,&#xD;
           nowadays, there are no studies that assess the impact of the CUSUM chart on mother and&#xD;
           children health. The most published studies used CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) to see the&#xD;
           behaviour of an indicator, but do not exploit the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) as a SPC&#xD;
           (statistical process control)tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: to assess the impact of Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts used&#xD;
           as a maternity dashboard to decreases maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity&#xD;
           Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  select a consensual set of quality indicator to assess the overall quality of&#xD;
                obstetrical care and could be routinely monitored in maternity units.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  estimate acceptable and unacceptable rates of quality indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess Satisfaction of caregivers about the proposed tool&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess patient satisfaction about their care in maternity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OUTCOMES Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicator of mother health : is a composite outcome taking into account multiple clinical&#xD;
      events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - complications of pre-eclampsia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemolysis ,Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet syndrome (HELLP):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) eclampsia retro-placental hematoma,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - postpartum hemorrhage:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. - need of intensive care transfer for women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicator of newborn health: is a composite outcome of mortality and morbidity. Morbidities&#xD;
      take into account several clinical events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - postnatal deaths (8days 1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - prematurity: medical or spontaneous&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - low birth weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - maternal-fetal infection: occurring in the first hours of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Transfer to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - chromosomal abnormalities with absence of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - malformations without screening and diagnostic Secondary outcomes Care giver&#xD;
           satisfaction Women satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participating Center : Ten Maternity departments in France will participate to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility criteria Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All deliveries during the study period: Regardless of the mode of delivery: vaginal&#xD;
           delivery, cesarean section, spontaneous or induced delivery Regardless of the pregnancy&#xD;
           term&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women followed or not from the first trimester of pregnancy in the concerned maternity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New born during the study period Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancies that ended with fetal death in UTERO or pregnancy termination for medical&#xD;
           reasons 5.STUDY DESIGN It is a Step-wedge cluster-randomized, prospective multicenter&#xD;
           study, evaluating the impact of continuous monitoring of quality indicators using&#xD;
           CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) chart, on the health of mother and newborn in 10 participating&#xD;
           centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of this design is that the intervention is rolled out to all individuals or&#xD;
      clusters in phases and this design may require fewer clusters than a parallel CRCT design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) will be set up in all centers, and for each quality indicator&#xD;
      previously selected, with a delayed onset of disseminating the results of the CUmulative SUM&#xD;
      (CUSUM) in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Delphi survey with an international expert panel in obstetrical care was used to develop a&#xD;
      set of main quality indicators to be followed routinely in maternity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic performance of each maternity will be evaluated in the first period of data&#xD;
      collection in order to have a perception of the performance of each maternity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown in Figure 1, the study will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: is a 3 months testing and observation period. During this phase, rates of each&#xD;
      quality indicator selected will be collected to adjust the acceptable and unacceptable rate&#xD;
      set by practitioners of each maternity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: In this phase, maternity will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups:&#xD;
      the group to which the results of the CUSUM will be provided for a period of 12 months (Early&#xD;
      CUSUM result group), or group to which the results of CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) will not be&#xD;
      shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: In this phase, the maternity wards in the &quot;early result group&quot; will continue to&#xD;
      receive the results of the CUSUM for a period of 12 months, while maternity in second group&#xD;
      receive CUSUM result (CUSUM result Delayed group) during the same period 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of study period, maternity &quot;early result group&quot; will receive the results of the&#xD;
      CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) for 24 months period, while maternity in &quot;Delayed CUSUM result group&quot;&#xD;
      will receive CUSUM results for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.STUDY STEPS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A modified Delphi Survey of an international multidisciplinary panel to select quality&#xD;
           indicators A modified Delphi survey will be conducted involving international expert&#xD;
           panel. The Delphi technique is a structured process that is widely used for quality&#xD;
           indicators development. One of the main reasons for the popularity enjoyed by the Delphi&#xD;
           technique is that a large number of individuals across diverse locations and areas of&#xD;
           expertise can be included anonymously and do not interact directly with each other, so&#xD;
           situation where the group is dominated by the views of certain individuals can be&#xD;
           avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The modified Delphi technique is defined, among other, as the combined use of a&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaire and of a physical meeting of the experts to enhance&#xD;
           complex decision making process and clarify language and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The panel members will be asked to rate each of the quality indicators against 2&#xD;
           criteria: validity and feasibility. Validity was defined as the extent to which the&#xD;
           characteristics of the indicator are appropriate for the concept being assessed and&#xD;
           quality indicators was considered feasible if information needed to assess adherence was&#xD;
           thought to be available in the medical record or from patient or simple to collect from&#xD;
           any source whatsoever with a workload consistent with the activity of maternity. These&#xD;
           will be both rated along a 9 point scale, from a score of 1 (definitely not valid or not&#xD;
           feasible) to 9 (definitely valid or feasible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimating acceptable and unacceptable rates of quality indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maternity obstetricians will be asked to define acceptable and unacceptable rates for&#xD;
           each quality indicator in accordance with their actual performances, activities and&#xD;
           local needs. For each quality indicator, the acceptable rate was defined as the rate at&#xD;
           and beyond which no corrective action was needed and the unacceptable rate as the rate&#xD;
           at and beyond which an audit was needed to identify the cause of the change in&#xD;
           performance and thereby allow corrective action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention is described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Implementation of the CUSUM control chart using available medical data Step 2:&#xD;
      Submission of monthly results to the coordinator of each participating center (if CUmulative&#xD;
      SUM (CUSUM) results period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: When an alarm is generated, the steering committee will meet with maternity staff to&#xD;
      find the causes of these alerts and propose corrective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on the following assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of mortality / morbidity: 40 per 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternity activity over 1 year period: 3000 births on average per center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A decrease in events of 30% In a cluster randomized trial, the outcome of individuals&#xD;
           within clusters is not independent. The sample size should be increased to take into&#xD;
           account these effects. The required increase is influenced by both the ICC and the size&#xD;
           of the cluster. The investigators must increase the standard sample size by an inflation&#xD;
           factor equal to [(1 + (n-1) ρ)] where n is the average size of centers in our study ,&#xD;
           estimated to 3000 patients per year, ρ the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a hypothetical ICC of 0.01, the number of subjects required is estimated to 7500&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of centers being set at 10 with an average inclusion of 3,000 women per year, the&#xD;
      investigators will easily reach the number of women required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive analysis Data are expressed as mean (SD), or median and 1st , 3rd quartiles,&#xD;
           as appropriate for quantitative variables. Qualitative variables are expressed as total&#xD;
           numbers and percentages Comparison of characteristics in each group was performed using&#xD;
           χ2 test or Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. For quantitative variables,&#xD;
           comparison involved the t.test or wilcoxon test. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
           significant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two analysis will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           First analysis: will compare the incidence of events taking into account in the&#xD;
           Indicator of mother or newborn health from the 'Early result group' and the 'delayed&#xD;
           start group' up 'at end of period 2 (see figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second analysis: to asses if there is a difference in event rates between the 'Early&#xD;
           result group' and the 'delayed start group' for the duration of the study (Period&#xD;
           period2 + 3). This analysis shows whether the benefit observed in the 'Early result&#xD;
           group' observed at the end of the two continues until the end of the study when the two&#xD;
           groups received the same intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators use hierarchical models to account for possible correlations between&#xD;
           observations in the maternity wards. The investigators can introduce variables dependent&#xD;
           to maternity (level, status, number of medical staff, activity ...) and women (and&#xD;
           newborn).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All tests will be performed using the SAS software version 9.2 and ML-Win&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) Chart CUSUM charts are constructed by calculating and plotting&#xD;
           the sum St = max (0, St-1 + Xt - k+), where S0=0, to detect an upward change; or St =&#xD;
           min (0, St-1 + Xt - k-), where S0=0, to detect a downward change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CUSUM tests the null hypothesis, according to which the process is 'in control' (IC),&#xD;
      that is, performance is acceptable; as opposed to 'out of control' (OC).&#xD;
