      Objective: To evaluate the influence of dietary sodium reduction on body fluid volume and&#xD;
      inflammatory state in hemodialysis (HD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective controlled randomized study. Setting: Dialysis Unit of Botucatu Medical&#xD;
      School Hospital, Sao Paulo State University, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Adult patients on HD for at least 30 days and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 0.7 mg/dl&#xD;
      were randomly allocated into two groups: Group A: 21 patients treated with a 2g sodium&#xD;
      restriction in their habitual diet, and Group B: 18 controls. Inflammatory, biochemical,&#xD;
      hematological and nutritional markers, as well as dialysis dosage were assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and after 8 and 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prognosis of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) patients is strongly compromised by&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) complications. Inflammation is established as a major risk factor for CV&#xD;
      complications in these patients, occurring in approximately one third of them. Recently,&#xD;
      growing evidences have suggested the body water volume expansion is a cause of inflammation&#xD;
      in CKD. In a previous study Rodrigues Telini showed that dietary sodium restriction reduced&#xD;
      the inflammatory markers levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Similar results were observed&#xD;
      in patients treated by reduction of HD dialysate sodium concentration. However in both&#xD;
      studies no significant reduction in body volume markers was observed. These results could be&#xD;
      due to small number of patients or low sensibility of volume markers; on the other hand they&#xD;
      could suggest a direct role of sodium as an inflammatory inducer independently of volume.&#xD;
      With a larger number of patients and using a more sensitive volume marker as the B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), this study intends to confirm the hypothesis that sodium&#xD;
      mobilization can reduce the body water volume and attenuate the inflammatory in HD patients.&#xD;
      A hundred thirty-five patients will be enrolled and divided in three groups with 35 patients:&#xD;
      A, treated by reduction of 2 grams in daily sodium intake; B, exposed to reduction of sodium&#xD;
      dialysate from 138 to 135 mEq/L and C, control group. The patients will be followed up by 16&#xD;
      weeks and inflammatory markers (CRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor) as well as&#xD;
      volume markers (Watson formula, electrical bioimpedance measurements and BNP concentration)&#xD;
      will be determine each 8 weeks.&#xD;
