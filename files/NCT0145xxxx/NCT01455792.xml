      Background: Prostate biopsies are usually performed due to accidentally discovered elevated&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy is standard procedure, but possibility for precise&#xD;
      documentation concerning the localization of the biopsies are lacking. Therefore, the same&#xD;
      locations might be subject to multiple negative biopsies. There is a growing confidence that&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate gland can identify significant, high-grade&#xD;
      tumours, and studies have shown value in performing MRI before biopsies. Because image&#xD;
      documentation is lacking, it is not possible to know which region actually being biopsied&#xD;
      with conventional TRUS biopsy. MRI and 3D ultrasound soft image fusion guided biopsy, is a&#xD;
      new promising method that will ascertain all regions of the prostate gland to be biopsied,&#xD;
      and it is possible to perform accurate targeted biopsies when combined with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the biopsy results in the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the overall rate of positive biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the rate of re-biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the detection rate of Gleason grade 4 and 5 tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the rate of positive targeted biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the rate of positive random biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare targeted and random biopsies between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare patient tolerance, time consumption and cost of the two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of performing cytological imprints of targeted&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: A prospective randomized study including 300 consecutive patients&#xD;
      referred to the initial biopsy. The patients are randomized to conventional TRUS biopsies and&#xD;
      image fusion guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo a minimum 12-core re-biopsy procedure. In addition a targeted biopsy&#xD;
      will be obtained in case of positive MRI of ultrasound.&#xD;

      Biopsy procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional TRUS biopsy procedure (Gold standard). These patients will first undergo&#xD;
           0-6 TRUS targeted biopsies (TRUS TB) (2 targeted biopsies in up to 3 lesions), directed&#xD;
           towards lesions suspect of prostate cancer seen on TRUS, or detected by DRE&#xD;
           (standard-target). Subsequently, they will undergo a standard random 12 core TRUS guided&#xD;
           biopsy procedure. All biopsies will be performed using the Bruel and Kjaer ultrasound&#xD;
           unit, type 1846, and transrectal transducer No 8531 (New york, United States). If there&#xD;
           for any reason would be desirable to reduce the total number of biopsies, we will omit&#xD;
           random biopsies if targeted biopsies already have been taken at that specific site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two dedicated urologist, (L. M. E. and G. M.), with special interest and experience in&#xD;
           prostate cancer will perform conventional TRUS biopsies according to the protocol, and&#xD;
           according to their previous experience. No effort will be done for these two urologists&#xD;
           to harmonize their biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 3D image documented biopsy (3D IDB) procedure. These patients will first undergo an MRI&#xD;
           examination of the prostate. Possible cancer-suspect areas will be identified and mapped&#xD;
           in 3D. MRI findings with high grade of cancer suspicion will be marked as red circles&#xD;
           with diameter from 6 to 8 mm. MRI finding compatible with low or intermediate cancer&#xD;
           suspicions will be labelled as yellow circles from 6 to 8 mm in the diameter. The&#xD;
           circles will be placed in the centre of MRI findings. A few days later the patients will&#xD;
           first undergo 0-6 targeted biopsies, directed towards possible lesions detected by MRI,&#xD;
           which are transferred (by soft image fusion) to the TRUS images, allowing for TRUS&#xD;
           biopsies directed towards lesions detected by MRI, so-called MRI targeted biopsies (MRI&#xD;
           TB). These biopsies will be used for additional cytological imprints for evaluation of&#xD;
           presence/absence of carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, they will undergo 12 core random TRUS guided biopsy procedure, using the 3D IDB&#xD;
      software and 3D TRUS equipment (3D IDB random). When performing these random biopsies, the&#xD;
      MRI findings will not be displayed on the US screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dedicated urologist (E. B.) with substantial experience with the 3D IDB procedure will&#xD;
      perform the MRI TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy procedures will be performed in local anaesthesia using 6-10 ml 2% Lidocaine. Using&#xD;
      ultrasound control, local anaesthetic is injected around the prostate using a 22-gauge spinal&#xD;
      needle. Prostate volume is calculated using the standard ellipsoid formula, multiplying the&#xD;
      largest anterioposterior (height), transverse (width) and cephalocaudal (length) prostate&#xD;
      diameters by 0,524.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be performed using 18 gauge spring-loaded needle (Angiotech®). All individual&#xD;
      biopsies cores will be marked and kept in separate glasses for fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy time defined as time when the TRUS probe is in place is registered in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI examination Patients randomized to the 3D IDB procedure with MRI US fusion, will undergo&#xD;
      examination of the prostate using a 1,5 T MR scanner (Siemens Avanto, Erlangen Germany) with&#xD;
      a body array coil. Total scan time will be approximately 12 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Siemens Picture Archive Communicating System (PACS) and Nordic ICE® will be used for post&#xD;
      processing analyses. Evaluation of the MRI examinations will be performed by one radiologist&#xD;
      (E. R.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation Warfarin anticoagulant therapy is stopped 3 days before biopsy procedure&#xD;
      and biopsy is not performed if international normalized ratio (INR) value is over 2,0. If&#xD;
      needed, low molecular weight heparin can be administered to the patient. A cleansing enema is&#xD;
      not strictly required. One hour before the biopsy procedure is planned a peroral antibiotic&#xD;
      (Trimethoprim 160 mg, Sulfamethoxazole 800 mg) is administered and additional dose is taken&#xD;
      the following evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of patient tolerance and discomfort will be registered in both groups by visual&#xD;
      analogue score (VAS) pain score questionnaire (10 scores denoting the worst and 0 denoting no&#xD;
      bother).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytological procedures Each targeted biopsy will be subject to cytological imprint. These&#xD;
      smears will undergo standard staining and classified as positive or negative according to&#xD;
      presence of carcinoma or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological procedures Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain of the biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed, and evaluated according to Gleason system (gold standard for histological&#xD;
      evaluation) ranging from 1-5, with 5 being the most aggressive tumour. Gleason score is the&#xD;
      sum of the two dominating Gleason grades, for instance 5+5 for the most aggressive tumour&#xD;
      giving a Gleason score of 10. The biopsies will be marked, in order to evaluate the spatial&#xD;
      distribution of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the biopsy core and tumour involvement will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is no difference in the overall prostate cancer detection (rate of positive&#xD;
           biopsies) between the group undergoing conventional TRUS biopsy procedure and the group&#xD;
           undergoing 3D IDB MRI TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is not higher rate of Gleason grade 4 and 5 in the 3D IDB MRI TB group compared to&#xD;
           the conventional TRUS group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The 3D IDB MRI TB group do not have more prostate cancer than random 3D IDB&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The MRI TB does not detect more prostate cancer than TRUS TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Random 3D IDB do not detect more prostate cancer than TRUS random biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The rate of re-biopsies is equal between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. There is no correlation of the cytological and histological results.&#xD;
