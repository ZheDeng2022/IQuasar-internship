      The aim of this study performed in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) subjects and healthy&#xD;
      patients is to demonstrate the ability of composite score of frequency of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms to discriminate healthy subjects and IBS patients. The properties of this&#xD;
      questionnaire of composite score of gastrointestinal symptoms frequency will be compared to&#xD;
      other validated questionnaires (severity of IBS symptoms and HRQoL).&#xD;
