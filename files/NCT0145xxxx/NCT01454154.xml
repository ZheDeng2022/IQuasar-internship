  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess whether participants with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI) administered glyburide begun within 10 hours of injury will show a decrease in&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined edema and/or hemorrhage, compared to placebo and to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of glyburide compared to placebo in participants with TBI.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include analyzing brain cell loss, computerized tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
      /MRI abnormalities, reduction of mortality and or improvement of function or physiology,&#xD;
      incidence of decompression craniectomy, incidence of neuroworsening, and to assess the steady&#xD;
      state concentrations of glyburide in TBI participants.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. A serious adverse event is any AE that is fatal, life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event</description>

    <description>The GOS-E assesses status in patients with traumatic brain injury on an 8-point scale. The minimum score is 1 and the maximum score is 8. The rating scale is as follows: 1- Dead, 2- Vegetative State, 3- Low Severe Disability, 4- Upper Severe Disability, 5- Low Moderate Disability, 6- Upper Moderate Disability, 7- Low Good Recovery, and 8- Upper Good Recovery</description>
