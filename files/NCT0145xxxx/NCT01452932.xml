      Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of muscle training, the degree of dyspnea and&#xD;
      aerobic capacity in patients over 50 with COPD, in a health care institution provider in&#xD;
      Antioquia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question: What is the effectiveness of muscle training, in the degree of dyspnea and aerobic&#xD;
      capacity in COPD patients over 50 years, in a health service institution provider in the&#xD;
      department of Antioquia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Muscle training causes changes in the degree of dyspnea and aerobic capacity,&#xD;
      other than the breathing exercises and relaxation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized clinical trial with allocation and blinding of the autcomes assesor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: COPD patients stage II and II, male and female, over 50 years old, who are&#xD;
      attending to a community health service provider in the department of Antioquia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A physiotherapeutic intervention using PNF technique was applied to the&#xD;
      experimental physiotherapy group versus Yoga sessions applied to the other group. Twelve&#xD;
      weeks protocol performing three sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Dyspnea degree and aerobic capacity was measured using the MMRC scale and&#xD;
      the six minute walking test respectively at the begining and the end of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by GOLD (The Global Initiative for&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) as a disease process characterized by progressive airflow&#xD;
      limitation associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to particles or&#xD;
      harmful gases and is not fully reversible. This restriction generates an expiratory flow of&#xD;
      air entrapment resulting hyperinflation, coupled with the effects that systemic, structural&#xD;
      changes occur in skeletal muscles which leads to greater fatigue causing dyspnea.&#xD;
      Consequently, patients with COPD require participation of accessory muscles of respiration,&#xD;
      which should have a dual function during activities involving the upper limbs, to supply the&#xD;
      ventilatory requirements and movements of the shoulder girdle, which increases dyspnea&#xD;
      carrying the patient to stop their activities, leading to physical deconditioning and&#xD;
      progressively decreasing aerobic capacity. This demonstrates the need to improve the&#xD;
      resistance of the upper limb muscles in these patients, thus contributing to a reduction in&#xD;
      the degree of dyspnea and improved their aerobic capacity. The investigators propose a study&#xD;
      aimed at determining the effectiveness of muscle training in the degree of dyspnea and&#xD;
      aerobic capacity in COPD.&#xD;

    <description>The physiotherapeutic intervention was based on the Kabat (PNF) technique. Thirty-three sessions were planed. Each session lasted between thirty and fifty minutes.&#xD;
The experimental group was guided by a physiotherapist or a physiotherapy student and each session took place in a hospital auditorium provided with oxygen cylinders, chairs and water.&#xD;
Each session consisted of a warm up and stretch period, a period of resistance training of the upper limbs with their rest periods in which diaphragmatic breathing exercises and finally a cooling period.&#xD;
The instructions and instruments given to each participant such as weights and elastic bands were the same for all of them.</description>
