      the investigators first aim is to determine the effect of low intensity exercise (without&#xD;
      weight loss) on insulin sensitivity, muscle lipid metabolism, and factors regulating these&#xD;
      processes in skeletal muscle after 1 day, 2 wks, 12 wks of training, and again after 3 days&#xD;
      without exercise in obese adults. the investigators second aim is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      combining low intensity exercise training with 10% weight loss on insulin sensitivity, muscle&#xD;
      lipid metabolism, and factors regulating these processes in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a single 40 minute session of exercise at a low exercise intensity will not improve&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, the investigators anticipate adaptations after two weeks of exercise&#xD;
      training (6 session/wk; 12 session total) will improve insulin sensitivity and be accompanied&#xD;
      by a reduction in fatty acid intermediates and a reduction in markers for pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      activation in muscle. the investigators anticipate changes in insulin sensitivity, fatty acid&#xD;
      partitioning, and pro-inflammatory markers the day after the last session of a 12 wk training&#xD;
      program (without weight-loss) will be similar to that measured after 2 weeks of training. the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate insulin sensitivity, accumulation of fatty acid intermediates, and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory activation will be markedly improved after 10% weight loss when measured the&#xD;
      day after exercise. the investigators would expect the improvements in Insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      accumulation of fatty acid intermediates, and markers of inflammatory stress will be&#xD;
      significantly attenuated when measured 3 days after the most recent exercise session, but&#xD;
      beneficial effects of 10% weight loss on these metabolic endpoints will persist when compared&#xD;
      with before weight loss.&#xD;

    <description>During the first 12 weeks of the study, subjects will adhere to an exercise training program while maintaining their original body weight. The exercise training program will entail the following: 40min/session, ~50% of their maximal aerobic capacity (approximately 100-110 beats per min), 5-6 days/week&#xD;
After the first 12 weeks in the study, subjects will continue with the same exercise program, but then they will be placed on a reduced calorie diet until they lose exactly 10% of their original body weight</description>
