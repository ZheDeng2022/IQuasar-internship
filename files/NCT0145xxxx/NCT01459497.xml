      The study is designed to determine whether an accelerated course of hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiation therapy with daily image guidance and motion assessment/control will allow more&#xD;
      effective treatment of poor performance status patients with stage II-III NSCLC, who would&#xD;
      benefit from local therapy compared to standard radiation therapy (60 Gy in 2 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction).&#xD;

      The study is designed to determine whether an accelerated course of hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiation therapy with daily image guidance and motion assessment/control will allow more&#xD;
      effective treatment of poor performance status patients with stage II-III NSCLC, who would&#xD;
      benefit from local therapy compared to standard radiation therapy (60 Gy in 2 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction). Poor performance status patients can be a heterogeneous group, with tumor-related&#xD;
      factors, other co-morbidities, or advanced age placing patients in the category. These&#xD;
      patients have traditionally been underrepresented in clinical trials, and thus no prospective&#xD;
      study has evaluated the efficacy of other radiotherapy dose fractionations in these patients.&#xD;
      One phase III trial of &quot;poor-risk&quot; locally advanced NSCLC (RTOG 93-04) included just over 40%&#xD;
      Karnofsky performance status 60-70 patients and showed median survival times of 9.5 and 10.3&#xD;
      months with 60Gy of conventional radiation therapy alone or with recombinant β-interferon&#xD;
      [18]. 1 year overall survival was just 44% in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes randomization to two arms. Arm A (experimental arm) will include IGRT, 60&#xD;
      Gy in 15 fractions (3 weeks). Arm B will include conventional radiation, 60-66 Gy in 30-33&#xD;
      fractions (6 weeks) with optional concurrent with carboplatin/taxol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental arm dose for this trial is based on a dose escalation trial at University of&#xD;
      Texas Southwestern evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated IGRT in this&#xD;
      patient population (Phase I study IRB #072010-050). Doses were escalated from 3 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction (total dose 45 Gy) to 4 Gy per fraction (total dose 60 Gy) and evaluation for&#xD;
      treatment related toxicity was being performed. Critical structure dose constraints will be&#xD;
      expressed as organ dose-volume limits, with limits formulated with the approval of the study&#xD;
      investigators using known tolerance data, radiobiological conversion models, and norms used&#xD;
      in current practice at academic centers [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block within strata&#xD;
      to balance for patient factors other than institution. The stratifying variables are Zubrod&#xD;
      performance status (2 vs. &gt; 2) and stage (II vs. III).&#xD;
