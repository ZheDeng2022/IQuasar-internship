    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) is a condition where eosinophils (a cell that fights infection)&#xD;
      travel to the esophagus (the tube through which food passes to the stomach). These cells do&#xD;
      not belong there and can cause pain, soreness, difficulty swallowing and sometimes vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ways to treat this condition include medicine, not eating some foods, and drinking a specific&#xD;
      formula (like milk) without eating any other foods. Doing these things can help fight off EE&#xD;
      but these problems can come back when treatment is stopped. If EE symptoms go on for a long&#xD;
      time, it can lead to the esophagus becoming narrow and feeling tight when eating and&#xD;
      swallowing and surgery may be needed to widen the narrowed area to relieve the sensation of&#xD;
      tightening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast is a medicine that fights off a type of chemical that can be a magnet for&#xD;
      eosinophils. People usually take this medicine to help treat their asthma. It is not approved&#xD;
      to treat EE. This medication is taken once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if Montelukast, compared to placebo, will help reduce the&#xD;
      number of eosinophils in children with EE and help stop the tightening of the esophagus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a disease diagnosed using both clinical and pathologic&#xD;
      results. Presentation varies among age groups with younger children suffering from vomiting,&#xD;
      failure to thrive, or food refusal and adolescents suffering from dysphagia, odynophagia, or&#xD;
      food impaction. It is more prevalent in males. EE is suggested when an upper endoscopy yields&#xD;
      eosinophils greater than 15 per high power field (hpf) in both the middle and distal&#xD;
      esophagus. Therapy for EE depends upon age and ability to be compliant. Three main categories&#xD;
      of treatment are options for families, including the use of medicines, removal of the most&#xD;
      allergenic foods, and the use of an elemental diet (formula) (1-2). Treatment can be&#xD;
      different within the two main phases of therapy for EE, initial and maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Initial therapy occurs when the patient is first diagnosed and has eosinophils over 15 per&#xD;
      hpf and can last for years if the patient does not respond to treatment. Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      only occurs after the patient has responded to treatment with a reduction of his/her&#xD;
      eosinophil counts below 5 per hpf. Typically, medicinal therapy with steroids (either oral&#xD;
      prednisone or swallowed fluticasone) improves eosinophil counts but has a large side effect&#xD;
      profile suggesting that steroids are not ideal for maintenance therapy. Dietary therapies are&#xD;
      effective in both treatment phases but many patients find it difficult to remain compliant&#xD;
      with food restriction for a prolonged length of time. Unfortunately, EE recurs upon&#xD;
      withdrawal of oral therapy (3-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EE is believed to be an imbalance of the TH1/TH2 immune system and is more prevalent in&#xD;
      patients with asthma and allergies (8-9). Some EE centers have started treating patients with&#xD;
      targeted elimination diets and elemental diets and are having good success. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      most families and in particular teenagers, are noncompliant with the dietary therapies.&#xD;
      Formula for the elemental diet is not covered by most insurance and is very costly as well.&#xD;
      Therefore, finding a drug that would keep a patient with EE in maintenance therapy and reduce&#xD;
      both the long term consequences of steroids and potential for esophageal strictures would be&#xD;
      ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many adults with EE present with dysphagia or food impactions and subsequently are found to&#xD;
      have an esophageal stricture requiring multiple esophageal dilatations for treatment.&#xD;
      Esophageal subepithelial fibrosis has been found in the adult literature in patients with EE.&#xD;
      Chehade et al evaluated distal esophageal biopsy specimens in children with EE, eosinophilic&#xD;
      gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and controls for the presence of increased&#xD;
      collagen deposition indicative of fibrosis. They found that fibrosis was present in 57% of&#xD;
      patients with EE, of which 42% had symptoms of dysphagia and 80% had food impactions. The&#xD;
      degree of fibrosis was not associated with eosinophil count but was associated with&#xD;
      eosinophilic degranulation (10). Upon degranulation, eosinophils release major basic protein&#xD;
      (MBP) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β). MBP changes smooth muscle contractility by&#xD;
      blocking M2 muscarinic receptors therefore changing the motility of the esophagus. TGF-β is&#xD;
      believed to cause an increase in the production of the extracellular matrix and smooth muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy and hyperplasia leading to esophageal thickening and fibrosis. TGF-β is a key&#xD;
      growth factor that increases fibroblasts and subsequent fibrosis in the lung as well.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids have been shown to reverse esophageal remodeling, but no large clinical&#xD;
      trials have evaluated the treatment of esophageal fibrosis related to EE. To quote Aceves and&#xD;
      Ackerman: &quot;[f]ibrosis likely contributes to multiple clinical aspects of EE, including&#xD;
      dysphagia symptoms, disease chronicity, and stricture formation.&quot; Fibrosis is measured in&#xD;
      esophageal tissue by evaluating the amount of collagen that is deposited. Trichrome stains&#xD;
      specifically for collagen (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with EE have an abundance of inappropriate cells within the esophagus, including&#xD;
      eosinophils and mast cells. A normal esophagus is devoid of eosinophils. Mast cells likely&#xD;
      have an active role in the development of eosinophilic esophagitis; unfortunately the precise&#xD;
      mechanism is unknown. Mast cells are found in the majority of vascularized tissues and are&#xD;
      abundant in the gastrointestinal tract. They are located in the submucosa and lamina propria.&#xD;
      Within the esophagus specifically, they are found in the mucosa and submucosa with rare&#xD;
      expansion into muscularis layer. With severe eosinophilic inflammation, mast cells can be&#xD;
      seen in the muscularis layer. Biopsies from patients with EE have demonstrated marked&#xD;
      increase in mast cells in the mucosal layer of the esophagus. There has been correlation of&#xD;
      mast cell number with degree of eosinophilia. Mast cells within the GI tract contain tryptase&#xD;
      as well as other preformed mediators and can synthesize mediators that promote inflammation.&#xD;
      Tryptase may activate eosinophils and therefore induce eosinophilic degranulation and&#xD;
      cytokine secretion. Mast cells release chemokines and leukotrienes specific to eosinophil&#xD;
      recruitment. Ultimately mast cell mediators worsen edema, create more inflammation, induce&#xD;
      smooth muscle contractility and potentially affect tissue fibrosis. Therefore, active mast&#xD;
      cells are proinflammatory, modify esophageal function, and encourage the development of&#xD;
      strictures (12). Mast cells may be a key component in the propagation of the inflammatory&#xD;
      state as well as of significant importance in the development of fibrosis. Evaluating&#xD;
      tryptase levels could lead to a better understanding of the inflammatory process and ultimate&#xD;
      problem of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophils and mast cells contain leukotrienes in abundance. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid. They are important in eosinophil&#xD;
      attraction and migration, smooth muscle bronchoconstriction, vascular permeability, and mucus&#xD;
      hypersecretion (13). Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and blocks specifically&#xD;
      the leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor. Attwood et al treated 8 patients with EE with Montelukast&#xD;
      for which 6 reported complete subjective improvement and 5 remained asymptomatic on a&#xD;
      maintenance regimen. Treatment with Montelukast did not change the density of eosinophils&#xD;
      present in the esophagus however (14). Montelukast has been used in mouse models to decrease&#xD;
      fibrosis occurring in both the liver and the lung. El-Swefy and Hassanen performed a&#xD;
      randomized study in which they subjected mice to one of 4 groups, no bile duct ligation plus&#xD;
      saline, no bile duct ligation plus montelukast, bile duct ligation plus montelukast and bile&#xD;
      duct ligation plus saline. Bile duct ligation induced inflammation leading to cirrhosis and&#xD;
      fibrosis. They found that bile duct ligation increased the amount of TGF-β, which correlated&#xD;
      with the amount of fibrosis found. Of more import is that montelukast significantly reduced&#xD;
      the amount of fibrosis as well as decreased the amount of TGF-β (15). Izumo, Kondo, and Nagai&#xD;
      evaluated the use of montelukast in the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis after exposure to&#xD;
      bleomycin. They found that mice given montelukast had significantly lower levels of TGF-β and&#xD;
      fibrosis of the lung (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's research focus throughout fellowship included several retrospective&#xD;
      studies in eosinophilic esophagitis. One of the investiagotor's studies evaluated the&#xD;
      management of both initial and maintenance therapy for EE within our department. The&#xD;
      investigator wanted to know what medicines the majority of pediatric gastroenterologists at&#xD;
      the investigator's institution were using to treat EE and how often patients were being&#xD;
      reevaluated by endoscopy. The investigator also wanted to evaluate the use of montelukast in&#xD;
      the treatment of EE. The investigator reviewed 1500 charts of patients who had undergone&#xD;
      upper endoscopy and had a result of &quot;esophagitis.&quot; Patients were then selected by the&#xD;
      presence of greater than or equal to 20 eosinophils per high power field in at least one&#xD;
      biopsy location. Of the 1500 charts the investigator evaluated, only 88 patients fulfilled&#xD;
      criteria for EE. The investigator discovered that there is not a consistent standard of care&#xD;
      within their department for the initial and maintenance treatment of EE. Many different&#xD;
      medicines are trialed initially and patients undergo esophageal biopsies at different time&#xD;
      intervals, contrary to what is recommended. The primary group of 88 patients was then&#xD;
      separated into 49 patients who reached maintenance therapy (defined by less than 5&#xD;
      eosinophils per high power field) and 39 patients who never experienced improvement in their&#xD;
      eosinophil counts. Of the 49 who reached maintenance therapy, 30 patients were treated with&#xD;
      montelukast and had follow up endoscopy. The investigator evaluated peak eosinophil counts&#xD;
      pre and post treatment, and contrary to their hypothesis, those patients treated with 5mg of&#xD;
      montelukast had lower post treatment eosinophil counts than those treated with higher doses&#xD;
      (10 and 20mg). This raised the possibility that the packaging differences of the two main&#xD;
      doses had an impact in treatment. The investigator considered the possibility that the lower&#xD;
      dosage of montelukast is protective since 5mg tablets are chewable and would yield a topical&#xD;
      effect on the esophagus whereas the 10mg tablets are swallowed, not chewed. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigator evaluated how often EE recurred and discovered there was a high rate of&#xD;
      histologic recurrence. Also interesting to the investigator was the lower recurrence rate in&#xD;
      patients given 5mg of montelukast compared to 10mg and 20mg doses. These results were not&#xD;
      expected and deserve further evaluation. If montelukast can prevent fibrosis through a&#xD;
      topical effect, then its therapeutic potential is huge in the treatment of EE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has developed a study that will investigate the use of montelukast in total&#xD;
      vs placebo as well as allow them to look for dosing effects within montelukast in the&#xD;
      treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. The primary objective is to evaluate if montelukast&#xD;
      will keep eosinophil counts low enough for the patient to remain in remission and if so, is&#xD;
      there a particular dose of montelukast that will achieve this in a greater proportion. All&#xD;
      patients will be maintained on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at baseline so that patients&#xD;
      receiving placebo will still receive standard of care treatment. Many GI practitioners at&#xD;
      this institution will place patients with EE on montelukast as part of standard of care&#xD;
      treatment at varying doses without any good literature to support this use. The&#xD;
      investigator's goal is to determine if montelukast is a valuable therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      EE. The investigator's study will also evaluate histological stains that may show an&#xD;
      improvement with the use of montelukast, even if the eosinophil counts do not change, as the&#xD;
      chemicals released by eosinophils and mast cells may be of primary import in the continuation&#xD;
      of EE.&#xD;
