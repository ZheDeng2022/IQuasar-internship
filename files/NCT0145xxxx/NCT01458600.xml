      AGO study - adjuvant treatment, with NSAID, of endocrine ophthalmopathy in Graves´ disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background - Already at diagnosis of Graves disease approximately 98% of the patients have&#xD;
      morphological changes of the retrobulbar tissue concordant with ophthalmopathy. Factors known&#xD;
      to induce clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy are mainly unknown. An interesting observation&#xD;
      is that a patient with stable and inactive Graves´ disease developed ophthalmopathy when&#xD;
      treated with a glitazone due to diabetes type 2. Glitazones have been shown to increase&#xD;
      differentiation of orbital preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Glitazones are PPAR-gamma&#xD;
      agonists and recently diclofenac have been shown to interact with PPAR-gamma in physiological&#xD;
      concentrations. Other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, NSAID, like indomethacin lack&#xD;
      this effect. In addition, diclofenac inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins which also may be of&#xD;
      importance because the natural ligand to PPAR-gamma is prostaglandin J. Inflammation and&#xD;
      adipogenesis are hallmarks of the pathological process in Graves ophthalmopathy and NSAID&#xD;
      like diclofenac may affect both. There is only one earlier study demonstrating effects of&#xD;
      NSAID (indomethacin) in 7 patients with effects on soft tissue symptoms, eye muscle symptoms&#xD;
      and eye protrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim - to investigate if diclofenac can prevent ophthalmopathy and/or progress of&#xD;
      ophthalmopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the frequency of clinical ophthalmopathy in Graves´ disease after 12 months&#xD;
           treatment with or without diclofenac.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the frequency of progress of clinical signs and symptoms in ophthalmopathy&#xD;
           after 12 months treatment with or without diclofenac.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the frequency of optic neuropathy in clinical ophthalmopathy after 12 months&#xD;
           treatment with or without diclofenac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan and randomisation -&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 patients with newly diagnosed Graves´disease without ophthalmopathy will be treated with&#xD;
      anti-thyroid drugs and L-thyroxin (block and replace) according to clinical routine for 18&#xD;
      months. These patients will be randomized to diclofenac 50 mg twice daily or not for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Adjuvant treatment of Graves´ ophthalmopathy with NSAID (aGO study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When performing MRI / CT / ultrasound of the orbital room 98 % of the patients with&#xD;
           Graves´ thyrotoxicosis exhibit changes of ophthalmopathy without clinical symptoms of&#xD;
           endocrine ophthalmopathy (Burch 1993). Thus, almost all patients with Graves´ disease&#xD;
           are at risk to develop clinical ophthalmopathy. Tobacco exposition and treatment with&#xD;
           radioiodine ar known factors that trigger ophthalmopathy but other factors are poorly&#xD;
           defined. However it is well known that both environmental and genetic factors is of&#xD;
           importance because monozygotic twins show a concordance of 20 - 50 %. One interesting&#xD;
           observation is a patient with inactive and stable Graves´ ophthalmopathy who developed&#xD;
           clinical ophthalmopathy when treated with pioglitazone due to type 2 diabetes (Starkey&#xD;
           2003). One pathogenic mechanism in Graves´ ophthalmopathy is increased orbital&#xD;
           adipogenesis and glitazones are known to increase the volume of subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
           tissue. Orbital fibroblasts from patients with ophthalmopathy have been shown to&#xD;
           differentiate to adipocytes in response to rosiglitazone (Valyasevi 2002). Glitazones&#xD;
           are PPAR-gamma agonists and it could be of interest to study effects of PPARgamma&#xD;
           antagonists in endocrine ophthalmopathy. Diclofenac has been shown to interact with&#xD;
           PPAR-gamma in physiological concentrations and to antagonise PPAR-gamma mediated effects&#xD;
           like adipogenesis of the preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1(Adamsson 2002, Vondrichova 2007).&#xD;
           In addition diclofenac is a well-known inhibitor of cyclooxygenases with effects on the&#xD;
           synthesis of prostaglandins in for example fibroblasts, lymphocytes and monocytes. The&#xD;
           natural ligand for PPAR-gamma is prostaglandin J (Forman 1995). To conclude, NSAID like&#xD;
           diclofenac may affect both synthesis of prostaglandins and concomittantly antagonise the&#xD;
           effects of the natural ligand to PPAR-gamma, prostaglandin J2. We have recently&#xD;
           demonstrated upregulation of immediate early genes, including COX-2, with important&#xD;
           functions in adipogenesis in patients with severe ophthalmopathy (Lantz 2005).&#xD;
           Previously there is only one study published on treatment of ophthalmopathy with NSAID&#xD;
           ,indometacin (Amemia 1982). Although only 7 patients were studied there were effects on&#xD;
           soft tissue symptoms, eye protrusion and eye muscle symptoms. Due to the knowledge of&#xD;
           retrobulbar morphological changes in patients with Graves´ thyrotoxicosis without&#xD;
           clinical ophthalmopathy it may be of importance to interact as early as possible. We&#xD;
           therefore plan to start a randomised single-blind study where patients will receive&#xD;
           diclofenac for 12 months in parallel with the standard treatment for thyrotoxicosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial is a multi-center (Malmö and Stockholm), controlled, single-blind design and&#xD;
           the subjects are randomised to thyrostatics with and without diclofenac by a body&#xD;
           independent from the study The total duration of the study is 24 months with 12 months&#xD;
           treatment with or without diclofenac in addition to regular treatment for&#xD;
           thyrotoxicosis. The follow up period will be 12 months. Decision of the main treatment&#xD;
           of thyrotoxicosis is based on clinical terms according to routines in Malmö and&#xD;
           Stockholm and is given according to the protocol of TT96. Patients are randomised for&#xD;
           adjuvant therapy with or without diclofenac after choice of main treatment for&#xD;
           thyrotoxicosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be monitored by a science nurse with formal education in monitoring&#xD;
           clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if diclofenac can prevent development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves´&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the activity at diagnosis of ophthalmopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the time from thyrotoxicosis to ophthalmopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the frequency of patients with corticosteroid requiring ophthalmopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Endpoints&#xD;

&#xD;
           II. The time from thyrotoxicosis to ophthalmopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. The frequency of corticosteroid requiring ophthalmopathy. Criteria for start of&#xD;
           steroid treatment are: 1. Risk of corneal ulcers with or without exophthalmos 2. Double&#xD;
           vision within 30 degrees 3. Optic nerve dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Treatment of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients that fulfill the inclusion criteria and accept participation in the study&#xD;
           will after decision of main treatment for thyrotoxicosis be randomised to treatment with&#xD;
           or without diclofenac. Patients will receive diclofenac 50 mg 1x2 for 12 months in&#xD;
           addition to standard treatment of thyrotoxicosis according to the following routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thyrostatics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive p.o. methimazole (Thacapzol) 5 mg 3x2 supplemented with&#xD;
           L-thyroxine (Euthyrox) after 14 days, initially for the first two weeks 0.5x1, and&#xD;
           thereafter 1x1. If the patient react with allergic symptoms to methimazole, treatment is&#xD;
           changed to propylthiouracil (Tiotil) 50 mg 3x3. Adjustment of L-thyroxine is done with&#xD;
           help of thyroid laboratory parameters (TSH, fT4) and titration after clinical response.&#xD;
           The dose of thyrostatics is not reduced and if necessary on demand the dose is&#xD;
           increased. If necessary, a beta-blocker is used, primarily propranolol (Inderal) 40 mg&#xD;
           1x1-3 or metoprolol (Seloken) 50 mg 1x1-3 which can be increased depending of patients&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Measurement of laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           All laboratory analyses will be performed at the department of Clinical Chemistry, Malmö&#xD;
           University Hospital and at the department of Clinical Chemistry Karolinska University&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rationale for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adjuvant treatment already at diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis has been chosen in the aim to&#xD;
           prevent clinical ophthalmopathy due to the fact that morphological changes of&#xD;
           ophthalmopathy in the orbital room exist in Graves´ thyrotoxicosis in up to 98% of the&#xD;
           patients without clinical symptoms. The long period of time for treatment with&#xD;
           diclofenac is justified by the knowledge that the majority of patients at risk for&#xD;
           developing ophthalmopathy exhibit clinical symptoms within 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 150 statistically analysable patients (the total number of patients included&#xD;
           will be 10% higher to compensate for loss of subjects) , with 75 in each treatment arm&#xD;
           will be included in the study.&#xD;

      6.1 Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects attend to the first screening visit one week before randomisation. Before screening&#xD;
      the participants have been provided with written information of the trial. The subjects will&#xD;
      be informed, orally and in writing of their responsibilities / rights during the trial as&#xD;
      well as possible advantages / disadvantages of the trial. Subjects who wish to participate&#xD;
      will be asked to sign and date an Informed Consent Form prior to any trial-related activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated a subject number and the following will be performed and recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thyroid history&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. General physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pregnancy test will be performed as per judgement of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Concomitant illness and medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Information and choice of the routine treatments for thyrotoxicosis&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Actual eye status, performed by an ophthalmologist within 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. An appointment will be made for visit w0&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Randomization visit, w0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data and other information gathered at screening visit is reviewed and the final&#xD;
      decision regarding participation in the trial is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will now be randomised to adjuvant treatment with or without diclofenac. The&#xD;
      randomization procedure will be designed by an independent body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Trial material&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is not performed in direct collaboration with the drug manufacturers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary evaluation variable is the proportion of present or new cases of endocrine&#xD;
      ophthalmopathy. The null-hypothesis is that there is no differences between the two treatment&#xD;
      alternatives according to this proportion (H0:pi 1 = pi 2). The number of patients in each&#xD;
      group when performing a two-side significance test on the 5% level for different demands on&#xD;
      power and different values in the given proportions of the hypothesis is shown in a separate&#xD;
      diagram. With 72 patients in each group there is 80 % chance (power) to get significant&#xD;
      results if the real difference is 0.2. The hypothesis is tested with Mantel Haenzels test and&#xD;
      further analyses performed with logistic regression which take into consideration the effect&#xD;
      of prognostic factors.&#xD;
