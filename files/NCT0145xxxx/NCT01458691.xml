    <time_frame>Postinjection 1month</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use.</description>

    <measure>Safety determined with symptoms &amp; signs of infection and immune response and adverse events evaluated with NCI-CTCAE v3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Postinjection 1month</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of general symptoms or signs associated with infection and immune response, such as rash, pruritus, fever, chills, urticaria, or dyspnea.&#xD;
Injection sites were examined to identify erythema, swelling, or abnormal discharge.&#xD;
Adverse events were categorised with use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale, version 3.0.</description>
