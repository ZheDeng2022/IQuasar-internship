      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of iniparib as a single agent&#xD;
           and in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
           that are refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the antitumor effect of iniparib (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
           Tumors [RECIST]) Version 1.1 in patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize iniparib (and its metabolites, if possible) pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data generated by Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess&#xD;
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been&#xD;
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,&#xD;
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of&#xD;
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell&#xD;
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.&#xD;
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess&#xD;
      eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1&#xD;
      cycle (3 weeks or 4 weeks depending on regimen) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug. However, treatment&#xD;
      may continue until precluded by toxicity, progression, or death.&#xD;
