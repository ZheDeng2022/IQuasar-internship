  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By improved kidney dosimetry including biological effective dose and taking into account&#xD;
      potential risk factors (especially for kidney toxicity), it might be possible to give an&#xD;
      optimal and personalized treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-TATE to the patient with metastatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor.&#xD;

    <description>177Lu-DOTA-TATE given as intravenous infusion given during 3-5 treatments. Evaluation is performed after every single cycle. Further more, evaluation is made after last cycle, and delivered cumulative dose to kidneys should be 27 Gy.&#xD;
Patients with stable disease or partial response, and without pronounced toxicity will continue treatment to a step 2, where additional 3-5 treatment cycles are given, with a cumulative dose to kidneys to 40 Gy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically verified neuroendocrine tumors with a Ki67 of at least 20 % or at least&#xD;
             20 mitoses/high power fields. If the tissue on which this determination is based is&#xD;
             several years old, the investigator should consider the option of acquiring a new&#xD;
             determination, especially if the behaviour of the tumor has changed since diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease where complete resection is not considered possible or feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiological disease progression during the last 14 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The largest metastases should have an uptake of 111In-octreotide that is greater than&#xD;
             the uptake in the liver by planar scintigraphy. Metastases that are small, or located&#xD;
             centrally, can be evaluated by SPECT to enable a correct estimation of the relative&#xD;
             uptake. The majority of the tumor burden must demonstrate an increased uptake for&#xD;
             lutetium-treatment to be considered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of somatostatin analogue for the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated survival more than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC more than 1.5 x 10 9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GFR more than 50 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed written informed concent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continues to fulfill all of the inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion&#xD;
             criteria, from step 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A maintained GFR (less than 40 % decrease compared to baseline AND GFR more than 50&#xD;
             ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treatment in step 1 have been administered with a maximal interval of 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age under 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status ECOG 3-4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proliferation index (Ki67) more than 20 % or more than 20 mitoses/hpf&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loco-regional treatment during the last 3 months involving all of the measurable&#xD;
             lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy during the last 3 months, or longer if persisting toxicity exists.&#xD;
             Earlier treatment with mTORi or TKI is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concommitant nephrotoxic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Modifications of the somatostatine dose in the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiotherapy including more than 25 % of active bone marrow volume&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy and lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extensive liver metastases (more than 50 % of liver volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic CNS metastases requiring corticosteroid treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing treatment with interferon. This treatment should be suspended a minimum of 4&#xD;
             weeks before treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-TATE, or longer if there is persisting signs of&#xD;
             toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have another metastatic tumor diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive disease since start of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ toxicity grade 3-4 during step 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious hematological toxicity during previous treatment cycles (ANC less than 0.5 x&#xD;
             10 9 or platelets less than 50.0 x 10 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Longstanding diabetes (more than 8 years). Patients with a well-controlled diabetes&#xD;
             with a history of less than 8 years and a blood pressure less than 130/80 and no&#xD;
             albuminuria (albumin/creatinine index)can be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension, i.e. more than 160/90 (for diabetics more than 130/80). Antihypertensive&#xD;
             pharmacological treatment is permitted as long as there is no manifest albuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous liver embolisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous chemotherapy&#xD;
