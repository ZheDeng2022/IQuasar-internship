    <description>A piece of occipital scalp is taken from the subject. The epidermal and dermal cells from this tissue are expanded in culture. The cells are then harvested and, for certain types of product, combined. These cells are then injected into the balding area of the scalp of the original subject.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used any oral or topical medication including over the counter and&#xD;
             herbal medications for the treatment of hair loss within 6 months of study screening,&#xD;
             or finasteride or dutasteride within 12 months of study screening (with the exception&#xD;
             of minoxidil).&#xD;

          -  Insufficient hair or scarring in the donor area that might impact cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might compromise hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,&#xD;
