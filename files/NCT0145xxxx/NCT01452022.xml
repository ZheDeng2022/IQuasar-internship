    <textblock>
      This is an open-label non-randomised, prospective, post market study to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of Inductigraft (osteoinductive synthetic bone graft) in patients receiving&#xD;
      posterolateral lumbar spine fusion through assessment of successful fusion at 12 months post&#xD;
      operation using x-rays and CT scans. Quality of life questionnaires also used to assess&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures such as pain and quality of life. Patients followed up for 24&#xD;
      months after surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease (DDD) or lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two&#xD;
             continuous spinal level(s), including subjects with spondylolisthesis (i.e.&#xD;
             degenerative or isthmic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has failed at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to clinical trial&#xD;
             enrolment and is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery over one or two vertebral&#xD;
             levels between, and including, L2 to S1 (i.e. second lumbar to first sacral)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years old and skeletally mature (epiphyses closed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is, in the Investigator's opinion, psychosocially, mentally, and physically able to&#xD;

             up visits, the filling out of required forms, and have the ability to understand and&#xD;
             give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has diagnosis of symptomatic DDD, spondylolisthesis, or lumbar spinal stenosis at more&#xD;
             than two levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior fusion surgery at any lumbar level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has systemic infection or infection at the surgical site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant metabolic bone disease such as osteomalacia, autoimmune disease&#xD;
             including rheumatoid arthritis, renal disease, hepatic disease, peripheral vascular&#xD;
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, Paget's disease at the involved spinal level(s)&#xD;
             or upper motor neuron disease (positive Babinski sign)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a medical condition that would interfere with post-operative assessments and care&#xD;
             (i.e. psychiatric disease, paraplegia, quadriplegia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is in poor general health or any concurrent disease process that would place the&#xD;
             subject in excessive risk to surgery (e.g. significant circulatory, pulmonary&#xD;
             problems, or cardiac disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history (present or past) of substance abuse (recreational drugs, prescription&#xD;
             drugs or alcohol) that in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with protocol&#xD;
             assessments and/or with the subject's ability to complete the protocol required follow&#xD;
             up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is known to be pregnant/breastfeeding at the time of enrollment, or plans to become&#xD;

             surgery resulting in significant muscle/ligament morbidity. This does NOT include&#xD;
             facet saving techniques such as discectomy, laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures&#xD;
             including nucleotomy, IDET procedures or annuloplasty procedures&#xD;
&#xD;

             involved level)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a condition or requires post-operative medications that may interfere with&#xD;
             bone/soft tissue healing (i.e. oral or parenteral glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives,&#xD;
             methotrexate, etc.), or that effect the rate of bone metabolism unless they have&#xD;
             undergone a 14 day wash out period prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is undergoing treatment for osteoporosis (excluding osteopenia) such that in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated&#xD;
