  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      illnesses as well as more severe lower respiratory illnesses, including bronchiolitis and&#xD;
      pneumonia. RSV affects almost all children within the first 2 years of life. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immune response to the RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 vaccine among adults,&#xD;
      RSV-seropositive children, and RSV-seronegative infants and children.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of the RSV MEDI ΔM2-2&#xD;
      vaccine in the four groups of participants. The study vaccine will be evaluated in adults, in&#xD;
      RSV-seropositive children, and in a dose-ranging study in two groups of RSV-seronegative&#xD;
      infants and children.&#xD;
