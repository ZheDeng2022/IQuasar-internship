      Open-label, pharmacodynamic, safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy study of Lunacalcipol&#xD;
      Injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, PD, safety, PK and efficacy study of Lunacalcipol&#xD;
      Injection. Approximately 12 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups&#xD;
      receiving either 180 µg (n=4) or 270 µg (n=8) Lunacalcipol Injection in a 1:2 ratio,&#xD;
      respectively. All subjects are planned to receive a total of 11 doses of the study drug given&#xD;
      three times per week (tiw) over 24 days (day 1 to day 24), administered not more often than&#xD;
      every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously defined criteria relating to serum levels of iPTH, Ca, and P will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the Medical Monitor to determine subject safety. If any of the criteria are observed,&#xD;
      subjects will be discontinued from the study, receiving no further administration of the&#xD;
      study drug and will be followed for safety. Safety data will be reviewed by the Medical&#xD;
      Monitor for the first 2 subjects in the 270 µg group. If the first 2 subjects meet dose group&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria, including treatment emergent calciphylaxis, treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse events (TEAEs) related to elevated serum Ca levels, or a reported death associated&#xD;
      with elevated serum Ca levels or related to study drug, subjects beyond the first 2 will not&#xD;
      be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to provide an independent&#xD;
      evaluation of all safety data, including all laboratory results and serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs). The DSMB will conduct its review after 4 subjects in the 270 µg dose group have&#xD;
      completed at least 6 doses, at any time death is reported, or at the request of the DSMB. The&#xD;
      DSMB will also conduct an additional review at the End of Study.&#xD;
