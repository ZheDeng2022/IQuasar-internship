      The goal of this study is to compare a sample of the cyst taken by a standard method (fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration) to the sample taken by a new method using a device called the EchoBrush to&#xD;
      see which method is more accurate at diagnosing cancer. We will also look at proteins (also&#xD;
      called biomarkers) in the samples to see if they predict whether or not the cyst is&#xD;
      cancerous.&#xD;

      Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be offered the study and those&#xD;
      who consent will undergo Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) evaluation. All patients who consent to&#xD;
      the study will undergo Endoscopic Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and EUS&#xD;
      guided EchoBrush. All patients will receive the recommended standard antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      (Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV given 30 minutes prior to EUS) that is used prior to EUS-FNA of&#xD;
      cystic pancreatic lesions and a prescription for oral Ciprofloxacin for 5 days post procedure&#xD;
      (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with pancreatic cysts that are &gt;10 mm but under 25 mm: These patients will&#xD;
      undergo standard EUS-FNA of cyst fluid. From the first 19 participants, 0.5cc of aspirated&#xD;
      cyst fluid will be sent for Proteomic analysis and the rest for cytology. EUS guided&#xD;
      EchoBrush of the cyst wall will not be performed in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with pancreatic cysts that are &gt; 25 mm will undergo EUS guided Echobrush&#xD;
      sampling of the cyst wall at the same time they undergo EUS-FNA. This will be done using the&#xD;
      standard technique that is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS guided cyst wall brushing and residual fluid aspirated after lavage with 2 cc of sterile&#xD;
      normal saline The tip of the Echobrush and the saline used to lavage the cyst will be placed&#xD;
      in the same specimen jar (Specimen 2) based on the discussion with published experts on the&#xD;
      EchoBrush technique. It should be noted that the pancreatic cyst will be punctured with the&#xD;
      19G FNA needle only once to obtain the specimens mentioned above. A single pass with EUS-FNA&#xD;
      is the standard of care for pancreatic cysts and this study does not alter standard of care.&#xD;
      It should be noted that the two groups represent two samples from the same patient and same&#xD;
      cystic lesion. Therefore each patient will serve as their own internal control. All patients&#xD;
      will be considered for surgical resection. Patients who do not undergo surgical resection&#xD;
      will be followed up per standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>The difference in diagnostic accuracy between the cytological grade of dysplasia on aspirated cyst fluid cytology (Specimen/ Group 1) and Echo Brush cytology (Specimen/ Group 2) when compared to surgical histology (Specimen 3).&#xD;
Specifically, the cellularity (scored 0 to 3) of specimen 1 will be compared to specimen 2 using the two-sample proportion test. In addition, the Spearman's rank correlation will be used to calculate the correlation between cytological grade of dysplasia of specimen 1 to specimen 3, and the correlation between specimen 2 to specimen 3.</description>
