  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not people with schizophrenia who take&#xD;
      LY2140023 become physically dependent on it, and experience a series of symptoms such as&#xD;
      craving to have the drug when they stop using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial consists of two phases: An open-label phase consisting of up to 4 weeks and a&#xD;
      double-blind phase consisting of up to 3 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum 3-Day Moving Average (MA) of the Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to Week 2 of randomization treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The checklist is a 30-item, participant-rated scale that asks whether participants experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, anxiety, irritability, or craving for study drug during the previous day to assess potential symptoms of drug withdrawal. Each item is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (severe). Total scores range from 0-90. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. The 3-day MA was calculated starting the third day until the last day of double-blind, randomized period. The 3-day MA was the average of scores from that day and previous 2 days. If scores from any of the days during the 3-day was missing, the average was based on the non-missing days. If there was no total scores for any day of the 3-day, the average was considered to be missing. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline total score, treatment, pooled investigative site and gender.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization up to Week 2 in the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, randomization treatment Weeks 0.5 and 1 and 1.5 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The CIWA-Ar is a 10-item scale that was used to monitor for symptoms of drug withdrawal. The scale includes the following domains/criteria: nausea, vomiting; anxiety; paroxysmal sweats; tactile disturbances; visual disturbances; tremors; agitation; orientation and clouding of sensorium; auditory disturbances; and headache. Items 1-9 have possible scores of 0 (no symptom)-7 (severe symptom), and item 10 has possible scores of 0 (no symptom)-4 (severe symptom). Total scores range from 0-67. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptom. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline CIWA-Ar total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline CIWA-Ar total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 2 in Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) Global Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, randomization treatment Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The BAS is a 4-item instrument that evaluates akathisia associated with use of antipsychotic medications. Item 4 is the Global Clinical Assessment (Global Score) and is rated 0 to 5 (0 = absent, 5 = severe). The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline BAS global score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline BAS global score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 2 in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, randomization treatment Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is used to measure parkinsonian-type symptoms in participants exposed to antipsychotics. SAS consists of 10 items; each rated on a 5-point scale, with 0 meaning complete absence of the condition and 4 meaning the presence of the condition in extreme form. The total score is obtained by adding the ten items, and ranges from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline SAS total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline SAS total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 2 in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, randomization treatment Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS is a 12-item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Items 1 to 10 are rated on a 5- point scale, with 0 being no dyskinetic movements and 4 being severe dyskinetic movements. Items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions regarding the dental condition of a subject. The AIMS 1-7 total score is the total of items 1 through 7 of the AIMS, and ranges from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline AIMS 1-7 total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline AIMS 1-7 total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations Measured Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) During Open-Label Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4 of open-label treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. The percentage of participants with treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior during open-label treatment period (with a change from baseline in C-SSRS) was calculated as the number of participants with an increase in suicidal behavior or ideation over baseline (before open-label treatment), divided by the total number of participants multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Maximum 3-Day Moving Average (MA) of the Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels Total Score</title>
        <description>The checklist is a 30-item, participant-rated scale that asks whether participants experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, anxiety, irritability, or craving for study drug during the previous day to assess potential symptoms of drug withdrawal. Each item is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (severe). Total scores range from 0-90. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. The 3-day MA was calculated starting the third day until the last day of double-blind, randomized period. The 3-day MA was the average of scores from that day and previous 2 days. If scores from any of the days during the 3-day was missing, the average was based on the non-missing days. If there was no total scores for any day of the 3-day, the average was considered to be missing. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline total score, treatment, pooled investigative site and gender.</description>

          <title>Maximum 3-Day Moving Average (MA) of the Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels Total Score</title>
          <description>The checklist is a 30-item, participant-rated scale that asks whether participants experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, anxiety, irritability, or craving for study drug during the previous day to assess potential symptoms of drug withdrawal. Each item is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (severe). Total scores range from 0-90. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. The 3-day MA was calculated starting the third day until the last day of double-blind, randomized period. The 3-day MA was the average of scores from that day and previous 2 days. If scores from any of the days during the 3-day was missing, the average was based on the non-missing days. If there was no total scores for any day of the 3-day, the average was considered to be missing. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline total score, treatment, pooled investigative site and gender.</description>

        <description>The CIWA-Ar is a 10-item scale that was used to monitor for symptoms of drug withdrawal. The scale includes the following domains/criteria: nausea, vomiting; anxiety; paroxysmal sweats; tactile disturbances; visual disturbances; tremors; agitation; orientation and clouding of sensorium; auditory disturbances; and headache. Items 1-9 have possible scores of 0 (no symptom)-7 (severe symptom), and item 10 has possible scores of 0 (no symptom)-4 (severe symptom). Total scores range from 0-67. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptom. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline CIWA-Ar total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline CIWA-Ar total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 2 in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The SAS is used to measure parkinsonian-type symptoms in participants exposed to antipsychotics. SAS consists of 10 items; each rated on a 5-point scale, with 0 meaning complete absence of the condition and 4 meaning the presence of the condition in extreme form. The total score is obtained by adding the ten items, and ranges from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline SAS total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline SAS total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations Measured Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) During Open-Label Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. The percentage of participants with treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior during open-label treatment period (with a change from baseline in C-SSRS) was calculated as the number of participants with an increase in suicidal behavior or ideation over baseline (before open-label treatment), divided by the total number of participants multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 2 in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Total Scores</title>
        <description>BPRS is an 18-item clinician-administered scale used to assess the degree of severity of a participant's general psychopathological symptoms. Item scores range from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). Total Scores range from 18 to 126. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) mean and standard error. LS mean values are controlled for baseline BPRS total score, treatment, gender, pooled investigative site, visit, baseline BPRS total score*visit and treatment*visit.</description>
