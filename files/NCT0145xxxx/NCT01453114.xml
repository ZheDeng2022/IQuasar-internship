  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to adapt a cognitive behavioral prevention of&#xD;
      recurrence treatment (CBT-PR) for women with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder&#xD;
      who decide to discontinue their maintenance anti-depressant (AD) treatment for pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a small year-long pilot to collect data for a planned larger, randomized&#xD;
      control trial in the future. The current protocol focuses on modifying a Cognitive-Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) recurrence prevention protocol for the study population, finalizing a therapist&#xD;
      training manual, finalizing therapist adherence and competence scales, and fine tuning&#xD;
      research procedures for recruitment and retention of subjects. This phase will involve&#xD;
      enrolling 20 subjects in order to have at least 12 subjects receive CBT treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks with assessments conducted bimonthly. The subjects will have the option of having&#xD;
      additional monthly &quot;booster&quot; CBT sessions. Independent Assessments by HRC-approved study&#xD;
      staff and interviews with study psychiatrists will occur at 16 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and&#xD;
      1 year after study initiation. Participants will be offered the opportunity to speak with a&#xD;
      study psychiatrist at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is rate of recurrence and/or re-initiation of antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment up to 12 months post-randomization. The study end point of procedures is 12 weeks&#xD;
      after baseline; the study end point for follow-up assessments is one year after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the point of enrollment, subjects will have reviewed risks and benefits of perinatal&#xD;
      depression treatment in a consultation with a non-study psychiatrist in the MGH Center for&#xD;
      Women's Mental Health (CWMH) program and in collaboration with the subject's primary&#xD;
      psychiatrist, and decided to discontinue AD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential subject will then undergo a preliminary phone screening with a CWMH research&#xD;
      coordinator where basic eligibility criteria are reviewed. If the potential subject is&#xD;
      interested, she will be scheduled for a baseline study visit conducted by the PIs or another&#xD;
      study clinician. After an explanation of study procedures, written, informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. This will occur prior to execution of any study assessments or procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, the clinician will conduct a structured clinical interview using&#xD;
      the MINI and HRC-approved study staff will complete study assessments. If the potential&#xD;
      subject continues to be interested in participating in the study and remains eligible, she&#xD;
      will meet with a study psychiatrist who will instruct her on how to begin the taper of her&#xD;
      antidepressant, if she has not already started to taper. The subject will then meet with the&#xD;
      clinician who will administer the CBT treatment for the first session&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12 weeks have passed, subjects will be asked to complete assessments at 16 weeks,&#xD;
      24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 1 year after beginning the study, and will be able to choose to&#xD;
      continue monthly booster sessions of CBT-PR. Subjects will also be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      meet with study psychiatrists every booster session. Visits with the study psychiatrist will&#xD;
      be arranged at the discretion of the study psychologist and/or upon participant request. An&#xD;
      optional qualitative interview will be conducted by study staff after completion of the acute&#xD;
      treatment phase in order to obtain feedback on the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who experience a relapse of depressive symptoms during study participation will&#xD;
      have the option of remaining in the study and continuing to receive CBT treatment regardless&#xD;
      of decisions regarding antidepressant treatment. Additionally, the investigators will ask&#xD;
      patients who experience a relapse to complete a questionnaire regarding the course of relapse&#xD;
      and their treatment decisions at one year after study enrollment. This questionnaire can be&#xD;
      completed over the phone or at home and returned by mail.&#xD;
