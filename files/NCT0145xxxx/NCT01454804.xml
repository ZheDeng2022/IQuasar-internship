    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combinations of pazopanib and either lapatinib or trastuzumab that can be given to patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer. The safety of the drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients needed for&#xD;
      tumor growth. This may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking 2&#xD;
      proteins on the surface of the cancer cell, which are HER 1 and HER 2 receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      proteins inside the cancer cell, called the Her2/neu receptor.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide which&#xD;
      study drugs you will receive based on the disease type and the drugs you have taken in the&#xD;
      past&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive either a combination of pazopanib and lapatinib (Arm A) or a combination of&#xD;
      pazopanib and trastuzumab (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 dose levels of each combination will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      at each dose level of each combination. The first group of participants will receive the&#xD;
      lowest dose level of each combination. Each new group(s) will receive a higher combination&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Participants may be&#xD;
      enrolled on 1-3 similar dose levels at the same time. You will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      based on when you joined this study. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose(s)&#xD;
      of the study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable doses of the different combinations are found, this dose of each&#xD;
      combination will be given to an expansion group of 20 extra participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Arm A, you will take lapatinib by mouth 1 time each day. You will take&#xD;
      pazopanib by mouth 1 time every other day (Day 1, 3, 5, and so on). You should take pazopanib&#xD;
      and lapatinib either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Arm B, you will take pazopanib by mouth 1 time each day. You will receive&#xD;
      trastuzumab by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. The first infusion will be over&#xD;
      90 minutes. If you handle the infusion well, the next infusions will be over 30 minutes. You&#xD;
      should take pazopanib either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you&#xD;
      may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 3 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 3 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 4 of Cycle 2 and then every 2-3 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, and/or x-ray to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you continue to&#xD;
      have intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan,&#xD;
           and/or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Lapatinib and trastuzumab are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. The combination of pazopanib and&#xD;
      lapatinib or pazopanib and trastuzumab is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 174 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
