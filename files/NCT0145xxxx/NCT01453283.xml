  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trabectedin is an experimental drug that kills some cancer cells in the laboratory and&#xD;
           in mice by interfering with genetic material (DNA) in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In some adult patients with cancer who received trabectedin, tumors grew slower or&#xD;
           shrank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a dose of trabectedin that can be given safely to children and adolescents&#xD;
           as a 24-hour continuous infusion through a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the side effects of trabectedin in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study how the body handles trabectedin by measuring the amount of the drug in the&#xD;
           bloodstream over time after a dose is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect of trabectedin on DNA in white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if an individual's tumor cells have a specific proteins involved in DNA&#xD;
           repair and if a pattern of genes can be identified in tumor samples that might help&#xD;
           explain why trabectedin reduces tumors in some individuals and not others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study genetic factors that may influence the way the body handles trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if trabectedin is beneficial in certain types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Children between 4 year and 17 years of age with tumors that recur or no longer respond to&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive trabectedin as a 24-hour continuous infusion repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
           The first three children entering the study receive a dose of 1.1 mg/m2. Subsequent&#xD;
           groups of up to six patients receive higher doses (1.5 mg/m2 and 1.7 mg/m2) as long as&#xD;
           the preceding dose is well tolerated. Patients enrolled at the lowest dose level may&#xD;
           have their dose increased to the next level if they tolerated the lower dose well.&#xD;
           Treatment may continue as long as the cancer does not worsen and the treatment is&#xD;
           tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have blood drawn on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the first treatment cycle to&#xD;
           study how the body handles trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tumor sample obtained from a prior surgery or biopsy is examined for proteins involved&#xD;
           in DNA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample is drawn to look for genetic factors that may influence how the body&#xD;
           handles trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have periodic physical examinations and blood tests. MRI or CT scans are done&#xD;
           before starting therapy and after every two treatment cycles to evaluate the tumor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabectedin (ET-743) is a natural product derived from the marine tunicate Ecteinascidia&#xD;
      turbinata. It binds to the minor groove of DNA and interacts with various transcription&#xD;
      factors resulting in cell cycle arrest. It also inhibits transcription coupled nucleotide&#xD;
      excision repair system inducing lethal DNA strand breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical and clinical studies, trabectedin has been found to be active in many soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcomas including leiomyosarcoma, synovial cell sarcoma, neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, renal and prostate&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adult phase I and phase II studies, trabectedin has been well-tolerated up to dose levels&#xD;
      of 1.9mg/m(2)/dose with the most common toxicities being fatigue, neutropenia, and reversible&#xD;
      transaminase elevations. Objective responses were seen at doses equal to or greater than&#xD;
      1.5mg/m(2)/dose. Trabectedin 1.5mg/m(2) administered as a 24-hour continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion is the recommended dose and schedule in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pediatric phase I study of trabectedin administered as a 3-hour infusion has been completed&#xD;
      in the Children's Oncology Group. The maximum tolerated dose was 1.1 mg/m(2). Dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity was reversible elevation of hepatic transaminases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of trabectedin administered as a 24-hour&#xD;
      continuous infusion in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the toxicity profile of trabectedin administered as a 24-hr infusion in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin administered as a 24-hr infusion in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify double strand DNA breaks in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients receiving&#xD;
      trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue, when available from prior&#xD;
      biopsies or surgical procedures, for the expression of the nucleotide excision repair&#xD;
      proteins and genomic instability markers (histone gamma-H2AX, phospho-ATM, phospho-Chk2) by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular characterization of DNA repair genes and correlation to outcome using mRNA isolated&#xD;
      from microdissected archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the pharmacogenetics of host DNA repair proteins and drug metabolizing enzymes to&#xD;
      explore the impact of host factors on trabectedin toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children greater than or equal to 4 years and less than 17 years of age with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive trabectedin as a 24-hour continuous infusion repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
      The starting dose level is 1.1mg/m(2)/dose with escalations to 1.5mg/m(2)/dose and&#xD;
      1.7mg/m(2)/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive dexamethasone pretreatment and growth factor support with&#xD;
      filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of dose-limiting hepatic toxicity will be identical to the definition used in&#xD;
      phase I trials in adults on the same dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the first treatment&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six patients will be enrolled at the first dose level and up to 6 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled on subsequent dose levels. Dose escalation will be based on tolerability of&#xD;
      trabectedin at the prior dose level. For patients enrolled at dose level 1 (1.1mg/m(2)),&#xD;
      intrapatient dose escalation to dose level 2 (1.5mg/m(2)) will be allowed with subsequent&#xD;
      cycles if no dose limiting toxicities occurred at the lower dose level. Total accrual will be&#xD;
      up to 24 patients.&#xD;
