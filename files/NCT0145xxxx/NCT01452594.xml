      The drug diphenylcyclopropenone, or DPCP, modifies the immune system and has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in treating certain kinds of cancer. This study hopes to improve our understanding&#xD;
      of how this drug helps create an effective immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is the primary line of defense against infections and other things&#xD;
      perceived as foreign to the body. Unfortunately, this immune system often fails to eliminate&#xD;
      tumors or other cancerous growths. The drug diphenylcyclopropenone, or DPCP, modifies the&#xD;
      immune system and has been shown to be effective in treating certain kinds of cancer. This&#xD;
      study hopes to improve our understanding of how this drug helps create an effective immune&#xD;
      response. In order to reach this goal, normal volunteers will be given the DPCP drug in the&#xD;
      form of a gel or a placebo gel (gel without the active chemical) on a few small areas of&#xD;
      skin. Then, biopsies will be taken of the skin at the sites where the active drug was placed.&#xD;
      Also, small biopsies will be taken from opposite areas of skin which received placebo gel to&#xD;
      serve as controls. The biopsied skin samples will then be studied by methods such as&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis which will help define the immune reaction&#xD;
      caused by DPCP. The rationale for the study is to better understand how the immune system can&#xD;
      be activated to produce cells that may fight infections or cancers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             pregnant, willingness to use an acceptable method of contraception to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy for the duration of the study (while receiving study medication and for one&#xD;
             month following the last dose of study medication). Acceptable forms of contraception&#xD;
             are listed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a negative urine pregnancy test (for WOCBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking any of the following systemic or topical therapies within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment: corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or any other medications that may&#xD;
             affect the outcome of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to bandage or adhesive tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have active localized or systemic medical conditions that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would preclude or make unsafe their participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any underlying concomitant diagnosis that may influence immune reactions&#xD;
             (e.g. eczema, psoriasis, lupus)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are nursing mothers, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant at anytime&#xD;
             during the course of the study or within 30 days of study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to comply with study procedures, communicate effectively,&#xD;
             cooperate with the investigator, or are unable to understand the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been treated with another investigational device or drug within 30&#xD;
             days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive as determined by self-reported history and/or a HIV POCT at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History, physical, social or lab findings suggestive of any medical or psychological&#xD;
             condition that would, in the opinion of the PI, make the candidate ineligible for the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
