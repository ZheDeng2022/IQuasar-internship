      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Savers are used intraoperatively to decrease the risk of transfusion due to surgical&#xD;
      blood loss. Blood collected from the operative field is anticoagulated, filtered, and stored&#xD;
      in a reservoir. Once a set volume of blood has been collected in the reservoir, the blood is&#xD;
      separated into its red blood cell and plasma components by use of a centrifuge. Red blood&#xD;
      cells are washed with a crystalloid solution and then reinfused into the patient. Although&#xD;
      the theoretical benefits of using a cell saver are attractive, the literature seems to be&#xD;
      controversial with respect to efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The benefits are clear in&#xD;
      patients undergoing fusions for scoliosis that involve more than 5 levels where blood loss is&#xD;
      considered substantial. It is less clear in patients who undergo a more limited two to three&#xD;
      level lumbar fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of using a cell saver for 2&#xD;
      to 3 level lumbar fusions. A secondary objective is to determine if there will be a decrease&#xD;
      in the number of allogenic blood transfusions when a cell saver is used intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Another secondary objective is to determine incidence of complications associated with cell&#xD;
      saver use and transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Patients seen at the Norton Leatherman Spine Center scheduled to have decompression&#xD;
      and fusion over 2 to 3 lumbar spine segments will be screened for the study. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, patients will be randomized to have a cell saver used intraoperatively&#xD;
      (Cell Saver group) or no cell saver (Non-Cell Saver group). Data to be collected will include&#xD;
      age, gender, smoking status, height, weight, co-morbidities, the use of medications that may&#xD;
      increase bleeding (Plavix, Coumadin, Warfarin), or increase blood production (Ferrous&#xD;
      sulfate, erythropoietin) medications used to decrease intraoperative bleeding (Aprotinin,&#xD;
      Tranexamic Acid); the use of hypotensive anesthesia, ASA Grade, indications for surgery, date&#xD;
      of surgery, estimated blood loss, surgical approach, surgical levels, bone graft used,&#xD;
      operative time, complications, length of stay, discharge information, whether or not patient&#xD;
      pre-donated blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit and maximum body temperature prior to surgery and&#xD;
      during the patient's hospital stay, surgical drain output, products transfused&#xD;
      intraoperatively and postoperatively and the amount of cell saver salvaged, re-infused, and&#xD;
      the cell-saver hematocrit and hemoglobin prior to re-infusion. The costs associated with the&#xD;
      use of the cell-saver and/or blood transfusions, including supplies and personnel time, will&#xD;
      be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be through stratified block randomization to allow for&#xD;
      stratification of the number of levels fused. Randomization will use sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size To detect a medium effect size of 0.3 with an α error of 0.05, a total of 220&#xD;
      subjects need to be included in the analysis. To account for subject withdrawal, a total of&#xD;
      240 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Patients receiving care at the Norton Leatherman Spine Center will be screened as&#xD;
      potential subjects for the study. Only the existing information obtained per standard routine&#xD;
      medical procedures will be used. Patients who fail pre-screening will not be recorded on any&#xD;
      log or form. Patients considered potential candidates for the study based on screening will&#xD;
      sign an Institutional Review Board -approved Informed Consent Document and HIPAA&#xD;
      Authorization form prior to participating in any study activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive or not receive cell saver during surgery. The&#xD;
      following data will be collected during the clinic visit: age, gender, smoking status,&#xD;
      height, weight, co-morbidities, the use of medications that may increase bleeding (Plavix,&#xD;
      Coumadin, Warfarin), or increase blood production (Ferrous sulfate, erythropoietin). The&#xD;
      following pre-operative data will be collected: hemoglobin, hematocrit, body temperature and&#xD;
      whether or not patient pre-donated blood, the predonated blood volume and date of donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed per the standard of care of the treating surgeon. The choice of&#xD;
      surgical approach, instrumentation and bone grafts/bone graft substitutes will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon. The following intraoperative data will be collected: use of&#xD;
      hypotensive anesthesia, ASA Grade, indications for surgery, date of surgery, estimated blood&#xD;
      loss, surgical approach, surgical levels, bone graft used, operative time products transfused&#xD;
      intraoperatively. In the subjects randomized to the Cell Saver group, the amount of cell&#xD;
      saver salvaged, re-infused, and the cell-saver hematocrit and hemoglobin prior to re-infusion&#xD;
      will be determined and collected. In-hospital post-operative data to be collected include:&#xD;
      complications, length of stay, discharge information, hematocrit, hemoglobin and maximum body&#xD;
      temperature during the patient's hospital stay, surgical drain output, products transfused&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be transfused at a set transfusion threshold of hemoglobin of 7.0g/dL or below&#xD;
      and corresponding hematocrit of 21 or below. Subjects with Hb 7.0g/dL and are symptomatic as&#xD;
      evidenced by tachycardia, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension or have pre-existing cardiac&#xD;
      or pulmonary disease will also be transfused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks that occur in this study are associated with the general risks of spine surgery.&#xD;
      Risks associated with allogeneic blood transfusion include allergic reactions, hemolytic&#xD;
      reactions, isoimmunization, graft versus host reactions, increased infection rates, and&#xD;
      transmission of bloodborne pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis.&#xD;
      Risks associated with the use of a cell saver include a paradoxical increase in blood loss,&#xD;
      electrolyte depletion, metabolic acidosis, and hematuria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary endpoint is the volume of blood transfusion required. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate post-op Hematocrit level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate post-op Hemoglobin level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of blood products used post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics, including frequency counts for discrete&#xD;
      variables and measures of central tendency (means, medians) and dispersion (standard&#xD;
      deviation, range) for continuous variables will be calculated. Comparisons between the Cell&#xD;
      Saver and non-Cell Saver groups will be done with independent t test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and χ2 tests for discrete variables. To determine the effects of potentially confounding&#xD;
      variables, analysis of covariance to compare the Cell Saver and non-Cell Saver groups will be&#xD;
      used. This will help identify variables that may be statistically different between the Cell&#xD;
      Saver and non-Cell Saver groups that could potentially influence the total units of blood&#xD;
      transfused. Those variables that were significantly related (i.e., correlated) with the&#xD;
      number of units of blood transfused will be entered as covariates into the statistical model&#xD;
      to determine if they affect the statistical conclusions between the Cell Saver and non-Cell&#xD;
      Saver groups. All analyses will performed an a priori alpha level of 0.05 using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      version 19.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding This study will be unfunded.&#xD;
