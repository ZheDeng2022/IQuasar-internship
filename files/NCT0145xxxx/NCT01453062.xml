    <textblock>
      B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a subtype of mature peripheral B-cell neoplasms,&#xD;
      characterized by the accumulation of circulating malignant lymphocytes that typically express&#xD;
      cell surface markers CD5, CD20, and CD23. It is the most common type of leukemia in adults in&#xD;
      Western Europe and in the US. The median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years, with a male to&#xD;
      female ratio of 2:1. Initially, most patients present with asymptomatic lymphocytosis and do&#xD;
      not need cytoreductive therapy. Patients with active disease are characterized by a&#xD;
      lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months, or progressive, even massive lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
      hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night&#xD;
      sweats, unintended weight loss, and extreme fatigue are common in advanced disease and can&#xD;
      significantly impact quality of life. CLL also causes relative immunosuppression that&#xD;
      increases the risk of infections that are ultimately the major cause of death in this patient&#xD;
      population. Median survival at diagnosis ranges from 5 to 20+ years depending on risk&#xD;
      factors, but is only 6 to 14 months for patients with CLL refractory to available therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arzerra (ofatumumab) is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds specifically to a&#xD;
      distinct epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20&#xD;
      molecule. The CD20 molecule is a transmembrane phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from&#xD;
      the pre-B to mature B lymphocyte stage and on B-cell tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arzerra is designated as an orphan medicinal product in the European Union (EU) for treatment&#xD;
      of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) concluded&#xD;
      that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was estimated to be affecting approximately 3.5 in 10,000&#xD;
      persons in the Community at the time the application was made (June 2008) and that the&#xD;
      condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to poor&#xD;
      long-term survival in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arzerra was given a conditional approval in the EU on April 19, 2010. The approved indication&#xD;
      in the EU for the product is treatment of CLL in patients refractory to fludarabine and&#xD;
      alemtuzumab. A specific obligation for this conditional approval was an agreement by GSK to&#xD;
      conduct a post-marketing observational study in CLL patients receiving Arzerra. The data from&#xD;
      this study is intended to enhance the evidence of the safety and efficacy of Arzerra as it is&#xD;
      used in clinical practice, and once final data are available, together with results of a&#xD;
      second specific obligation study, will support the transition from conditional to a full&#xD;
      approval of Arzerra in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this observational study is to provide additional data to confirm the safety&#xD;
      profile and efficacy of Arzerra for CLL patients treated in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular data of interest are: co-morbidities (specific chronic disease diagnoses),&#xD;
      concomitant medications, disease (CLL) characteristics, prior treatment regimens, adverse&#xD;
      events, reasons for discontinuation of Arzerra therapy, Arzerra response, progression free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, non-interventional, medical record review study in CLL patients. A&#xD;
      total of 100 patients with CLL who have previously received Arzerra, whether alive or&#xD;
      deceased, and have either completed the full course of Arzerra therapy or discontinued&#xD;
      treatment early will be eligible to participate in the study. Centers across Europe who are&#xD;
      members and non members of the European Research Initiative of CLL (ERIC) and treat CLL&#xD;
      patients will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLL patients newly initiating Arzerra who are still undergoing the treatment phase and&#xD;
      patients having been treated with Arzerra in phase II or phase III clinical trials will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have completed approximately 1 year or more of follow up since Arzerra&#xD;
      initiation, data on response to Arzerra, adverse events during treatment and subsequent to&#xD;
      treatment, patient status, progression free survival and overall survival covering the period&#xD;
      up to approximately one-year post-drug initiation will be collected. For patients who have&#xD;
      not completed approximately l year of follow-up since Arzerra initiation, including those who&#xD;
      have been lost to follow up or died prior to one year or have not yet had a full year to&#xD;
      elapse in calendar time, similar data will be collected at the point in time at the last&#xD;
      available patient contact with the physician using information in the record. After approach&#xD;
      for informed consent from the patient or next of kin for patients who have died to review the&#xD;
      medical record, no interaction with the patient will occur.&#xD;
