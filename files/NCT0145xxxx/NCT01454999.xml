      This project aims to enhance the emotional and physical well-being of veterans through the&#xD;
      reduction of smoking by utilizing a web-based, computerized tailored intervention (CTI) with&#xD;
      feedback messages delivered via cell phone. CTIs have shown increasing promise as useful&#xD;
      behavior change programs for improved health behaviors. A variety of modalities are to&#xD;
      deliver personalized CTI information and feedback; however, the ubiquity and sophistication&#xD;
      of today's wireless mobile technologies represent new modes of delivery for empirically based&#xD;
      smoking cessation and other behavioral health interventions. The CTI is based on the&#xD;
      empirically-supported Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM). A web-based CTI&#xD;
      modified for a veteran population will be used to pilot test the effectiveness of the CTI&#xD;
      alone and CTI plus individualized text messaging enhancements. The pilot study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to assess the cell phone's feasibility as an intervention&#xD;
      modality for changing smoking behaviors. This will be the first study to adapt a smoking&#xD;
      cessation Internet-based CTI to provide personalized feedback on a cell phone to reduce&#xD;
      smoking behaviors in military veterans.&#xD;

      Objective: This project examined the effectiveness of tailored text messages as an&#xD;
      enhancement to a computerized tailored intervention (CTI) for smoking cessation with&#xD;
      Veterans. It was theorized that the ubiquity and sophistication of today's wireless mobile&#xD;
      technologies would represent new modes of delivery for empirically based smoking cessation&#xD;
      and other behavioral health interventions. CTIs have shown increasing promise as useful&#xD;
      behavior change programs for improved health behaviors; however, the ubiquity and&#xD;
      sophistication of today's wireless mobile technologies represent new modes of delivery for&#xD;
      evidence-based smoking cessation and other behavioral health interventions. The CTI was based&#xD;
      on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and developed by Pro-Change Behavior&#xD;
      Systems, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This randomized, prospective pilot employed a 2 (group) x 3 (timepoint)&#xD;
      research design. Veteran smokers were recruited nationally from direct mailings, Facebook&#xD;
      ads, community newsletters, posters, and flyers. In addition to the randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT), a focus group (n=9) and individual usability tests (n=5) were conducted in order to&#xD;
      assess the acceptability of the graphic user interface, questions, tailoring and program&#xD;
      content to Veteran smokers. The pilot study tested the effectiveness of the CTI alone and CTI&#xD;
      plus individualized text messaging enhancements in reducing smoking behavior in Veterans. In&#xD;
      addition to smoking cessation, readiness to change other negative health behaviors � such as&#xD;
      alcohol use, healthy eating, and exercise � was also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Research Methodology and Procedures: Usability Testing: Five separate usability&#xD;
      tests were conducted for the CTI smoking cessation program using a combination of the Think&#xD;
      Aloud protocol and Wizard of Oz approach. Usability testing software was used to take notes&#xD;
      and record participant interactions with the program. Participants provided qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative feedback on overall presentation and usability of the program. All interview&#xD;
      data were coded, categorized, and summarized in a feedback report so that revisions to the&#xD;
      system could be adapted. Pilot Study: At all three timepoints, participants completed a brief&#xD;
      Health Risk Intervention (HRI), two additional smoking assessments, and the smoking cessation&#xD;
      (SC) intervention. The HRI assessment determined baseline readiness to change for smoking and&#xD;
      several other related health behaviors, and the smoking cessation intervention provided&#xD;
      assessment and feedback about participants' confidence to quit smoking, decisional balance,&#xD;
      and use of various change strategies. Following the baseline HRI and SC intervention, the CTI&#xD;
      system randomized participants into either the treatment group (Tx), who also received the&#xD;
      CTI only, or the treatment-plus group (Tx-plus), who received the CTI and tailored text&#xD;
      messages. The study was conducted as entirely anonymous. All participants were given three&#xD;
      months' access to the web-based CTI system. The Tx participants received only the online&#xD;
      feedback narratives/report that all participants received upon completion of the online&#xD;
      Smoking Cessation intervention. Tx-plus participants also received individualized text&#xD;
      messages on their cell phones 2-5 times per week (the number of messages correlated with the&#xD;
      participant's stage of change) that provide expert guidance, encouragement, and reminders&#xD;
      that support their smoking cessation efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings: Four-hundred and forty-six Veterans were recruited at baseline. All participants&#xD;
      were active smokers, distributed across the stages of change as 11.9% in Precontemplation&#xD;
      (n=53; not intending to change in the next 6 months); 63% in Contemplation (n=281; intending&#xD;
      to change in the next 6 months), and 25.1% in Preparation (n=112; intending to change in the&#xD;
      next 30 days). Two-hundred and thirty-five individuals (52.7%) completed the one-month and&#xD;
      three-month follow-ups: n=116 in the treatment group (CTI only; Tx) and n=119 in the&#xD;
      treatment-plus group (CTI plus text messages; Tx-plus). Results indicated that the&#xD;
      CTI-plus-text-messaging intervention outperformed the CTI-only intervention at an&#xD;
      unprecedented quit rate. For those participants in the Tx group 32.8% had quit smoking at&#xD;
      three-month follow-up; however, those in the Tx-plus group had quit rates of 43.2%. These&#xD;
      findings are highly encouraging, and exceed those quit rates found for other CTI&#xD;
      interventions for both groups by almost 15% (Krebs, Prochaska &amp; Rossi, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Participant Experiences: While data are available only for those participants who&#xD;
      completed the study, indications from the User Satisfaction Scale, as well as the open-ended&#xD;
      questions, were that Veterans found the CTI and tailored text messages to be both appropriate&#xD;
      and relevant. In addition, participants in the Tx-plus group also indicated that the text&#xD;
      messages were helpful, timely and useful. There were no adverse events to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Current Risk - Potential Benefit Assessment based on Study Results: This study was&#xD;
      able to demonstrate that the TTM is an appropriate model to promote multiple behavior change&#xD;
      in Veterans. Furthermore, the addition of tailored text messages increased the effect of the&#xD;
      smoking cessation intervention (CTI) and improved quit rates in the Tx-plus group to levels&#xD;
      that are unprecedented in the literature. Additionally, individuals who were at risk for&#xD;
      other health behaviors progressed to A or M without intervention. For Veterans who are not&#xD;
      ready for in-person psychotherapy, have practical issues attending therapy sessions, or fear&#xD;
      stigma associated with seeking mental health care, this Veteran-tailored, motivational&#xD;
      enhancement CTI may provide unique benefits. In addition, Veterans who smoke and have&#xD;
      comorbid behavioral risk factors may find this CTI sufficient to resolve their problems. In&#xD;
      this sense, the adapted CTI will make evidence-based mental health care more accessible to&#xD;
      Veterans in need without adding concerns about stigma and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/Significance: This is the Final Abstract for this research project. This study was the&#xD;
      first to adapt a smoking cessation Internet-based CTI to provide personalized feedback on a&#xD;
      cell phone to reduce smoking behaviors in military Veterans. The findings suggest that&#xD;
      behavior change interventions can be successfully delivered to Veterans via the Internet, and&#xD;
      that tailored text messaging can significantly enhance the intervention effects.&#xD;
