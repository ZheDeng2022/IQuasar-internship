      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Pompe&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is a rare (estimated at 1 in every 40,000 births), inherited and often fatal&#xD;
      disorder that disables the heart and muscles. It is caused by mutations in a gene that&#xD;
      encodes an enzyme called alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, the body uses GAA to break down&#xD;
      glycogen, the long-term storage form of sugar, into glucose, which the body can utilize to&#xD;
      gain energy. But in Pompe disease, mutations in the GAA gene reduce or completely eliminate&#xD;
      the activity of this essential enzyme. Excessive amounts of glycogen accumulate everywhere in&#xD;
      the body, but the cells of the heart and skeletal muscles are the most seriously affected.&#xD;
      Re-searchers have identified up to 70 different mutations in the GAA gene that cause the&#xD;
      symptoms of Pompe disease, which can vary widely in terms of age of onset and severity. The&#xD;
      severity of the disease and the age of onset are related to the degree of enzyme deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early onset (or infantile) Pompe disease is the result of complete or near complete&#xD;
      deficiency of GAA. Symptoms begin in the first months of life, with feeding problems, poor&#xD;
      weight gain, muscle weakness, floppiness, and head lag. Respiratory difficulties are often&#xD;
      complicated by lung infections. The heart is grossly enlarged. More than half of all infants&#xD;
      with Pompe disease also have enlarged tongues. Most babies with Pompe disease die from&#xD;
      cardiac or respiratory complications before their first birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late onset (or juvenile/adult) Pompe disease is the result of a partial deficiency of GAA.&#xD;
      The onset can be as early as the first decade of childhood or as late as the sixth decade of&#xD;
      adulthood. The primary symptom is muscle weakness progressing to respiratory weakness and&#xD;
      death from respiratory failure after a course lasting several years. The heart may be&#xD;
      involved but it will not be grossly enlarged. A diagnosis of Pompe disease can be confirmed&#xD;
      by screening for the common genetic mutations or measuring the level of GAA enzyme activity&#xD;
      in a blood sample - a test that has 100 percent accuracy. Once Pompe disease is diagnosed,&#xD;
      testing of all family members and consultation with a professional geneticist is recommended.&#xD;
      Carriers are most reliably identified via genetic mutation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the&#xD;
      disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to develop new biochemical markers from the plasma of&#xD;
      the affected patients helping to benefit the patient by an early diagnose and thereby with an&#xD;
      earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of mass-spectometry, maximal 10&#xD;
      ml blood will be taken from the patient via using a dry blood spot filter card. To proof the&#xD;
      correct Pompe diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic&#xD;
      testing has been done, sequencing of Pompe will be done as rou-tine diagnostic.&#xD;
