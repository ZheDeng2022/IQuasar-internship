  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington disease is characterized by difficulties in movement and thinking. Psychological&#xD;
      disturbances including irritability, aggression, loss of interest, depressed mood, obsessions&#xD;
      and compulsions, also represent common symptoms of HD. These symptoms are distressing both&#xD;
      for HD patients and their caregivers, contribute to the loss of ability to carry out&#xD;
      activities of daily living, and present a major treatment challenge for physicians. The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the effect of memantine on movement, thinking and emotional&#xD;
      difficulties in HD patients. Memantine is a medication originally approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of aggression and agitation in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD),&#xD;
      which has also recently been shown to improve the behavioural and neuropathological symptoms&#xD;
      in a mouse model of Huntington Disease (HD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRACK-HD was a multi-centre, multi-national, prospective, observational study of pre-manifest&#xD;
      and early Huntington's disease (HD) with a control group of volunteers not carrying the HD&#xD;
      mutation. The goal of the project was to contribute essential methodology that will form the&#xD;
      basis for clinical trials in pre-manifest and early HD. TRACK-HD complemented existing&#xD;
      observational studies (e.g., Predict-HD, PHAROS, COHORT), sharing some features, but also&#xD;
      having areas of unique emphasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UBC site recruited 90 subjects including 30 control subjects, 30 asymptomatic&#xD;
      pre-manifest HD gene carriers and 30 subjects with early symptoms of HD (stage 1 or 2). All&#xD;
      subjects were assessed using the TRACK-HD battery at baseline, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years.&#xD;
      Following the fourth visit (3 year assessment), the TRACK-HD study will be completed, and the&#xD;
      30 subjects with early symptoms of HD will be invited to enroll in the MITIGATE-HD Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MITIGATE-HD study is a single center Phase IIb,out-patient,randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of memantine treatment in subjects with Huntington disease (HD). The&#xD;
      study will evaluate Memantine 10 mg two times daily (BID) administered orally (PO) for six&#xD;
      months (24 weeks) compared with matching placebo BID. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      assessed by recording of adverse events and by monitoring of vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations, and suicidality risk scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRACK-HD assessment battery will be administered to all subjects after six months of&#xD;
      study drug administration. The effects of memantine will be evaluated both against placebo as&#xD;
      well as compared to the previous 3 years of observational data from the TRACK-HD Study.&#xD;
