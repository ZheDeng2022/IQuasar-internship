  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if patients with the flu would receive oseltamivir&#xD;
      treatment more quickly if it were prescribed by a pharmacist as compared to a physician, and&#xD;
      to see if there is any difference in the effect of treatment on flu symptoms and overall&#xD;
      health. Another reason for doing the study is to see how accurately pharmacists can diagnose&#xD;
      the flu as compared to physicians. Viruses that are exposed to antiviral medications (like&#xD;
      oseltamivir) sometimes develop a resistance to the medication. This means that the medication&#xD;
      is no longer as effective in treating the symptoms caused by the virus. The development of&#xD;
      viral resistance to oseltamivir will also be followed in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age presenting at the pharmacy with a current&#xD;
             prescription for oseltamivir (75 mg capsule BID for 5 days as per the Canadian label)&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Willingness to undergo 2 nasal swab procedures&#xD;

             started within a maximum of 2 days prior to the visit to the pharmacy (see Appendix A:&#xD;
&#xD;
             FACTSS Influenza Diagnostic Tool)&#xD;
