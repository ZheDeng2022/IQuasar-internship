  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfavorably high sodium intakes remain prevalent around the world. A negative sodium gradient&#xD;
      in hemodialysis treatment results in absolute sodium removal via diffusive transport of&#xD;
      sodium from the blood to the dialysate, and it may be a potentially useful tool to improve&#xD;
      sodium loading due to excess dietary sodium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a in small negative sodium gradient could&#xD;
      improve blood pressure level, arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy in&#xD;
      hypertensive hemodialysis patients, who had been achieving and maintaining their dry weight&#xD;
      assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that lowering dialysate sodium concentration could improve&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) control, and the lower BPs are considered to be a result of an&#xD;
      improvement in volume status via increasing sodium removal. However, sodium, apart from&#xD;
      volume, may have an independent effect on BP regulation. It is speculated that a reduction in&#xD;
      exchangeable sodium, even without a change in body water content, may improve BP control.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, as of yet, no clinical studies have actually provided the evidence in this&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general population, dietary salt loading produces significant increase in aortic pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity, which is reversed by lowering sodium intake. To the investigators knowledge,&#xD;
      the effect of sodium on arterial stiffness has not been investigated in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been achieved through strict dietary&#xD;
      sodium restriction in hemodialysis patients. Lack of effect on LVH was observed in low sodium&#xD;
      dialysis which may be due to the shorter time interval.&#xD;
