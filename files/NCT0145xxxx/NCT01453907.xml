    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and PK of a single IV dose of ETI-204 in subjects 18 to&#xD;
      65 years of age. Three cohorts will be studied with subjects receiving ETI-204. This study&#xD;
      will be randomized, double-blind and stratified by gender. Each cohort will contain 36&#xD;
      subjects (including at least four females), 30 who will receive ETI-204 and six who will&#xD;
      receive placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol AH-105 is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential,&#xD;
      dose escalation study. It will evaluate the safety and PK of single IV doses of ETI-204&#xD;
      administered to approximately 108 healthy male and female subjects. At each dose level, 30&#xD;
      healthy subjects, including at least 4 females, will be randomly assigned to active drug, and&#xD;
      at least 6 healthy subjects of both genders will be randomly assigned to matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Agent: ETI-204 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to protective antigen (PA) from&#xD;
      Bacillus anthracis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening, Inpatient, and Outpatient Follow-up.&#xD;
      Enrollment criteria will be determined during the 21-day Screening Phase (Visit 1), following&#xD;
      by a 3 night inpatient phase where eligible subjects will receive a single dose of IV ETI-204&#xD;
      or matching placebo as described above and undergo routine safety monitoring, dermatologic&#xD;
      assessments, and blood draws at pre-specified time points. Subjects will be discharged from&#xD;
      the center after collection of the 48-hour PK sample. During the subsequent 70-day outpatient&#xD;
      follow-up phase, subjects will return to the center on Days 8, 15, 29, 43 and 71 for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing (hematology and clinical chemistry), physical examinations and vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, and routine safety monitoring. Blood samples for PK and anti-drug antibodies&#xD;
      (ADA)will also be collected. The 70 day post-dosing follow-up in this study was selected to&#xD;
      allow characterization for the PK profile of ETI-204 and the potential development of ADA.&#xD;
