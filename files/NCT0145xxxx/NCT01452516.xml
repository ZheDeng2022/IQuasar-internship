  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine fusion is one of the most common procedures performed in spinal surgery. Several&#xD;
      surgical techniques can achieve a solid union, but the intertransverse posterolateral fusion&#xD;
      (PLF) is the most widely used. However, complications can develop when the bone graft&#xD;
      material used is insufficient to achieve the desired fusion. With its unique properties,&#xD;
      nanOss Bioactive can be mixed with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and other graft materials to&#xD;
      obtain new bone growth during the healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive will result in fusion at 12 months, with&#xD;
      CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of translational motion, and less than&#xD;
      5 degrees of angular motion. In addition, patients are expected to see an improvement in&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index scores, VAS pain scores, and SF36 scores, while decreasing the use&#xD;
      of pain medication, returning to work, and finding satisfaction in the results of their&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      The post marketing clinical trial is designed to assess lumbar fusion using interbody cages&#xD;
      with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions using nanOss&#xD;
      Bioactive bone void filler in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) characterized by&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for this study will be recruited from up to 10 clinical sites. It is estimated that&#xD;
      100 patients will be enrolled in the study. At least 10 investigators will participate in the&#xD;
      study. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent. Preoperatively, the patient will provide his /her medical history and&#xD;
      complete self assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the criteria for entrance into the study will undergo lumbar fusion using&#xD;
      interbody cages with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions&#xD;
      using nanOss Bioactive in combination with local autograft and bone marrow aspirate (BMA).&#xD;
      Anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected. The patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. At each postoperative visit,&#xD;
      the investigator will clinically evaluate the patient and the patient will complete self&#xD;
      assessment documents, Oswestry Disability Index, Quality of Life questionnaires and a surgery&#xD;
      satisfaction survey, e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, or very&#xD;
      unsatisfied with the surgery. Fusion status will be evaluated radiographically at each visit&#xD;
      using plain films. CT scans at 12 months will be evaluated by an independent radiologist.&#xD;
      Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;

             assessed at the time of the preoperative evaluation based on the patient&quot;s history,&#xD;
             physical examination and review of the radiographic evaluations. All patients at risk&#xD;
             for osteoporosis must obtain a DEXA scan of the spine and hip to determine if the&#xD;
             patient has severe osteoporosis. The definition of a patient at risk used by the&#xD;
             National Osteoporosis Foundation includes the following: i. Premature menopause (&lt; 45&#xD;
             years) ii. Prolonged amenorrhea (&gt; one year) iii. Maternal history of hip fracture iv.&#xD;
             Primary hyperparathyroidism or hyperthyroidism v. Chronic renal failure vi. Previous&#xD;
             fragility fractures, particularly of the hip, spine or wrist vii. Patients who have&#xD;
             ever taken corticosteroids in doses &gt;7.5 mg/day for one year or more. Patients will be&#xD;
             excluded if their bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine or hip is more than 1.0&#xD;
             standard deviation (SD) below the mean of normal adults in the presence of one or more&#xD;
             fragility fractures indicating severe osteoporosis. If severe osteoporosis is&#xD;
             diagnosed, the patient must be excluded from the investigational study. If the patient&#xD;
             has osteoporosis or osteopenia, they may be included in the study if he or she meets&#xD;
             the rest of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
