      Atherosclerosis is the major contributor for the morbidity and mortality for the variety of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic calcification on x-ray is a marker for arterial atherosclerosis and an independent&#xD;
      prognostic factor for the morbidity and mortality from a cardiovascular event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid artery stenoses is the current accepted indication for interventional treatment of&#xD;
      carotid artery, for the prevention of embolic event, while other arterial atherosclerosis&#xD;
      indication, is for hemodynamic disturbance and ischemic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will try to find whether incidental aortic calcification can predict carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will be chosen: group A - patients who had CT scan in the hospital (for different&#xD;
      indications); Group B - patients (not from the first group) who have a significant carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis who are indicated for interventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to analyze:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - Patients with aortic calcification, carotid artery stenosis, and patients with both&#xD;
      Group B - Patients who have aortic calcification Comparison of the populations within the&#xD;
      group and among the two will show if a significant correlation between aortic calcification&#xD;
      and carotid artery stenosis exist.&#xD;

      Background - thoracic or abdominal aortic calcification is a documented independent risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease and increased death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is a diffuse multicentric disease in the arterial tree, affecting target&#xD;
      organs (heart, aorta, lower extremities, carotid arteries etc.). Mostly located in arterial&#xD;
      bifurcations (Iliac and carotid artery bifurcations) or in constant repetitive arterial&#xD;
      trauma (Adductors tendon, Hunter's canal). The invasive treatment (endovascular, surgery) is&#xD;
      preserved for patients with critical arterial stenosis or occlusion in symptomatic patients.&#xD;
      Exceptions are the carotid arteries: the majority of patients with a severe internal carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis are asymptomatic patients, which are treated for the prevention embolic&#xD;
      events (TIA's or CVA's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current articles are observational, and describe retrospectively the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      from atherosclerosis with aortic calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators assumption is that if aortic calcification is a marker for diffuse&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, it has good correlation to criptogenous carotid artery disease, and can lead&#xD;
      to early carotid artery disease evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose - to find a reliable correlation between aortic calcification, and carotid artery&#xD;
      stenosis (from atherosclerosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method - two groups will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - patients (age &gt;40 years), that had a CT scan (chest/abdomen) for any indication,&#xD;
      will be evaluated for aortic calcifications. The patients will be additionally examined for&#xD;
      carotid artery stenosis by Doppler ultrasound. (100 patients) Group B - Patients that were&#xD;
      diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound, and were found to have a severe carotid artery stenosis.&#xD;
      These patients are scheduled for a computed tomography-angiography (regardless for the&#xD;
      research) of the cervical arteries, will be additionally complete abdominal/chest tomography&#xD;
      scan, without additional contrast. (50 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results - will be statistically evaluated - Group A - number of patients with aortic&#xD;
      calcification, number of patients with carotid artery stenosis; Group B - Number of patients&#xD;
      that have associated aortic calcification.&#xD;
