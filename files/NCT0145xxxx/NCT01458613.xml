      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of&#xD;
      Maroteaux-Lamy disease from blood&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maroteaux-Lamy disease (MPS VI) is a lysosomal storage disease inherited in an autosomal&#xD;
      recessive pattern. The responsible mutations lie in ARSB (5q11-q13), the gene that encodes&#xD;
      the enzyme arylsulfatase B. The phenotype results from defective dermatan sulfate break-down&#xD;
      with lysosomal accumulation. This accumulation of glycosaminoglycans is responsible for the&#xD;
      widespread signs and symptoms found in this disease. Bone destruction in shoulders, hips and&#xD;
      skull is often seen by the second decade of life and may become evident later in the knees&#xD;
      and spine. Early growth may be normal but eventually slows resulting in short stature.&#xD;
      Dysplasia of bones comprising these joints leads to stiffness and restricted movement. The&#xD;
      face is dysmorphic with coarse features. Bone dysplasia and facial dysmorphism may be seen at&#xD;
      birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelopathy and even tetraplegia can result from vertebral compression. Intelligence is often&#xD;
      normal although more severely affected individuals may have some cognitive defects due to&#xD;
      impaired vision and hearing. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and compromised respiratory&#xD;
      function can result in reduced physical stamina. The tongue is usually enlarged. Accumulation&#xD;
      of dermatan sulfate in heart valves may produce insufficiency or restriction of outflow. A&#xD;
      diagnosis of Maroteaux-Lamy disease can be confirmed by screening for the common genetic&#xD;
      mutations or measuring the level of the arylsulfatase B enzyme activity in a blood sample --&#xD;
      a test that has 100 percent accuracy. Once Maroteaux-Lamy disease is diagnosed, testing of&#xD;
      all family members and consultation with a professional geneticist is recommended. Carriers&#xD;
      are most reliably identified via genetic mutation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the&#xD;
      disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of the&#xD;
      study to develop new biochemical markers from the plasma of the affected patients helping to&#xD;
      benefit the patient by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of mass-spectometry 10 ml EDTA&#xD;
      blood or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct Maroteaux-Lamy&#xD;
      diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has&#xD;
      been done, sequencing of Maroteaux-Lamy will be done as routine diagnostic.&#xD;
