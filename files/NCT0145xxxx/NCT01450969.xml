    <textblock>
      The PREFER Trial has three main objectives. The primary objective of the trial is to show how&#xD;
      much radiation attenuation is provided by XPF in absolute and relative terms. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to measure and compare the amount of radiation that interventional&#xD;
      radiologists are exposed to per case in an interventional suite setting using FDA approved&#xD;
      XPF thyroid collars or standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collars. The third objective is&#xD;
      to assess the operator comfort wearing the XPF protection devices. In order to achieve these&#xD;
      objectives, measurements will be performed in 60 consecutive endovascular procedures&#xD;
      requiring C-arm fluoroscopy performed at BCVI. Participants will be asked to wear an XPF cap&#xD;
      (weighing approximately 100 grams) in every study procedure. Furthermore, a prospective&#xD;
      randomization will be performed, assigning participants to wear their own standard 0.5 mm Pb&#xD;
      equivalent thyroid collar or to wear the FDA approved XPF thyroid collar. Radiation exposure&#xD;
      will be monitored with 4 radiation detectors (TLDs, 2 attached to the cap, 2 attached to the&#xD;
      collar) which the participant is required to wear. After each procedure the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to rate the comfort of wearing the devices on a scale from 1 to 100.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiation attenuation in percentage (%) and in absolute terms (μSv/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>The attenuation is assessed directly after each procedure (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The null hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is inferior to the standard 0.5mm Pb lead equivalent thyroid collar with regard to radiation attenuation/transmission. The alternative hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is non-inferior to the standard thyroid collar. If there is truly no difference between standard and XPF thyroid collars, then 60 patients are required to be 95% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -0.7% transmission rate and -0.013 μSv/min.</description>
