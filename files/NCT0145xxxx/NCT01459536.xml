  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate upper limb function is critically important to maintenance of independence and&#xD;
      prevention of disability in older adults. The goal of this work is to identify factors that&#xD;
      contribute to rotator cuff rupture and improved outcomes for repair. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to identify patients most at risk for rupture and to guide clinicians on&#xD;
      optimal surgical and rehabilitation strategies. This pilot study will quantitatively&#xD;
      characterize the morphological (muscle volume and fatty infiltration) and functional&#xD;
      (shoulder isometric joint strength, movement when performing typical task) changes in the&#xD;
      muscles of the rotator cuff following supraspinatus tear and surgical repair. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients with supraspinatus tear will have reduced muscle&#xD;
      volume and increased fatty infiltration of rotator cuff muscles compared to their&#xD;
      contralateral arm and age-matched controls, which will increase following surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that isometric joint strength in these individuals will be&#xD;
      associated with muscle volume and the degree of fatty infiltration, and that older adults&#xD;
      with a rotator cuff tear will use a restricted range of motion to accomplish functional&#xD;
      tasks. This study emphasizes muscle function and composition with application to&#xD;
      rehabilitation of upper limb function, which complements the theme of the Pepper Center.&#xD;
