    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that the regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and&#xD;
      bortezomib improves the progression free survival and the response rate compared to&#xD;
      historical controls of fludarabine and melphalan alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent blood cancer (10%) after non-hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma. It represents approximately 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. Although&#xD;
      the peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 70 years of age, recent statistics indicate both&#xD;
      increasing incidence and earlier age of onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The historical control 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) is assumed to be 35%. The&#xD;
      proposed therapy of fludarabine, melphalan and bortezomib is expected to improve the PFS by&#xD;
      20%.&#xD;

    <description>The main primary endpoint of this study is two-year progression free survival. Patients are considered a failure with respect to PFS if they die or experience disease progression or relapse. The time to this event is the time from transplantation to relapse/progression, initiation of non-protocol anti-myeloma therapy, or death from any cause. Subjects alive without confirmed disease progression will be censored at the time of last disease evaluation. Deaths without progression are treated as failures no matter when they occur.</description>

Melphalan will be administered at a dose of 140 mg/m2 on transplant day-2&#xD;
Bortezomib will be administered by rapid IV push at a dose of 1.6mg/m2 on days-4 and -1. The bortezomib should be given at least 20 hours after the melphalan.</description>
