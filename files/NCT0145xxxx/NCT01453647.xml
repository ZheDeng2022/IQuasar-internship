      This project will be the first known to explore the relationships among immunity and stress&#xD;
      and the symptoms of fatigue, pain, and mood following guided imagery in women with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia. Finding ways to reduce these unpleasant symptoms may lead to improved function&#xD;
      and well-being in this chronic disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain and fatigue syndrome that affects 3 to 6&#xD;
      million adults in the United States. Consequences of FM include physical and psychological&#xD;
      distress, loss of work productivity, reduced quality of life, and increased use of health&#xD;
      resources. Although the mechanisms underlying the symptomatology of FM are not clear; one&#xD;
      theory suggests potential alterations in cytokine balance. Because the symptoms of FM may be&#xD;
      worsened by stress and negative psychological processes, mind-body modalities may positively&#xD;
      influence the neuroendocrine and immunological mediators of symptoms in FM. Given that immune&#xD;
      modulation by both psychosocial stressors and interventions has been linked to health&#xD;
      changes, self-efficacy (i.e., the belief that one can cope), may be one mechanism affecting&#xD;
      FM outcomes. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to test the effects of a 10-week&#xD;
      guided imagery intervention in comparison to an attention control group among women diagnosed&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia on (a) the primary outcomes of self-efficacy for managing symptoms and&#xD;
      perceived stress and (b) the secondary outcomes of symptoms of fatigue, pain, distressed&#xD;
      mood, and depressive symptoms and markers of immune function; and (2) to examine the&#xD;
      relationships among self-efficacy for managing symptoms, perceived stress, symptoms of&#xD;
      fatigue, pain, distressed mood, and depressive symptoms and markers of immune function. The&#xD;
      biobehavioral framework to guide this project is adapted from psychoneuroimmunology. Using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled two-group design with repeated measures, 72 individuals will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomized into one of two groups: Usual Care plus guided imagery (GI)&#xD;
      intervention (Group 1) or Usual Care alone (i.e., attention control group) (Group 2). The&#xD;
      intervention consists of three 30-minute guided imagery audio recordings to be used in a&#xD;
      proscribed manner over a 10-week period. An ANCOVA model will be used to test for group&#xD;
      differences between the intervention and standard care groups at week 10. This project will&#xD;
      be the first known to explore the relationships among cytokines and perceived stress and the&#xD;
      symptoms of fatigue, pain and mood following the administration of a biobehavioral&#xD;
      intervention in women with FM.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of three audio-recorded guided imagery scripts formatted as three separate tracks on one CD. Each track is 30 minutes in length and is to be used in a recommended order for the first 6 weeks of the intervention and then used in any order for the follow-up weeks, 7 through 10. Project participants will be instructed to use each CD track, as prescribed, a minimum of once daily. CD Track 1 is a basic relaxation entrainment script; CD track 2 is a pleasant scene imagery script; CD track 3 is a well body imagery script.</description>
