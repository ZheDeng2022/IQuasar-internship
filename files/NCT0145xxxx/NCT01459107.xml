  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Millions of people each year sustain injuries, have tumors surgically removed, or&#xD;
      are born with defects that require complex reconstructive surgeries to repair. In the case of&#xD;
      hand, forearm, or arm amputation, prostheses only provide less than optimal motor function&#xD;
      and no sensory feedback. However, hand and arm transplantation is a means to restore the&#xD;
      appearance, anatomy, and function of a native hand. Although over 70 hand transplants have&#xD;
      been performed to date and good functional results have been achieved, widespread clinical&#xD;
      use has been limited due to adverse effects of life-long and high-dose immunosuppression&#xD;
      needed to prevent graft rejection. Risks include infection, cancer, and metabolic problems,&#xD;
      all of which can greatly affect recipients' quality of life, make the procedure riskier, and&#xD;
      jeopardize the potential benefits of hand transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This non-randomized, Phase II clinical trial will document the use of a new&#xD;
      immunomodulatory protocol (aka - Pittsburgh Protocol, Starzl Protocol) for establishing hand&#xD;
      transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive treatment for upper extremity&#xD;
      amputations by minimizing maintenance immunosuppression therapy in unilateral and bilateral&#xD;
      hand/forearm transplant patients. This protocol combines lymphocyte depletion with donor bone&#xD;
      marrow cell infusion and has enabled graft survival using low doses of a single&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug followed by weaning of treatment. Initially designed for&#xD;
      living-related solid organ donation, this regimen has been adapted for use with grafts&#xD;
      donated by deceased donors. The investigators propose to perform 30 human hand transplants&#xD;
      employing this novel protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) To establish hand transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive&#xD;
      strategy for the treatment of upper extremity amputations; 2) To reduce the risk of rejection&#xD;
      and enable allograft survival while minimizing the requirement for long-term high dose&#xD;
      multi-drug immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of Research: Hand transplantation could help upper extremity amputees recover&#xD;
      functionality, self-esteem, and the capability to reintegrate into family and social life as&#xD;
      &quot;whole&quot; individuals. The protocol offers the potential for minimizing the morbidity of&#xD;
      maintenance immunosuppression, thereby beneficially shifting the risk/benefit ratio of this&#xD;
      life-enhancing procedure and enabling widespread clinical application of hand&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>This protocol uses a novel bone marrow cell-based therapy for composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) rather than conventional triple-drug immunosuppression to facilitate long-term graft survival of deceased donor human upper extremities under low-dose maintenance immunosuppression. Initial T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab is followed by upper extremity transplantation and tacrolimus maintenance therapy. Donor bone marrow cells are infused on Day 10 (±4 days) post-transplantation to elicit a host alloimmune response triggering exhaustion and deletion of the respective host (anti-donor) lymphocyte clones. Subsequently, tacrolimus therapy is given for at least 6 months before spaced weaning is considered in stable recipients.</description>
