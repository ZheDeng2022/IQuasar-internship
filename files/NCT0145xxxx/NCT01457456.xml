    <textblock>
      Morquio syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type IV; MPS IV) is a mucopolysaccharide storage&#xD;
      disease that exists in two forms (Morquio syndromes A and B) and occurs because of a&#xD;
      deficiency of the enzymes N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfatase and beta-galactosidase,&#xD;
      respectively. A deficiency of either enzyme leads to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides&#xD;
      in the body, abnormal skeletal development, and additional symptoms. In most cases,&#xD;
      individuals with Morquio syndrome have normal intelligence. The clinical features of MPS IV-B&#xD;
      are less severe than those associated with MPS IV-A. Symptoms may include growth retardation,&#xD;
      a prominent lower face, an abnormally short neck, knees that are abnormally close together&#xD;
      (knock knees or genu valgum), flat feet, abnormal sideways and front-to-back or side-to-side&#xD;
      curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), abnormal development of the growing ends of the long&#xD;
      bones (epiphyses) resulting in dwarfism, and/or a prominent breast bone (pectus carinatum) as&#xD;
      well as bell shaped chest. Though the CNS and peripheral nerves are primarily not affected&#xD;
      the bone defects may result in neurological symptoms such as spinal cord compression. Hearing&#xD;
      loss, weakness of the legs, and/or additional abnormalities may also occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders.&#xD;
      Lysosomes function as the primary digestive units within cells. Enzymes within lysosomes&#xD;
      break down or digest particular nutrients, such as certain carbohydrates and fats. In&#xD;
      individuals with MPS disorders, deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes lead&#xD;
      to an abnormal accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides or&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycans) in the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin and/or teeth. These&#xD;
      accumulations may also be found in the respiratory system, liver, spleen, central nervous&#xD;
      system, blood, and bone marrow. This accumulation eventually causes progressive damage to&#xD;
      cells, tissues, and various organ systems of the body. There are several different types and&#xD;
      subtypes of mucopolysaccharidosis. These disorders, with one exception, are inherited as&#xD;
      autosomal recessive traits and all vary in their clinical phenotype. Within our clinical&#xD;
      trial we focus on MPS type IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the&#xD;
      disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of the&#xD;
      study to develop new biochemical markers from the plasma of the affected patients helping to&#xD;
      benefit the patient by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of mass-spectometry 10 ml EDTA&#xD;
      blood and a dry blood spot filter card are used. To prove the correct Morquio diagnosis in&#xD;
      those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,&#xD;
      sequencing of Morquio will be done as routine diagnostic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
