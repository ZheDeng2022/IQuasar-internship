    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at medium&#xD;
      doses twice daily and high doses once daily (evening dosing) and placebo over an 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period in asthmatic patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately controlled on low&#xD;
      dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy as demonstrated by a decrease in Forced Expiratory&#xD;
      Volume in one second (FEV1) (not less than 10 %, and equal to or less than 25%) and an Asthma&#xD;
      Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 score of not less than 1.5 at time of randomisation.&#xD;

             weeks prior to Visit 1 (see also Section 3.3.1 and Appendix 10.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of not less than 60 to 90% of&#xD;
             predicted normal and an ACQ-6 mean score of less than 1.5 at the pre-screening Visit&#xD;
             1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an improvement in FEV1 not less than 12 % above baseline and an&#xD;

             must be within plus/minus 20 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be never-smokers or ex-smokers with a smoking history of less than10&#xD;

             salbutamol/albuterol HFA MDI. When the reversibility is not achieved at Visit 1, there&#xD;
             will be the option to repeat reversibility test at any visit during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the run-in period (at the same clinic visit) all patients must be both&#xD;
