      Study Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside USA [OUS] Pilot Multi-center prospective feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the safety and preliminary efficacy of the Check-Cap System in patients with&#xD;
      negative FOBT (Fecal Occult Blood Test) or FIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the device in terms of total and segmental transit time and to&#xD;
           study the effect of the presence of polyps and variable colon dimensions on these&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor the functionality of the activation mechanism and of the scanning circuitry&#xD;
           (transmitter detectors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect data about the overall imaging of the colon internal surface during the&#xD;
           passage of the capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a correlation map between the imaging of the polyps by optical colonoscopy&#xD;
           vs. the images of same polyps by the Check-Cap capsule vs. the imaging of same polyps by&#xD;
           CT Colonography (in patients which were referred after positive CTC examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the total radiation exposure to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the distribution of the contrast material within the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, Single arm, Multi-Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - First in Man:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects older than 40 and younger than 75 years old that are eligible for&#xD;
      CRC screening and meet the eligibility criteria for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be enriched with up to 45 patients with known polyps detected by&#xD;
      CTC or colonoscopy, in addition to 15 patient of the device's normal cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that are eligible for enrollment in the study will be tested by FOBT (Fecal&#xD;
      Occult Blood Test) After the Capsule test, they will be referred for optical colonoscopy as&#xD;
      part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B - CE Pilot:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects older than 45 and younger than 75 years old that are eligible for&#xD;
      CRC screening and meet the eligibility criteria for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that are eligible for enrollment in the study will be tested by FIT ,. After the&#xD;
      Capsule test they will be referred for optical colonoscopy Consenting patients with negative&#xD;
      FIT testing scheduled for clinically-indicated optical colonoscopy without contraindication&#xD;
      to either Check-Cap System imaging or optical colonoscopy, and able to undergo the bowel&#xD;
      preparation necessary for optical colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 100 patients in both groups: A:3-5 + B: 55-57 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st visit - recruitment and screening meeting with the Principal Investigator [PI].&#xD;
           Subject will receive the FIT test kit with detailed instructions for executing the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd visit - The FIT kits will be analyzed in order to diagnose the presence of blood in&#xD;
           the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the bowel log form is complete and the bowel frequency is not less than once per 2&#xD;
           days the subject will be asked to sign the Informed Consent Form [ICF] for ingesting the&#xD;
           capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd visit - Subject will ingest the capsule and continue ingestion of contrast material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. th visit - Subjects will return to the PI with the excreted capsule which is expected&#xD;
           within 24-100 hours after ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. th visit - All patients will undergo standard bowel preparation and optical colonoscopy&#xD;
           between 10 and 30 days following imaging with the Check-Cap System.&#xD;
