    <textblock>
      The MANOS device is a carpal tunnel blade used to perform carpal tunnel release (CTR). CTR is&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when conservative therapy fails. This&#xD;
      study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CTR with the MANOS&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Enrollment did not reach our intended sample size due to availability of CTR with MANOS outside&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is scheduled to undergo carpal tunnel release surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has chronic Carpal Tunnel Syndrome with persistent symptoms despite&#xD;
             non-operative treatment, or refusal of non-operative treatment, with one or more of&#xD;
             the following: splinting, NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome must be confirmed by positive results of Electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
             and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is 18-75 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential, including those who have had a tubal&#xD;
             ligation, but excluding those who have not experienced a menstrual period for at least&#xD;
             two years, must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must voluntarily provide written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a prior or current musculoskeletal or neurologic condition that limits&#xD;
             strength, motion, or sensation in the affected hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a medical condition that precludes the use of anesthetic required for&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an ipsilateral injury or other conditions affecting hand function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has acute CTS resulting from an injury (e.g., fracture).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had previous CTR surgery on the affected hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has psychiatric history, head injury or any other condition which, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would prevent patient from complying with post-operative hand&#xD;
             therapy or follow-up visits.&#xD;
