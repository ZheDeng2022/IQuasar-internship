  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impedance aggregometry (IA) (Multiplate速)is a new whole blood platelet function test with&#xD;
      potential use in anesthesia and intensive care. Most anesthetic drugs have been shown to have&#xD;
      in vitro antiplatelet activity. The goal of this in vitro study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      several drugs, frequently used in cardiac anesthesia and intensive care, on platelet function&#xD;
      as measured by IA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impedance aggregometry (IA) on the multiple platelet function analyzer (Multiplate速) ) is a&#xD;
      whole blood point of care test evaluating platelet function. In IA, the increase in&#xD;
      electrical impedance of whole blood is measured after the addition of a platelet activator.&#xD;
      Some of the activators available are arachidonic acid (ASPI Test), ADP (ADP Test), TRAP-6&#xD;
      (TRAP Test) and collagen (COL TEST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an activator is added to the blood sample, the activated platelets will aggregate on the&#xD;
      electrodes embedded in the test recipient. As platelets accumulate on the electrodes surface,&#xD;
      the impedance will increase. The increase is measured and expressed in arbitrary units (AU).&#xD;
      Reduced impedance implies platelet dysfunction or the presence of specific platelet&#xD;
      inhibitors. For example, the ASPI test is inhibited in the presence of acetylsalicylic Acid&#xD;
      and clopidrel inhibits the ADP test. Thrombin (TRAP) is an extremely potent agonist which can&#xD;
      be used to monitor GpIIb/IIIa therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multiplate速 analyzer may have an important role in detecting and analyzing perioperative&#xD;
      coagulopathies, but many drugs, routinely used in cardiac anesthesia or in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, have known in vitro antiplatelet effects, and may interfere with IA interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the influence of lidocaine, propofol, midazolam, and&#xD;
      magnesium on the results of impedance aggregometry and to understand to which extent the&#xD;
      tests are modified by the presence of one of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years old will be recruited. Exclusion criteria are the&#xD;
      use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 2 weeks prior to donation and known&#xD;
      coagulation disorders. Whole blood is taken from the antecubital vein. Platelet count is&#xD;
      measured. Blood samples for Multiplate速 analysis are drawn in hirudin anticoagulated tubes.&#xD;
      During storage, blood is gently moved in order to avoid sedimentation and spontaneous&#xD;
      platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each sample baseline measurements are performed using ASPI Test, ADP Test, TRAP Test and&#xD;
      COL Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four study drugs are added to the blood samples, in isovolumic dilutions, to obtain&#xD;
      subclinical, normal or near toxic plasma concentrations (table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;

      Midazolam (ng/ml) 150 250 500 Propofol (mcg/ml) 2 5 8 Table 1. Plasma concentration of the&#xD;
      four study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every concentration, IA is measured using the 4 different activators. For every test and&#xD;
      dose, the area under the curve is compared with the baseline.&#xD;
