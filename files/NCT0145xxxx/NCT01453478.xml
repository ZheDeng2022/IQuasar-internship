      This is a Phase I study to assess the combined effects of food and suppression of gastric&#xD;
      acid secretion on the relative bioavailability of an immediate release (IR) tablet&#xD;
      formulation and prototype bioenhanced formulations of GSK1325756, an oral interleukin 8&#xD;
      receptor (IL8R also known as CXCR2) antagonist. The objectives are to understand if the&#xD;
      co-administration of food enhances absorption and the inter-subject variability for the&#xD;
      current GSK1325756 IR tablet under fed state proton pump inhibitor (PPI) conditions and&#xD;
      secondly to assess whether two proposed bioenhanced formulations offer any improvement over&#xD;
      the current GSK1325756 IR formulation under PPI conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, randomized, 5-period crossover study will be completed in a single cohort of&#xD;
      subjects, with an interim analysis after completion of Treatment Period 4. During Treatment&#xD;
      Periods 1 to 4, subjects will be randomized to receive GSK1325756 50 mg IR in the fed state,&#xD;
      GSK1325756 50 mg IR in the fasted state, GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 1 in the fasted&#xD;
      state, and GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 2 in the fasted state. Progression to Treatment&#xD;
      Period 5 and the choice of bioenhanced formulation for dosing in this treatment period will&#xD;
      be dependent on the findings of an interim analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile and&#xD;
      relative bioavailability of each formulation following completion of Treatment Periods 1 to&#xD;
      4. In Treatment Period 5, subjects will receive the selected GSK1325756 bioenhanced&#xD;
      formulation in the fed state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability, including&#xD;
      the inter-subject variability, of the immediate release (IR) tablet used for the previous&#xD;
      Phase I studies and 2 prototype bioenhanced tablet formulations of GSK1325756 in healthy&#xD;
      elderly male and female subjects under fed and fasted states during suppression of gastric&#xD;
      acid secretion (concomitant omeprazole, 20 mg, once daily (QD)). Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      provision of information on the oral pharmacokinetic (PK) of GSK1325756 in the elderly under&#xD;
      different dosing conditions during suppression of gastric acid secretion, and additional&#xD;
      safety and tolerability information for oral administration of GSK1325756 in elderly&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will provide an understanding of the PK of three formulations of GSK1325756&#xD;
      during gastric acid suppression in a population of 65 to 80 year old healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
      The effect of food on the PK of each GSK1325756 formulation will also be addressed in this&#xD;
      population. The outcome of this study is likely to guide selection of the most appropriate&#xD;
      formulation/dosing regimen for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completed clinical studies demonstrated that to minimize inter-subject variability of the&#xD;
      exposure to GSK1325756, the current formulation needs to be administered with food,&#xD;
      particularly in elderly subjects. This does not preclude development of the current&#xD;
      formulation, but is not ideal, particularly if twice daily administration is needed in&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and for elderly subjects in which food&#xD;
      intake can be variable. In addition, the inter-subject variability in exposure with the&#xD;
      current formulation when given with omeprazole in the fasted state is not acceptable. This is&#xD;
      likely due to the need for a low pH (acid level) (pH &lt; 2) gastric environment, particularly&#xD;
      in the fasted state, to allow for sufficient solubilization of the GSK1325756 prior to&#xD;
      transport to the small intestine where it is absorbed. Thus, this study is being conducted&#xD;
      for the following reasons: (1) to determine if the current formulation results in acceptable&#xD;
      exposure and inter-subject variability if given with food in subjects in which gastric acid&#xD;
      secretion is suppressed with omeprazole and (2) to determine if a bio-enhanced formulation&#xD;
      can provide an acceptable exposure profile and acceptable inter-subject variability in the&#xD;
      fasted state in subjects in which gastric acid is suppressed. This information will be&#xD;
      important in helping to determine the appropriate formulation and dosing regimen for&#xD;
      progression to studies in COPD patients.&#xD;

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding&#xD;

             the following acceptable forms of contraception methods, one of which must be a&#xD;
             barrier method, from screening until 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment:&#xD;
             1) Established use of oral, injected or implanted methods of contraception. (The&#xD;
             decision to allow use of hormonal contraceptives should be based on the&#xD;
             investigational medicinal product's metabolism and potential for interactions,&#xD;
             pharmacology and adverse event profile e.g., vomiting) 2) Placement of an intrauterine&#xD;
             device or system 3) Barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Barrier&#xD;
             contraceptives must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide, which are not&#xD;
             a barrier method and therefore should not be used alone 4) Male sterilization 5) True&#xD;
             abstinence is acceptable when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject. If a subject is not usually sexually active but becomes active, they should,&#xD;
