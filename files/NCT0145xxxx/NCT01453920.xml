  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current norm in clinical practice for the treatment of choroidal neovascular membranes&#xD;
      (CNVM) secondary to Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) involves monthly injections of&#xD;
      Ranibizumab until the disease is stabilized. At this point, most physicians tend to follow&#xD;
      one of two treatment regimens. 'Treat -and-observe' entails regular follow-up of stable&#xD;
      patients, with treatment thereafter only in the presence of disease recurrence.&#xD;
      Alternatively, in a 'treat-and-extend' dosing strategy, intervals between treatments are&#xD;
      extended as long as disease remains stable. Many clinicians, who employ a treat-and-extend&#xD;
      dosing regimen, do not extend their treatment intervals beyond 3 months. However, it is&#xD;
      possible that the subgroup of patients on every three months 'treat-and-extend' dosing may&#xD;
      represent a uniquely, stable population that would perform particularly well on an&#xD;
      observational regimen with regular follow-up. We hypothesize that there will be a low CNVM&#xD;
      recurrence rate in wet AMD patients stable on every three months Ranibizumab dosing&#xD;
      ('treat-and-extend'), who begin a treat-and-observe protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In North America, AMD is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in those over 65 years&#xD;
      of age.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a potent promoter of angiogenesis&#xD;
      and vascular permeability and its role in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD is well&#xD;
      recognized.2,3 The advent of VEGF inhibitors such Ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech Inc.) has&#xD;
      revolutionized the management of neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab is an intravitreally&#xD;
      administered recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) that&#xD;
      neutralizes all known active forms of VEGF-A. In the landmark phase III clinical studies&#xD;
      MARINA, and ANCHOR, Ranibizumab injections were administered monthly over the course of 2&#xD;
      years to eyes with subfoveal CNVMs secondary to AMD. Ranibizumab was shown to not only&#xD;
      prevent loss of visual acuity (VA) but also improve VA on average in these patients. 4-6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the tremendous benefit of this treatment, the prospect of indefinitely adhering to&#xD;
      the monthly treatment schedules of MARINA and ANCHOR has raised ocular and systemic safety&#xD;
      concerns as well as convenience and cost issues for patient and physician alike. The&#xD;
      identification of alternative dosing strategies capable of reducing the number of required&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injections while still achieving favourable visual acuity outcomes has since been a&#xD;
      subject of great interest. The current norm in clinical practice with Ranibizumab is to&#xD;
      implement an 'initiation phase' followed by an individualized 'maintenance phase' that is&#xD;
      modeled after one of two basic approaches: 'treat-and-observe' or 'treat-and-extend'. Both&#xD;
      regimens are currently considered within the standard of clinical practice. 'Treat&#xD;
      -and-observe' entails treatment and follow-up until the macula is free of exudation, with&#xD;
      treatment thereafter only in the presence of recurrent exudation.7 Alternatively, in a&#xD;
      treat-and-extend dosing strategy, intervals between treatments are extended as long as the&#xD;
      macula remains dry.8 In the 2009 ASRS survey, 56% of physicians reported employing&#xD;
      treat-and-observe and 44% reported employing treat-and-extend for their patients with&#xD;
      neovascular AMD.9 In a study by Oubraham et al10 it was found that a treat-and-extend dosing&#xD;
      regimen may yield greater gains in vision than treat-and-observe, albeit with a greater&#xD;
      number of required injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a treat-and-extend dosing strategy, some patients may require frequent monthly injections&#xD;
      to stabilize their disease, while others may demonstrate a more stable condition requiring&#xD;
      infrequent treatments. Many clinicians who employ a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, do not&#xD;
      extend their treatment intervals beyond 3 months. However, it is possible that the subgroup&#xD;
      of patients on every three months 'treat-and-extend' dosing may represent a unique, stable&#xD;
      population that would perform particularly well on a 'treat-and-observe' regimen.&#xD;
