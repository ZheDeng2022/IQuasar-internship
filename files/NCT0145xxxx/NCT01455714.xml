      Finding early predictors of myocardial in patients with hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scientific objective The study objective is to clarify the grounds of heart exertional&#xD;
           dyspnoea stenocardial pain in patients with well-controlled stage I or II hypertension&#xD;
           according to ESH (European Society of Hypertension), without changes in epicardial&#xD;
           coronary arteries in coronary angiography and normal resting echocardiography result,&#xD;
           and to assess of potential early markers of heart hypertrophy and failure in patients&#xD;
           with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Characteristics of the final result The study is to allow for identification of patients&#xD;
           with hypertension, in whom an early introduction of pharmacological treatment of heart&#xD;
           failure should be considered. Evaluation in the detection of asymptomatic myocardial&#xD;
           dysfunction will include potential heart failure markers such as: cardiotrophin 1,&#xD;
           cystatin C, serum syndecan-4, collagen III N-terminal propetide [PIIINP], MMP-2, MMP-7,&#xD;
           MMP-8, MMP-9 and NT-proBNP, modern echocardiography methods and magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging in order to increase the effectiveness of prevention, diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
           optimalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Project significance Prognosis in heart failure is very serious. It is similar or worse&#xD;
           than in advanced cancer. These data indicate an extreme importance of the optimal early&#xD;
           causal treatment of hypertension and symptomatic treatment of heart failure early stage&#xD;
           in order to prevent the development advanced form of the disease, which has bad&#xD;
           prognosis. In clinical practice, patients with well-controlled hypertension often report&#xD;
           exercise limitation, exertional dyspnea and/or stenocardial pain which is not reflected&#xD;
           in a standard resting echocardiography (normal result), without coronary artery disease&#xD;
           data in electrocardiographic stress test and without change in epicardial coronary&#xD;
           vessels in coronary angiography. The study is designed to establish the panel of&#xD;
           diagnostic tests in patients with hypertension and exertional dyspnoea only, which will&#xD;
           allow for early detection of abnormalities (before symptoms occur) and the start of the&#xD;
           optimal treatment for these patients. Unfortunately, still too small percentage of&#xD;
           patients receives full pharmacotherapy, hence the authors of the latest guidelines of&#xD;
           procedure in heart failure and hypertension put great emphasis on this aspect. Optimal&#xD;
           management may prevent the progression of these patients in stage C heart failure, and&#xD;
           thus bring tangible benefits not only the patients themselves but also, by reducing the&#xD;
           number of costly hospitalizations, significantly reduce health care costs. The number of&#xD;
           hospitalizations for heart failure in Poland is estimated at 100 000 per year, and&#xD;
           hospitalization costs exceed 70% of the total costs associated with the treatment of&#xD;
           heart failure. The issue of exertional dyspnoea and overt heart failure in patients with&#xD;
           hypertension and normal results of resting echocardiography is a new problem, both in&#xD;
           Poland and in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there are no treatment recommendations for this group of patients. Material and study&#xD;
      plan 120 persons (age 40-60 years old) will be included in the study, patients with stage I&#xD;
      or II primary hypertension according to the European Society of Hypertension: Group A- 40&#xD;
      patients without symptoms of heart failure Group B- 40 patients with exertional dyspnoea&#xD;
      Group C - 40 patients with overt heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B (patients with exertional dyspnea/stenocardia) we will include only patients who&#xD;
      have undergone contrast coronary angiography without any identified changes in the epicardial&#xD;
      coronary arteries, which will facilitate answering the presented purpose of research.&#xD;
      Patients in groups A and B with normal resting echocardiography and treated with a maximum of&#xD;
      2 antihypertensive drugs (an ACE inhibitor or a sartan as therapy base), according to the&#xD;
      following regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACEI/ARB + diuretic ACEI/ARB + calcium channel antagonist Group C - treatment in accordance&#xD;
      with the standards for heart failure. Each patient will be informed about the objectives of&#xD;
      the study and give written consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent patients will have performed the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview and documentation analysis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour EKG recording,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography at rest and during submaxinal exercise on a bicycle ergometer,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard labolatory parameters,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of markers: cystatin C, cardiotrophin-1, metaloproteinases: MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-8,&#xD;
           MMP-9, Procollagen III N-Terminal Propeptide (PIIINP), Syndecan 4 (SDC4) and NT-proBNP&#xD;
           Each patient will be informed about the objectives of the study and give written consent&#xD;
           to participate.&#xD;

      The concept and plan of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The attempt to clarify the grounds of heart exertional dyspnoea stenocardial pain in&#xD;
           patients with well-controlled stage I or II hypertension according to ESH (European&#xD;
           Society of Hypertension), without changes in epicardial coronary arteries in coronary&#xD;
           angiography and normal resting echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI evaluation of coronary microcirculation and endothelial function assessed by&#xD;
           flow-dependent vasodilation in hypertensive patients with and without heart failure&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of modern echocardiographic methods and magnetic resonance imaging in the&#xD;
           diagnosis of hypertensive patients with and without overt heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cystatin C as a new marker of organ damage in patients with hypertension and comparison&#xD;
           of cystatin C with GFR assessed by MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance on as&#xD;
           renal function assessment indicators in patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of new markers - cardiotrophin 1 and cystatin C, serum syndecan-4, collagen&#xD;
           III N-terminal propetide [PIIINP], MMP-2, MMP-7,MMP-8, MMP-9 and NT-proBNP in the early&#xD;
           diagnosis of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential markers of heart failure, modern echocardiography methods and magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging in the detection of asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction in order to&#xD;
           increase the effectiveness of prevention and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Searching for the relationship between the type of hypertension (dipper or non-dipper)&#xD;
           and the development of heart failure symptoms, and whether there are differences between&#xD;
           the echocardiographic images of these patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Selection of patients with hypertension, in whom an early introduction of&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment of heart failure should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The study will also help answer the following questions: (a) Which parameters best&#xD;
           assess the overall cardiovascular risk? and (b) When the treatment of heart failure in&#xD;
           patients with hypertension should start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurable effect of this research besides cognitive is to the possibility of reducing&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who come to overt heart failure connected with hypertension&#xD;
      through the optimization of preventive, diagnostic methods and to determine the optimum&#xD;
      treatment in these patients.&#xD;
