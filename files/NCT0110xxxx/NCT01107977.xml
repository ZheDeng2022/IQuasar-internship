  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects as many as 14% of high school-aged students. Symptoms&#xD;
      include discomfort in the abdomen, along with diarrhea and/or constipation and other&#xD;
      gastroenterological symptoms, which can significantly impact quality of life and daily&#xD;
      functioning of patients. Emotional stress appears to exacerbate IBS symptoms suggesting that&#xD;
      mind-body interventions reducing arousal may prove beneficial. Often symptoms can be traced&#xD;
      to childhood and adolescence, making the early manifestation of IBS important to understand.&#xD;
      The current study focuses on young people aged 14-26 years of age with IBS. The study will&#xD;
      test the potential benefits of Iyengar yoga (IY) on clinical symptoms, psychospiritual&#xD;
      functioning and visceral sensitivity. Yoga is thought to bring physical, psychological and&#xD;
      spiritual benefits to practitioners and has been associated with reduced stress and pain.&#xD;
      Through its focus on restoration and use of props, IY is especially designed to decrease&#xD;
      arousal and promote psychospiritual resources in physically compromised individuals.&#xD;
      Sixty-four IBS patients aged 14-26 will be randomly assigned to a standardized 6-week&#xD;
      biweekly IY group-based program (1.5 hour sessions) or a wait-list usual care control group.&#xD;
      The groups will be compared on the primary clinical outcomes of IBS symptoms, quality of life&#xD;
      and global improvement at post-treatment and 2 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include visceral pain sensitivity assessed with a standardized laboratory task (water load&#xD;
      task), and psychospiritual variables including coping, self-efficacy, mood, acceptance and&#xD;
      mindfulness. It is hypothesized that IY will be safe and feasible: with less than 20%&#xD;
      attrition; and the IY group will demonstrate significantly improved outcomes compared to&#xD;
      controls, with physiological and psychospiritual mechanisms contributing to improvements;&#xD;
      clinical treatment gains will be maintained at 2 months following yoga.&#xD;
