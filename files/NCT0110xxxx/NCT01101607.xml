  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal forearm fractures are amongst the most frequently encountered orthopedic injuries in&#xD;
      the pediatric emergency department (ED). Immediate closed manipulation and cast&#xD;
      immobilization, is still the mainstay of management. The initial management of non-displaced&#xD;
      or minimally displaced extremity fractures and relocation of uncomplicated joint dislocations&#xD;
      is part of the usual practice of emergency medicine. Although focused training in&#xD;
      fracture-dislocation reduction techniques is a part of the core curriculum of emergency&#xD;
      medicine training programs, there is limited data discussing outcomes following restorative&#xD;
      fracture care by pediatric emergency medicine (PEM)physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare length-of-stay and clinical outcomes after&#xD;
      closed manipulation of uncomplicated, isolated, distal forearm fractures, by PEMs to those&#xD;
      after manipulation by pediatric orthopedic surgeons. Our hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      difference in emergency department length-of-stay when fracture reduction is performed by a&#xD;
      PEM versus a post graduate year 3 or 4 orthopedic resident. Secondary outcomes that will be&#xD;
      assessed include: loss of reduction needing re-manipulation at follow up, cast related&#xD;
      complications, radiographic and functional healing at 6-8 weeks post injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric forearm fractures are common injuries and a frequent cause for an emergency room&#xD;
      admission. Ward et al have outlined the demands that emergency department coverage places on&#xD;
      practicing orthopedic surgeons. Assuming no statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      outcomes, there are potential advantages of having PEMs provide restorative fracture care at&#xD;
      the initial visit. This practice would permit judicious orthopedic consultation at a time&#xD;
      when several emergency department's are facing an &quot;on call&quot; specialist coverage crisis and&#xD;
      there exists a nationwide shortage of fellowship trained pediatric orthopedic specialists, in&#xD;
      addition to ACGME mandated duty hour restrictions for orthopedic residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pershad et al conducted a retrospective study with historical controls, of 60 patients with&#xD;
      distal radius fracture that were reduced by an orthopedic resident or PEM physician. In this&#xD;
      review, there were no differences in rates of re-intervention to restore fracture alignment&#xD;
      or ED length-of-stay between the two groups.Mean facility charges were lower in the group&#xD;
      treated by PEMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that with goal directed training, PEM physicians can perform closed&#xD;
      reduction of uncomplicated distal forearm fractures with outcomes that are similar to when&#xD;
      fracture reduction is performed by senior orthopedic resident physicians.&#xD;

The proportion of patients with adequate alignments will be compared between the Pediatric Emergency Medicine and the Orthopaedic groups.</description>

Comparisons between the two treatment groups (PEM and OP) will also be made with respect to each of these outcome variables.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion criteria will include patients who present to LeBonheur Emergency room&#xD;
             with an angulated or displaced distal radius fracture that meet standard orthopaedic&#xD;
             criteria for manipulation. Distal forearm will be defined anatomically as the distal&#xD;
             third of the radius or ulna.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria will be patients with an open fracture, neurovascular compromise at&#xD;
        presentation or who have undergone prior manipulation of their fracture. Prior manipulation&#xD;
        of a fracture is defined when a patient has their fracture manipulated at an outlying&#xD;
        facility prior to arriving to LeBonhuer emergency room.&#xD;
