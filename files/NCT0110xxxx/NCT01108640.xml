      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at Yale New Haven&#xD;
      Hospital in a prospective observational fashion. As this is a pilot study to determine the&#xD;
      accuracy of CGM in our patient population we have based our enrollment projection to complete&#xD;
      the study within an approximately 8 month time frame. We will identify three groups of 15&#xD;
      patients who are candidates for enrollment. The primary outcome is the degree of correlation&#xD;
      between the continuous glucose monitor and capillary or arterial blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will be patients who present to the SICU and are hemodynamically unstable.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic instability will be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or the&#xD;
      requirement of continuous infusion of vasopressors to maintain the systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      over 90 mmHg. The second group of patients will be a similar group that is expected to&#xD;
      require massive fluid or blood resuscitation (&gt;6L crystalloid or &gt;6 units of blood) to&#xD;
      maintain systolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg. This second group of patients will consist&#xD;
      mainly of trauma patients. These patients or their closest available relative will be&#xD;
      approached for consent to participate in the trial. For patients enrolled through a surrogate&#xD;
      who regain their decision making capacity they will be informed of their participation in the&#xD;
      study by one of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group will be patients undergoing elective surgical procedures that will likely&#xD;
      require a post-operative admission to the SICU. This group will include patients undergoing&#xD;
      open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, esophagectomy, or other major abdominal or thoracic&#xD;
      operation that will likely require a SICU stay of more than 24 hours. At least half of this&#xD;
      group will consist of diabetic patients. These patients will be selected by one of the&#xD;
      investigators based on their likelihood of requiring more than 24 hours of SICU care. Based&#xD;
      on the experience of the investigators we believe we will be able to accurately predict which&#xD;
      patients will require an ICU stay of at least 24 hours. Most commonly these patients will&#xD;
      have significant co-morbid medical conditions including coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, etc. An attempt will be made to contact these&#xD;
      patients pre-operatively by telephone within 1 week of their planned surgery at which time&#xD;
      details of the research will be explained. Their willingness to participate will be&#xD;
      ascertained and they will be formally enrolled and sign consent on the morning of surgery if&#xD;
      possible. On some occasions patients will require ICU stays post-operatively that were not&#xD;
      predicted pre-operatively. These patients and any patients that were not identified&#xD;
      pre-operatively by the research team will be enrolled post-operatively often through their&#xD;
      surrogate similar to the other study groups. Similarly if patient are enrolled&#xD;
      pre-operatively and subsequently do not require SICU admission they will not undergo any of&#xD;
      the study procedures and not be counted towards the total enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the surgical ICU a subcutaneous glucose sensor (Guardian RT® CGMS) will be&#xD;
      placed by one of the investigators after informed consent has been obtained. Insertion will&#xD;
      be in the lower lateral abdomen using the insertion device provided with the Guardian RT®&#xD;
      system. For patients for whom lower abdominal insertion is impossible, e.g. those with open&#xD;
      abdomens, a site will be chosen in the proximal thigh or proximal arm based on the estimated&#xD;
      thickness of the subcutaneous fat. The sensor transmits a signal wirelessly to a&#xD;
      receiver/monitor. This receiver/monitor will be maintained in the patient's room. The meter&#xD;
      will be calibrated based on an arterial or capillary blood glucose obtained within one hour&#xD;
      of sensor insertion per pre-existing SICU routine care. The meter will then be recalibrated&#xD;
      every 12 hours based on blood glucose measurements obtained per existing SICU routine. The&#xD;
      existing protocol in the SICU is measurement of a blood glucose every hour while on an&#xD;
      insulin infusion until stable then every 2 hours thereafter. For patients requiring only&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous insulin blood glucose is measured at a minimum of every 4 hours. If necessary&#xD;
      the sensor will be replaced a maximum of three times within 12 hours before placement will be&#xD;
      considered a failure. Capillary or arterial blood glucose will be measured every hour if the&#xD;
      patient is requiring a fluctuating insulin infusion. If the patient is on a stable insulin&#xD;
      infusion blood glucose samples will be obtained every 2 hours. If the patient is not on an&#xD;
      insulin infusion glucose levels will be obtained at least every 4 hours per pre-existing SICU&#xD;
      protocols. All arterial or capillary glucose levels will be entered into the Guardian RT®&#xD;
      system. Blood glucose measurements will be per the SICU routine. All SICU staff, physicians&#xD;
      and study personnel will be blinded to the CGMS readings. Sensors will be changed after 72&#xD;
      hours and when the system identifies a problem with the sensor that can not be corrected&#xD;
      through standard system diagnostics per manufacturer recommendations. Total attempts at&#xD;
      sensor placement will be limited to a maximum of 4 over the course of each subject's&#xD;
      participation in the study. Sensors will be removed when the patient is transferred from the&#xD;
      SICU, if the patient expires, or if the patient's care is transitioned to comfort measures&#xD;
      only. At the end of the second sensor life-time (144 hours) the sensor will be removed and&#xD;
      data collection will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the glucose data, administration of all insulin and other medications likely&#xD;
      to affect blood glucose levels or perfusion status will be recorded as will all infusions&#xD;
      containing dextrose, including parenteral nutrition and all enteral feeding. All other&#xD;
      clinical events such as return trips to the operating room, or development of a new&#xD;
      infection, or new organ failure, will be recorded by the investigative team. Additional data&#xD;
      collected will include age, gender, race, prior medical history, reason for SICU admission,&#xD;
      medications during the study and prior, complications, days on mechanical ventilation, length&#xD;
      of stay, daily vital signs, including weight and any vital sign abnormalities, body mass&#xD;
      index, liver failure, renal failure and use of renal replacement therapy. If a patient&#xD;
      develops a skin reaction to the device or the adhesive maintaining the device, it will be&#xD;
      removed and a new site will be employed if possible with tape replacing the standard&#xD;
      transparent dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from each sensor will be downloaded and blood glucose values obtained using proprietary&#xD;
      software from Medtronic. Because the CGMS system records glucose readings every 5 minutes&#xD;
      capillary or arterial glucose samples obtained will be compared with the closest CGMS reading&#xD;
      within 2.5 minutes of the time the sample was obtained. This will generate a set of paired&#xD;
      glucose levels for analysis. If the sample falls immediately between 2 readings the later of&#xD;
      the CGMS readings will be used to minimize the effect of the lag time for interstitial&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods will be used to assess accuracy of the CGMS. The International Organization&#xD;
      for Standardization (ISO) has put forth requirements for blood glucose monitoring systems.&#xD;
      For reference values ≤75mg/dl sensor values should be within ±15mg/dl, and for reference&#xD;
      values &gt;75mg/dl sensor values should be within ±20%. We will initially determine the&#xD;
      percentage of glucose pairs that meet these criteria. To determine the degree of agreement&#xD;
      between sensor and reference the mean difference (MD, average of sensor values - reference&#xD;
      values), mean relative difference (MRD, MD divided by the reference value multiplied by 100)&#xD;
      will be calculated. The MD and MRD allow determination of a general under or overestimation&#xD;
      by the sensor. The mean absolute difference (MAD, mean of the absolute value of: sensor value&#xD;
      - reference value) will be calculated. The mean and median absolute relative difference (ARD,&#xD;
      mean and median of the absolute value of: (sensor value - reference value) *100 / reference&#xD;
      value) will also be calculated. These absolute differences provide insight into the overall&#xD;
      accuracy of each individual meter reading. In the previous study in the medical intensive&#xD;
      care unit 22 patients resulted in 546 glucose pairs for analysis. The calculated MAD was 19.7&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 18.3. This resulted in a 95% confidence interval of [18.2-21.2].&#xD;
      In our study if we use a relatively conservative estimate of 45 patients studied for 1 day&#xD;
      (24 hours) each with blood glucose measurements every 2 hours this results in 540&#xD;
      meter-sensor glucose pairs. Based on these data our study will result in a similarly narrow&#xD;
      confidence interval for the MAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bland-Altman plots will be constructed. These are plots of the difference between the values&#xD;
      of each glucose pair (y-axis) versus the average of the two members of the pair (x-axis).&#xD;
      These plots are helpful to identify particular areas of inaccuracy in the range of glucose&#xD;
      reading e.g. at very high or very low glucose levels. The accuracy of the reference reading&#xD;
      must be considered when analyzing these plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarke error grids have become one of the most accepted methods of analyzing continuous&#xD;
      glucose data. These grids are plots of the CGMS reading versus the reference value. Areas on&#xD;
      the grid are constructed based on the clinical effects of each paired blood glucose. The&#xD;
      paired glucose readings are thereby classified as in good agreement or erroneous with varying&#xD;
      levels of clinical consequence. In order to identify inaccuracy based on the time delay of&#xD;
      the CGMS we will randomly select one or two multiple hour time periods from each patient. We&#xD;
      will compare plots of the CGMS readings with time shifted plots of the capillary or arterial&#xD;
      blood glucose readings and attempt to obtain matches to identify the effect of the time&#xD;
      delay. We will also analyze the effect of fluid loading and interstitial edema on the&#xD;
      accuracy of the meters as well as the time delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will define significant interstitial edema as an increase in body mass by 15% or more&#xD;
      above admission body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that we will be able to enroll 2 patients per month in each group&#xD;
      generating study enrollment duration of at least 8 months. Enrollment in this fashion will&#xD;
      require approximately 5 monitors and 75 sensors.&#xD;
