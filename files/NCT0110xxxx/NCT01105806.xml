  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning involves thinking about choices if the patient becomes sick, and is&#xD;
      important for everyone. It does not matter if the patients are ill or healthy. It is&#xD;
      especially important for people who have diseases that cannot be cured. It allows people to&#xD;
      make sure their wishes are respected if they become very sick or are dying. Thinking about&#xD;
      these issues can be upsetting. But, for many people, it is helpful. This type of discussion&#xD;
      can help the family learn what the patient may want but cannot tell them when these decisions&#xD;
      need to be made&#xD;
