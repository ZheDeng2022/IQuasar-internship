    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how safe, tolerable, and effective a novel drug,&#xD;
      raltegravir, is to a commonly used combination, atazanavir/ritonavir, as initial treatment in&#xD;
      HIV/Hepatitis C co-infected injecting drug users on a methadone program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor that is currently licensed for use in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients and recently approved for use in treatment-naïve&#xD;
      patients. Recent data has shown that the virologic response in patients on raltegravir with&#xD;
      no history of antiretroviral treatment (ART) was equal to efavirenz-based therapy at 96-weeks&#xD;
      (combined with tenofovir/lamivudine). Moreover, raltegravir demonstrated greater immunologic&#xD;
      effect, had fewer adverse side effects and had a neutral effect on lipid levels. Further&#xD;
      support for first-line use comes from recent 48-week data of a subgroup analyses of the&#xD;
      STARTMRK Phase III study comparing raltegravir to efavirenz-based therapy (with&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine) in treatment-naïve patients that showed non-inferior virologic and&#xD;
      immunologic efficacy with raltegravir. There were significantly fewer overall and&#xD;
      drug-related clinical adverse events in the raltegravir group and a similar safety profile in&#xD;
      patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. These findings suggest that use of&#xD;
      raltegravir as a component of initial therapy might be beneficial in patients with&#xD;
      significant co-morbidities such as hepatitis C and in situations where there is concern of&#xD;
      interactions between antiretrovirals and other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injecting drug users (IDUs) represent a patient group where there are formidable challenges&#xD;
      in HIV treatment. Difficulties in management arise not only from substance abuse but also&#xD;
      because of high rates of social instability and psychiatric co-morbidities. Furthermore, many&#xD;
      in this patient group have hepatitis C co-infection. These confounding factors negatively&#xD;
      impact adherence to, and ultimately the efficacy of treatment and can affect physician&#xD;
      perception when prescribing antiretrovirals. Concurrent methadone therapy further complicates&#xD;
      HIV treatment because of its potential side effects and interactions with antiretrovirals.&#xD;
      However, methadone maintenance therapy also represents an important opportunity to engage&#xD;
      patients in consistent medical care and has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment and thus viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of co-infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in IDUs is high. An&#xD;
      estimated 50-90% of IDUs in the U.S. are co-infected with HIV/Hepatitis C according to the&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV co-infection aggravates the natural course of&#xD;
      HCV infection. In a meta-analysis of the effect of HIV on the progression of HCV liver&#xD;
      disease compared to mono-infection with HCV, the relative risk of end-stage liver disease&#xD;
      (ESLD) and cirrhosis with HIV co-infection was found to be 6.14 and 2.07, respectively.&#xD;
      Difficulties arise in the treatment of HIV with respect to HCV liver disease. Drug&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity is a major concern in the selection of an appropriate antiretroviral regimen.&#xD;
      Optimising therapy in this patient group necessitates a balance between retroviral&#xD;
      suppression and minimising hepatic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir is predominantly metabolised by hepatic glucuronidation via the uridine&#xD;
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) isozyme. A small component is renally&#xD;
      excreted (~9%). In three double-blind, randomised studies of pharmacokinetics, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, raltegravir was found to be rapidly absorbed with a terminal half-life of 7-12&#xD;
      hours. It exhibited potent in vitro inhibition with a 95% inhibitory concentration (IC95) =&#xD;
      33nM in 50% human serum. Pharmacokinetic analyses of various dosing regimens supported the&#xD;
      use of twice daily dosing of multiple doses of 100mg and greater. Results from a study&#xD;
      investigating once daily dosing are pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic impairment is less likely to affect UGT1A1 metabolism in comparison to other liver&#xD;
      metabolic pathways. A recent study evaluated the effect of liver impairment on raltegravir&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in 20 HIV-negative patients (ten patients with moderate hepatic&#xD;
      insufficiency and ten healthy, matched controls). The geometric mean ratios (GMR: mean value&#xD;
      for the group with moderate hepatic insufficiency/mean value for the healthy controls) and&#xD;
      90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero&#xD;
      to infinity (AUC0- ∞ ), the maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), and the&#xD;
      concentration at 12 h (C12) were 0.86 (90% CI, 0.41, 1.77), 0.63 (90% CI, 0.23, 1.70), and&#xD;
      1.26 (90% CI, 0.65, 2.43), respectively. The study authors determined that liver impairment&#xD;
      produced no clinically significant effects on raltegravir pharmacokinetics and therefore no&#xD;
      dose adjustments are needed for mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir, are extensively metabolised via hepatic cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 (CYP) 3A isozymes. In patients with hepatic insufficiency, dose adjustments of PIs or&#xD;
      consideration of alternative therapies may be necessary. Atazanavir is also a potent&#xD;
      inhibitor of CYP3A and therefore has a potential to cause drug interactions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns regarding adverse cardiac effects of antiretroviral therapy have recently emerged.&#xD;
      Protease inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction that&#xD;
      is partially due to dyslipidaemia. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir is commonly used as part of&#xD;
      combination treatment in IDUs because of its modest effect on lipid levels and also due to&#xD;
      the simplicity of once daily dosing. However, it has other associated risk factors and&#xD;
      intolerability due to hyperbilirubinaemia is also an issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also growing concern with reports of long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes in&#xD;
      IDUs. This patient group have several risk factors that increase their susceptibility.&#xD;
      Methadone is well recognised to cause long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes through&#xD;
      inhibition of a cardiac potassium channel, the major component of which is encoded by the&#xD;
      human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG). Multiple HERG polymorphisms have been identified that are&#xD;
      clinically silent but may confer vulnerability to arrhythmia by a triggering event. Protease&#xD;
      inhibitors also have the potential to cause QT prolongation. This may be mediated by direct&#xD;
      effects on HERG channels or by potentiating the effects of other drugs through inhibition of&#xD;
      CYP3A, or both. Concurrent use of protease inhibitors and methadone might pose an additive&#xD;
      risk of QT prolongation and a few cases have been reported recently. Additionally,&#xD;
      co-infection with hepatitis C is also recognised to prolong the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir has been shown to have no effect on the QT interval in a single, supratherapeutic&#xD;
      dose in humans and in multiple doses in an animal model. It also exhibits negligible&#xD;
      inhibition of HERG current in vitro and has been found to have little to no effect on&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, efficacious virologic and immunologic response, safe use in hepatic impairment,&#xD;
      non-inhibition of CYP enzymes, lack of QT effect, and favourable lipid and side effect&#xD;
      profile indicate that raltegravir could be a preferred option for first-line treatment in&#xD;
      this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out as a Phase 4, Multi-Centre Open Label, Investigator Led,&#xD;
      Randomised Pilot Study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of raltegravir&#xD;
      (Isentress™) with protease inhibitor-based therapy atazanavir/ritonavir (Reyataz™/Norvir™) in&#xD;
      treatment naïve, HIV/Hepatitis C co-infected injecting drug users receiving methadone.&#xD;
      Patients who are attending a drug treatment clinic, who are on methadone maintenance therapy,&#xD;
      who fulfill standard criteria to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who meet all other&#xD;
      study specific eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients, who are willing to participate in the study and who agree to comply with&#xD;
      all study treatments and procedures, will be randomized to treatment with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Raltegravir 400mg PO twice daily; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Atazanavir/ritonavir 300mg/100mg PO once daily over a 96 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the recommended guidelines, both treatment regimes will be combined with a nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of tenofovir and emtricitabine, but can be&#xD;
      changed due to toxicities as per the discretion of the investigator or other medically&#xD;
      qualified designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration for subjects completing the entire study will be approximately 100&#xD;
      weeks. During this time subjects will attend the clinic for 11 study visits at Baseline,&#xD;
      Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 and an End of Study Visit, 4 weeks post completion&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' participation in this study will end following the End of Study Visit (or early&#xD;
      withdrawal visit if applicable). Once subjects have completed their participation in this&#xD;
      study they will be treated as per routine standard care for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures being conducted.&#xD;
      Patients will have an initial baseline assessment prior to treatment initiation. This will&#xD;
      include a medical history, physical examination and electrocardiogram. Baseline laboratory&#xD;
      tests will include a resistance profile, CD4 count, viral load, hepatitis C status, full&#xD;
      blood count, liver blood tests and renal profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be re-assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 weeks post initiation&#xD;
      for treatment efficacy, safety, tolerability and compliance. Follow-up blood tests will be&#xD;
      drawn to assess virological and immunological response to treatment as well as routine blood&#xD;
      tests to detect hepatitis C status, liver/renal toxicities and haematological abnormalities.&#xD;
      ECG evaluation for QT abnormalities will be performed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, 48 and&#xD;
      96. A follow up safety visit will be conducted 4 weeks post completion of therapy. Monitoring&#xD;
      for adverse events will take place throughout the study period and continuity of care, as per&#xD;
      standard medical care for this patient population, maintained after the patients have&#xD;
      completed the study at the respective sites.&#xD;
