  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly with hip fractures are often frail and discharged from hospital after few days of&#xD;
      hospitalisation. Hip fracture surgery is often associated with blood loss, where the patient&#xD;
      is at risk of developing anaemia. Low haemoglobin level reduces the body's oxygen transport&#xD;
      which causes impaired functional ability and strain on vital organs. Acute anaemia is worse&#xD;
      tolerated in elderly, than in younger patients. Therefore this study aims to investigate&#xD;
      whether there are effects of an expanded indication for blood transfusion in the frail&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All elderly patients aged 65 and above who are hospitalised from nursing home or sheltered&#xD;
      housing facilities to the Orthopaedic Surgery Ward at Aarhus University Hospital with hip&#xD;
      fracture and treated operatively, are eligible for this study. According to sample size&#xD;
      calculations 284 patients are needed. Informed consent or deputy informed consent, if the&#xD;
      patient is cognitively impaired, is needed. Inclusion is dependent on a haemoglobin measure&#xD;
      between 6 and 7 mmol/l 6 days after surgery at the latest. Randomization will be&#xD;
      computerised. Randomization will determine intervention with blood transfusion and the&#xD;
      measurement of haemoglobin is blinded to the patient, relatives, and endpoint assessor. Both&#xD;
      transfusion groups will receive blood when haemoglobin is less than 6 mmol/l, as recommended&#xD;
      by the Danish Health and Medicine Authority. Geriatric and Orthopaedic Team (GO-team),&#xD;
      consisting of following trained specialists: physiotherapist, nurse, and physician, will&#xD;
      conduct medical evaluations, including blood transfusions, from admission until 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery. The GO-team will work on weekdays both at the Orthopaedic surgery ward and in the&#xD;
      patients home immediately after discharge. In accordance with Aarhus Blood Bank's&#xD;
      instructions, blood transfusions are given both under hospitalisation, in the nursing homes&#xD;
      and in the sheltered housings. Outcomes are functional ability and mortality during 90 days,&#xD;
      and overall quality of life (OQoL) after 30 days and 1 year. The association between physical&#xD;
      recovery and OQoL are tested.&#xD;
