  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (DexCom™ SEVEN PLUS®) and to evaluate the impact of CGM on glycemic control&#xD;
      when worn for up to 6-months by subjects 18 to 70 years-old with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on&#xD;
      MDI or CSII therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate no statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between MDI and CSII subjects in terms of A1C change at 6 months as compared to&#xD;
      baseline. A secondary objective is to evaluate time spent outside of the euglycemic region&#xD;
      (70 to 180 mg/dL) from the baseline (blinded month) to the conclusion of 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data of the SEVEN PLUS System will also be collected and safety will be characterized&#xD;
      by the incidence of Adverse Device Effects, Serious Adverse Device Events, and Unanticipated&#xD;
      Adverse Device Effects experienced by study participants.&#xD;

        This clinical study population will consist of a minimum of 100, and up to 120 subjects&#xD;
        with insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus on Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) or Continuous&#xD;
        Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) therapy; equal number of subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
        among each therapy group. It is desirable to have a similar distribution of baseline A1C in&#xD;
        each study group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 to 70 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at least 3 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have been treated on multiple daily injections (MDI) or Continuous Subcutaneous&#xD;
             Insulin Infusion (CSII) insulin therapy for at last 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing not to switch method of insulin delivery (i.e., MDI to CSII, or CSII to MDI)&#xD;
             while enrolled in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline A1C within 6.5% to 10.0% (may be determined by POC measurement, e.g., DCA&#xD;
             2000 to assess this inclusion criterion);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients on MDI should be on a stable dose of peak-less insulin (e.g., Lantus) once or&#xD;
             twice a day along with any rapid acting prandial insulin analog (e.g., Humalog,&#xD;
             Novolog, or Apidra);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing not to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump insertion set within 3 inches&#xD;
             from the Sensor site during Sensor wear;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing to use only the blood glucose meter(s) provided to them for self-monitoring of&#xD;
             blood glucose (SMBG) during Sensor wear;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing to take a minimum of 4 fingersticks per day during home use (2 for calibration&#xD;
             purposes, 2 for comparative purposes);&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willing to refrain from the use of acetaminophen during the Sensor insertion period&#xD;
             and for at least 24-hours prior to Sensor insertion;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willing not to schedule a magnetic resonance (MRI) scan, computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             scan, or x-ray, for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Able to speak, read, and write English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Have extensive skin changes/diseases that preclude wearing the Sensor on normal&#xD;
             skin (e.g. extensive psoriasis, recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive eczema,&#xD;
             extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis herpetiformis) at the proposed wear&#xD;
             sites; 2. Subjects who have a known allergy to medical-grade adhesives; 3. Are&#xD;
             pregnant as demonstrated by a positive pregnancy test within 72 hours of insertion or&#xD;
             are planning to become pregnant during the course of study; 4. Have a hematocrit that&#xD;
             is less than 30%, or greater than 55%; 5. Current participation in another&#xD;
             investigational study protocol (if a subject has recently completed participation in&#xD;
             another drug study, the subject must have completed that study at least 30 days prior&#xD;
             to being enrolled in this study); 6. Have used CGM for 6 or more weeks (combined)&#xD;
             during the 3 months prior to enrollment; 7. Have any condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, would interfere with their participation in the trial or pose an&#xD;
             excessive risk to study staff handling venous blood samples (e.g., known history of&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C).&#xD;
