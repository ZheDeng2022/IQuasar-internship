    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if pancreatic cancer/pre-cancer can be detected in&#xD;
      early stages through the molecular analysis of stool samples. Investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      analysis of stool samples using digital melt curve (DMC) analysis, can be used as a sensitive&#xD;
      and specific method to detect the common genetic abnormalities present in pancreatic cancers&#xD;
      and pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDC) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      death in the United States. This is largely due to the fact that most patients present with&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable disease, highlighting the critical need for a screening test for this&#xD;
      disease. Stool testing is an approach that has not been explored for use in PDC screening.&#xD;
      With the advent of stool-based DNA tests, it may be possible to target genetic abnormalities&#xD;
      that have been recently characterized in PDC tumorigenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to determine if deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations present&#xD;
      in pancreatic cancer and precancerous intrapapillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) can be&#xD;
      reliably recovered in matched stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a case-control prospective study to determine the utility of a stool-based&#xD;
      digital melt curve (DMC) assay in PDC screening. A total of 30 patients (18 with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, 12 with IPMN) who will be undergoing pancreatic resection will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Pancreatic neoplastic tissue will be isolated from their surgical specimens and the genes&#xD;
      most commonly mutated in PDC will be sequenced from extracted DNA. In addition,&#xD;
      hypermethylation at common promoter sites will be assessed by methylation-specific PCR. The&#xD;
      genetic and epigenetic alterations isolated in pancreatic tissue will be utilized as the&#xD;
      targets for stool DMC assay. Blinded technicians will process stool specimens from control&#xD;
      patients as well as a matched control. The primary outcomes of this study will be the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the stool DMC assay in detecting genetic mutations present in&#xD;
      tumor or IPMN lesions.&#xD;

      -  Tissue Collection: Fresh frozen resected tumor and IPMN tissue will be obtained whenever&#xD;
           possible. All resected specimens, cancer and IPMN, will have histologic review to&#xD;
           confirm the diagnosis. Ten slices of 10 microns each from each specimen will be prepared&#xD;
           and sent to Mayo Clinic on dry ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool Collection: Prior to any surgery, stool will be collected from both study and&#xD;
           control patients. Collection containers and mailing materials will be provided to&#xD;
           subjects at time of their recruitment. Stool specimens will be mailed directly to Mayo&#xD;
           Clinic within 48 hours of collection. Stool will be stored at 80 Â°C until assayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool DNA extraction: After stool is homogenized, crude stool DNA will be extracted and&#xD;
           purified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital melt curve mutation analysis: Target gene copies in captured stool DNA and&#xD;
           tissue DNA will be quantified with real-time PCR. To target the mutations detected in&#xD;
           tumor specimens, we will utilize PCR primers that scan for specific gene abnormalities.&#xD;
