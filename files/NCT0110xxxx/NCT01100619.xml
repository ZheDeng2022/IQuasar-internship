  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether the inhibition of&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme CYP2C8 by XL184 observed in in vitro preclinical studies&#xD;
      translates into the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions in humans.&#xD;
      The study will measure the effect of once daily dosing of XL184 on the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of rosiglitazone. The PK of XL184 when combined with rosiglitazone will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific objective of this study is to determine whether the interaction between XL184 and&#xD;
      a drug such as rosiglitazone is sufficiently large enough to necessitate a dosage adjustment&#xD;
      when used in combination with XL184, or whether the interaction would require additional&#xD;
      therapeutic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosiglitazone, commonly known as Avandia, is a prescription medicine approved by the FDA used&#xD;
      to treat adults with Type 2 (adult-onset or non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (high&#xD;
      blood sugar). In this study, subjects will only take 2 doses of rosiglitazone. There is no&#xD;
      intention of therapy as a result of taking rosiglitazone in this study.&#xD;
