  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory studies have found that insufficient sleep duration and impaired sleep quality are&#xD;
      associated with disease risk, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The limitation&#xD;
      to the laboratory studies is that they are conducted in artificial environments that do not&#xD;
      reflect real-world behavior. Although the epidemiologic studies do reflect habitual behavior,&#xD;
      the vast majority of them rely on self-reported measures of sleep, which are only moderately&#xD;
      correlated with objective measures of sleep.. The next logical step in the examination of&#xD;
      sleep's role in cardiometabolic health is to conduct objective, detailed measures of sleep in&#xD;
      people's homes. This project is a pilot study that will develop ideal methodologies for&#xD;
      recording sleep in the home environment. Because there is currently is a gap between&#xD;
      laboratory models of sleep loss and real world conditions, the ultimate goal of this research&#xD;
      is to expand our work on sleep and cardiometabolic health outside of the laboratory. Given&#xD;
      the strong evidence for a link between impaired and insufficient sleep and increased disease&#xD;
      risk, it is critical that we understand how people sleep in their daily lives and what&#xD;
      factors can impact sleep. This project will record sleep in people's homes using ambulatory&#xD;
      polysomnography recordings and wrist actigraphy.&#xD;
