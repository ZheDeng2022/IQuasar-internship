      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of an&#xD;
      adenovirus-based HIV vaccine in HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Control of the global HIV pandemic will require the development of a safe and effective&#xD;
      vaccine. Many HIV preventive vaccines that are in development use a recombinant adenovirus&#xD;
      serotype 5 (rAd5) vector as a way of delivering the vaccine into cells. However, the majority&#xD;
      of people, particularly in the developing world, have immunity against the Ad5 vector, which&#xD;
      means the vaccine will not be effective at preventing HIV infection. This study will use a&#xD;
      rAd26 vector as part of a HIV vaccine, as research has shown that relatively few people have&#xD;
      immunity against this vector. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a rAd26 vector preventive HIV-1 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected people. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either the rAd26 vaccine or a placebo vaccine. All vaccines will be injected into&#xD;
      the upper arm. At the vaccination study visit, participants will undergo a medical and&#xD;
      medication history review, physical examination, and a rectal sampling procedure. They will&#xD;
      then receive their assigned vaccine. After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in&#xD;
      the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects.&#xD;
      Participants will receive counseling on HIV risk reduction and pregnancy prevention. For 7&#xD;
      days after the vaccination, participants will monitor their temperature and side effects.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur at Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 61, 168, and 365. At these&#xD;
      visits, participants will undergo a medical history review, physical examination, counseling,&#xD;
      and blood collection. At the Day 14 and 168 visits, a rectal sampling procedure will be&#xD;
      performed. Participants will attend a study visit or be contacted by study researchers by&#xD;
      telephone or e-mail 18 months after receiving the vaccine for follow-up health and safety&#xD;
      monitoring. Participants may elect to attend optional follow-up visits for blood collection&#xD;
      at Years 2, 3, 4, and 5.&#xD;
