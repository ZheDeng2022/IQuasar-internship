  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many population studies include food questionnaires (recording the normal food intake or the&#xD;
      food intake of the study day). This is necessary, because diet is an important lifestyle&#xD;
      factor, although food questionnaires are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover,&#xD;
      mis-reporting is a very common problem. We therefore seek for a tool to validate food&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is to find biochemical marker for animal protein, fruit intake and grape&#xD;
      consumption in urinary metabolic profiles after specific food consumption. Furthermore we&#xD;
      want to specify biomarkers for different animal protein sources, fish and beef.&#xD;

      Volunteers are asked to follow a diet plan over the whole course of the study. Every newly&#xD;
      introduced food (in this study the dinner on days 2-5) will cause a change in biochemical&#xD;
      marker excretion with urine. To monitor the kinetics of biomarker excretion it is necessary&#xD;
      to collect urine several times a day; we will ask volunteers to collect the first morning&#xD;
      urine, before lunch, before dinner and before going to bed. Urine sampling will start with&#xD;
      the first morning urine on day 1 and end with first morning urine on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As test food, we propose a fruit salad (apples, grapes, orange and grapefruit) on day 2, fish&#xD;
      on day 3, grapes on day 4, beef on day 5 and again fish for lunch on day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 0 (run-in day) to day 6 the basic diet will always be bread and cheese for&#xD;
      breakfast, coffee in the morning, a ham sandwich for lunch, and pasta and tomato sauce for&#xD;
      dinner. As beverages only water will be allowed (although wine is permitted on day 4 if the&#xD;
      subject wishes but this is not a protocol requirement). The test foods will be consumed in&#xD;
      addition to that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All urine samples will then be analysed using high resolution NMR spectroscopy and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. Mathematical data analyses as well as the visual examinations of the NMR&#xD;
      spectra will also be carried out to identify new food biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>1H NMR metabolic profiles will be acquired for all urine samples. These metabolic profiles contain a wealth of information about metabolites present in urine samples.&#xD;
Multivariate mathematical model procedures, such as partial least squares discriminant analysis, will be employed to elucidate metabolic signatures associated to consumption of fish, beef, fruit salad and grape.</description>
