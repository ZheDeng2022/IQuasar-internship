      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together&#xD;
      with cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate in treating patients with breast cancer that has&#xD;
      returned or spread to other parts of the body. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with combination chemotherapy may be a better treatment&#xD;
      for breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 (veliparib) when administered&#xD;
      daily for 14 days out of a 21 day cycle in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine&#xD;
      (vinorelbine ditartrate) in subjects with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and&#xD;
      breast cancer (BRCA) mutation associated breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 when combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine&#xD;
      and the safety/tolerability profile of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the level of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition at each dose level to&#xD;
      determine whether maximal PARP inhibition is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identify the subgroup of triple negative breast cancer patients who will potentially&#xD;
      derive the most benefits from PARP inhibition combined with platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 (days 0-13 of course 1&#xD;
      only). Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and&#xD;
      vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 10-20 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for 6-10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment&#xD;
      with veliparib alone may continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.&#xD;
