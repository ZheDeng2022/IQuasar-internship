      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a 6-month music-based multitask&#xD;
      exercises program (Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics) in improving gait and balance, and reducing&#xD;
      fall risk in community-dwelling older adults with an increased risk of falling.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls are among the most common and devastating concern facing older adults. The scope of&#xD;
      this problem will continue to expand as the number of older adults is projected to increase&#xD;
      dramatically over the coming decades. Since most falls occur as a result of a complex&#xD;
      interaction of risk factors, considerable evidence documents that gait instability and poor&#xD;
      balance capacity are two major contributors to falling. A large proportion of falls in&#xD;
      elderly people are experienced while walking and, with advancing age, older adults are more&#xD;
      likely to fall when they are engaged in concurrent tasks. Gait variability, particularly&#xD;
      during dual-task walking conditions, may provide an objective measure to characterize&#xD;
      impaired execution of gait, with greater variability placing older adults at increased risk&#xD;
      of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics, an approach to music education through movement developed by the&#xD;
      composer Emile Jaques-Dalcroze (1865-1960) in Geneva in the early 20th century, is currently&#xD;
      practiced worldwide in the field of music, as well as dance, theatre and therapy. Initially&#xD;
      intended for music students, Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics soon expanded extensively to music&#xD;
      education of children and adolescents all over the world. The main focus of this method are&#xD;
      on developing rhythmicality and musicality as well as strengthening body awareness,&#xD;
      coordination, expression, as verbal and social skills. Recently, Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics&#xD;
      classes for older adults were developed. Those classes engage the elderly in varied multitask&#xD;
      exercises performed to the rhythm of improvised piano music, sometimes with the manipulation&#xD;
      of objects (e.g., instruments of percussion, balls). Basic exercises consist of walking&#xD;
      following the music, responding directly to changes in music's rhythmic patterns. In a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study performed in long-term Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics users, the&#xD;
      age-related increase of stride-to-stride variability appeared to be attenuated (Kressig,&#xD;
      2005). The effectiveness of this intervention to achieve improvement in gait variability in&#xD;
      older adults without previous experience of Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics need to be confirmed&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy of a 6-month&#xD;
      community-based Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program in improving gait and balance, and&#xD;
      reducing fall risk in elderly people with an increased risk of falling. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to assess the efficacy of the intervention in reducing gait variability. Change in gait&#xD;
      variability under dual-task condition over 6 months is the primary endpoint. The main&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to assess the effects on other quantitative gait and balance&#xD;
      measures, functional tests performances, and falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteer participants are recruited in the Geneva area (Switzerland) through flyers, press&#xD;
      releases and advertisements in local community newspapers. Individuals aged 65 or older,&#xD;
      community-dwelling and identified at high risk for falling are randomly assigned, according&#xD;
      to a computer-generated list, to either an immediate Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program of&#xD;
      weekly 1-hour classes for 6 months or a wait-list control group scheduled to receive the same&#xD;
      intervention 6 months following the completion of the baseline assessment. Participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group are followed for an additional 6 months in order to evaluate whether&#xD;
      intervention gains can be maintained over time. Main outcome measures include gait (under&#xD;
      single and dual-task conditions) and balance performances assessed by quantitative analysis&#xD;
      (i.e., electronic walkway and angular velocity transducers) and functional tests administered&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Falls data are prospectively ascertained during the whole&#xD;
      follow-up using a monthly calendar method with daily records. The principal analysis will be&#xD;
      done on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the 12-month follow-up, subjects will have the option of continuing&#xD;
      classes via the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute. Subjects will be invited to enter into an&#xD;
      extension phase of the trial and participate in a follow-up assessment visit scheduled four&#xD;
      years following original trial enrolment.&#xD;
