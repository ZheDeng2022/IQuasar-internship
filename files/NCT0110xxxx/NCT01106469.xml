  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, food effect as well as&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the&#xD;
      body and how it is removed from the body over time) and pharmacodynamics (the effects of the&#xD;
      drug) of single and multiple ascending doses of JNJ-41443532 in healthy male participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor&#xD;
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled, single and multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose study conducted at a single study center. The study has 4 parts. Part 1 is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, alternating panel, single ascending oral dose study. Two&#xD;
      alternating treatment panels (A and B) each with nine healthy male participants will be&#xD;
      studied with successively increasing dose levels. Part 2 is a randomized, open-label (all&#xD;
      people involved know the identity of the intervention), 2-period crossover study to evaluate&#xD;
      what the effect of administering JNJ- 41443532 with food (i.e. standard high fat breakfast&#xD;
      meal) relative to administration in the fasted state will have on pharmacokinetics/blood&#xD;
      levels of JNJ-41443532. Part 3 is a randomized, double-blind, single oral dose study in&#xD;
      obese, otherwise healthy male participants. Part 4 is a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study in up to 5 sequential treatment groups of&#xD;
      healthy male participants. Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events, and&#xD;
      evaluation of lab results, cardiac parameters, vital signs, and physical exams. In Parts 1,&#xD;
      2, and 3 participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) orally on Day 1&#xD;
      after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned doses are 25 to 1500 mg. In Part 4,&#xD;
      participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) orally each day for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned doses are 100 to 1000&#xD;
      mg.&#xD;
