  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of 2&#xD;
      different formulations, assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics and assess safety&#xD;
      of rabeprazole sodium in healthy volunteers. Rabeprazole sodium is a drug used to treat&#xD;
      patients with Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). GERD is a condition in which the&#xD;
      esophagus (tube from throat to stomach) becomes irritated or inflamed because of acid backing&#xD;
      up from the stomach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (the patient knows the&#xD;
      treatment/drug they are taking), single-dose, 3-way crossover study to evaluate and compare&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and safety of 2 formulations of orally (by mouth)&#xD;
      administered rabeprazole sodium in healthy volunteers. Rabeprazole sodium is a drug used to&#xD;
      treat patients with Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), a condition in which the&#xD;
      esophagus (tube from throat to stomach) becomes irritated or inflamed because of acid backing&#xD;
      up from the stomach. The primary outcome measure of the study is to evaluate the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability (the rate and extent at which the drug is absorbed and reaches blood&#xD;
      circulation ) of rabeprazole sodium (Phase 3 versus Phase 1 formulation) and the effect of&#xD;
      food (Phase 3 formulation) by estimation of standard plasma PK parameters (Cmax, the maximum&#xD;
      concentration of the drug in the blood observed after its administration; tmax, the time it&#xD;
      takes for the drug to reach its maximum concentration in the blood after its administration;&#xD;
      and AUC [the area under the curve]) of rabeprazole and its major metabolite.Blood samples to&#xD;
      assess the PK of study drugs will be obtained before and up to 16 hours after dosing on Day 1&#xD;
      during 3 treatment periods. Thirty-six (36) healthy volunteers will be enrolled and will&#xD;
      participate in the study for a total of approximately 36 days (from beginning of screening&#xD;
      until the end-of-study procedures). During the study, the healthy volunteer will make a total&#xD;
      of approximately 4 visits to the study center. The 4 visits will include a screening visit&#xD;
      and three 2-day inpatient stays to receive study drug. During the screening visit, the&#xD;
      details regarding the study will be explained and if the volunteer wishes to participate in&#xD;
      the study, a signed informed consent form will be obtained. After informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, study specific entry criteria will be reviewed with the volunteer, information&#xD;
      regarding the volunteer's medical history and demographics (age, race, etc) will be&#xD;
      collected, and the following procedures will be performed: physical examination, measurement&#xD;
      of vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), serum&#xD;
      pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential), serology, drug screen and alcohol test,&#xD;
      and laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis). During each treatment&#xD;
      period, volunteers who fulfill study enty criteria will be randomized to receive 1 of 3&#xD;
      treatments as follows: (1) a strawberry flavored suspension of the phase 1 formulation of&#xD;
      study drug in a fasted state (2) a strawberry flavored suspension of the phase 3 formulation&#xD;
      of study drug in a fasted state , and (3) a strawberry flavored suspension of the phase 3&#xD;
      formulation of study drug in a fed state (with food) OR phase 3 formulation of study drug&#xD;
      sprinkled on 1 ounce of plain yogurt. During each 2-day treatment period, volunteers will be&#xD;
      admitted to the study center after an overnight fasting (withholding consumption of food)&#xD;
      period of at least 8 hours before blood is drawn for laboratory safety testing on Day 1,&#xD;
      receive study drug on Day 1, and remain overnight at the study center unit for completion of&#xD;
      all Day 2 study procedures. After all Day 2 study procedures are completed, the volunteer&#xD;
      will be discharged from the study center unit for a 7- to 14-day period and then return to&#xD;
      the study center for the 2nd treatment period. The same procedures will be followed for&#xD;
      treatment periods 2 and 3. During the study, safety will be monitored by the measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs before and after dosing during each treatment period, ECG findings at screening&#xD;
      and at the end-of-study (Day 2 of treatment period 3 or at the time of early withdrawal from&#xD;
      the study), and the evaluation of adverse events reported from the time of screening through&#xD;
      to the end of the study. In each of 3 treatment periods, healthy volunteers will receive the&#xD;
      equivalent of a 10 mg dose of rabeprazole sodium (ie, four 2.5 mg capsules of the phase 3&#xD;
      pediatric bead formulation or two 5-mg sachets of the phase 1 pediatric bead formulation)&#xD;
      mixed with a strawberry-flavored vehicle and administered orally as a suspension or they will&#xD;
      receive four 2.5 mg capsules of the phase 3 formulation sprinkled on plain yogurt to be&#xD;
      ingested (eaten).&#xD;
