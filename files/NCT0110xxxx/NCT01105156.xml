      1. Background / Scientific Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEW (Vomiting, Eating, and Weight Loss) Questionnaire has been developed as a method for&#xD;
      the assessment of post bariatric surgery patients, as well as a research tool into the eating&#xD;
      behaviour of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective VEW Questionnaire Premise If used optimally the VEW score is a valuable tool for&#xD;
      patients who have had Laparoscopic Gastric Band Surgery (LAGB). The VEW score will be able to&#xD;
      assist clinicians treating patients with a LAGB, specifically the Swedish Adjustable Gastric&#xD;
      Band (SAGB), by providing them a tool to enhance patient outcomes. By using the information&#xD;
      gained from the VEW questionnaire we can assess many areas of the eating behavior, and&#xD;
      adjustment outcomes in patients with Gastric Bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VEW questionnaire aids in the assessment of the need for gastric band adjustment (up&#xD;
           or down in volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparison of patient factors in those who have had a&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. good outcome (increased weight loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. bad outcomes (vomiting, low weight loss, maladaption), from a gastric band&#xD;
                     fluid addition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In patients who have had a bad outcome, which factors are more predictive?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fewer Complications associated with Gastric Band Adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Need for urgent deflation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain on eating&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lowering incidence of inappropriate fills&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lower incidence of maladaption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating behavior can predict long term outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           o By comparison of factors in the different quartiles of weight loss (particularly top&#xD;
           25% cf. bottom 25%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of weight loss after 12 months is best achieved by use of behavior&#xD;
           modification via improved food tolerances and better eating behavior than by increasing&#xD;
           restriction of the band by further adjustments. 12 months is chosen as an arbitrary time&#xD;
           where the majority of expected weight loss (45% of expected 50-55% 0f EWL) has been&#xD;
           achieved. It is also a time frame by which patients have learnt to use the band&#xD;
           appropriately, and the gastric band has had time to be adjusted into its optimal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VEW questionnaire can help predict poor outcomes from a SAGB adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  By analyzing the factors in patients who have returned both acutely (days) or at&#xD;
                subsequent visits (weeks) and had fluid removed from their bands. These factors&#xD;
                would include pain, vomiting, length of meals, maladaption score, fluid added, etc.&#xD;

           appropriately, and the gastric band has had time to be adjusted into its optimal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VEW questionnaire can help predict poor outcomes from a SAGB adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  By analyzing the factors in patients who have returned both acutely (days) or at&#xD;
                subsequent visits (weeks) and had fluid removed from their bands. These factors&#xD;
                would include pain, vomiting, length of meals, maladaption score, fluid added, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3. Study Population, including Inclusion/Exclusion There are 507 patients that are&#xD;
                eligible for inclusion to this study. The patients that will be included are only&#xD;
                those patients that are eligible for a LAGB adjustment (thus excluding preoperative&#xD;
                and the first post-operative visit) and have presented for review by the treating&#xD;
                surgeon (single surgeon) in the year 2009. All non-gastric band and non-SAGB&#xD;
                gastric bands have been excluded. Assessments by dietitians and psychologists have&#xD;
                also been excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4. Study Procedures Initial Patient consent for the VEW questionnaire is obtained&#xD;
                in consultation with the treating surgeon and dietician where the expectation,&#xD;
                benefits and knowledge are explained and confirmed. This occurs prior to the need&#xD;
                for adjustments, that is, during the preoperative period. To date there have been&#xD;
                no patients that have not participated with the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEW questionnaire is handed out to all eligible (please see description for eligibility&#xD;
      in point three) upon arrival to the clinic. Patients are given five minutes to fill out the&#xD;
      questionnaire which is then brought into the consultation with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient care and treatment is done with the strictest adherence to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and in the aim of developing new and better guidelines for Best Practice for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients who have had a LAGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Duration of Study Twelve months starting 1st January 2009-31st December 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Procedure Type&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEW score study is limited to patients that have had LAGB specifically the Swedish&#xD;
      Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      o SAGB -VC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SABG -QC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAGB - 2100 The VEW questionnaire is used following all bariatric procedures but the&#xD;
           study would be limited to the above subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Primary / Secondary Safety and Efficacy Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimal gastric band adjustment tailored for the patient for no pain on eating, no&#xD;
           obstructions and urgent deflation of the band&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inappropriate adjustment of the LAGB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify and Decrease the incidence of maladaptive eating behaviours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excess Weight loss at 3, 6, 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating behaviour at 3,6,12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill frequency and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the significant amount of data that is currently contained in the North Eastern&#xD;
      Weightloss Surgery database I have decided to narrow the parameters to the following for this&#xD;
      particular study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o All patients will be broken into two arms, one control arm and one trial arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o The outcomes that will be looked for are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of adjustments per patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy of the adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Excess Weight Loss (EWL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eating behaviour and its changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Food tolerances (as per the Moore-Bohn Food tolerance scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Safety Considerations and Reporting There are no safety considerations relating tho the&#xD;
      use of the VEW questionnaire&#xD;
