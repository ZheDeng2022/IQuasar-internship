      To assess the safety of a new influenza virus vaccine containing a new virus strain in&#xD;
      healthy patients prior to the release of the vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of monovalent vaccine or placebo by&#xD;
      intranasal spray. This study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive one dose of investigational product on Study Day 1. The duration of&#xD;
      study participation for each subject is the time from receipt of investigational product&#xD;
      through 180 days after receipt of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize the primary safety phase data (Study Days 1-8), the study will be unblinded to&#xD;
      the analysis team at MedImmune after all data through at least Study Day 8 are locked.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 18 through 49 years of age (not yet reached their 50th birthday) at&#xD;
             the time of investigational product administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy by medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, Health Insurance&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act in the United States of America, European Union&#xD;
             [EU] Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject/legal representative&#xD;
             prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential, (ie, unless at least 2 years&#xD;
             postmenopausal, surgically sterile [eg, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy], has sterile male partner, or practices abstinence)&#xD;
             must use an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or&#xD;
             implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with spermicide,&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap, or use of a condom with spermicide by the&#xD;
             sexual partner) for 30 days prior to administration of investigational product, and&#xD;
             must agree to continue using such precautions for 60 days after investigational&#xD;
             product administration. In addition, the subject must also have a negative urine or&#xD;
             blood pregnancy test at screening and, if screening and Day 1 do not occur on the same&#xD;
             day, on the day of vaccination prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males, unless surgically sterile must use an effective method of birth control with a&#xD;
             female partner and must agree to continue using such contraceptive precautions for at&#xD;
             least 30 days after dosing with investigational product (from Study Day 1 through&#xD;
             Study Day 31)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject available by telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol, as judged by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete follow-up period of 180 days after dosing as required by the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, including egg or egg&#xD;
             protein or serious, life threatening, or severe reactions to previous influenza&#xD;
             vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to gentamicin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition for which the inactivated influenza vaccine is indicated, including&#xD;
             chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems (eg, asthma), chronic&#xD;
             metabolic diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus), renal dysfunction, or hemoglobinopathies&#xD;
             that required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the preceding year&#xD;
             Note: A history of asthma that requires regular medical follow-up or hospitalization&#xD;
             during the preceding 2 years is exclusionary. Investigator judgment is required to&#xD;
             determine whether or not a subject has a history of asthma; however, for adult&#xD;
             subjects, a remote history of wheezing or a remote diagnosis of asthma that the&#xD;
             investigator does not consider to be relevant to current health does not need to be&#xD;
             considered to be a history of asthma. For example, childhood asthma that has not&#xD;
             required treatment in adulthood is not necessarily exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute febrile (&gt; 100.0°F oral or equivalent) and/or clinically significant respiratory&#xD;
             illness (eg, cough or sore throat) within 14 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known immunosuppressive condition or immune deficiency disease, including human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or ongoing immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A household contact who is severely immunocompromised (eg, hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant recipient, during those periods in which the immunocompromised individual&#xD;
             requires care in a protective environment); additionally, subject should avoid close&#xD;
             contact with severely immunocompromised individuals for at least 21 days after receipt&#xD;
             of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days prior to randomization, or&#xD;
             expected receipt through 30 days after the dose of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any non-study vaccine within 30 days prior to randomization, or expected&#xD;
             receipt through 30 days after receipt of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected receipt of antipyretic or analgesic medication on a daily or every other day&#xD;
             basis from randomization through 14 days after receipt of investigational product&#xD;
             Note: A daily dose of up to 81 mg of aspirin for prophylactic use is not considered a&#xD;
             contraindication to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of intranasal medications within 14 days prior to randomization, or&#xD;
             expected receipt through 14 days after administration of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of influenza antiviral therapy or antiviral agents within 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             investigational product administration or expected receipt of influenza antiviral&#xD;
             therapy or antiviral agents through 14 days after receipt of each dose of&#xD;
             investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected mitochondrial encephalomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nursing mother&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition (eg, chronic cough) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject&#xD;
             safety or study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employees of the clinical study site, any other individuals involved with the conduct&#xD;
             of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals&#xD;
