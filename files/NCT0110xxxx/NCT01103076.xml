      In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether CD4+ TCM producing effector cytokines&#xD;
      can be distinguished on the basis of their expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha-chain&#xD;
      (CD127). Using CD154 production as a marker of Ag-specific CD4+ T cells, the investigators&#xD;
      will also test the hypothesis that the phenotype and function of TCM are influenced by the&#xD;
      type of Ag they recognize. TCM specific for two cleared protein Ag, tetanus toxoïd (TT) and&#xD;
      hepatitis B surface (HBs), inducing an early stage of CD4+ T cell differentiation will be&#xD;
      compared to TCM specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a persistent virus inducing an advanced&#xD;
      stage of CD4+ T cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to demonstrate in uremic patients who will begin chronic HD and in&#xD;
      patients already chronically hemodialyzed any improvement in CD4+ T cell function ex vivo and&#xD;
      in vitro. These analyzes will focus on memory T-cell subsets (i.e. Th17 and Tregs population)&#xD;
      using HCO membranes or polyamide dialyzers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint is a clinical one, namely, to show any improvement in T cell response&#xD;
      to HB and TT vaccination (blood antibody titers).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hemodialysis (HD) has been associated with changes not only in T cell immunity but&#xD;
      also in lipid profile. Apart from their immune function, circulating T cells may participate&#xD;
      actively in atherogenesis, and treatments that aim to reduce T cell activation and apoptosis&#xD;
      in patients with ESRD reduce the risk for development of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence exists that HD patients are exposed to enhanced oxidative stress that is initiated&#xD;
      by the generation of oxygen free radicals, mainly in tissue and probably in the circulation.&#xD;
      The most potent O2-generating proteins are oxidatively modified lipoproteins, mainly oxidized&#xD;
      (oxLDL). OxLDL have been shown to trigger apoptosis of endothelial cells, macrophages, and&#xD;
      lymphocytes. However, the pathophysiological relevance of oxLDL-induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis&#xD;
      in HD patients remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous findings including ours have suggested that in chronic HD patients, a significantly&#xD;
      high percentage of activated CD4+ T cells ultimately do not proliferate but become apoptotic.&#xD;
      The induction of activated CD4+ T cell apoptosis from HD patients was dependent on Fas/FasL&#xD;
      expression, which leads to a cell contact form of circulating CD4+ T cell self-injury.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators showed that activated CD4+ T cells from these patients fail to&#xD;
      respond adequately to exogenous IL-2. This is due to the downmodulation of surface IL-2&#xD;
      receptor (IL-2R) beta and gamma subunit expression, impaired IL-2 signal transduction in CD4+&#xD;
      T cells, and/or increased serum levels of soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R). Moreover, in vivo&#xD;
      sensitization to IL-2 or low synthesis of endogenous IL-2, themselves potentially may lead to&#xD;
      enhanced sensitivity to T cell apoptosis. Decreased proliferative capacity of CD69+/CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells that were from individuals with normal renal function and incubated with serum from&#xD;
      chronic HD patients and its restoration by normal serum strongly suggest that mediators that&#xD;
      are induced by HD affect transduction mechanisms in the IL-2/IL-2R pathway. Finally, IL-2&#xD;
      seems to inhibit the apoptotic process at many stages by interacting with various proteins.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators postulated that, in HD patients, oxidative stress that is&#xD;
      induced by oxLDL may increase CD4+ T cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, in part as a&#xD;
      consequence of an HD patient's specific dysregulation of IL-2 expression. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the investigators assessed the role of Fas and IL-2 in mediating the&#xD;
      oxLDL-induced CD4+ T cell dysfunction in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Meier et al. have shown that HD patients exhibited a reduction in the number of&#xD;
      peripheral Tregs, which showed a reduced suppressor function. Considering the oxLDL effects,&#xD;
      the relative percentage of Tregs of the total CD4 population was significantly reduced by&#xD;
      incubation with oxLDL compared with a nonsignificant depleting effect on CD4+/CD25- T cells.&#xD;
      The authors suggest that oxLDL have a specific role on Tregs. More interestingly, Tregs from&#xD;
      HD patients exhibited early cell-cycle arrest and became apoptotic. These phenomena were the&#xD;
      consequence of the oxLDL-inhibited proteasome proteolytic activity of p27Kip1 and Bax&#xD;
      proteins, both of which accumulated in PHA-stimulated Tregs in vitro. Thus, plasma oxLDL in&#xD;
      uremic patients might be the trigger of Tregs cycle arrest and apoptosis through proteasome&#xD;
      alteration. Furthermore, they found that both uremic serum from HD patients and oxLDL&#xD;
      triggered a time- and concentration-dependent down-regulatory effect on the expression of&#xD;
      FOXP3. This means that circulating Tregs in HD patients, in addition to being reduced in&#xD;
      number, also expressed low levels of FOXP3 per cell, and thus failed to suppress the&#xD;
      proliferation of effector cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the investigators want to use gene and protein expression profiling and&#xD;
      functional assays of human (ESKD patients on chronic HD or naive uremic patients not yet on&#xD;
      HD) CD4+ TCM to identify the mechanisms underlying their maintenance or dysfunction. Our&#xD;
      results will provide a molecular basis for the capacity of CD4+ TCM to resist apoptosis and&#xD;
      to persist in a stable manner in the host, thereby conferring long-term protective immunity&#xD;
      against reinfection. To test this hypothesis, it will be important to determine whether TCM&#xD;
      producing cytokines represent a distinct subset of memory cells expressing a specific&#xD;
      differentiation phenotype. To the other part the investigators will analyse the role played&#xD;
      by Tregs in uremic patients using a new membrane, namely HCO 1100.&#xD;
