      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D plays a key role in calcium absorption in the gut and in skeletal development.&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is common, affecting an estimated one billion people worldwide,&#xD;
      including developed countries. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, the most common&#xD;
      non-communicable disease of childhood. Rickets causes poor growth and skeletal deformities&#xD;
      and, at its most severe, seizures and death. Recent data suggest that children with rickets&#xD;
      have an increased risk for developing diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for vitamin D deficiency is not commonly done. It is generally diagnosed only after&#xD;
      symptoms of rickets have developed. Prevention and treatment is simple and inexpensive.&#xD;
      Hence, early detection of vitamin D deficiency through screening would be beneficial. Studies&#xD;
      are urgently needed to validate such screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium balance is tightly regulated in the body and calcium loss in the urine (measured by&#xD;
      the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio) is a sensitive indicator of reduced calcium&#xD;
      absorption, such as in vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Hypotheses. The objective of this study is to evaluate the urine&#xD;
      calcium-to-creatinine ratio as a noninvasive and inexpensive screening test for vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency. Our hypotheses are 1) that the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio correlates with&#xD;
      blood vitamin D levels in infants and toddlers at risk for vitamin D deficiency and 2) that&#xD;
      this test can be used to screen for vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact. A validated screening tool would allow for the detection of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency before the development of rickets, decreasing the morbidity and mortality of this&#xD;
      common disease.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficient circulating levels of vitamin D is a common problem in both developed and&#xD;
      developing countries; it is estimated that over one billion people have vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      at this time. In children, vitamin D deficiency leads to nutritional rickets, which is&#xD;
      considered the most common non-communicable disease of children worldwide. Rickets causes&#xD;
      significant short term morbidity and mortality through hypocalcemic tetany and seizures, as&#xD;
      well as long term morbidity from growth delay and skeletal deformities. Recent data also&#xD;
      suggest that children who have had nutritional rickets are three times more likely to develop&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is wide agreement that screening for vitamin D deficiency would be highly beneficial.&#xD;
      However, there is debate on how best to do this. Most screening efforts have included serum&#xD;
      levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, these assays are&#xD;
      complex and are neither available nor affordable for many of the most vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium excretion in the kidney is a tightly regulated process involving metabolites of&#xD;
      vitamin D and PTH. Renal calcium excretion, in the absence of primary renal or parathyroid&#xD;
      gland disease, is a sensitive indicator of total body calcium balance. We have shown that&#xD;
      renal calcium excretion correlates with blood levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in older&#xD;
      children and urine calcium-to-creatinine ratios have been shown to distinguish children with&#xD;
      active rickets from healthy controls in one Nigerian study. This biomarker is noninvasive and&#xD;
      the assays are straight forward and inexpensive. We believe that the urine&#xD;
      calcium-to-creatinine ratio has excellent potential as a screening tool for vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Hypotheses. The objective of this study is to evaluate the urine&#xD;
      calcium-to-creatinine ratio as a biomarker of vitamin D deficiency. Our hypotheses are 1)&#xD;
      that urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio correlates with serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level in&#xD;
      infants and toddlers at risk for vitamin D deficiency and 2) that the urine&#xD;
      calcium-to-creatinine ratio can be used to screen children for vitamin D deficiency. These&#xD;
      hypotheses will be tested through two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the&#xD;
      correlation between the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio with 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels&#xD;
      and with biomarkers of rickets in infants and toddlers at increased risk for vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and&#xD;
      negative predictive values of one random urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio in relation to&#xD;
      biochemical evidence of vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. This will be an observational study of infants and toddlers at increased risk for&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency. We will recruit 150 healthy children, 6 to 36 months of age, with risk&#xD;
      factors for vitamin D deficiency (premature birth, breast feeding, dairy product avoidance,&#xD;
      etc.). Based on previous studies in the US, we anticipate about 12% of these subjects will&#xD;
      have vitamin D deficiency. Subjects will have a physical exam targeted to signs of rickets.&#xD;
      Laboratories will include a random urine sample for calcium-to-creatinine ratio and blood for&#xD;
      calcium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, magnesium, intact PTH, and 25-hydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D. Subjects with biochemical evidence of rickets will have x-rays done of the left&#xD;
      wrist and knees that will be scored according to previously published rickets scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact. Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly recognized as a common source of&#xD;
      morbidity in both developed and undeveloped countries. The validation of a noninvasive and&#xD;
      inexpensive screening tool for vitamin D deficiency would allow for large scale screening of&#xD;
      at risk populations and detect this problem early, preventing the morbidities of rickets.&#xD;
