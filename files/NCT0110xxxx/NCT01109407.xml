      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells and has a poor&#xD;
      long-term survival rate. Two other types of cancer, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined&#xD;
      significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM), may eventually progress and develop into&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Researchers are interested in collecting samples from individuals who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with MGUS and SMM to study possible risk factors for developing multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study risk factors that may cause MGUS and SMM to progress to multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with either MGUS or SMM but do&#xD;
      not have multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be examined by study researchers at the initial visit, at 6 months&#xD;
           following enrollment, and every 12 months for a maximum of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests may be performed: (1) blood and urine tests, (2) bone marrow&#xD;
           aspiration and biopsy, (3) imaging studies, and (4) a skeletal survey (a series of&#xD;
           skeletal X-rays of the skull, spine, pelvis, ribs, shoulders, upper arm, and thigh&#xD;
           bones).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. - Participants will remain on&#xD;
           the study for 5 years, or until their MGUS or SMM progresses to multiple myeloma&#xD;
           requiring treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM)&#xD;
           are premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorders characterized by elevated&#xD;
           monoclonal protein and bone marrow plasma cells. MGUS affects 3.2% of Caucasians over&#xD;
           the age of 50 and has a 1% annual risk of progression to MM. approximately 3000 cases of&#xD;
           SMM are diagnosed annually with a 10% annual risk of progression to MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current risk stratification schemes rely on serum protein markers and phenotyping by&#xD;
           flow cytometry. While they can differentiate high and low risk patients, they cannot&#xD;
           predict outcome for individual patients, are not integrated with one another, and have&#xD;
           limited direct correlation to biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired samples linked to clinical information can advance research into improved risk&#xD;
           stratification, the pathogenesis of MGUS, SMM, and MM, and the potential for an early&#xD;
           treatment window for these incurable diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the natural history and prognosis of MGUS and SMM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To integrate protein markers (including immunoglobulin free light-chains) and&#xD;
           immunophenotyping by flow cytometry with molecular profiles (including gene expression&#xD;
           profiles) and clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To apply expertise and diagnostic technology to provide improved evaluation, monitoring,&#xD;
           and risk-stratification for patients on this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide paired samples of blood and tissue linked to clinical and molecular&#xD;
           information for pilot translational studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A confirmed diagnosis of MGUS or SMM (based on IMWG diagnostic criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status in the range of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have a diagnosis of MM are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective cohort study of patients with either MGUS or SMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following initial evaluation and confirmation of diagnosis, patients will be followed as&#xD;
           clinically indicated, usually at 12 month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint is progression to MM requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           154 patients with MGUS and 154 patients with SMM will be enrolled on this protocol.&#xD;
