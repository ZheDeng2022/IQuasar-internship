    <textblock>
      Nephrolithiasis is a disease that strikes roughly 10% of the Italian population and its&#xD;
      incidence in industrialized countries is on the increase. The most common form of the disease&#xD;
      (80%) is Idiopathic Calcium Nephrolithiasis (ICN) with calcium-oxalate (CaOx) and/or&#xD;
      calcium-phosphate (CaP) stones. The etiopathogenesis involves both genetic and acquired&#xD;
      factors, the interplay of which leads to urinary biochemical anomalies at the root of stone&#xD;
      formation. The elements and urinary compounds involved are known as &quot;urinary stone risk&#xD;
      factors&quot;. The risk factors for CaOx stones consist of low urine volume, hypercalciuria,&#xD;
      hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. In the case of CaP stones,&#xD;
      the hyperphosphaturia and pH parameters are of particular importance; a pH&gt;7 promotes the&#xD;
      formation of stones prevalently composed of phosphates, while a pH of between 6 and 7,&#xD;
      associated with a volume &lt;1l/day, can raise CaP supersaturation to a dangerously high level&#xD;
      and lead to the formation of mixed CaOx and CaP stones. For uric acid stones, the elements&#xD;
      involved are hyperuricosuria and pH&lt;5.5. In general, the most prevalent alteration in ICN is&#xD;
      hypercalciuria (50%). Hypertension and obesity are also social diseases with important&#xD;
      epidemiological similarities to nephrolithiasis. These affinities have led to the search for&#xD;
      a common pathogenic moment. As far as hypertension is concerned, various studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated high calciuria in hypertensives with a linear relationship between 24-h&#xD;
      calciuria and arterial blood pressure. The incidence of stone disease is greater in&#xD;
      hypertensives than in normotensives and, by the same token, the incidence of hypertension is&#xD;
      greater in stone formers than in non stone formers, but it is not clear whether&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis is a risk factor for hypertension or vice versa. Moreover, a linear&#xD;
      relationship exists between calciuria and natriuria, where the calcium is the dependent&#xD;
      variable, with a much steeper slope of the straight line in stone formers and hypertensives&#xD;
      compared to controls. It has, in fact, been demonstrated that to reduce calcium, it is more&#xD;
      efficacious to reduce sodium intake as opposed to calcium intake. Finally, BMI and body&#xD;
      weight are independently associated with an increase in stone risk even though, due to a&#xD;
      number of bias (limited weight categories, low number of obese persons in the study&#xD;
      populations, no control group, no recording of food intake) the studies published failed to&#xD;
      be conclusive. In the final analysis, stone disease, arterial hypertension and excess&#xD;
      weight/obesity prove to be closely interconnected and it is possible to intervene with&#xD;
      targeted diets aimed at reducing the risk of illness and death from these diseases. Among&#xD;
      such dietary approaches, the reduction of sodium chloride in food, increased hydration and an&#xD;
      increased intake of foods with an alkaline potential seem to play an important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years now, the investigators research unit has been involved in projects, partially&#xD;
      financed by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR), geared towards studying&#xD;
      the effects induced by dietary changes in patients with calcium stone disease. The aim of the&#xD;
      present project is to analyse in depth the relationship between stone disease, hypertension,&#xD;
      body weight and water and salt intake both in the general population of the area of Parma&#xD;
      (where historically and by gastronomic tradition, the usual diet tends to have a high salt&#xD;
      content) and in a selected population of stone formers and hypertensives not under treatment.&#xD;
      A representative sample of the population of the area of Parma will be studied, divided on&#xD;
      the basis of weight category, in order to assess water and salt intake and relationships with&#xD;
      the presence of hypertension, and a sample of normal and hypertensive stone formers&#xD;
      randomized to receive for one year either water therapy+low salt diet or water therapy alone.&#xD;

      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrolithiasis is a disease that could be defined as social, due to its widespread&#xD;
      distribution and its continually increasing incidence in industrialized countries with a high&#xD;
      standard of living (1). In Italy, it strikes just under 10% of the population, leading to&#xD;
      expenditure of approx. 200 million euro/year for hospital admissions alone (2). Idiopathic&#xD;
      Calcium Nephrolithiasis (ICN) with the formation of calcium oxalate stones, sometimes mixed&#xD;
      with calcium phosphate ones, is the most common form, having an incidence of roughly 80%&#xD;
      (3,4). As regards distribution in the two sexes, a slightly higher incidence in males has&#xD;
      been observed. The pathogenesis of ICN involves both genetic and acquired factors (5), the&#xD;
      combining of which leads to urinary biochemical anomalies which lie at the root of stone&#xD;
      formation. A high rate of calcium-oxalate and/or calcium-phosphate supersaturation leads to&#xD;
      the formation of nests of crystals that can then grow and aggregate to form a stone. The&#xD;
      elements and urine compounds involved in the process of crystallization, whether they be&#xD;
      inhibitors or promoters, are known as urinary stone risk factors. For Ca-oxalate they are:&#xD;
      low urine volume (&lt;2 l/day), hypercalciuria (&gt;250mg/day), hyperoxaluria (&gt;40 mg/day),&#xD;
      hyperuricosuria (&gt;600 mg/day), hypocitraturia (&lt;320 mg/day) and hypomagnesuria (&lt;50 mg/day).&#xD;
      For Ca-phosphate, in addition to the above-mentioned factors, hyperphosphaturia (&gt;1000&#xD;
      mg/day) and urinary pH also acquire considerable importance: a pH&gt;7 promotes the formation of&#xD;
      stones prevalently composed of phosphates, while a pH of between 6 and 7 associated with a&#xD;
      urine volume &lt;1l/day, can dangerously raise Ca-phosphate supersaturation and lead to the&#xD;
      formation of mixed Ca-oxalate and Ca-phosphate stones. Finally, for uric acid stone disease&#xD;
      the elements involved are hyperuricosuria and pH &lt; 5.5. Among the stone risk factors, the&#xD;
      most common found in the urine of patients affected by ICN is hypercalciuria with an&#xD;
      incidence of around 50%. With regard to age of onset, there are two peaks, one between 20 and&#xD;
      30 years of age and one between 50 and 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension and obesity are also widespread social diseases with important epidemiological&#xD;
      similarities to nephrolithiasis. These affinities have, over the years, led investigators to&#xD;
      seek interconnections between the three diseases in order to find a common pathogenic moment.&#xD;
      As far as hypertension is concerned, various studies have demonstrated that urinary excretion&#xD;
      of calcium is greater in hypertensives than in normotensives. A linear association between&#xD;
      the excretion of 24-h calcium and arterial blood pressure has been demonstrated in numerous&#xD;
      studies, including INTERSALT (6). In 1999, after following up 132 hypertensives and 135&#xD;
      controls for 5 years, our group published a paper which reported the onset of stone disease&#xD;
      in the hypertensives in significantly higher percentages compared to the controls, with an RR&#xD;
      of 5.5 (7). Moreover, a year earlier, Madore and Curhan published two studies (8,9) conducted&#xD;
      on a large cohort of Americans in which they demonstrated that patients with a past history&#xD;
      of nephrolithiasis without hypertension were more prone to become hypertensive during the&#xD;
      follow-up than non stone formers. These results, further confirmed by many subsequent&#xD;
      studies, did not however succeed in clarifying the doubt as to whether it is the&#xD;
      hypercalciuria of hypertensives that predisposes them to the development of stone disease or&#xD;
      whether it is the renal damage, albeit microscopic, caused by stone disease that triggers the&#xD;
      development of hypertension. Scientific literature has, however, identified, for&#xD;
      hypertensives, stone formers and controls alike, a linear relationship between the excretion&#xD;
      of calcium and the excretion of sodium, where calcium is the dependent variable and where the&#xD;
      slope of the straight line, i.e. the increase of calcium for each mmol of sodium, is much&#xD;
      greater in both stone formers and hypertensives than in controls. Moreover, as far back as&#xD;
      the '80s, it was demonstrated that a reduction in kitchen salt intake from 10 g to 4 g per&#xD;
      day, has the capacity to reduce calciuria more than a reduction in calcium intake from 1000&#xD;
      mg to 500 mg (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, we confirmed this experimental data with a paper published in the New England&#xD;
      Journal of Medicine in which we demonstrated in recurrent male hypercalciuric stone formers&#xD;
      followed up for 5 years, that a normal calcium, low-salt, low-protein diet had the power to&#xD;
      reduce both the calciuria and the stone recurrences much more significantly than a&#xD;
      low-calcium diet (12). Obviously it was not possible to separate the effect of the&#xD;
      restriction of sodium from the restriction of protein. Both diets were accompanied by the&#xD;
      recommendation to drink water, the effectiveness of which had already been demonstrated in&#xD;
      first-episode stone formers in a previous study randomized with a follow-up of 5 years&#xD;
      conducted on 199 stone formers and 101 controls (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central role of body weight in determining stone risk is clearly described in scientific&#xD;
      literature. BMI, weight, abdominal circumference are independently associated with kidney&#xD;
      stone risk (14). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this relation are still unknown.&#xD;
      Data exist in literature to suggest that body weight can affect the excretion of many&#xD;
      promoters or inhibitors of crystalline aggregation. For example, some population studies in&#xD;
      the United States have demonstrated how urine pH is inversely correlated to body weight and&#xD;
      how urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate and uric acid increase as body weight increases&#xD;
      (15,16). Notwithstanding these data, the effects of body weight on the excretion of many&#xD;
      urinary stone risk factors remains partly unknown; this is due to the limited weight&#xD;
      categories, the low number of obese people in the study populations, the absence of a control&#xD;
      group with &quot;non stone formers&quot; and the failure to record food intake in the studies&#xD;
      published. In addition to this, as regards urinary excretion, the evaluation of excess weight&#xD;
      solely on the basis of BMI values and abdominal circumference may seem somewhat reductive. It&#xD;
      would appear to be more useful to assess body composition, lean mass, fat tissue mass and&#xD;
      mineral mass. In this way, by better stratifying obesity classes, it might become simpler to&#xD;
      understand the intricate endocrine/metabolic changes that occur in obesity (hyperinsulinism,&#xD;
      hyperestrogenism etc.) and establish better correlations with the urinary excretion of stone&#xD;
      risk factors. In fact, some studies (16) have demonstrated a slight increase in the total&#xD;
      incidence of stone disease in female obese patients compared to males, with a slightly higher&#xD;
      mean age in the females and, in any case, ages being equal, with a lower number of&#xD;
      recurrences in the females compared to the males. These phenomena are probably affected by&#xD;
      the concentration of serum estrogens and by the transformation in the fatty tissue of the&#xD;
      adrenal androgens into estrogens; nonetheless the effects of serum estrogens on the urinary&#xD;
      excretion of calcium are unknown. Finally, some studies have demonstrated that body weight&#xD;
      also affects the composition of the stones. In fact, it has been demonstrated how the&#xD;
      incidence of uric acid stones is higher in overweight/obese patients than in normal weight&#xD;
      patients; some studies have highlighted that patients with idiopathic uric acid&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis have a higher BMI than hyperuricosuric patients who form calcium oxalate&#xD;
      stones. The pathophysiological link should be sought in hyperinsulinism: in fact insulin&#xD;
      resistance is associated with a decrease in the production of renal ammonia leading to a&#xD;
      consequent decrease in urinary pH, characteristic of uric acid stone disease (17). This&#xD;
      theory is indirectly corroborated by the aforementioned indirect relationship between BMI and&#xD;
      24-h urine pH and the finding that also age-related reduced urinary acidification capacity&#xD;
      increases the risk of uric stone disease, irrespective of body weight. On the basis of the&#xD;
      above, it is clear how the presence of excess weight/obesity, uric acid or mixed stone&#xD;
      disease could raise suspicions of a Metabolic Syndrome: there are, however, no conclusive&#xD;
      studies on this, and neither have the effects on stone risk and arterial blood pressure of&#xD;
      water therapy and a low-salt diet in a population of overweight/obese stone formers been&#xD;
      sufficiently studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final analysis, nephrolithiasis, arterial hypertension and excess weight/obesity prove&#xD;
      to be closely interconnected and it is possible to develop targeted diets aimed at reducing&#xD;
      the risk of illness and death from this disease. Among such dietary approaches, the reduction&#xD;
      of sodium chloride in food, increased hydration and an increased intake of foods with an&#xD;
      alkaline potential (18) seem to play an important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years now, our research unit has been involved in projects, partially financed by&#xD;
      the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR), geared towards studying the effects&#xD;
      induced by dietary changes in patients with calcium stone disease. The aim of the present&#xD;
      project is to deepen our knowledge on the relationship between stone disease, hypertension,&#xD;
      body weight and water and salt intake both in the general population of the area of Parma,&#xD;
      where historically and by gastronomic tradition the normal diet tends to have a high salt&#xD;
      content, and in a selected population of stone formers and hypertensives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design/description of methodologies&#xD;
&#xD;
      As already mentioned, the aim of this project is to attempt to clarify the relationship&#xD;
      between idiopathic calcium stone disease, salt and water intake, hypertension and body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into two sub-projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the salt and water intake in the general population of the area of Parma&#xD;
           (duration 24 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of the effects of a low salt + water therapy diet vs water therapy alone for&#xD;
           one year in patients with idiopathic calcium stone disease, both male and female,&#xD;
           normal- and hypertensive without treatment (duration 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 350 healthy controls, 100 hypertensive non stone formers without treatment, 150&#xD;
      normotensive stone formers and 100 hypertensive stone formers without treatment will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Both the controls and the stone formers will be subdivided according&#xD;
      to a 4-class BMI scale. The classes will have the following characteristics: Class 1 BMI £&#xD;
      18.9 (underweight condition); Class 2 BMI between 19 and 24.9 (normal weight condition);&#xD;
      Class 3 BMI between 25 and 29.9 (excess weight condition); Class 4 BMI &gt; 30 (obesity). The&#xD;
      patients enrolled will have their medical history recorded after which they will be subjected&#xD;
      to the measurement of anthropometric parameters and arterial blood pressure, and a stone risk&#xD;
      mini-profile will be drawn up including volume, creatinine, sodium, potassium and calcium&#xD;
      measured according to the methods published. As is well-known, 24-h urinary sodium is&#xD;
      considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the assessment of food-related salt intake, creatinine is&#xD;
      a sensitive marker of lean mass, potassium is an index of the body's alkaline potential and&#xD;
      calcium has the important pathophysiological role described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stone formers will be randomized to receive a low salt+water therapy diet or water&#xD;
      therapy alone, for one year. The term &quot;water therapy&quot; refers to an abundant intake of water&#xD;
      with a low mineral and low sodium content (at least 2 litres in winter and 3 in summer). For&#xD;
      stone formers only, at the end of the 12 month period of therapy, anthropometric parameters&#xD;
      and arterial blood pressure will be measured once more and the urinary mini-profile will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
