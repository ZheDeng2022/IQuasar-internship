      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the C-MAC (Karl Storz&#xD;
      Endoscopy, Inc., Tuttlingen, Germany) video intubation system guided intubation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the C-MAC video laryngoscope is safe and efficacious in terms of&#xD;
      successful endotracheal intubation. The C-MAC may be a safe and suitable alternative device&#xD;
      for routine and difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. This is the first study to&#xD;
      investigate the performance of C-MAC in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of the laryngoscope into clinical anesthesia practice, innovators have&#xD;
      attempted to improve upon and perfect the design of the laryngoscope blade. The goal of these&#xD;
      innovations has been to improve visualization of laryngeal structures and increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of successful tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that endotracheal intubation is performed on some 8 million patients per year&#xD;
      in the United States. Of these endotracheal intubations, approximately 80% are performed by&#xD;
      direct laryngoscopy with transoral placement of the endotracheal tube (ET) into the trachea.&#xD;
      The incidence of unsuspected difficult intubation is estimated to be higher at approximately&#xD;
      3%. One factor that contributes to difficult intubation is poor visualization of the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video laryngoscopes are a relatively new edition to the armamentarium of airway devices&#xD;
      available to the airway manager. Although these instruments are more expensive than&#xD;
      traditional direct laryngoscopes, they offer several advantages that may justify their&#xD;
      expense. While many clinicians may espouse the routine use of video laryngoscopy, most&#xD;
      providers advocate its use for anticipated difficult situations, or as &quot;plan B&quot; after failed&#xD;
      intubation by direct laryngoscopy (DL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video laryngoscopes have been shown to provide superior views to traditional laryngoscopy&#xD;
      in normal and difficult intubation situations.3-6 Video intubation techniques, by allowing&#xD;
      tracheal intubation monitoring, improve the safety of the procedure and increase intubation&#xD;
      success. In contrast, using conventional laryngoscopy, anesthesiologists have only a&#xD;
      &quot;keyhole&quot; view of the airway structures; a view that may be further obscured during attempts&#xD;
      to pass the ET tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The C-MAC video laryngoscope is the latest edition to the pool of video laryngoscopes. C-MAC&#xD;
      is a further development of the V-MAC (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Inc., Tuttlingen, Germany) video&#xD;
      laryngoscope. The C-MAC became commercially available in US in March 2009 and at this time;&#xD;
      there are no studies available regarding its use in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device consists of a laryngoscope handle and Macintosh blade that have been modified to&#xD;
      provide a video image of airway structures on a screen, which can be conveniently located&#xD;
      directly in front of the anesthesiologist. A micro video module based on CMOS image sensor&#xD;
      technology is contained in the modified handle and an image/light bundle is introduced into&#xD;
      the standard blade. Because of its design, this is the video laryngoscope system which can be&#xD;
      used to perform either a direct or indirect laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. General Study Design-&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 50 patients. All patients will be intubated using&#xD;
      conventional endotracheal tube preferably without any alternative aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, standard monitoring devices will be applied including a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, 3 lead (at least), ECG and blood pressure cuff; the latter could be invasive or&#xD;
      non-invasive depending on the nature of the surgery. Baseline measures of BP, pulse, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and CO2, will be made. The time will be noted before any sedation or anesthesia&#xD;
      is administered. Vital signs will be recorded every minute from the time that induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia is begun until five minutes after the patient has been intubated, and then at&#xD;
      five-minute intervals thereafter for fifteen minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced by bolus administration of propofol (2-3 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      fentanyl (1-2 mcg/kg), and maintained with an inhalational agent. Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) will&#xD;
      be administered, after face mask ventilabilty being checked, to provide muscle relaxation and&#xD;
      a mixture of sevoflurane or isoflurane and nitrous oxide (per anesthesiologist choice) will&#xD;
      be utilized for maintenance of anesthesia once the ability to mask ventilate is confirmed.&#xD;
      The lungs will be mechanically ventilated with a semi-closed circle system to maintain an&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 near 35 mmHg. Patients' lungs will be ventilated via an anesthesia mask for&#xD;
      five minutes with 100% oxygen until the patient is completely relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators, residents and attendings, will be trained based on manufacturer&#xD;
      recommendations, and each resident will perform at least 3 intubations with C-MAC video&#xD;
      laryngoscope prior to enlisting any patients for the study. Intubations will be performed by&#xD;
      2nd and 3rd year (CA-2 and CA-3) residents. The resident will perform direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
      utilizing C-MAC followed by the video laryngoscopy or vice versa. In an effort to prevent&#xD;
      bias, a computer-generated list will be prepared to help randomize the order of execution&#xD;
      between direct laryngoscopy and indirect video laryngoscopy; intubations will be performed&#xD;
      during the second method used. The resident will first take a direct look at the larynx&#xD;
      without manipulating the scope. Then, the resident will take a video-assisted look (or vice&#xD;
      versa). Subsequently, the operator will compare the direct view with the video-assisted view,&#xD;
      then intubate. He/she will record an observation of the laryngeal aperture for both based on&#xD;
      the Cormack-Lehane Scale and a percentage of glottic opening score (POGO Score). External&#xD;
      neck pressure may be applied by an assistant in an attempt to improve exposure of the larynx.&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist's assessment of the optimal view obtained by these maneuvers will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify, residents will have only one attempt opportunity each for direct laryngoscopy and&#xD;
      in-direct video assisted laryngoscopy. If, after the first unsuccessful attempt, the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist will take one more attempt respectively for the direct and&#xD;
      in-direct views. Between laryngoscopy attempts, the intubator will achieve easy patient&#xD;
      ventilation before the next attempt is made. The number of attempts (maximum 4 total)&#xD;
      measured as either the reinsertion of the blade or endotracheal tube) and the intubation time&#xD;
      (time the laryngoscope blade enters the mouth until 1st capnograph breath) will also be&#xD;
      recorded. If unsuccessful, the direct laryngoscopy/ flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed to intubate the trachea. If more than 4 attempts (two maximum for each type of&#xD;
      laryngoscopy) were needed or if the anesthesiologist discontinued use of the video&#xD;
      laryngoscope, the case will be deemed a failure. The subjective level of difficulty (from 0 =&#xD;
      Extremely Easy to 5 = Extremely Difficult) in the performance of intubation will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a plan to do the second phase of the study. This will include a total of 50 patients&#xD;
      with anticipated difficult airway (limited mouth opening, restricted neck movement,&#xD;
      Mallampati 4, thyromental distance &lt; 6 cm, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). All patients will be adult&#xD;
      surgical candidates aged 18-80 years, ASA I- III, presenting for elective surgery who require&#xD;
      general endotracheal anesthesia. We hypothesize that the C-MAC may be a safer and suitable&#xD;
      alternative device for both routine and difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Measurements We will record morphometric characteristics of all patients. The quality of&#xD;
      the airway will be evaluated using the Mallampati, thyromental distance, interincisor gap&#xD;
      distance, neck mobility and circumference, and sternomental distance. All intubators will&#xD;
      note their laryngoscopy experience level (Cormack-Lehane Scale modified by Yentis, POGO&#xD;
      score). Additionally, the anesthesiologist will provide a personal, subjective opinion of a&#xD;
      possible difficult laryngoscopy and intubation based on scale from 1 to 5. Any evidence of&#xD;
      fogging on the lens will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation: We will measure the time and number of attempts required for successful&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation, easiness of double view (direct vs video), laryngoscopy view change,&#xD;
      and any alternative aid (bougie, stylet, etc) required. An attempt is defined as placement of&#xD;
      an ETT through the glottic opening and into the trachea. Removal/reinsertion of the&#xD;
      laryngoscope or the switching of the laryngoscopist will constitute as a new attempt. Once an&#xD;
      optimal positional has been confirmed, position of the ETT will not be further altered. A&#xD;
      four question survey will be presented to the resident (is it easy to be used, is it&#xD;
      intuitive, do you think it is valuable as a teaching tool, what do you think is the greatest/&#xD;
      worst value of this device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of irritation: Following intubation in either group, the appearance of oropharynx,&#xD;
      pharynx, epiglottis, and arytenoids will be checked. The presence of abrasions, bleeding,&#xD;
      redness, perforation or other signs of tissue or dental injury will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be adult surgical candidates age 18-80, ASA I- III, presenting for elective&#xD;
      surgery who require general anesthesia. Patients will be chosen if it is determined that&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation is required. Patients will be excluded if they are considered so&#xD;
      difficult (i.e. Mallampatti IV, &lt; 2 FB or 4 cm mouth opening), that an awake fiberoptic&#xD;
      intubation should be performed. ASA IV and V patients will also be excluded from the study in&#xD;
      addition to those who need rapid sequence (i.e. patients with acid reflux) and have known&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT METHODS/ INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician investigators will interview all potential subjects to determine if subjects are&#xD;
      suitable for the study. Written consent will be obtained by an anesthesiology resident or&#xD;
      research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information recorded on the anesthetic records will be kept strictly confidential and all&#xD;
      data will be kept in a data logbook locked in the office of the principal investigator. We&#xD;
      will record patients only by study code number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using t- tests, ANOVA, or Fisher Exact test, as appropriate. Results&#xD;
      will be presented as means ± SD. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
