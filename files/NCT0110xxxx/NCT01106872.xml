  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the combination of the chemotherapy drugs Gemcitabine,&#xD;
      bevacizumab, and docetaxel with valproic acid to treat patients with metastatic sarcoma.&#xD;
      Valproic acid is used by people who have seizures to prevent seizures from happening;&#xD;
      however, its use in cancer is investigational. This study will help define the proper dosing&#xD;
      of this valproic acid. We will assess the safety of valproic acid with the combination of the&#xD;
      above chemotherapy drugs and check for possible side effects. Valproic acid may improve the&#xD;
      function of the chemotherapy drugs against the cancer.&#xD;

      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant tumors of&#xD;
      various supportive tissues arising from the mesoderm. There are 56 known subtypes classified&#xD;
      by the tissue of origin. Soft tissue sarcomas account for 1% of all human malignancies. These&#xD;
      tumors share a common mesenchymal origin with the vasculature. Many of the signaling pathways&#xD;
      involved in angiogenesis also drive sarcoma tumor cell growth. Autocrine and paracrine&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) - and platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      (PDGF)-mediated growth plays a role in the pathogenesis of several sarcoma subtypes1. Despite&#xD;
      promising preclinical data supporting a role for angiogenesis inhibition in sarcoma,&#xD;
      relatively few clinical trials have evaluated antiangiogenic therapy in sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies for the use of anti-angiogenic drugs have been taken from phase I trials&#xD;
      of refractory solid tumors showing a lack of response in sarcomas. This may be due to an&#xD;
      inadequate dose, wrong sequence of the treatment or lack of studies with combination&#xD;
      treatments. Given the heterogeneity of sarcomas there may be a benefit in certain subgroups&#xD;
      that can easily be missed. A recent clinical trial has shown improved cytotoxic cell kill and&#xD;
      response rates by epigenetically modifying the tumor environment prior to chemotherapy. It is&#xD;
      believed that the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to be greatly improved&#xD;
      when they are combined with other anticancer drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor metastasis is highly dependent on angiogenesis progressing through a metastatic cascade&#xD;
      that includes primary tumor growth, modification of tumor cell growth and behavior and&#xD;
      formation of new blood vessels. This angiogenic switch is believed to be the result of&#xD;
      changes in the balance of angiogenesis stimulators, inhibitors and modulators present at the&#xD;
      site of the tumor growth. These changes are due to both genetic alterations involving RAS,&#xD;
      RAF, MYC, SRC, EGFR and HER-2 and tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic circumstances such as&#xD;
      hypoxia, inflammation or hormonal stimulation. It is clear that vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) has emerged as the key stimulatory molecule for promoting angiogenesis in a&#xD;
      variety of human malignancies. Other pro-angiogenic factors can be induced or amplified in&#xD;
      the presence of hypoxia hypoglycemia, inflammatory cytokines and altered cell-cell contact.&#xD;
      Thus it would be of interest to combine epigenetic modifiers like Valproic acid, a histone&#xD;
      deacetylase inhibitor, with Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent against VEGF and standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Gemcitabine /docetaxel) to better modulate the cytotoxic effects against&#xD;
      sarcomas.&#xD;
