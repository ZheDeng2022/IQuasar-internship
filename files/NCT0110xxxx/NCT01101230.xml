  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to build the evidence base for approval of FDA health claims&#xD;
      related to almonds and cardiovascular disease. A randomized, 2-period, crossover controlled&#xD;
      feeding study was designed to compare the effects of two blood cholesterol lowering diets&#xD;
      that meet the American Heart Association recommendations. The nutrient profiles of the&#xD;
      control diet (no almonds/day) and almond diet (1.5 oz. of almonds/day) are matched for&#xD;
      protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol. The study population consists of two cohorts of 25&#xD;
      men and women with moderately elevated LDL-C. The investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering diet designed with almonds confers greater cardioprotective effects than&#xD;
      a cholesterol-lowering diet without almonds on the basis of the LDL-C lowering response,&#xD;
      effect on LDL particle size, abdominal adiposity and vascular health.&#xD;
