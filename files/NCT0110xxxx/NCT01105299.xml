      The purpose of this study is to characterize and compare the bioequivalence of CJ anastrozole&#xD;

      This study was conducted to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles&#xD;
      and the bioequivalence of a newly developed new generation aromatase inhibitor (CJ&#xD;
      anastrozole) with existing anastrozole formulation (Arimidex®) in healthy Korean volunteers.&#xD;
      This study is designed as single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 2-way crossover trial.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized to receive 1 mg of either the CJ anastrozole or Arimidex,&#xD;
      followed by a 3-week washout period. And then the alternate formulation was administered.&#xD;
      After 10-hour overnight fast drug was administered. For analysis of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties, including Cmax and AUClast, blood samples were obtained at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 216 hours after drug administration.&#xD;
