  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the outcomes of patients who undergo single-port laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy and conventional laparoscopic colectomy for colonic neoplasia (large polyp not&#xD;
      amenable to endoscopic removal/ cancer) through a randomized controlled trial. After informed&#xD;
      consent, patients will be randomized to have either conventional or single-port laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy by a team of surgeons with good experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      Patients' demographic, operative detail and post-operative outcomes including operating time,&#xD;
      blood loss, complications, pain score, analgesic requirement, resumption of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      function and length of hospital stay will be recorded prospectively. The patients will be&#xD;
      blinded to the type of treatment that they have received during the first three days after&#xD;
      operation (post-operative pain and analgesic requirement will be recorded in these period).&#xD;
      Patients will have long term up to record for cancer recurrence and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of two groups of patients will be compared scientifically to assess if&#xD;
      single-incision laparoscopic colectomy results in any difference in outcomes when compared to&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopic colectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventionally laparoscopic surgery requires multiple abdominal wall incision for placement&#xD;
      of ports and laparoscopic instrument to perform the operation. With the advancement of&#xD;
      technology, laparoscopic surgery can now be performed through one special port which can&#xD;
      accommodate several laparoscopic instruments to perform the operation and hence, require only&#xD;
      one small 2-3cm incision through the umbilicus. This is commonly named as Single-incision&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) or single-port laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery, SILS has the advantage of further reduction of&#xD;
      post-operative wound pain because of only one small abdominal incision is required. The&#xD;
      cosmetic result from SILS is also better because the only incision is made through the&#xD;
      umbilicus which can hide the wound effectively after operation. After complete healing of the&#xD;
      umbilical wound, the patient's abdomen could be visually 'scarless'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been no study to compare the results of the new single-port laparoscopic colectomy&#xD;
      to the conventional laparoscopic colectomy in the literature yet. In order to decide if this&#xD;
      new technique should be recommended to more patients for treatment of colonic neoplasia, a&#xD;
      formal study is required. We designed a patient blinded randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      investigate if there is any difference between these two laparoscopic colectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome to be measured is post-operative pain on coughing and analgesia&#xD;
      consumption. The patients will be blinded to the type of treatment that they have received&#xD;
      during the first three days after operation. During these three days, the post-operative pain&#xD;
      score and analgesic requirement will be recorded independently by the Pain team who is also&#xD;
      blinded to the type of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary to be measured include operating time, blood loss, morbidities and mortality,&#xD;
      cancer recurrence and patient survival in long term. The secondary outcomes will also be&#xD;
      recorded prospectively and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of conversion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversion to conventional is defined as the need to place additional port to aid the&#xD;
      procedure during the single port laparoscopic colectomy Conversion to open is defined as(1)&#xD;
      the need to perform conventional laparotomy in order to accomplish the procedure or (2)&#xD;
      premature abdominal incision for colorectal dissection or vascular control during single port&#xD;
      or conventional laparoscopic colectomy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be operated by using the technique of single port laparoscopic colectomy by surgeon with experiences and training in this procedure. Laparoscopic instruments will be inserted to perform the procedure through a multi-channel single port which is placed via transumbilical incision.
