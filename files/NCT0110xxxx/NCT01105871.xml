    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test a specific hypothesis exploring the neurophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanism(s) that underlie the pain- relieving effects of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic pain management technique, using healthy volunteers experiencing carefully&#xD;
      controlled thermal and/or electrical pain in the laboratory. Over the past decade, our&#xD;
      research group has performed a series of NIH-funded investigations of VR analgesia - in both&#xD;
      the clinical pain and laboratory pain settings - demonstrating its clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. In the current study we will test pharmacologic manipulation of VR analgesia (with&#xD;
      the opioid analgesia antagonist naloxone). We anticipate that this theoretical work will&#xD;
      provide a foundation for future clinical applications of immersive VR - whether used alone or&#xD;
      in combination with other analgesic agents - and make immersive VR a more effective and more&#xD;
      widely used analgesic tool for the treatment of clinical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous work with immersive VR indicates that its use during a painful event can reduce&#xD;
      subjective pain reports during both acute clinical and laboratory pain by 20-50% [1].&#xD;
      Furthermore, we have shown that effective VR analgesia is associated with reduced&#xD;
      pain-related brain activity that is quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to clinically&#xD;
      relevant doses of systemic opioid analgesics [2]. The laboratory pain protocol proposed in&#xD;
      the current application is identical to the UW HSD-approved protocol used in our previous&#xD;
      studies (#25296 - &quot;Reducing Brief Thermal and Electrical Pain&quot;). What is specifically&#xD;
      different in the current protocol is the use of naloxone to determine whether VR analgesia&#xD;
      operates through an endogenous opioid-dependent mechanism or not. The results of this study&#xD;
      will not only suggest the mechanism of action of VR analgesia, but also allow us to more&#xD;
      effectively apply immersive VR analgesia in the clinically pain setting through its&#xD;
      thoughtful combination with well-established pharmacologic analgesic techniques, such as&#xD;
      opioid analgesia administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study and the hypothesis it tests are as follows: To determine the&#xD;
      extent to which subjective analgesic effects of VR analgesia are inhibited by opioid receptor&#xD;
      antagonism with naloxone. Hypothesis - VR analgesia will not be inhibited by systemic opioid&#xD;
      receptor antagonism, suggesting that VR analgesia is not mediated by release of endogenous&#xD;
      opiates and/or by activation of opioid-dependent descending central nervous system pathways.&#xD;
