    <textblock>
      Patients who have been treated successfully for bowel cancer (colorectal cancer) sometimes go&#xD;
      on to develop nodules of disease in another part of the body. If this disease is found to be&#xD;
      related to the original cancer it is called a metastasis. Some patients develop one or more&#xD;
      metastases particularly in the lungs or the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing trend to remove lung metastases with an operation, in the belief that this&#xD;
      will help patients live longer, however there have not been any scientific studies to prove&#xD;
      this. There is also very little published information about the side effects of this surgery&#xD;
      and how it affects subsequent daily living. This is a feasibility study to determine whether&#xD;
      it will be possible to conduct a large randomised controlled trial investigating the value of&#xD;
      pulmonary metastasectomy (surgery to remove lung metastases) in patients who have been&#xD;
      successfully treated for colorectal cancer. There is a two stage consent and randomisation&#xD;
      process. Firstly, patients will be invited to consent to having a full range of&#xD;
      investigations to assess their suitability for surgery. If found to be suitable, they will&#xD;
      then be invited to consent to randomisation between active monitoring of their disease or&#xD;
      active monitoring with pulmonary metastasectomy. Patients will be followed up regularly for 5&#xD;
      years to assess their disease status and to measure their quality of life and lung function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the three commonest solid tumours. Approximately 100 cases are&#xD;
      diagnosed each day in the UK. In 2006, 37,514 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing use of CT scans in routine follow up of patients has led to earlier diagnosis&#xD;
      of isolated and/or subclinical lung nodules and there has been widespread adoption of&#xD;
      pulmonary metastasectomy in selected cases. A survey of practice in Europe showed that&#xD;
      pulmonary metastasectomy is very commonly performed but criteria vary widely. About 300 such&#xD;
      operations were being carried out annually in the UK when PulMiCC opened as a 'feasibility'&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although well-established in clinical practice there have been no previous randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials of the effect of lung metastasectomy on survival and there is doubt as to&#xD;
      its clinical effectiveness. The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis concludes&#xD;
      that pulmonary metastasectomy is associated with a high likelihood of recurrence, with&#xD;
      doubling of the recurrence rate with each of three adverse prognostic factors: (i) more than&#xD;
      one metastasis, (ii) an interoperative interval (primary resection to lung metastasectomy)&#xD;
      less than three years, (iii) elevated CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective registry capturing more than 60% of Spanish practice for a two year period&#xD;
      these limits were commonly exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an RCT it has been shown that recurrence can be detected earlier with CT and/or CEA&#xD;
      surveillance and as a result more liver and lung metastasectomy operations were performed.&#xD;
      However, these operations did not provide any survival benefit, within the RCT. The&#xD;
      uncertainty about the practice has been set out in the British Medical Journal in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary metastasectomy is thus part of a bigger question about effectiveness of surgery for&#xD;
      metastases from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are known unfavourable prognostic factors which include the number of metastases and&#xD;
      the length of time they take to become evident radiologically: (a) a solitary nodule&#xD;
      appearing after a long interval is will be removed in most instances, (b) surgery is rarely&#xD;
      advocated when there are multiple metastases present at the time of surgery on the primary&#xD;
      colorectal cancer or appearing soon after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These scenarios represent opposite ends of the continuum of favourable to adverse factors for&#xD;
      survival after resection of pulmonary metastases. Most patients operated on fall between&#xD;
      these extremes and it is evident that if there is a &quot;yes&quot; towards one end of the continuum&#xD;
      and &quot;no&quot; towards the other that there must be cross over zone where there is clinical&#xD;
      uncertainty. PulMiCC aims to investigate the outcome following pulmonary metastasectomy in&#xD;
      patients where there is accepted clinical uncertainty, to provide evidence to guide practice&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown previously that trials requiring patients to consider randomisation&#xD;
      between treatments that appear very different, as in this instance between surgery or no&#xD;
      surgery, can experience recruitment difficulties. This is because potential participants may&#xD;
      have acquired a strong preference for one of the treatments over the other and they are not&#xD;
      willing to accept the possibility of being allocated to the less non-preferred option&#xD;
      alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There can also be problems of bias if one treatment is mentioned to the patient before the&#xD;
      option of a trial is introduced; the first mentioned treatment may be perceived to be&#xD;
      preferred between doctor and patient. This trial has been designed to overcome these&#xD;
      potential difficulties and maximise recruitment as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer patients presenting with pulmonary metastases will first be consented for&#xD;
      registration into the study. This consent is to undergo evaluation according to the trial&#xD;
      protocol as part of the work up for consideration by the MDT. Following evaluation, the MDT&#xD;
      will consider how they would normally treat each patient according to their standard local&#xD;
      practice. Patients eligible for randomisation will be those for whom clinical uncertainty&#xD;
      exists as to whether surgery would be of benefit. This trial design was successful in a study&#xD;
      of the feasibility of randomising patients in a trial of mesothelioma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time taken for patients to undergo the full range of tests for evaluation gives them time&#xD;
      to think carefully about the possible treatment options and discuss them with their doctor.&#xD;
      In addition to the patient information leaflet, patients will be invited to take home a DVD&#xD;
      explaining the trial in detail, which can be watched as often as the patient likes. It is&#xD;
      hoped that those who are ultimately identified as eligible for randomisation will have fewer&#xD;
      anxieties because of their extended opportunity to consider the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local site research staff involved in recruiting patients will attend a training session to&#xD;
      learn the best method of informing patients about the trial before recruitment commences.&#xD;
