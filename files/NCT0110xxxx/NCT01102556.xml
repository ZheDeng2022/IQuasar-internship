    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this project are to create a registry, as well as a biospecimen bank for&#xD;
      individuals with pancreatic disease (e.g. pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatitis,&#xD;
      intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), and pancreatic&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) or have been determined to be at high-risk for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Biospecimen can be defined as blood, urine, tissue, stool, or saliva samples.&#xD;
      Therefore, no hypothesis is to be tested. The personal data derived from the registry,&#xD;
      correlated with biological information derived from the biospecimens will allow for future&#xD;
      investigative studies of pancreatic cancer etiology and tumor biology. The long-term goals of&#xD;
      the study are to advance the knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the knowledge derived will ultimately lead to improvements in the&#xD;
      diagnosis, prevention, detection,and treatment of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the&#xD;
      United States. According to the American Cancer Society facts and figures, approximately&#xD;
      43,920 people in the United Sates will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2012, and it is&#xD;
      expected that 37,390 will die from the disease. The dismal prognosis of the disease is&#xD;
      clearly depicted by the fact that its incidence approximates its mortality. Pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      has a 95% case fatality rate. The etiology of pancreatic cancer remains elusive and our&#xD;
      knowledge of its precursors and natural history is preliminary and incomplete. The uniform&#xD;
      fatality of the disease merits priority attention in the search for its cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rapid progression of the disease, early detection and prevention provides the best&#xD;
      hope for reducing morbidity and mortality. However, the few screening tests available for&#xD;
      early detection and/or prevention of neoplastic lesions are poorly studied and prohibitively&#xD;
      impractical in the general population. Further, few pancreatic cancer risk factors are well&#xD;
      established or widely accepted. Advanced age, family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes,&#xD;
      and some dietary risk factors are established or suspected risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high volume of individuals seen at the pancreas center, we plan on enrolling 500+&#xD;
      individuals per year who have either been diagnosed with pancreatic disease or are at high&#xD;
      risk for developing pancreatic cancer. All participants enrolled during a clinic/non clinic&#xD;
      visit at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) will undergo a baseline visit and up to 3&#xD;
      subsequent visits. Additionally, based on the different conditions of pancreatic disease that&#xD;
      we are enrolling, not all subjects will participate in all aspects of the program. For&#xD;
      example, only individuals with cancer or pre-neoplastic lesions will have tissue collected&#xD;
      and banked.&#xD;

      -  Peripheral Blood Specimens: Three tubes of blood will be collected from each study&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Archived Fixed Tissue Samples: Tissue blocks from surgery performed at CUMC or&#xD;
           elsewhere, will be requested after obtaining consent for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fresh Tissue Collection: At the time of surgery for any tumor resection, tumor tissue&#xD;
           and adjacent normal tissue will be requested from the Pathology Department. At the time&#xD;
           of endoscopy, aspirated fluid or biopsied tissue will be requested. No additional tissue&#xD;
           will be resected beyond that required for surgical or endoscopic management. In no&#xD;
           circumstance will tissue be obtained solely for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
