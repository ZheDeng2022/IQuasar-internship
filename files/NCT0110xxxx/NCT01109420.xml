      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are studying types of thyroid cancer that seem to cluster in families.&#xD;
      Non-medullary thyroid cancer accounts for the vast majority of all types of thyroid cancer,&#xD;
      but little is known about possible genes that may cause the cancer. More research is needed&#xD;
      to develop the best ways to screen for familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) so that&#xD;
      it can be diagnosed and treated at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the natural history of FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the best screening strategy for FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genes that may indicate susceptibility to FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 7 years of age who have two first-degree relatives (e.g., parents,&#xD;
      children, siblings) who have or have had non-medullary thyroid cancer or a documented&#xD;
      diagnosis of non-medullary thyroid cancer and one living relative with documented&#xD;
      non-medullary thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be evaluated by family history pedigree, physical examination, imaging&#xD;
           (including possible neck ultrasound and radioactive iodine scans), and laboratory&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who agree to have blood or other biological samples collected will be asked&#xD;
           to enroll in an additional study to provide the appropriate samples and tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the initial study evaluation, participants who are not found to have a malignant&#xD;
           thyroid tumor will be re-screened every year with non-invasive imaging studies.&#xD;
           Participants who are found to have a malignant thyroid tumor will be informed of&#xD;
           possible treatment options.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-medullary thyroid cancer accounts for 95% of all thyroid cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 8% of all non-medullary thyroid cancers are hereditary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) is more aggressive than sporadic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No susceptibility gene for FNMTC has been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The best approach for screening at risk family members for FNMTC is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is designed to determine the natural history and best screening strategy&#xD;
           for FNMTC, and to identify susceptibility gene(s) for FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the natural history of FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the best screening strategy for FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify susceptibility gene(s) for FNMTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An individual with 2 first-degree relatives who have or have had non-medullary thyroid&#xD;
      cancer or a documented diagnosis of non-medullary thyroid cancer and one living relative with&#xD;
      documented non-medullary thyroid cancer (Note: as this is a familial study, subjects do not&#xD;
      need to present with the disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any member of an affected family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than 7 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults must be able to understand and sign the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults must be able to complete the family history questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic, clinical and pathologic data will be collected from the medical record and&#xD;
           patient interview for each patient participant and family members. Data will be securely&#xD;
           stored in a computerized database. When possible, pathology slides and blocks will be&#xD;
           obtained from all cases in the family for verification of diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated by family history pedigree, physical examination, imaging,&#xD;
           and laboratory testing as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biospecimens, including peripheral blood or buccal cell samples as well as thyroid&#xD;
           tissue (normal and affected by cancer), if participants have thyroidectomy, and thyroid&#xD;
           cancer metastases tissue if patients undergo surgical removal of thyroid cancer&#xD;
           metastases, will be collected for molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After their initial on-study evaluation, patients who are not found to have a malignant&#xD;
           thyroid tumor will be re-screened every year with non-invasive imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of patients with a thyroid neoplasm will be performed based on established&#xD;
           clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Projected accrual will be 20 patients per year for a total of 15 years. Thus, we&#xD;
           anticipate accruing 300 patients on this protocol.&#xD;
