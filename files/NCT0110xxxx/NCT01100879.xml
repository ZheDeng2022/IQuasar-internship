  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia and functional iron deficiency are common conditions in Multiple Myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      patients, conditions which reduce significantly the quality of life and increase morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Traditionally, Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) have been used, but&#xD;
      recently their use has been shown to have a negative impact on overall survival in different&#xD;
      oncology populations. Recently published data suggest that intravenous (IV) iron can be&#xD;
      effective in anaemia treatment, even without ESAs. This exploratory study is the first&#xD;
      clinical project with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with MM: the data generated may&#xD;
      be used for further evaluations of the drug in larger populations. In this study, 1,000 mg of&#xD;
      IV iron as FCM will be administered on the same day or within 24 hours before or after&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FCM given&#xD;
      without ESA, in the correction of haemoglobin levels in subjects with MM, undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Secondary objectives aim to describe the safety and tolerability of FCM, and&#xD;
      the effect of FCM treatment on iron status variables in MM subjects.&#xD;

Subjects of bw ≤66 kg will receive a single dose of 500 mg iron as FCM infusion at baseline (Week 0) and at Visit 3 (Week 2).&#xD;
Ferric carboxymaltose will be administered on the same day with chemotherapy treatment or within 24 hours before or after the chemotherapy. For subjects with bw ≤66 kg, if no chemotherapy planned for the visit 4 (Week 2), the second FCM dose should be infused independent of chemotherapy.</description>
