  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to prevent or delay the initiation of alcohol use among young&#xD;
      adolescents being seen in a pediatric emergency department, by enhancing parental monitoring&#xD;
      and improving parent/adolescent conversations. Previous studies have shown that the pediatric&#xD;
      emergency department is an excellent location for performing prevention interventions. By&#xD;
      targeting individuals and their families in the pediatric emergency department (PED), we are&#xD;
      capitalizing on the opportunity to perform a prevention intervention among a high risk&#xD;
      population when parent and youth may be particularly receptive to the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our long term goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a program to prevent or delay the&#xD;
      initiation of alcohol use in young adolescents by increasing protective factors and reducing&#xD;
      risk through a family-based brief prevention intervention started in the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      department (PED). The primary aims of the proposed developmental study include: (1) To pilot&#xD;
      test a prevention intervention in alcohol-naïve adolescents, make necessary revisions, and&#xD;
      finalize an intervention manual and (2) conduct a randomized pilot trial comparing the&#xD;
      prevention intervention with enhanced standard care. After conducting an open trial of the&#xD;
      prevention intervention with 10 adolescents, ages 12-14, and their accompanying parent(s),&#xD;
      and refining the intervention, we will use a two-group randomized design to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the prevention intervention will prevent/delay the initiation of alcohol use&#xD;
      significantly more than enhanced standard care only. 100 adolescents, ages 12-14, who present&#xD;
      to the PED and their accompanying parent(s)/caregiver will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
      Eligible, assenting adolescents and their consenting parent(s)/caregiver will complete a&#xD;
      series of assessment instruments relating to alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, communication&#xD;
      styles, parenting styles, and alcohol attitudes and behaviors. Parent/youth family units will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) Enhanced Standard Care (ESC) or 2)&#xD;
      Brief Targeted Prevention Intervention with Boosters (BTP). The initial session will be&#xD;
      comprised of parent-targeted skill building directed primarily at parental monitoring and the&#xD;
      importance of parent-adolescent communication as the precursor to successful monitoring. The&#xD;
      primary goal of the prevention session will be the mobilization of the parents' own resources&#xD;
      to increase communication and monitoring using motivational interviewing techniques. Parents&#xD;
      within this condition will also receive periodic brochures and telephone booster sessions at&#xD;
      1 and 3 months to explore parental implementation of the plan from the previous session(s)&#xD;
      and make revisions as necessary. Adolescents and parents will then be reassessed six months&#xD;
      following their PED visit. Adolescents will also be assessed with monthly, brief, web-based&#xD;
      follow-up contacts to determine the status of their alcohol use.&#xD;
