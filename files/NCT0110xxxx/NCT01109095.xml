  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor&#xD;
      2). This antibody sticks to GBM cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells&#xD;
      called HER2. Up to 80% of GBMs are positive for HER2. HER2 antibodies have been used to treat&#xD;
      people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that&#xD;
      instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is&#xD;
      joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T&#xD;
      cells seem to be able to kill tumors like GBM, but they don't last very long and so their&#xD;
      chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of&#xD;
      these T cells should help them fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found that T cells work better if we also attach a protein called CD28 to the HER2&#xD;
      chimeric receptor (HER2-CAR). In this study we placed this HER2-CAR into T cells that were&#xD;
      pre-selected for their ability to recognize Cytomegalovirus (CMV). This virus exists in most&#xD;
      people. These CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CMV-T cells) will be more active since they&#xD;
      will react to the virus as well as to tumor cells. These HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells are an&#xD;
      investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells, to learn&#xD;
      what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with GBM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When the patient enrolls on this study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-CAR CMV-T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given a single injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the&#xD;
      assigned dose. The injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed&#xD;
      in the clinic after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. If later the subject seems to be&#xD;
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),&#xD;
      s/he may be able to receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These&#xD;
      additional infusions would be at least 6 to 12 weeks apart and at the same dose level&#xD;
      received the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows:&#xD;
      Physical exam, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart&#xD;
      function tests (Echocardiogram),Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusions and after:Physical&#xD;
      exams, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function&#xD;
      tests (Echocardiogram) at 6 weeks after the infusion, Measurements of the tumor by routine&#xD;
      imaging studies 6 weeks after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the HER2-CAR CMV-T cells are working and how long they last in&#xD;
      the body, blood will be taken on the day of the T-cell infusion, before, 1 hour and 4 hours&#xD;
      after the T-cell infusion, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.&#xD;
