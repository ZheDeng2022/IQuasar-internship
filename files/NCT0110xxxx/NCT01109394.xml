      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Laboratory investigators who are studying common childhood cancers are interested in&#xD;
      developing a tissue repository to collect and store blood, serum, tissue, urine, or tumors of&#xD;
      children who have cancer or adults who have common childhood cancers. To develop this&#xD;
      repository, additional samples will be collected from children and adults who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with common childhood cancers such as leukemia and tumors of the central nervous&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect and store blood, serum, tissue, urine, or tumor samples of children who have&#xD;
      cancer or adults who have common childhood cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with a common childhood cancer (e.g., leukemia)&#xD;
           regardless of patient age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children, adolescents, and adults who have been diagnosed with a type of cancer more&#xD;
           commonly found in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra blood, serum (the liquid part of blood), tissue, urine, or tumor samples will be&#xD;
           collected from participants at a time when sampling is required for medical care or as&#xD;
           part of a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of obtaining additional&#xD;
           tumor tissue, aside from what is required for clinical care.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of the biology&#xD;
      of cancer and to the development of new therapies for pediatric malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Systematic Molecular, Genomic, Proteomic, Metabolomic ( Omic ) and other profiling for&#xD;

        -  Biospecimens can be collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during&#xD;
           sampling or procedures required for routine patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will allow for the collection of specimens for a Tissue Repository, and for&#xD;
           designated sample investigations including systematic molecular, genomic and proteomic&#xD;
           (Omic) profiling, and growth factor and cellular profile investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing activities may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DNA, RNA and protein will be extracted from a section of tumor samples, the&#xD;
                remainder will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Germ line DNA and RNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved&#xD;
                tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Germ line DNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved tissue&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Growth factor and cellular profile investigations of bone marrow-derived cell&#xD;
                populations to include quantification of hematopietic progenitor cells (HPCs),&#xD;
                endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs),&#xD;
                levels of matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9 (MMP2) and (MMP9), gene expression, growth&#xD;
                factor and microvesicle analysis and bone marrow analysis of progenitor cells in&#xD;
                blood and tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Research tests described in active IRB approved protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immune profiling and stromal profiling of blood, tumor, and normal tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immune function studies from blood and normal tumor tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilizing an oversight committee to oversee the receipt and the distribution of unlinked&#xD;
           tissues to other investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative methodologies will be used to ascertain knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and&#xD;
           behaviors in 25-35 parents/caregivers at NIH concerning the anticipated use of NGS for&#xD;
           diagnosing and directing therapy for pediatric cancer and how incidental findings might&#xD;
           be returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected accrual 100-150 patients per year.&#xD;
