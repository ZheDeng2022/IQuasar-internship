    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study to determine the proportion of patients with a&#xD;
      family history of pancreatic cancer and other malignancies among patients who have&#xD;
      intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be reviewing the demographic, clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and&#xD;
      follow-up information from the Pancres Center database. The investigators will also conduct a&#xD;
      chart review to collect information recorded by clinicians on each subject's family history&#xD;
      of malignancy and personal history of malignancy. Results of this database and chart review&#xD;
      will be incorporated into a datasheet in which all patient identifiers have been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the percentage of IPMN patients with at least one first-degree&#xD;
      relative with pancreatic cancer or IPMN, or at least two first or second degree relatives&#xD;
      with pancreatic cancer, IPMN, or malignancies related to pancreatic cancer syndromes,&#xD;
      including colorectal, gastric, breast, ovarian, and melanoma neoplasms. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be the relative risk of IPMN subtypes of higher malignant potential (main duct or mixed&#xD;
      type location), more advanced histology (carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma), and&#xD;
      recurrence following surgical resection amongst subjects with a family history.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a cyst-like cancer of the pancreas that is&#xD;
      increasingly being identified in medical practice, including during the screening of&#xD;
      individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer. It has been established that 10 to 20% of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancers are familial. In comparison, there has been little research into the&#xD;
      importance of genetic risk in IPMN incidence. The investigators will perform a retrospective&#xD;
      chart review of patients with IPMN who were evaluated for surgical intervention at our&#xD;
      tertiary referral center. The investigators are interested in determining the proportion of&#xD;
      IPMN patients with a family history of pancreatic and other cancers. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess if familial cancer risk is associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      malignant IPMN and recurrence, relative to those patients without an inherited&#xD;
      predisposition.&#xD;
