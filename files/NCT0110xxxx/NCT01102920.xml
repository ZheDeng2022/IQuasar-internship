      The primary aim is to study whether a tailored behavioural medicine intervention addressing&#xD;
      physical activity and eating habits have additional effects to continuous positive airways&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) in patients with moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)&#xD;
      combined with obesity. Direct everyday life consequences (see below) of OSAS are studied, as&#xD;
      well as cognitive functions and ventilatory parameters. Long-term benefits will be examined&#xD;
      in terms of quality of life and everyday life activity. Another aim is to study mechanisms of&#xD;
      treatment effects, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific goals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study changes in OSAS ventilatory parameters following a tailored behavioural&#xD;
           medicine intervention addressing physical activity and eating habits (including CPAP)&#xD;
           compared to regular CPAP-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study immediate and long-term effects on daytime sleepiness, attention and&#xD;
           concentration, everyday life activity, quality of life following a tailored behavioural&#xD;
           medicine intervention addressing physical activity and eating habits (including CPAP)&#xD;
           compared to regular CPAP-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study associations of changes in metabolic parameters and systemic inflammation and&#xD;
           physical activity level and adherence to CPAP-regimen respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify mediators, moderators, and predictors of treatment effects, if any.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSAS is characterised by loud snoring, upper airway obstruction, and occasional apnea during&#xD;
      sleep. OSAS may affect at least 4% of the men and 2% of the women in middle-age. In Sweden,&#xD;
      prevalence figures of 200 000 have been reported. The mechanisms behind OSAS is not fully&#xD;
      explained but functionally impaired upper airways muscles, causing a reduction in tonic and&#xD;
      phasic contraction during sleep, are proposed one key explanation. The reduced contractions&#xD;
      cause partial or complete occlusion of airflow, which in turn cause oxygen desaturation and&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation. Patients commonly report everyday life consequences including loud&#xD;
      snoring, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, reduced alertness and concentration, and&#xD;
      involvement in motor vehicle accidents. Between 7% and 70% of patients suffer from depression&#xD;
      and anxiety (figures vary extensively because of methodological differences in existing&#xD;
      studies). Due to cardiovascular consequences, OSAS is also linked to hypertension, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and stroke. Approximately 75% of patients with severe OSAS carry overweight.&#xD;
      First line measures recommended for OSAS are conservative including lifestyle modifications,&#xD;
      CPAP, and oral appliances. Current state-of-science concludes that CPAP is best possible&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment. Despite the use of life style modification recommendations in terms&#xD;
      of physical activity and weight loss in accepted guidelines of OSAS, randomised clinical&#xD;
      trials supporting these recommendations are rare. Hence, the value of health behaviour&#xD;
      modifications has yet to be established. Research within this area is therefore of major&#xD;
      interest and urgency, which has motivated the present study design.&#xD;
