      The objective of the study is to examine the effectiveness and accuracy of the BioXbot in&#xD;
      prostate biopsy as opposed to transrectal biopsy. This evaluation of the efficacy of both the&#xD;
      procedures is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uptake rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral zone reachability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needling accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure execution time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative discomfort or trauma experienced by patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality and type of tissue sample extracted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse and unanticipated side-effects on patient after the procedure and recording any&#xD;
           unexpected reactions&#xD;

      The prostate gland is a walnut-sized organ found only in men that encircles the urethra&#xD;
      (urine passage) below the urinary bladder. It secretes fluid that is an important component&#xD;
      of semen. Prostate cancer is a disease of the prostate gland where malignant tumours cells&#xD;
      invade normal prostate tissue and spread to other organs. It is second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in men and it is mainly found in men above the age of 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate biopsy is considered to be the most definitive diagnostic tool for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      It is a surgical procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the prostate&#xD;
      gland and examined by a pathologist. The procedure normally takes about 15 minutes and is&#xD;
      usually performed by the urologist in conjunction with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). No&#xD;
      anesthetic is required. With the help of TRUS, a doctor guides a biopsy gun -- a hand-held&#xD;
      device with a spring-loaded, slender needle -- through the wall of the rectum into the area&#xD;
      of the prostate gland that appears abnormal. Since the rectal wall is thin, it is possible to&#xD;
      place the needle more accurately and with less injury to other tissues. When activated, the&#xD;
      needle can remove a slender cylinder of tissue, called a core.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy has become the standard for obtaining tissue&#xD;
      for the histological diagnosis of prostate cancer. On the other hand, transperineal approach&#xD;
      is not commonly used worldwide and little data is available on transperineal prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are some problems with existing system and these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Random Biopsy Sites: Biopsy cores represent only about 0.6% of the prostate in terms of&#xD;
           volume. Therefore, without having accurate knowledge of cancer sites, it is unlikely&#xD;
           that a random biopsy protocol will yield consistently high cancer detection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inaccurate Needling: The biopsy needle may not reach the desired position accurately and&#xD;
           quickly under manual control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limited 2D Guidance: The TRUS used for biopsy guidance is 2D ultrasound images. As the&#xD;
           biopsy sites are distributed in 3D, it is difficult for the surgeon to imagine the&#xD;
           overall picture of the biopsy sites and identify the biopsy site accurately and&#xD;
           intuitively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk Factors: The two primary risks of needle biopsy are severe bleeding and infection&#xD;
           of the prostate gland or urinary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transrectal Shortfalls: As most of the cancer occurs at the apex area of the prostate,&#xD;
           transperineal biopsy is considered having higher chance to get cancer tissue, comparing&#xD;
           with the conventional transrectal biopsy. Furthermore, transperineal biopsy is&#xD;
           considered &quot;cleaner&quot;, as its puncture point is on skin, rather than on rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assist the surgeon in transperineal biopsy, a device name BioXbot has been designed.&#xD;
      BioXbot aims to address the shortfalls of the transrectal method of biopsy and limitations of&#xD;
      existing robotic biopsy in order to improve the cancer uptake rate. An ideal design should&#xD;
      need no more than 2 operators to complete the procedure comfortable within comparable time&#xD;
      with the conventional approach. A motorized needle positioning mechanism may also improve the&#xD;
      accuracy in the needling and allow the needle reach any point within the prostate in all&#xD;
      scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioXbot is a computer based motion control system with software driven gantry mechanism to&#xD;
      assist in the positioning of the biopsy gun. It drives a 2D ultrasound probe to obtain a&#xD;
      series of 2D images of the prostate which will then be modeled into a 3D view. This 3D&#xD;
      visualization gives the surgeon a better idea of the prostate and allows him to plan the&#xD;
      biopsy sites more intuitively. The mechanical components precisely align it to allow the&#xD;
      clinician to accurately reach the position inside the prostate he wanted to and obtain tissue&#xD;
      from there. To improve the usability and the positioning accuracy, as well as reducing the&#xD;
      operation time, the positioning of the needle is fully motorized.&#xD;
