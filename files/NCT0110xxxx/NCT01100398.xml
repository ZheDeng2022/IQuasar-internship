      Prospective determination of the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)in a primary care setting using ultrasound and&#xD;
      percutaneous liver biopsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years who are eligible for care at Brooke Army Medical&#xD;
      Center are considered for enrollment. After obtaining informed consent, a baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire is given to patients who present to the Primary Care Clinic for routine clinic&#xD;
      visits or during colon cancer screening classes within the Gastroenterology Clinic. The&#xD;
      questionnaire includes information about the patient's past medical history to include: known&#xD;
      history of chronic liver disease, current medications, current and past alcohol ingestion,&#xD;
      dietary habits that included consumption of fructose containing beverages and frequency of&#xD;
      fast food visits. Patients are excluded if they are found to have a history of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease, HIV, on medications that are associated with a fatty liver, or consumption of more&#xD;
      than 20 grams of alcohol per day. Right upper quadrant ultrasound will then be performed to&#xD;
      determine if there is evidence of fatty liver disease. All patients with a positive&#xD;
      ultrasound for hepatic steatosis are then offered a liver biopsy after obtaining fasting&#xD;
      blood work that included a complete blood count, coagulation studies, liver function tests,&#xD;
      fasting lipid panel, glucose and insulin. Patients with a negative ultrasound for fatty liver&#xD;
      are not referred for liver biopsy and are considered as completed study patients. Serum is&#xD;
      also stored for adipokine and cytokine analysis. A study investigator using a 14g Bard&#xD;
      Monopty biopsy gun will perform the liver biopsy. A single expert hepatopathologist will&#xD;
      review all liver biopsies and utilize the Brunt system (9) for grading and staging of&#xD;
      steatohepatitis if present.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 18 to 70 years of age were recruited from the Primary Care Clinics or the&#xD;
             Gastroenterology Clinic at Brooke Army Medical Center. After completing a baseline&#xD;
             questionnaire, all patients had a right upper quadrant ultrasound. If fatty liver was&#xD;
             identified, then laboratory data and a liver biopsy were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ETOH consumption over 20 grams/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, HIV, or medication ingestion&#xD;
             associated with fatty liver disease&#xD;
