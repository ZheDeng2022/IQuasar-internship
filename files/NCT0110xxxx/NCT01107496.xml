      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability study in adults with ADHD. The target subjects are healthy male or female adults&#xD;
      aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive, with a diagnosis of ADHD. A total of fifty subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at approximately 5 sites in the US. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups, SPN-812V or placebo.&#xD;
