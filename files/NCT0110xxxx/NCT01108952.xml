  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: While treatment for pediatric cancer has improved significantly over the past 40&#xD;
      years, the neurotoxic side-effects of the chemotherapy agents themselves are now being&#xD;
      recognized. Two drugs suspected of having acute impact on memory performance in children are&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX) and steroids (GCs). In addition, new evidence suggests that this&#xD;
      neurotoxicity might actually protect these children from traumatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims: This project aims to examine the acute impact of MTX and GC&#xD;
      chemotherapy on memory performance in children and young adults with cancer, and the&#xD;
      subsequent impact on the development of traumatic symptoms. We hypothesize that MTX and GCs&#xD;
      will each produce acute declines in memory performance and that children with greater&#xD;
      reductions in memory performance will have fewer traumatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will recruit 45 children being treated with MTX or GCs at Dana&#xD;
      Children's Hospital. To determine acute impact on memory, a battery of memory tests will be&#xD;
      administered before and after a cycle of MTX and before and after a cycle of GCs. In&#xD;
      addition, traumatic symptoms will be assessed at each post-chemotherapy evaluation point&#xD;
      Expected results: The investigators expect poorer memory performance after MTX and after GCs&#xD;
      and that these performance declines will correlate with lower rates of traumatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: The immediate impact of MTX and GCs on memory is not well known, especially in&#xD;
      children. In addition, recent findings have led us to hypothesize that chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      deficits in memory function would paradoxically protect these patients from the&#xD;
      traumatization often associated with cancer and its treatment. The proposed study will test&#xD;
      this novel hypothesis for the first time.&#xD;
