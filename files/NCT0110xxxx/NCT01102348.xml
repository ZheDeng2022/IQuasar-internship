      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a&#xD;
      new feeding protocol, &quot;The Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision via the Enteral Route in&#xD;
      Critically Ill Patients: The PEP uP protocol.&quot;&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a well known and well described relationship between malnutrition, immune&#xD;
      dysfunction, and infection. Critically ill patients are often hypermetabolic and can rapidly&#xD;
      become nutritionally compromised. Repeated efforts over the past few years have not&#xD;
      significantly improved the amount of calories delivered via the enteral route. Historically,&#xD;
      feeding protocols have been used to guide the delivery of enteral nutrition (EN) but they&#xD;
      frequently utilize conservative, reactionary approaches to optimizing nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a new approach that protocolizes an aggressive approach to providing EN and shifts&#xD;
      the paradigm from reactionary to proactive followed by de-escalation if nutrition therapy is&#xD;
      not needed. The key components of this new protocol are the following: 1) Starting feeds at&#xD;
      the target rate based on increasing evidence that some patients tolerate starting nutrition&#xD;
      at higher rate of delivery and that slow start ups are not necessary. For patients who are&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable, we propose to shift from an hourly rate target goal to a 24 hour&#xD;
      volume goal and give nurses guidance on how to make up this volume if there was an&#xD;
      interruption for non-gastrointestinal reasons. This 'volume-based' goal represents a&#xD;
      significant shift in practice from traditional hourly rate goals in which nurses can increase&#xD;
      the hourly rate depending on how many hours they have left in the day to ensure that the&#xD;
      patient receives the 24 hour volume within the day. 2) For patients who are deemed unsuitable&#xD;
      for high volume intragastric feeds, we provide an option to initiate 'trophic feeds' at a low&#xD;
      volume of a concentrated feeding solution. By 'trophic', we mean a minimal volume of EN&#xD;
      designed to maintain gastrointestinal structure and function, not designed to meet the&#xD;
      patients caloric or protein needs. When deemed suitable, trophic feeds can be advanced to&#xD;
      full feeds. 3) Rather than wait for a protein debt to accumulate because of inadequate&#xD;
      delivery of EN, protein supplements are prescribed at initiation of EN and can be&#xD;
      discontinued if EN is well tolerated. 4) We propose to start motility agents at the same time&#xD;
      EN is started with a re-evaluation in the days following to see if it is necessary and we&#xD;
      raised our gastric residual volume threshold from 200 to 250 ml. It has been shown in one&#xD;
      randomized trial that a feeding protocol that starts a motility agent empirically at the time&#xD;
      of initiation of feeds and uses a higher threshold for a critical gastric residual volume&#xD;
      (250 ml) improves nutritional adequacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the bedside nurses initiate and utilize feeding protocols to achieve target goals, we&#xD;
      will couple this newer generational feeding protocol with a comprehensive nurse-directed&#xD;
      nutritional educational intervention that will focus on its safe and effective&#xD;
      implementation. This focus on nursing nutrition education represents a major shift away from&#xD;
      traditional education which has focused on dietitians and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the combination of these components will safely improve the provision of&#xD;
      energy and protein compared to usual care. We postulate that this increased provision of&#xD;
      calories and protein may translate into improved clinical outcomes, particularly for the&#xD;
      patients at the extremes of weight, but the current study is not powered to demonstrate such&#xD;
      a difference. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and safety of this new feeding protocol, &quot;The Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision via the&#xD;
      Enteral Route in Critically Ill Patients: The PEP uP protocol.&quot;&#xD;
