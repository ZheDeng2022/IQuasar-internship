  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrathoracic positive pressure may lead to a change hemodynamics, with repercussions for the&#xD;
      intracranial compartment, thereby altering intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      pressure (CPP). This effect may become more intense when using high positive end expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP) values. The aim of the present study was to measure the impact of different&#xD;
      PEEP values on ICP, CPP and mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP, whereas high PEEP values&#xD;
      increase ICP, although without clinical relevance.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective clinical trial, developed in the neurological intensive care unit&#xD;
      approved by the ethics committee and research in humans. The charge of each patient had&#xD;
      information about the study through the completion of informed consent and signed him when he&#xD;
      agreed. Were the following inclusion criteria: adult patients with acute CVA and presence of&#xD;
      ventricular drainage catheter for invasive monitoring of ICP and without intracranial&#xD;
      hypertension. Were adopted as exclusion criteria: increased intracranial pressure,&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability as a criterion of loss was used to expressions of interest in charge&#xD;
      to leave. All patients completed the study. &lt;br&gt;All patients were from the surgical&#xD;
      implantation of the ventricular catheter, arriving to the ICU intubated orally and manually&#xD;
      ventilated with an Ambu bag. Were subjected to routine procedures: adjusting the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator (Inter5, Intermed, BR) during assisted controlled cycled pressure and facility to&#xD;
      monitor vital signs. After thirty minutes of stable ICU patient in a supine position with&#xD;
      head elevated 30 °, the protocol was initiated to assess the impact of PEEP on ICP. To&#xD;
      perform the evaluation of lung mechanics ventilatory mode was changed to control volume with&#xD;
      the following parameters: tidal volume (Vt) = 8ml/kg weight, peak flow (PF) = 6 x minute&#xD;
      volume, fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) = 40%, respiratory rate (RR) = 16 bpm, sensitivity = 1&#xD;
      cmH2O. The following variables were monitored: PIC, Blood Pressure (BP), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      peak pressure in the airways (pp.) and plateau pressure of the respiratory system (Ppl.),&#xD;
      these values were monitored with PEEP = 5 cmH2O. &lt;br&gt;During the assessment protocol was&#xD;
      changed to pressure control ventilation mode with the following values of ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters: Pp = 30 cm H2O, inspiratory time = 1s; FiO2 = 40%, RR = 16 bpm; Sensitivity = 1&#xD;
      cmH2O. PEEP employed ranged from 0 to 14 cmH2O. To eliminate a possible physiological&#xD;
      accommodation by the progressive increase of PEEP, the range of values was determined by&#xD;
      drawing a sealed envelope for each patient, ranging from 2 to 2 cmH2O. At each value of PEEP&#xD;
      the patient was ventilated for a period of five minutes to carry out monitoring of ICP, BP,&#xD;
      HR, PPC and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). The ICP monitoring catheter was kept closed&#xD;
      for drainage and open for monitoring, since the arrival of the surgical block, was only open&#xD;
      for drainage if there was an increase in ICP above 20 mmHg. &lt;br&gt;The monitoring was carried&#xD;
      out using the multiparameter monitor (Siemens 7000). For ICP monitoring the ventricular&#xD;
      catheter was connected to a pressure transducer and this monitor. &lt;br&gt;After the parameters&#xD;
      evaluated with seven different PEEP values, the ventilatory mode was changed again to control&#xD;
      volume again to evaluate pulmonary mechanics with the same initial parameters.&#xD;
