  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will trace the path of a natural plant pigment, (cyanidin-3-glucoside; C3G),&#xD;
      through the human body after consumption. C3G is the most abundant of the naturally occurring&#xD;
      anthocyanin family of plant pigments and is responsible for the red to purple colour of many&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables. Anthocyanins are promoted as being potentially beneficial to&#xD;
      heart-health and also have anti-cancer properties, however little is known about how the body&#xD;
      processes these compounds after they are eaten or how they are cleared from the digestive&#xD;
      system. The investigators study aims to answer these questions and, in doing so, unravel how&#xD;
      they may benefit everyone's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this BBSRC funded study, 8 healthy (18-45y) male participants will be recruited to a one&#xD;
      day feeding study (lasting 8 hours) to establish the routes of clearance of anthocyanins from&#xD;
      the body. After consent has been obtained, participants will be screened to establish their&#xD;
      health (by NHS clinical staff). Eligible participants will be asked to consume a low&#xD;
      anthocyanin diet for 7 days and to attend a study day at the Clinical Research &amp; Trials Unit&#xD;
      (CRTU, University of East Anglia). Participants will attend in a fasted state (at least 8h of&#xD;
      water only) and will be asked to provide a urine (total morning void) and faecal (within the&#xD;
      previous 72h) sample. Participants will then consume a C3G capsule and blood and breath&#xD;
      samples will be collected at regular intervals after consumption (0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours).&#xD;
      The capsule is roughly the size of a commercial vitamin-C tablet (500mg). Participants will&#xD;
      then return in a fasted state on the following 2 mornings to provide further urine, faeces,&#xD;
      breath and blood samples. Low anthocyanin meals will be provided throughout the study day and&#xD;
      on the following 2 mornings. Participants will be reimbursed for their inconvenience&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No allergies to fruits or vegetables containing anthocyanins or foods to be provided&#xD;
             on the study day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those agreeing to restrict dietary intake of rich sources of anthocyanins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those agreeing to comply with a biological sampling protocol and have cannula inserted&#xD;
             for the collection of blood samples on the study day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those agreeing to record their dietary intake over 3 days (1 weekend day and 2 week&#xD;
             days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those judged by the study clinical staff (to be appointed) to have biochemical and /&#xD;
             or haematological screening results which reflect compromised health or that may&#xD;
             affect the study analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a body mass index of less than 18.5 or greater than 30&#xD;
&#xD;
