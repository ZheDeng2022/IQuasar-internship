  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying new ways to make treatment decisions for these types of&#xD;
      cancer. Technologies at the Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) are available to determine a&#xD;
      tumor's molecular makeup (gene expression profile). This technology (called &quot;Xenobase&quot;) is&#xD;
      being used to discover new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best&#xD;
      treatments for patients with cancer. The researchers at VARI have filed a patent on the&#xD;
      Xenobase and the specific network analysis method that the investigators will be using as&#xD;
      part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specimen obtained from the tumor during a recent surgical, biopsy, or bone marrow procedure&#xD;
      will be sent to the Van Andel Research Institute. Researchers will attempt to identify the&#xD;
      molecular makeup within the specimen, as well as in blood and urine samples in patients with&#xD;
      aggressive and/or refractory cancer. This additional testing is different than the routine&#xD;
      tests currently performed at the hospital for the evaluation of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this part of the study are: To determine if the investigators tumor board&#xD;
      committee (at minimum a panel of 3 oncologists and 1 pharmacist) can use patient specific&#xD;
      cancer cells to make real-time treatment decision using patient specific genetic information,&#xD;
      and predicted therapies generated in the Xenobase report.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically proven neuroblastoma and confirmation of refractory&#xD;
             or recurrent disease with histologic confirmation at diagnosis or at the time of&#xD;
             recurrence/progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be age &gt;12 months and diagnosed before the age of 21&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy must be more than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If measurable disease, this must be demonstrated by residual abnormal tissue at a&#xD;
             primary or metastatic site measuring more than 1 cm in any dimension by standardized&#xD;
             imaging (CT or MRI). For patients with only skeletal sites of disease, there must be&#xD;
             at least one persisting focus with increased activity on a pre-treatment&#xD;
             meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current disease state must be one for which there is currently no known curative&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lansky Play Score must be more than 30&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without bone marrow metastases must have an ANC &gt; 750/μl and platelet count&#xD;
             &gt;50,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SGPT (ALT) &lt; 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other significant organ toxicity defined as &gt;Grade 2 by National Cancer Institute&#xD;
             Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (NCI-CTCAE V3.0&#xD;
             (http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of child bearing&#xD;
             potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)&#xD;
