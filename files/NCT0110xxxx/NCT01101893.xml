    <textblock>
      In this study, approximately 16 subjects will receive raltegravir 400mg twice daily for 5&#xD;
      days (Treatment A) followed by a washout period. In Period 2, subjects will receive&#xD;
      GSK2248761 200mg once daily for 5 days (Treatment B). There will be no wash out between&#xD;
      Period 2 and 3. Subjects will then be administered raltegravir 400mg twice daily in&#xD;
      combination with GSK2248761 200mg once daily (Treatment C) for 5 days. Subjects will be&#xD;
      housed in the unit for the duration of the study. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples&#xD;
      will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and ECGs. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;

             is confirmatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1&#xD;

             of study medication until the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for men and greater than or equal to 45 kg&#xD;

             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.&#xD;

             during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or&#xD;
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;

             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects at Screening and predose&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
