  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics (how the&#xD;
      drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the body and how it is removed&#xD;
      from the body over time) and pharmacodynamics (the effects of the drug) of JNJ-41443532 in&#xD;
      healthy male and female Caucasian and male Japanese participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor&#xD;
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled, parallel group, single&#xD;
      dose study in male and female Caucasian and male Japanese participants. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      study in healthy male and female caucasian and male Japanese participants. For each&#xD;
      participant, the study will consist of a screening examination (within 28 days of first dose&#xD;
      on Day 1), a single period of open label treatment (all people involved know the identity of&#xD;
      the intervention) upon entry in the study and discharge on Day 3), and a final, follow-up&#xD;
      examination between 7-10 days after discharge from the study. Safety assessments include&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse events, and evaluation of lab results, cardiac parameters, vital signs,&#xD;
      and physical exams. Participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) by mouth&#xD;
      on Day 1 after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned dose is 250 mg.&#xD;
