      The aim of this study is to compare results of the new surgical strategy to the traditional&#xD;
      4-ports technique for cholecystectomy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In particular&#xD;
      we are going to investigate the procedures in terms of overall morbidity, while taking into&#xD;
      considerations skin-incision's related morbidity, postoperative pain and cosmetic results&#xD;
      which are the hypothetical benefits of the new approach. Other parameters are supposed to be&#xD;
      unchanged, considering evidences from recent literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 ports cholecystectomy (4PC): a 12mmHg pneumoperitoeum is created either by a 10mm umbilical&#xD;
      Hasson's port or by a Verress needle followed by a 10mm umbilical port insertion; further one&#xD;
      10mm and two 5mm ports are placed according to the preferred technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Port Access cholecystectomy (SPC): the single-port device is inserted through the&#xD;
      umbilicus, by means of an adeguate incision, as the only access to the abdominal cavity. A&#xD;
      trans-abdominal suture in right hypochondrium is placed through the gallbladder wall of the&#xD;
      fundus to retract it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: overall morbidity rate (at 60 days from surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. skin-incision's related morbidity rate (at 60 days from surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. perioperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. cosmetic results&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. long-term morbidity (12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. intraoperative time&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. &quot;conversion SPC to 4PC&quot; rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. &quot;conversion to laparotomy&quot; rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. hospital stay&#xD;

      Duration of the project Patients will be recruited for this study from September 2010 until&#xD;
      September 2012 in all participating centers. All randomized patients will be followed up&#xD;
      (after recovery) with outpatient clinic appointments 30 and 60 days from surgery. A long-term&#xD;
      evaluation will be done 12 months after surgery. The last 3 months will be used for&#xD;
      photographic analysis of cosmetic results, statistical analysis and reporting of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis /Aims SPA technique is a feasible approach to the peritoneal cavity. While&#xD;
      performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy the single umbilical access has an overall morbidity&#xD;
      comparable to multiport laparoscopy (equivalence study) while it entails a reduced&#xD;
      skin-incision's related morbidity rate, a reduced post-operative pain and allows a better&#xD;
      cosmetic result. Other considered parameters (operative time, conversion rate and hospital&#xD;
      stay) are supposed to be unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background More recently Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) has been&#xD;
      highlighted to the attention of lay literature and media, after first clinical reports.&#xD;
      Concept and feasibility had been tested in animal experiments since 20041, leading to the&#xD;
      creation of new scientific societies and committees with the declared aim to regulate&#xD;
      research activity, through sponsorships and registers, without reaching the goal completely.&#xD;
      After less than three years, the race for the first cholecystectomy under NOTES conditions in&#xD;
      a human being was having its course. Since then, many authors have reported various case&#xD;
      collections, while many others presented consistent research activity in vitro or in vivo,&#xD;
      but it looks evident that two different branches of research were being defined2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first consists in what we would call Endoscopical Access Natural Orifice Surgery (EA-NOS)&#xD;
      which includes all procedures truly performed through natural orifices, having the goal to&#xD;
      design new platforms for surgery to be brought within the human body to recreate surgical&#xD;
      conditions under safety. The evident difficulties to obtain such an environment with&#xD;
      guaranteed ease of use, safety and efficacy, reduced to a mere research activity the interest&#xD;
      in this field, with few clinical applications described consisting of hybrid procedures, i.e.&#xD;
      procedures which were performed basically under laparoscopic conditions with the help of&#xD;
      flexible instruments inserted through natural orifices. In fact, a recent large metanalysis&#xD;
      of NOTES literature3 focusing on various surgical intra-abdominal procedures, all ascribable&#xD;
      to EA-NOS, concluded that no human studies were found satisfactory for the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, for scarce disposable evidence, minor safety and efficacy compared to laparotomic&#xD;
      and laparoscopic alternatives. The recommendation that human procedures should first pass&#xD;
      through hybrid NOTES surgery, under strict guidelines, and in apposite controlled registers&#xD;
      was later supported, as known, by the revision of NOSCAR &quot;white paper&quot; 4 . In fact, it is out&#xD;
      of discussion that there is a need for a worldwide register, a standardization of the&#xD;
      nomenclature, safety data to be used by ethical committees in order to authorize human&#xD;
      trials, and implementation of the interface between medical societies, industry and&#xD;
      regulatory offices. In this field, on behalf of the EURONOTES Foundation, we have promoted an&#xD;
      european registry of NOTES procedures (www.euronotes.world.it) which preliminary results are&#xD;
      now awaited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cooling of enthusiasm related to EA-NOS procedures has naturally forced surgeons to&#xD;
      concentrate on techniques which could be more easily reproduced in clinical environments.&#xD;
      This brought the interest towards what we would call Surgical Access Natural Orifice Surgery&#xD;
      (SA-NOS)2 . In fact, an analysis of the literature would unveil that the vast majority of&#xD;
      human studies can be ascribed to SA-NOS. A wider vision of what can be considered a SA-NOS&#xD;
      approach, includes in this group not only transvaginal, thoroughly described in literature,&#xD;
      but also trans-umbilical surgery. Although both approaches have the advantage of not being&#xD;
      burdened by problems related to endoscopic defect's closure in terms of infection, safety,&#xD;
      consistent technological research and time-consumption, there is no discussion that&#xD;
      trans-umbilical techniques encountered more appreciation among surgeons. We have observed a&#xD;
      rapid clinical diffusion driven by a technology development supported by all the different&#xD;
      major surgical companies. Thus, it has to be said that single-port laparoscopic surgery is&#xD;
      nothing new. It was 1992 when Marco Pelosi first described a laparoscopic appendectomy using&#xD;
      a single umbilical puncture5 . Even multi-port single-incision trans-umbilical laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy was first described by Giuseppe Navarra already in 19977 . Despite this,&#xD;
      interest towards single-port surgery grew-up only very recently. This might be on one side&#xD;
      explained with the better establishment of laparoscopic techniques and skills over the years,&#xD;
      but rises doubts about a possible industry driven interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no discussion that the technique has a number of drawbacks. The major one regards&#xD;
      the concept of &quot;triangulation&quot; to which laparoscopic surgeons have grown accustomed in terms&#xD;
      of both the instruments and scope, which is now lacking. Although this seems to be&#xD;
      overshadowed by the increasing acceptability of in-line viewing, it has to be said that&#xD;
      industries concentrate on developing and marketing a number of curved instrument with&#xD;
      different characteristics with the aim of restoring standard triangulation as under&#xD;
      laparoscopic environment. Nevertheless, personal experience gained by conducing a trial on a&#xD;
      virtual reality simulator designed for the purpose, demonstrated that only very experienced&#xD;
      surgeons performed surgical tasks with safety and effectiveness and requiring a short&#xD;
      learning curve, while for all other surgeons technique acquisition was challenging7 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still a number of different concerns arise. The fundamental hypotheses that were at the base&#xD;
      of single-port growing interest were that it could improve cosmesis, decrease post-operative&#xD;
      pain and therefore probably allow an earlier return to work with in any case a better&#xD;
      patient's satisfaction. None of these has been confirmed yet, if they will ever. It is also&#xD;
      clear that those who advocate patients' preference as the main reason for proposing&#xD;
      single-port techniques forget that patients' preference is deeply influenced by the&#xD;
      assumption that these arguments in favor of single-port surgery are correct, despite there is&#xD;
      no realistic certainty about it. Some of the major experts in the field of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery and active researchers in the field of NOTES share the same skeptical opinion about a&#xD;
      real benefit of single port techniques application. Dr Ratner for instance states in a recent&#xD;
      interview that &quot;...it is not clear to me whether single port laparoscopy would be beneficial&#xD;
      compared to traditional laparoscopy&quot;8 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case we should never advocate for even slightly improved cosmetic value over safety,&#xD;
      the principal concern. This has implications in both the intraoperative and the postoperative&#xD;
      time. While it is recommended not to consider conversion to standard multi-trocars&#xD;
      laparoscopy a failure, it might be that, as it happened at the beginning of the diffusion of&#xD;
      laparoscopy, an increased number of complications will be observed. In fact, as often in&#xD;
      similar circumstances, only a minority of efforts has been dedicated to training programs and&#xD;
      very few simulators are available yet. Moreover, it has been advocated that a larger&#xD;
      peri-umbilical incision and consequent fascial defect would imply a higher rate of incisional&#xD;
      hernia. Although this is likely to happen, only time and data acquired will give us the&#xD;
      answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons robust studies to show that there is indeed a difference without a&#xD;
      significant compromise of safety should be awaited before a wide diffusion of these&#xD;
      techniques. In the proposed study cholecystectomy is chosen as a target as it represent the&#xD;
      typical and more diffuse indication for laparoscopy. Its morbidity rate related to skin&#xD;
      incisions occurs in a range of 1 to 5%9,10.&#xD;

      Study Design Design: multi-centric randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Overall morbidity rate defined as any diagnosed morbidity related to&#xD;
      surgical technique within 60 days from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure (for non-inferiority):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity, defined as the occurrence of any complication, directly or indirectly related to&#xD;
      surgery. Complications will be classified according to Dindo [Dindo D., Demartines N.,&#xD;
      Clavien PA. Classification of surgical complications: a new proposal with evaluation in a&#xD;
      cohort of 6336 patients and results of a survey. Ann Surg. 2004 Aug;240(2):205-13)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be subdivided into procedural (during treatment) and delayed complications&#xD;
      (after ending the procedure), and further subdivided into major (requiring additional&#xD;
      surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or medical intervention) complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During admission patients will be monitored for complications. The following standardized&#xD;
      discharge criteria will be applied in all participating hospitals: normal intake of&#xD;
      nutrition; normal mobility; absence of fever (&lt;38°C); and stable hemoglobin level during 1&#xD;
      day (&lt;1 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of same day discharge from the hospital patients will be called by telephone 1 day&#xD;
      after the procedure whether adverse events have happened. Two weeks after the intervention, a&#xD;
      research nurse will contact the patient by telephone again and ask for occurred&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo a direct check-up by means of a medical doctor at 30 and 60 days&#xD;
      after surgery, to conclude evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin-incision related morbidity defined as bleeding, infection, necrosis, skin retraction,&#xD;
      incisional hernia, suture dehiscence within 60 days from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain defined as a subjective evaluation of the same parameter using an&#xD;
      horizontal visual analogical scale daily for the first week and weekly till 60 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be administered Paracetamol IV 3 times a day for the first 24h, than&#xD;
      on demand. Tramadol will be administered when Paracetamol will not be judged sufficient for&#xD;
      pain control. On request, a single-dose of Ketorolac can be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cosmetic results defined as judgement of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  three independent surgeons: using a standardized methodology (patient on standing&#xD;
           position against a black background), two digital photographs (JPG format, 800x600&#xD;
           pixels resolution, 16x106 colours, 24 bit) will be taken preoperatively (for comparison)&#xD;
           and 60 days from surgery, one consisting of a close up of the umbilical area and a large&#xD;
           view including just the full abdomen. A Likert scale will be used independently by the&#xD;
           three surgeons to score the photographs from 1 to 5 (1= very poor, 2= poor, 3=&#xD;
           satisfactory, 4= good, 5= very good) in all cases. The mean value will be considered&#xD;
           objective evaluation of cosmetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patient him/her self: the patient will be asked to score his/her subjective&#xD;
           perception of cosmetic outcome using the same Likert scale 60 days from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A following comparison of the two different measures will give an interesting proportion of&#xD;
      differences between subjective and objective perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay: length (days) of hospital stay after surgery Intra-operative time: minutes&#xD;
      between skin incision and end of skin closure Conversion &quot;Single-Port (SPC) to Multi-Ports&#xD;
      (4PC) Laparoscopy&quot; rate: number of cases in which the surgeon preferred conversion from SPC&#xD;
      to 4PC for safely of technical reasons Conversion &quot;to Open Surgery&quot; rate: number of cases in&#xD;
      which the surgeon preferred conversion from SPC or 4PC to laparotomy for safely or technical&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term morbidity defined as any diagnosed morbidity related to surgical technique within 1&#xD;
      year from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment: Consecutive eligible patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      in the participating centres by the involved physician. All patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      above-mentioned criteria will be informed about the study by the physician. After consent is&#xD;
      given, central randomization will take place web-based and patients will be treated according&#xD;
      to the study protocol. Patients unable or refusing to provide informed consent will be&#xD;
      treated according to current clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: patient data will be entered into a web-based database and a blind&#xD;
      randomization (into two experimental groups: a. traditional 4-Ports Cholecystectomy (4PC) vs.&#xD;
      b. Single-Port Cholecystectomy (SPC)) will be done by an unchangeable number-generating&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Blinding of patients and physicians during treatment is unfeasible, since the two&#xD;
      treatment strategies are highly different and easily recognizable. Since a double-blinded&#xD;
      method is not possible in surgical experiments, this system guarantees the highest scientific&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: - age: 18-75&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI: &lt;30 ASA: I-III absence of non-correctable coagulopathy (international normalized&#xD;
           ratio &gt;1,5, or platelet count &lt;90 × 109/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis: cholelithiasis (gallstones &lt; 2 cm in diameter) gallbladder dyskinesia&#xD;
           gallbladder polyps&#xD;
&#xD;
      exclusion criteria: - diagnosis: cholecystitis suspected presence of common duct stones&#xD;
      suspected presence of biliary cancer Previous abdominal surgery Previous umbilical surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-Ports Cholecystectomy (4PC): a 12mmHg pneumoperitoeum is created either by a 10mm umbelical&#xD;
      Hasson's port or by a Verress needle followed by a 10 mm umbelical port insertion; further&#xD;
      one 10mm and two 5mm ports are placed according to the preferred technique. A straight or&#xD;
      angulated laparoscope may be used. Laparoscopic graspers, monopolar hook, bipolar forceps,&#xD;
      scissors and 10mm clips-applier are used. A plastic bag system might be used for gall bladder&#xD;
      extraction if necessary. In both 10 and 12mm accesses, fascia is sutured with resorbable&#xD;
      sutures. Skin is secured by either metallic agraffes or interrupted sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-Port Cholecystectomy (SPC): a 2.5cm long skin incision around the umbilicus is&#xD;
      performed. The subcutaneous tissue is dissected, the muscular fascia exposed and incised&#xD;
      along the middle line (linea alba) respecting the muscular tissue. Peritoneum is identified&#xD;
      and incised. The Single-Port device is inserted and anchored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to retract the gallbladder a transcutaneous suture is placed in the right&#xD;
      hypocondrium with a straight needle and a monofilament thread which are passed through the&#xD;
      fundus and knotted outside the skin. The following steps reproduce the traditional&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Each centre will be left free to use dedicated instruments and&#xD;
      which or traditional laparoscopic ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complication/Intervention failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversion &quot;single-port (SPC) to multi-ports (4PC) laparoscopy&quot; is possible according to&#xD;
      surgeon's decision, while performing the surgical procedure. Since the patients' recruitment&#xD;
      is based on &quot;intention to treat&quot; the converted procedure will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Conversion rate will be considered as a relevant result of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, conversion &quot;to open surgery&quot; both from 4PC and SPC is possible according to&#xD;
      surgeon's decision, while performing the surgical procedure. Since the patients' recruitment&#xD;
      is based on &quot;intention to treat&quot;, the converted procedure won't be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Conversion rate will be considered as a relevant result of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Power calculation Assuming a baseline overall morbidity of 5% for both 4PC&#xD;
      and SPC group (average morbidity based on specific literature) and considering a level of&#xD;
      difference considered clinically significant of 0.05 (4.75 to 5.25%) for SPC to be&#xD;
      non-inferior, with a β-error of 0.2 and α-error of 0.05, 300 patients are needed per&#xD;
      randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 patients in total allow to establish equivalence in terms of overall morbidity, with a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80%. If the hypothesis is confirmed, secondary endopoints will&#xD;
      eventually define benefits for the new surgical procedure in terms of reduced skin incision's&#xD;
      related morbidity, lower postoperative pain and better cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation has been obtained by R-software (R Project for Statistical&#xD;
      Computing, Lucent Technology, GNU General Public Licence) version 2.10.1, package epicalc,&#xD;
      routine sample-size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Intra and post-operative results will be inserted in the web-based database at&#xD;
      any time during the study by the recruiting surgeon. The photographic material will be&#xD;
      up-loaded into the computed database as well; all patients' personal data will be considered&#xD;
      strictly reserved in respect of privacy policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kolgoromow-test will be used to establish whether the results are parametric or not.&#xD;
      According to data feature, T-Test/Chi-Square or Wilcoxon rank test will be used where&#xD;
      appropriate. All analyses will be carried out primarily on an intention-to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on clinical practice and healthcare system SPA Surgery is an emergent frontier of&#xD;
      surgical innovation and represents an alternative to multi-ports standard laparoscopy. The&#xD;
      trans-umbilical technique allows to perform laparoscopy with the supposed benefit of reduced&#xD;
      invasiveness. In recent literature a large number of studies have aimed to demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of the new method even if no randomized trial is still available for&#xD;
      definitive conclusions. Once feasibility and safety will be shown we will have to investigate&#xD;
      benefit for the patients. For these reasons we have chosen as primary endpoint overall&#xD;
      morbidity while in order to demonstrate the supposed benefit (patient's reduced discomfort&#xD;
      and better cosmetic outcome) and skin incision morbidity will be taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since SPA surgical technique requires a consistent effort in terms of development of new&#xD;
      technology and surgeon's adaptation, we consider this definition of primary relevance. As a&#xD;
      matter of fact, a concrete introduction of SPA Surgery into daily practice is not possible&#xD;
      without a concrete advantage for patients. Except one single trial comparing only&#xD;
      postoperative pain (by Tsimoviannis et al. in G. Hatzikosta General Hospital, Ioannina&#xD;
      Greece), at present there are no similar studies posted on USA and European trials databanks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, we believe the MUSIC trial should produce precious information with&#xD;
      obvious recoils on clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Track record of applicants including their experience in the field and any plot work carry&#xD;
      out The present MUSIC project is the result of a collaboration between the members of EAES&#xD;
      Technology Committee and the Board of the EAES. All applicants have big experience in the&#xD;
      field of new technologies in laparoscopic surgery. In particular, many of them have taken&#xD;
      part in development of new instruments and new techniques for trans-luminal endoscopic&#xD;
      surgery (NOTES). Since SPA surgery is considered part of this new concept for a&#xD;
      micro-invasive approach to the abdominal cavity, we consider their knowledge particularly&#xD;
      useful in the coordination of the trial. Considering the high interest on SPA-surgery&#xD;
      expressed in recent literature by the international surgical community, the Technology&#xD;
      Committee has developed a specific interest in this new branch of surgical innovation.&#xD;

      Project management structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients accept to be included in the MUSIC study, the randomization will be performed&#xD;
      in one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment A: 4 Ports Cholecystectomy (4PC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment B: Single-Port Access Cholecystectomy (SPC) Randomization will take place by&#xD;
           connection to a dedicated web-site where initial data of the patient will be inserted&#xD;
           and the group assignment will be displayed, sent by e-mail to the centre logged in and&#xD;
           recruiting the patient, and stored in a dedicated database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the clinical informations related to the per-operative time and the follow-up as&#xD;
      described in the appendix will be stored through the same website and collected in a database&#xD;
      format. This will be accessible in an anonymous way, respecting the privacy of each patient,&#xD;
      at any time. Basic statistical analysis as well as more advanced data analysis such as&#xD;
      Wilcoxon tests and t-Student's test will be available online. Furthermore, the entire&#xD;
      database can be downloaded at anytime in xls format for more advanced data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow to complete an interim analysis and report to the Ethical committee at any&#xD;
      time during the project. Proposed interval for analysis and reporting will be 3 months, if&#xD;
      not suggested differently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applicants will be in charge of collection of data and analysis of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination plan Dissemination of research results, training and exploitation will be&#xD;
      actively pursued. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community through&#xD;
      specialized media, as selected magazines, conferences, fairs, websites and medical society,&#xD;
      including clinicians considered final users and patients. Training activities will be carried&#xD;
      out based on the dissemination activities, the target of the courses is expected essentially&#xD;
      coming from the medical community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Dissemination Plan is to identify and organize the activities to be&#xD;
      performed in order to promote the exploitation of the project's results and the widest&#xD;
      dissemination of knowledge from the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MUSIC trial will establish an infrastructure for communications (and therefore dissemination)&#xD;
      by building a robust framework in which dialogue and interaction can take place. This applies&#xD;
      equally to internal and external communication. These will be used to disseminate information&#xD;
      about and solicit input into the Single-Port-Access Surgery project work. Contact can be&#xD;
      maintained and facilitated by electronic mailing lists, through Internal Lists within the&#xD;
      EAES members, and External Lists including stakeholders using several existing lists to&#xD;
      communicate to the wider community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the MUSIC-working group develop a publications program which at minimum will&#xD;
      comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      targeted informational literature designed to raise awareness about Single-Port-Access&#xD;
      Surgery, and its activities instructional literature derived from experience across this&#xD;
      trial, including methodological guidelines and strategic guides to good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MUSIC-working group will develop effective mechanisms for dissemination material&#xD;
      including the worldwide web, with a website which will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  information about MUSIC study and its activities including contact details, background&#xD;
           information, working papers, events (seminars, workshops, conferences) etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  instructional materials as discussed above n(the web in this respect acts as a principal&#xD;
           means of publication):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequent news and updates to keep the community informed Finally printed publications&#xD;
           will be submitted to the EAES Official Journal, Surgical Endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MUSIC-working group will be promoting dissemination, advocacy and other events.&#xD;
      Conferences, workshops, seminars will be organized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      raise awareness about activities, resources, results, etc.; act as training venues e.g. For&#xD;
      disseminating instructional material as required by a particular stakeholding community or&#xD;
      communities; act as for a for more public discussion of research, development, collections,&#xD;
      standards or other strategic and substantive issues of interest to SPA Surgery and the wider&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term sustainability of the work The program has the potential for long term&#xD;
      sustainability according to its underlying concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Single-Port surgery is a traditional laparoscopy-like technique, the cost of procedure&#xD;
      is expected to be similar. Other than different ports and instruments (already present on the&#xD;
      market), SPC and 4PC require the same laparoscopic equipment, largely available in every&#xD;
      operative room. From this point of view, the study doesn't imply any supplementary expense.&#xD;
      The follow up of both procedures is identical. It will consist in outpatient clinical&#xD;
      meetings and doesn't require expenses for new material and devices. Cost for complications&#xD;
      and hospital stay is supposed to be unchanged between the two experimental groups.&#xD;
