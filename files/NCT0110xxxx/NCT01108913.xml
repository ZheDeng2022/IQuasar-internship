        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and postmenopausal or sterile female patients with a history of moderate to&#xD;
             severe COPD defined as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)&#xD;
             II-III for at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 40 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smoker or ex-smoker with at least 10 pack-year smoking history (Ten pack-years&#xD;
             is defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postbronchodilator FEV1 between 30% and 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 70%.&#xD;
             Postbronchodilator refers to 30 min after inhalation of 400 µg Salbutamol. This&#xD;
             criterion for FEV1 will have to be demonstrated after a washout period of at least 48&#xD;
             h during which no long acting anticholinergic medication (LAMA) or long acting&#xD;
             β2-agonists (LABA) has been inhaled or a washout period of 6 h during which no short&#xD;
             acting β2-agonists (SABA) or anticholinergic medication (SAMA) has been inhaled. For&#xD;
             patients having been pretreated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and/or&#xD;
             theophylline, this criterion needs to be demonstrated after a washout of at least 4&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to produce sputum upon induction in a sufficient quality. This criterion will be&#xD;
             checked by the responsible sputum lab prior to randomization of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Time and ability to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study. Understand and sign the written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of chronic respiratory disorders other than COPD e.g. asthma,&#xD;
             α1-Antitrypsin deficiency, mucoviscidosis, lung fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who experienced an exacerbation in the 4 weeks before the screening visit or&#xD;
             between screening and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who experienced an acute upper respiratory tract infection or&#xD;
             broncho-pulmonary infection requiring antibiotic treatment during the 4 weeks before&#xD;
             the screening visit or between screening and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with inhaled (ICS), topical or any systemic corticosteroids or theophylline&#xD;
             within at least 4 weeks before the screening visit and throughout entire course of the&#xD;
             study. Patients with ICS and/or theophylline treatment will undergo a washout of at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks after signature of the informed consent and prior to the screening&#xD;
             visit, where eligibility to enter the study will be assessed&#xD;
