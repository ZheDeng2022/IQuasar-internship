  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with cognitive and psychobehavioural disorders, gait disorders represent a major&#xD;
      problem in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). PD can be considered to be a&#xD;
      hyperglutamatergic disease because dopaminergic depletion induces hyperactivity of the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the internal pallidum (GPi), with glutamatergic hyperactivity&#xD;
      of the STN's efferent pathway, i.e., the subthalamopallidal, subthalamonigral and&#xD;
      subthalamo-entopeduncular pathways (projecting to the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)). Excess&#xD;
      glutamate in the PPN has also been observed in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD. Reduction of this&#xD;
      glutamatergic hyperactivity within the PPN via the systemic or intra-peduncular&#xD;
      administration of glutamate antagonists improves akinesia in drug-induced murine and primate&#xD;
      models of PD, via the NMDA and AMPA receptors. High doses of memantine (10 mg/kg) improve&#xD;
      locomotion in reserpine- and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated rats. In humans, the PPN may&#xD;
      play a key role in gait, posture control, axial rigidity and attention. It is also involved&#xD;
      in the gating of sensory information involved in the startle reflex, which can be studied via&#xD;
      prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the blink reflex. At present, two uncompetitive NMDA receptor&#xD;
      antagonists are approved for use in humans: amantadine and memantine. Reviews of the recent&#xD;
      literature on these drugs have identified no published studies specifically on severe gait&#xD;
      and attention disorders in PD. Memantine is a partial blocker of open NMDA channels. The&#xD;
      value of memantine relates to the fact that it decreases excessive glutamatergic transmission&#xD;
      by lowering the synaptic noise due to excessive activation of NMDA receptors. In this&#xD;
      double-blind study, the investigators shall seek to demonstrate the presence or absence of an&#xD;
      effect of memantine on gait and attention disorders. In order to study the interaction&#xD;
      between glutamatergic hyperactivity and the dopaminergic system, the investigators shall&#xD;
      study the phenomena both in the absence of L-dopa and following acute administration of the&#xD;
      latter. Twenty eight volunteer, non-demented, late-stage PD patients displaying severe gait&#xD;
      disorders will receive memantine (20 mg/day) or placebo for 3 months. The investigators&#xD;
      expect to see a reduction in gait and attention disorders, together with an improvement in&#xD;
      the blink reflex with PPI under memantine. This pilot study could subsequently be turned into&#xD;
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study.&#xD;

      Overall study duration: 2 years. Planned inclusion period: 12 months. Study duration for&#xD;
      individual patients: 4 months and 2 weeks(2 weeks between screening and randomization, 3&#xD;
      months of double-blind treatment and then a 4-week wash-out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective (V1 and V4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess efficacy of memantine treatment on severe gait disorders assessed on stride length&#xD;
      by gait analysis with an optoelectronic system (VICON®) in patients with advanced Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease under subthalamic stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Efficacy Endpoints (V1 and V4):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kinematic and Kinetic parameters (stride length, stride time, velocity, and cadence) of&#xD;
           the gait initiation and the stabilized gait using the optoelectronic system (VICON®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gait and motor symptoms: the &quot;Freezing Of Gait trajectory&quot;, the UPDRS scores (part III),&#xD;
           the dyskinesia rating scale,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axial rigidity : measured by passive flexion on isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex 6000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axial strength : measured by active flexion on isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex 6000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention: simple and complex reactions times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inhibition of the presynaptic dopamine transporter by memantine was assessed by the&#xD;
           mean DAT density of the bilateral striatum (putamen and caudate nuclei) using&#xD;
           [99mTc]TRODAT-1 SPECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Tolerability Endpoints (V1, V2, V3 and V4):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drowsiness: Epworth and Parkinson's disease Sleep Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apathy Lille Apathy Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression : MADRS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic properties of memantine were analyzed by the lowest plasmatic&#xD;
           concentrations of memantine before the morning intake of the blinded treatment at 7:00&#xD;
           h, during the steady state after 3 months (blind secondary analyse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety : Recording of all serious and non serious adverse events reported by the&#xD;
           patients, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and biological analyzes (blood counts,&#xD;
           ionogram, urea, creatinemia, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubinemia, gamma&#xD;
           GT, magnesium)&#xD;

      to participate in the study, subjects will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio into one of the&#xD;
      following two treatment groups based on a randomization scheme with blocks stratified:&#xD;
&#xD;
      one memantine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st week: 5 mg per day in the morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd week: 10 mg per day in the morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd week: 15 mg per day in the morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. th week: 20 mg per day in the morning&#xD;
&#xD;
      one placebo during 3 months same as memantine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule: 5 visits : screening (V0), randomization (V1, 15 days after V0), (V2) visit after 1&#xD;
      months, (V3) visit after 2 months and termination (V4, 3 months after randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients : 28 subjects with Parkinson's disease duration of more than 5 years, without&#xD;
      dementia (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ≥ 130, MMSE ≥ 27 and DSM IV), without major depression&#xD;
      (MADRS &lt; 18) who have severe gait disorders including freezing of gait (defined by an answer&#xD;
      2 or 3 at the 3rd question of the autoquestionnaire of Giladi: Do your gait disorders impede&#xD;
      your daily living activities and your independence: answer: yes, moderately or severely. But&#xD;
      the patient requires no physical assistance to walk) despite an optimal dopaminergic&#xD;
      treatment and optimal and stable subthalamic stimulation parameters. No additional therapy&#xD;
      will be permitted during the study.&#xD;
