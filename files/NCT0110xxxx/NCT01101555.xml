    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study of&#xD;
      otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis patients. One cohort will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue medication to assess&#xD;
      additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)&#xD;
      directed against the Îµ domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently&#xD;
      undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and&#xD;
      has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory&#xD;
      studies. Otelixizumab has been administered via the subcutaneous route as a single dose in&#xD;
      type I diabetes patients. This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      repeat dose study of otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      patients. One cohort will receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue&#xD;
      medication to assess additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby&#xD;
      otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts in a staggered fashion. Six cumulative doses&#xD;
      will be evaluated covering a 10-fold dose range in seven cohorts. The starting regimen will&#xD;
      be three doses (1.5 mg cumulative dose), increasing to 15 doses (15 mg cumulative dose).&#xD;
      Cohorts 1a and 1b have been included as optional lower doses. Serial blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained for clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum&#xD;
      otelixizumab PK parameters, and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the&#xD;
      previous dose(s) will be evaluated prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety&#xD;
      and to achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory&#xD;
      values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in&#xD;
      the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1.1 for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  for at least two weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last&#xD;
                  dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until at least 60 days after the last dose of otelixizumab or two months&#xD;
             after adalimumab (Cohort 6 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body mass index within the range 18.5 - 35 kg/m^2 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and willing and able to&#xD;
             follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A 12-lead ECG at pre-study screening measured in triplicate, which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Principal Investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will&#xD;
             compromise safety in this study. QTcB &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with&#xD;
             Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No significant and/or active disease in any body system. Examples of significant&#xD;
             diseases include but are not limited to: coronary artery disease, congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, uncontrolled hypertension, emphysema, seizure disorder, chronic infectious&#xD;
             disease ( e.g., chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection with bronchiectasis,&#xD;
             tuberculosis (TB) or latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has a diagnosis of RA according to the revised 1987 criteria of the&#xD;

             is willing to refrain from using any such antibody for 2 years after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug unless invited to participate in possible future studies with otelixizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If taking methotrexate, the patient must have been taking methotrexate for at least 12&#xD;
             weeks and to be on a stable dose of methotrexate (7.5-25 mg/week) for at least four&#xD;
             weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose until day 28 of the study&#xD;
             unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. If sulfasalazine is being taken, the patient must have been taking sulfasalazine for&#xD;
             at least 12 weeks and to be on a stable dose within local treatment guidelines for at&#xD;

             the study unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or&#xD;
             safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. If leflunomide is being taken, the patient must have been receiving this DMARD for at&#xD;
             least six months prior to dosing with otelixizumab and the DMARD dose has been stable&#xD;
             dose within local treatment guidelines for four weeks prior to dosing with study drug&#xD;
             and be willing to remain on this dose until day 28 of the study unless change required&#xD;
             for clinical management of disease activity or safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients on glucocorticoids e.g. prednisolone (â¤10mg/day), must be on stable dosing&#xD;
             regimens for at least four weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose&#xD;
             until day 28 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. PRN use is acceptable for NSAIDS and COX-2 inhibitors within local treatment&#xD;
             guidelines. Chronic NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor use is not permitted.&#xD;
