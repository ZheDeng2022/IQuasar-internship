  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is associated with a significant reduction of circulating progenitor cells&#xD;
      (CPCs). These include endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are involved in&#xD;
      cardiovascular homeostasis and repair. A reduction of CPCs in metabolic patients is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of future adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, ways&#xD;
      to active stimulate an increase of CPC levels in diabetes are actively pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental animal studies and preliminary data in humans indicate that a bone marrow defect&#xD;
      is causally related to the low CPC level in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous data in rats indicate that diabetes reduces the bone marrow responsiveness to&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in terms of progenitor cell mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we aim at investigating bone marrow responsiveness to pharmacological&#xD;
      mobilization of CPC in diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is associated with a significant reduction of circulating progenitor cells&#xD;
      (CPCs). CPCs are defined by the surface expression of the stem cell antigen CD34 and or&#xD;
      CD133. These cells include endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are involved in&#xD;
      cardiovascular homeostasis and repair. EPCs are characterized by the co-expression of&#xD;
      endothelial antigen(s), such as KDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction of CPCs in metabolic patients is associated with an increased risk of future&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization,&#xD;
      etc. Therefore, ways to active stimulate an increase of CPC levels in diabetes are actively&#xD;
      pursued. Indeed, there are several drugs that stimulate CPCs or EPCs, but it is not fully&#xD;
      clear if they are active also in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms that account for CPC reduction in diabetes include defective bone marrow&#xD;
      mobilization, reduced survival and increased homing outside the bloodstream. Experimental&#xD;
      animal studies and preliminary data in humans indicate that a bone marrow defect is causally&#xD;
      related to the low CPC level in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous data in rats indicate that diabetes reduces the bone marrow responsiveness to&#xD;
      G-CSF in terms of c-kit+/Sca-1+ progenitor cell mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also some experimental evidence in type 2 diabetic rats that a specific form of&#xD;
      autonomic neuropathy impairs bone marrow mobilization of progenitor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we aim at investigating bone marrow responsiveness to pharmacological&#xD;
      mobilization of CPC in diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic subjects and control subjects will be administered with a single dose of granulocyte&#xD;
      colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and progenitor cells will be quantified before and 24 hours&#xD;
      after G-CSF administration. Progenitor cells will be analyzed by flow cytometry on the basis&#xD;
      of the expression of CD34, CD133 and KDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean percentage variation of CPCs and EPCs will be compared in diabetic versus non diabetic&#xD;
      patients to understand whether or not diabetes is associated with a significant defective&#xD;
      mobilization of progenitor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary aim, diabetic patients will be divided in those with and without diabetic&#xD;
      autonomic neuropathy (DAN) to understand if DAN modulates bone marrow responsiveness to&#xD;
      G-CSF.&#xD;
