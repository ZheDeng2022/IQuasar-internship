      Sunitinib seems to be a promising treatment for the objective of this proposal: to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical activity of Sunitinib as first line therapy in patients who have measurable&#xD;
      disease and to evaluate the safety of Sunitinib with radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib (SU 11248) is a small molecule with good oral bioavailability that inhibits&#xD;
      multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) expressed on diverse tumour cells: VEGFR, PDGFR,&#xD;
      KIT, FLT3 and endothelium, pericytes, and stroma VEGFR, PDGFR. It has the potential to&#xD;
      inhibit directly the growth of multiple tumour types by the inhibition of multiple targets&#xD;
      and to act negatively on antiangiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent brain tumour. Standard treatment after surgical&#xD;
      resection is radiation therapy with Temozolomide. But patients who can afford only a biopsy&#xD;
      of their lesion due to the location in eloquent areas of their tumour or multifocality, don't&#xD;
      get benefit from such treatment and their median survival is in the best case of only 9&#xD;
      months. These patients constitute 30% of Glioblastomas. Clinical trials in this setting are&#xD;
      required as patients should be treated immediately after the biopsy to prevent neurological&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are ideal to test new promising therapies. Their survival is similar to&#xD;
      recurrent patients. The evaluation of response is easier as it's possible to avoid the&#xD;
      confounding post-surgical changes that interfere with the evaluation of treatment efficacy in&#xD;
      terms of tumour size reduction.. Furthermore, neo adjuvant treatment before radiotherapy has&#xD;
      shown not to worsen their survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma is a tumour rich in molecular abnormalities. PDGFRs are important in growth&#xD;
      signalling pathways and neoangiogenesis of gliomas. PDGF ligands and PDGFR-alfa are expressed&#xD;
      in most human gliomas, while PDGFR-beta is expressed in glioma cells and tumor endothelial&#xD;
      cells, PDFGR-α is expressed in most human gliomas. Imatinib mesylate exhibited antiglioma&#xD;
      activity in preclinical studies, sensitizes glioma cells to radiation injury, and combined&#xD;
      with hydroxyurea has shown promising results in the recurrent setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover gliomas are among the most angiogenic cancers. VEGF/VEGFR-2 is the most prominent&#xD;
      angiogenic signalling pathway. Its inhibition either by a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody,&#xD;
      anti-sense VEGF constructs, expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of VEGFR-2 (a&#xD;
      specific small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase) or neutralizing&#xD;
      anti-VEGFR-2 antibody has resulted in suppression of experimental malignant glioma growth.&#xD;
      VEGF has been the focus in the development of glioma-targeted therapies. Recently Bevacizumab&#xD;
      has shown to be active in phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, Sunitinib seems to be a promising treatment fo The objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to evaluate the clinical activity of Sunitinib as first line therapy in patients&#xD;
      who have measurable disease and to evaluate the safety of Sunitinib with radiation therapy.&#xD;
