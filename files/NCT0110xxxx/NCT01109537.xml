  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand the brain chemistry of people with Restless Legs&#xD;
      Syndrome (RLS). The primary hypothesis is that patients with RLS will have reduced GABA&#xD;
      levels in their Thalamus and elevated Glutamate levels in their Anterior Cingulate Cortex.&#xD;
      The study will use MRS imaging to examine the regional levels of these neurochemicals, GABA&#xD;
      and Glutamate, in the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a screening visit, a washout period for those taking RLS medications,&#xD;
      a night of actigraphy, an overnight polysomnogram, an MRI scan, and an MRS scan. The&#xD;
      polysomnography and MR scan visits will occur on consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent process for the study will be completed and a signed informed consent&#xD;
      form will be obtained. All subjects with RLS will undergo a clinical interview in order to&#xD;
      confirm or exclude an RLS diagnosis consistent with the International Restless Legs Syndrome&#xD;
      Study Group criteria and to determine the presence of any psychiatric or medical disorders.&#xD;
      The following study assessments will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLS) (RLS subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI) (RLS subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep Health Centers Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metal implant questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will have a urine pregnancy test and all subjects will have a urine sample for drug&#xD;
      screening collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the RLS group will be required to discontinue their RLS medications at least 48&#xD;
      hours prior to the PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
      An actigraph will be used to record limb movements of both legs the night before the PSG. The&#xD;
      actigraph will be worn from the subjects' bedtime until the subjects' final wake time&#xD;
      Subjects will also record their bedtime and wake time on the Actigraphy Data Form. Data from&#xD;
      the night of actigraphy will be used to monitor subjects' sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Polysomnography (PSG) The PSG will occur on the night prior to the MRS visit. The&#xD;
      time of lights out during all PSG sessions will be determined for each subject based on self&#xD;
      report of usual bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Channels will include an electroencephalograph (EEG), an electro-oculogram (EOG), a submental&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG), EMG of both anterior tibialis muscles (separate channels for each&#xD;
      leg), oral/nasal airflow, pulse oximetry, and respiratory effort. The PSG will be analyzed&#xD;
      for traditional sleep staging. Measures from the PSG will include Sleep Onset Latency (SOL),&#xD;
      Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), Sleep Efficiency (SE), N-REM and REM percentages, Periodic&#xD;
      Limb Movement Index (PLMI) and PLMs associated with arousal per hour of sleep (PLMAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: MR scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following visits 1 and 2, qualified subjects will undergo Magnetic Resonance brain scans the&#xD;
      Brain Imaging Center of McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA. Prior to MR scanning, subjects will&#xD;
      be questioned for a second time about the presence of metallic implants and fragments or any&#xD;
      other contraindications to MR imaging. They will be asked about recent alcohol, drug (licit&#xD;
      and illicit), and caffeine use. They will also be asked to provide a urine sample for drug&#xD;
      screening. Women will take a urine pregnancy test. Also, since brain GABA levels can be&#xD;
      affected by the menstrual cycle, women will be scheduled to have their MR scans during the&#xD;
      first portion of their menstrual cycle. Subjects will also be asked to complete the following&#xD;
      assessments before the MR scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRLS (modified)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (modified) (MOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Profile of Mood States (POMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Global Impression-Severity (PGI-S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 4T. In addition, in&#xD;
      accordance with the McLean Hospital Neuroimaging center guidelines, subjects will&#xD;
      additionally have a MR screening scan at either 1.5T or 3T. All MR recordings will be&#xD;
      obtained using parameters that are within FDA safety guidelines for exposure to static&#xD;
      magnetic fields, radio-frequency energy deposition, magnetic field switching rates and&#xD;
      acoustic noise levels. GABA and glutamate levels will be derived from MRS Scan at 4T.&#xD;
      Subjects will be in each scanner for approximately one hour. At the conclusion of each scan,&#xD;
      subjects will be queried regarding any adverse effects related to MR scans. The subject will&#xD;
      have completed the study at the conclusion of the MR scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the MRS at 4T, patients will complete a modified Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT).&#xD;
      During the SIT, the subjects will be asked by study staff to verbally rate the level of&#xD;
      discomfort in their legs on a scale from 1 (no discomfort) to 10 (extreme discomfort).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to make a rating in five minute intervals over one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case that MR scans on the 1.5T/3T and 4T MR scanners cannot be coordinated on the same&#xD;
      visit day at the McLean Brain Imaging center due to scheduling conflicts, the subject will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to return to McLean to have the remaining scan on a separate day.&#xD;
      Subjects will still be offered $50 for completion of each scan. Also, in the case that the&#xD;
      data collected during MR imaging is not usable (due to technical problems with the scanner,&#xD;
      excessive noise in the measurement, etc.), the subject may be contacted and offered a repeat&#xD;
      MRS scan on a separate date. Subjects will be compensated an additional $100 for completion&#xD;
      of such a repeat MRS scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Endpoints of this protocol are regional GABA and glutamate levels derived from 4T&#xD;
      MRS.&#xD;
