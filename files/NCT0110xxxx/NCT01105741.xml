    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major burden to individuals&#xD;
      and society. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) are the 2 major inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases (IBD). They share some pathologic and clinical features but overall their&#xD;
      pathogenesis is not resolved and diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The incidence rates range&#xD;
      from 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 person year for Crohn's disease to 2.2 to 14.3 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 person years for ulcerative colitis and prevalence ranges up to 201/100,000 for&#xD;
      Crohn's disease and up to 246/100,000 persons for ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Powerful biological therapies were recently introduced for the treatment of CD. They offer&#xD;
      superior treatment for the treatment of steroid refractory patients. Interestingly newer&#xD;
      studies suggest that these therapies might also be beneficial if not superior if used at&#xD;
      earlier stages of the disease. But presently limitations of these treatments need to be&#xD;
      considered and biomarkers that could better direct these treatments are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One present limitation is that these new therapies, though being beneficial in a large number&#xD;
      of CD patients, will not be beneficial to all CD patients. Presently treatment responders and&#xD;
      non-responders can not be identified prior to the treatment with the biological adalimumab&#xD;
      representing an important unmet clinical need. Since adalimumab treatment can be accompanied&#xD;
      by serious, potentially lethal, side effects, it would be a major advantage if future&#xD;
      biomarkers could predict whether an individual will or will not respond to one or the other&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore with treatments available being associated with high costs to patients and&#xD;
      society, as the treatment with adalimumab is, biomarkers that would help to identify&#xD;
      potential treatment-responders or non-responders would support their targeted use and would&#xD;
      be appreciated by all stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a method that generates comprehensive&#xD;
      metabolic profiles from human biofluids, and these metabolomic profiles may be useful to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers with discriminative and predictive power in CD. Thereby amongst other&#xD;
      factors serum metabolites are affected by inflammation and urine metabolites are affected by&#xD;
      gut flora and thus one or a combination of both may be a valuable tool in CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The investigators aim is to identify metabolomic predictors of clinical response to&#xD;
      adalimumab treatment in CD patients in order to direct future treatment to a group of&#xD;
      patients that is expected to benefit most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Metabolomic profiling together with the collection of clinical data will be&#xD;
      performed in patients with IBD prior to treatment with biological therapy and for up to 6&#xD;
      month thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study the investigators follow 50 patients with Crohn's Disease, naive to treatment&#xD;
      with biologics. Metabolomic profiling will be performed 1 week prior to the treatment with&#xD;
      adalimumab and then every 4 weeks for 6 month. In order to be reliable and reproducible,&#xD;
      sampling will be performed in the morning after an overnight fasting period. On the days of&#xD;
      serum/urine collection the following data will be collected: CBC, ESR, CRP, Calprotectin,&#xD;
      ASCA/pANCA, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ, Crohn's disease Activity Index, present medication and OTC,&#xD;
      Dietary and lifestyle history including 24 hour dietary recall, alcohol intake, smoking and&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify patterns in the metabolomic profile that&#xD;
      predict response or non-response to adalimumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize, IBD is a major burden to patients and society. Adalimumab treatment is helpful&#xD;
      in steroid refractory patients. Novel biomarkers that help physicians to decide which patient&#xD;
      might benefit from adalimumab treatment may be powerful tools to optimize directing these&#xD;
      powerful but expensive and side effect bearing therapies towards the patient that might&#xD;
      benefit most. Metabolomic profiling may be the tool that helps us to identify these patients.&#xD;
