&#xD;
          2. Patient's informed consent for &gt; or = 18 years of age before any assessment is&#xD;
             performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Parent or legal guardian's written informed consent and child's assent, if&#xD;
             appropriate, are required before any assessment is performed for patients &lt; 18 years&#xD;
             of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a diagnosis of CAPS: FCAS/FCU, MWS, or NOMID/CINCA&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body weight &gt; or = 15 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to communicate with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the&#xD;
             study (for children the parent can assist when necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient of childbearing potential (man or woman) and unwilling to use double barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception. It is required that double barrier method of contraception be&#xD;
             used (i.e. condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) by patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (man or woman) regardless of whether a hormonal agent is also&#xD;
             used as a method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to the start of the trial, during the trial&#xD;
             and up to 3 months following the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of significant medical conditions, which in the Investigator's opinion would&#xD;
             exclude the patient from participating in this trial (this can be discussed with&#xD;
             Novartis on a case by case basis in case of uncertainty).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical&#xD;
             classes&#xD;
&#xD;
