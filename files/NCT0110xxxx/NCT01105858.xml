      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Family and twin studies have suggested that genetic factors influence approximately 50&#xD;
      percent of a person's susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Recently, some of the genes involved&#xD;
      in the development of type 2 diabetes have been identified, in large part by genome-wide&#xD;
      association studies. Certain risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance, are highly inheritable, as are diabetic complications such as diabetes-related&#xD;
      eye and kidney disorders. However, few genes associated or linked with diabetes risk factors&#xD;
      or complications have been conclusively identified, and more research is needed to study&#xD;
      specific genetic factors associated with these aspects of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify and characterize genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, its risk&#xD;
      factors, and its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are not pregnant or nursing mothers at the start&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will provide information about family history, ethnicity and ethnic&#xD;
           background, occupation, behavioral risk factors, and other data as requested by the&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to a general health history, participants will provide specific information&#xD;
           about diabetes history, with particular emphasis on date of diagnosis, symptoms,&#xD;
           initiation of insulin therapy, complications, and current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing procedures will be different for individuals with and without diabetes. Those&#xD;
           without diabetes will have an oral glucose tolerance test, while those with diabetes&#xD;
           will be examined for diabetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests during the study will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination with measurements of height and weight, waist circumference, blood&#xD;
           pressure, and other tests for individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test for those who have not been classified as having diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retinal photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on the results of the examination and laboratory findings, participants may be&#xD;
           asked to return to the clinic for supplemental interviews, physical examinations, or&#xD;
           blood tests, or to arrange referrals for medical evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have diabetes will be asked to return for yearly follow-up visits.&#xD;
           Participants who do not have diabetes at the initial examination will be asked to return&#xD;
           for follow-up visits every 2 years.&#xD;

      Genetic factors play an important role in diabetes mellitus, its risk factors and&#xD;
      complications, but most of the specific genetic determinants remain unidentified. The&#xD;
      molecular pathways by which diabetes-susceptibility genes influence risk for diabetes and&#xD;
      related conditions are also largely unknown. This project will seek to identify, and quantify&#xD;
      the effects of, the genetic determinants of type 2 diabetes, its risk factors and&#xD;
      complications in a multiethnic sample. Diabetes and glycemic status will be assessed from&#xD;
      clinical interviews, an oral glucose tolerance test and glycated hemoglobin. Insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and insulin secretion will be assessed from indices derived from the oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test. Other potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes (e.g., obesity) and its&#xD;
      complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy) will be measured. DNA will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with or linked to diabetes or other traits.&#xD;
      Studies of gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiling will be performed,&#xD;
      and the resulting patterns will be analyzed for their relationships with diabetes, related&#xD;
      traits and variants in diabetes susceptibility genes. Individuals will be studied&#xD;
      longitudinally to determine if gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiles&#xD;
      predict development of diabetes or its complications. These studies will help to determine&#xD;
      the molecular pathways between genetic variants and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and its&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
