  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was determined to examine the relationship between the health literacy&#xD;
      scales of the patients who came to the smoking cessation clinic and their smoking cessation&#xD;
      success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient follow-up files registered in the archive of the smoking cessation clinic will be&#xD;
      scanned for the last 2 years and the demographic data and follow-up information of the&#xD;
      patients will be reached. Patients who have completed the 1-year follow-up period will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone, questioning whether they smoke or not, and will be invited to answer the&#xD;
      health literacy scale. Accepting patients will be divided into two groups as those who quit&#xD;
      smoking and those who cannot, and health literacy scales will be compared.&#xD;

    <description>The Turkish version of The European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU) Health Literacy Questionnaire scale (ASOY-TR) was used to measure health literacy. This scale consists of 47 questions. Each item has 4 degrees such that 1 = Very difficult, 2 = Difficult, 3 = Easy, 4 = Very easy. Code 5 is used for the expression &quot;I don't know&quot;. The total score that can be obtained from the scale is between 47-188. For the sake of ease of calculation, the total score is standardized with the following formula to take a value between 0-50.&#xD;
Formula = Index = (arithmetic mean-1) x [50/3] High score means better health literacy.</description>
