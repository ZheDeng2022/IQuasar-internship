  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell cancer that almost all patients eventually&#xD;
      relapse despite advancement in treatment strategies. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a&#xD;
      cell surface receptor that expressed primarily by malignant and normal plasma cells. This is&#xD;
      a single-arm that includes escalation phase and expansion phase ,Selinexor in Combination&#xD;
      withThalidomide and Dexamethasone to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients.To&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy and safety of Selinexor in combination with Thalidomide and Dexamethasone&#xD;
      in RRMM patients received at least one prior lines of therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm and open-label phase Ib/IIa study of Relapsed/Refractory Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma patients who have received at least one prior lines of treatment therapy;&#xD;
      Approximately 3-48 patients will be enrolled in the study. In dose escalation phase, patients&#xD;
      with RRMM will be treated with thalidomide 100mg/d, dexamethasone 20mg biweekly, and&#xD;
      escalating doses of oral ATG-010 weekly in a 3+3 design. ATG-010 dose level (DL) 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      are 60, 80 and 100mg respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a phase 2 expansion at the recommended dose level based on phase 1b trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This arm is 4 weeks per cycle and include a total of 12 cycles.Selinexor RP2D，Thalidomide&#xD;
      will be given at 100mg/d d1-28, and Dexamethasone 20 mg/d will be given on day 1,&#xD;
      2,8,9,15,16,22,23. If a patient develops partial intolerance to glucocorticoids (as&#xD;
      determined by the Investigator) during the study, a dose reduction of dexamethasone maximum&#xD;
      to 10 mg is permitted. If patients do not tolerate this dose, a potential discontinuation or&#xD;
      further dose reduction would be allowed.&#xD;

    <description>Selinexor (ATG-010# is a first-in-class, oral selective exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitor (1,2). Selinexor functions by binding with and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1 (also called CRM1), leading to the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins in the cell nucleus along with inhibition of translation of oncoprotein mRNAs.</description>
