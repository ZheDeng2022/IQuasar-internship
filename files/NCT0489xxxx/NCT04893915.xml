  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (Flu/Cy) and two infusions of&#xD;
      cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells at the previously defined maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      fourteen days apart. Low dose rhIL-2 will be administered to patients for in vivo expansion&#xD;
      following cell infusion. Patients will be assessed for anti-leukemic efficacy and safety.&#xD;
      Re-infusion of patients who relapsed after clinical response will be considered.&#xD;
