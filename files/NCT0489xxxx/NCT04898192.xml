      This study is aimed to detect severe fear of delivery and its association with the incidence&#xD;
      of obsessive-compulsive disorder and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the population of&#xD;
      pregnant women in the third trimester during the serious COVID-19 pandemic situation in&#xD;
      Slovakia. Data will be acquired from three departments of gynaecology and obstetrics of&#xD;
      University Hospital Bratislava. The majority of pregnancies from the region are managed in&#xD;
      this hospital; the total number of deliveries in 2020 achieved 7,835&#xD;

      The pregnancy is a risk factor for the first manifestation of several mental disorders.&#xD;
      Current serious pandemic situation and a constant risk of COVID-19 infection negatively&#xD;
      affects the mental state of the population, risk groups of pregnant women in particular. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to discover the incidence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder in association with the fear of delivery in current COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic conditions in Slovakia. We also decided to add a short tool for detection of&#xD;
      domestic violence among other scales to detect the incidence among Slovak pregnant&#xD;
      population. All pregnant women in their third trimester who visit the prenatal clinic for&#xD;
      their routine weekly check-up will be asked to participate in the study. The questionnaire&#xD;
      which comprises of validated mental scales will be handed out to the patients waiting for&#xD;
      their examination. After collection of filled questionnaires, those will be later paired with&#xD;
      patients' medical documentation and statistically evaluated. The questionnaires will be&#xD;
      collected during the period of 1.4.2021-31.3.2022 and statistical analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      in the period of 1.4.2022-1.8.2022. It is expected that approximately 1,500 women will be&#xD;
      included into the study. All three departments of gynaecology and obstetrics of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Bratislava will participate at the study. In total, approximately 7,800&#xD;
      deliveries a year are managed in the University Hospital Bratislava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following questionnaires are planned to be used in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire - aimed at fear of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASS (Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale) - aimed at anxiety in women before and after&#xD;
           delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PHQ-9-SK (Patient Health Questionnaire) - aimed at depressive disorder&#xD;
