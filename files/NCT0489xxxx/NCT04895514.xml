    <textblock>
      Study objective is to evaluate the outcomes of placing gamma-irradiated corneal tissue&#xD;
      (VisionGraft, CorneaGen, USA) within the cornea of patients with keratoconus, a procedure&#xD;
      called Corneal Tissue Addition for Keratoconus (CTAK).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using E gamma irradiated sterilized preserved corneal tissue, shaped corneal tissue inlays&#xD;
      are placed in a keratoconic cornea. Preserved corneal tissue is currently available&#xD;
      commercially from CorneaGen (VisionGraft,1200 6th Ave., STe.300, Seattle, WA 98101). Such&#xD;
      tissue is currently used in a number of eye surgical procedures. It is considered suitable&#xD;
      for corneal surgical procedures that do not require viable corneal endothelium, as is the&#xD;
      case for a tissue enhancement procedure in keratoconus. The goal of the current protocol to&#xD;
      evaluate the outcomes of placing gamma-irradiated preserved tissue within the keratoconic&#xD;
      cornea in order to enhance corneal thickness, stability, and optical conformation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For females: must not be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having topographic evidence of keratoconus which is graded as moderate or severe&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Severe Keratoconus: Axial topography consistent with keratoconus with marked&#xD;
                  areas of steepening, Maximum keratometry on Pentacam greater than or equal to&#xD;
                  56.01 D&#xD;
