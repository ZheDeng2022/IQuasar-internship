  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate OID hearing intervention on cognition among&#xD;
      patients who could vs. do utilize an OID. We will also evaluate the long-term effects of OID&#xD;
      use on secondary outcomes measures (hearing performance, quality-of-life, social interaction,&#xD;
      communication, physical functioning, etc)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impairment is highly prevalent and independently associated with cognitive decline.&#xD;
      Little is known about the various types, degrees, and configurations of hearing loss and how&#xD;
      it relates to uptake of a hearing intervention and possible long-term benefits of using the&#xD;
      intervention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      within an observational study design to determine the long-term effects of hearing&#xD;
      intervention, in the form of osseointegrated devices (OID), among patients with either&#xD;
      conductive, mixed, or single-sided hearing loss. Participants will be followed for 3 years&#xD;
      (36 months) to answer the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the effect of OID intervention versus no audiological intervention on rates&#xD;
      of decline in global cognitive function (primary outcome measure) in 18-85 year-old&#xD;
      well-functioning and cognitively-normal older adults with hearing loss. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      there will be a significant difference in cognitive function between patients that utilized&#xD;
      OID hearing intervention compared to no audiological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims: To compare the effect of OID intervention on secondary outcomes of hearing,&#xD;
      social, mental, physical, and cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that there are&#xD;
      significant differences in secondary outcomes between patients that utilized OID hearing&#xD;
      intervention compared to no audiological intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Ensuring Speech Understanding Test scores, evaluating a participants ability to hear the examiner during the Neurocognitive Test Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, five sentences are read aloud to the participant by a research staff member, and the participant is asked to repeat back the sentence. Participants are scored on the number of target words repeated back correctly (3 target words/sentence). This test contains 2 trials, Trial 1 and Trial 2, with Trial 2 only being completed if the score on Trial 1 is below the specified criteria. The total score for Trail 1 is 1 (one target word repeated correctly) to 15 (all target words repeated correctly). If a participant's score is 12 or less on Trial 1, Trial 2 will be administered using a slightly louder tone. Trial 2 contains 15 target words and the same scoring criteria as Trail 1. If the score on Trial 2 is 12 or less, the examiner will use a slightly louder tone while administering the neurocognitive test battery. This test guards against poor speech understanding from hearing loss directly confounding administration of neurocognitive tests with auditory stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Mini Mental State Exam scores, evaluating cognitive function ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>This test is a standardized instrument for screening a limited number of cognitive functions. The MMSE is used to exclude those with significant cognitive impairment at baseline, and as an outcome for tracking cognitive decline, and dementia. The MMSE is administered by interview and should be attempted in all participants. Scores range from 0 (no cognitive function questions answered correctly) to 30 (all cognitive function questions answered correctly).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Delayed Word Recall Test scores, evaluating verbal memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The DWRT is a measure of verbal memory that requires the participant to recall a list of 10 common nouns following a short delay. The participant is presented with a stimulus card for each of the 10 words. The examiner reads each word aloud, and asks the participant to repeat the word and use it in a sentence. This procedure is repeated, providing two exposures to the words. Following an approximate 5-minute delay, during which the (non-verbal) digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is given, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible. Scores range from 0 (no words recalled correctly) to 10 (all words recalled correctly).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores, evaluating psychomotor speed and sustained attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The DSST is a measure of psychomotor speed and sustained attention and also serves as a nonverbal distractor task, interposed between learning and recall for the Delayed Word Recall Test (DWRT). The participant is asked to translate numbers (1-9) to symbols using a key provided at the top of the test form. The participant is provided with a pencil (without an eraser). Instructions are provided in a deliberate and slow pace. One point is given for each correctly drawn symbol completed within the 90-second time limit. Scores range from 0 (no symbols correctly drawn) to 93 (all symbols correctly drawn).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Incidental Learning Test scores, evaluating non-verbal recent memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Incidental Learning Test was adapted from the WAIS-R NI and provides a non-verbal measure of recent memory. Following the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the participant is presented with the Incidental Learning Template. The participant is asked to write down as many of the DSST symbols as he/she can remember, in any order. Next, the participant is asked to write down the number that was paired with each of the symbols from the DSST. Two scores are yielded: 1) Free Recall: total number of symbols recalled, regardless of pairing and 2) Pairing: number of correct symbols correctly paired with corresponding numbers. Scores for each range from 0 (no symbols recalled, no symbols correctly paired to corresponding numbers) to 9 (all symbols recalled, all symbols correctly paired to corresponding numbers).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT A is a timed task in which participants connect numbers in sequence as quickly as possible. TMT measures attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual search and motor function. In the TMT A, the participant is asked to draw a line and connect a series of numbers (from 1-25) as quickly as possible. Prior to the test part, the participant is given a sample test to demonstrate the task. The score for TMT A is the number of seconds required to complete the task. Scores range from 1 (1 second to connect all numbers) to 240 (240 seconds to connect all numbers). A maximum of 240 seconds (4 minutes) and 5 errors is allowed. If a participant makes 5 errors, the test is stopped even if the participant has not reached the 240 second limit, and a score of 240 seconds is given.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B) scores, evaluating attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, visual search, and motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT Part B is a timed task in which participants connect letters and numbers in sequence as quickly as possible. The TMT measures attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual search and motor function. In the TMT B, the participant is asked to draw a line and connect a series of numbers and letters, alternating between a given number and letter (e.g., 1 to A, A to 2, 2 to B, B to 3, etc.) as quickly as possible. Prior to the test part, the participant is given a sample test to demonstrate the task. The score for TMT B is the number of seconds required to complete the task. Scores range from 1 (1 second to connect all numbers and letters) to 240 (240 seconds to connect all numbers and letters). A maximum of 240 seconds (4 minutes) and 5 errors is allowed. If a participant makes 5 errors, the test is stopped even if the participant has not reached the 240 second limit, and a score of 240 seconds is given.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on Logical Memory I and II scores, evaluating immediate and delayed verbal recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Logical Memory I and II provides a measure of immediate and delayed verbal recall for the number of ideas presented in two stories, which are read to the participant. Both stories are read to the participant, and after each story is presented, the participant is asked to recall as much of the story as possible. The Logical Memory I score is calculated as the average number of ideas recalled from Story A and B. Each story contains 25 scoring units, the maximum score is 25 (25+25/2). An approximate 20-minute delay follows, during which the remaining (non-memory) tests are administered. Following the delay period, the participant is again asked to recall the stories. The Logical Memory II score is calculated as the average number of story elements recalled from Story A and B. Scores range from 0 (no story elements correctly recalled) to 25 (all story elements correctly recalled).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to month 36 on SF36 Health Survey (SF-36) ratings, evaluating health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses health-related quality of life. It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. The SF-36 is the most widely-used health survey throughout the world because it is both brief and comprehensive, readily available, psychometrically-sound, and of proven usefulness in measuring health status and monitoring health outcomes. Eight domains of health can be estimated from the SF-36 (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, general mental health perception, role limitations due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, general health perception). Each domain is evaluated on a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best) with a global median of 50.</description>
