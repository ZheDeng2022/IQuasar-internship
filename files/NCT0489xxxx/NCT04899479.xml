  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to identify whether SGLT-2 inhibitor administration before and after coronary&#xD;
      intervention is effective in reducing the size of infarction and myocardial remodeling in&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and high risk of heart failure, and its&#xD;
      mechanism. For this reason, we compared cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) parameters&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes between the SGLT-2 inhibitor group and the control group to confirm the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a method to normalize&#xD;
      blood flow in the treatment of coronary artery disease, not only the technical aspects of&#xD;
      coronary intervention but also the devices and medications have been improved over the past&#xD;
      30 years. However, despite these advances, morbidity, and mortality of AMI are still high. In&#xD;
      particular, in patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), the 1-year mortality rate and&#xD;
      hospitalization rate due to heart failure are 10%, and 22%, respectively. Accordingly,&#xD;
      various efforts are being made to improve the prognosis of AMI and to reduce the infarct&#xD;
      size, which is a major prognostic factor. The most effective method for achieving this goal&#xD;
      to early and successful revascularization by PCI. However, restoring blood flow, which is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for relieving ischemia, can paradoxically cause damage to the myocardium and&#xD;
      death of the myocardium by itself. This phenomenon is called myocardial reperfusion injury.&#xD;
      Several pharmacological and mechanical treatments targeting this phenomenon have been&#xD;
      studied, and the experimental and small-scale clinical trials have been shown to have the&#xD;
      effect of reducing infarct size and relieving myocardium.4 However, to date, large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trials have not demonstrated clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibitors are developed to lower blood sugar and treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)&#xD;
      by inhibiting Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 in proximal renal tubule, releasing glucose&#xD;
      into the urine and preventing reabsorption. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors are known to have an&#xD;
      effect on lowering cardiovascular events in addition to lowering blood sugar. In three&#xD;
      large-scale, multicenter, randomized trials to evaluate the effects of SGLT-2 in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients, the combined outcome consisting of cardiac death or readmission due to&#xD;
      heart failure was significantly lowered compared to the placebo group. In particular,&#xD;
      DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial confirmed that this effect was consistent regardless of the history of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure.8 In addition, DAPA-CKD trial showed&#xD;
      that SGLT-2 inhibitor significantly reduced the composite outcome consisting of&#xD;
      cardiovascular death or readmission due to heart failure as well as the kidney-related&#xD;
      outcome compared to the placebo group in patients with chronic kidney disease regardless of&#xD;
      type 2 DM. Similarly, EMPEROR-Reduced and DAPA-HF trials consistently demonstrated that&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibitor was associated with significantly lower risk of a composite of&#xD;
      cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure in patients with heart failure with reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction. Therefore, the current guideline recommended the use of SGLT-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with a conjunction of&#xD;
      goal-directed medical therapy. Nevertheless, the mechanism that can explain this has been&#xD;
      extensively investigated, but it is not clear yet. Several potential hypotheses have been&#xD;
      proposed as mechanisms such as increased natriuresis, decreased blood pressure, decreased&#xD;
      inflammation, and decreased reactive oxidative stress. In this regard, it is anticipated that&#xD;
      the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors will benefit even in patients with AMI and high risk of heart&#xD;
      failure in both acute and chronic phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aimed to identify whether SGLT-2 inhibitor administration before and after&#xD;
      coronary intervention is effective in reducing the size of infarction and myocardial&#xD;
      remodeling in patients with AMI and high risk of heart failure, and its mechanism. For this&#xD;
      reason, we compared CMR parameters and clinical outcomes between the SGLT-2 inhibitor group&#xD;
      and the control group to confirm the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors.&#xD;
