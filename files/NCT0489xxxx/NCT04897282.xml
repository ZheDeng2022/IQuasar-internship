  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the efficacy and outcome of the UCRI (an&#xD;
      in-vitro diagnostics device in the form of a blood test and an algorithm) as a tool to detect&#xD;
      mucosal healing (level of inflammation in the colon) in people with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis treated with anti-TNFα. Another reason is to explore additional biomarkers&#xD;
      in blood, stool or voice to detect disease activity and/or mucosal healing. A tool to detect&#xD;
      the level of inflammation in the colon based on blood, stool or voice biomarkers may reduce&#xD;
      the need or the number of invasive endoscopic procedures. This is an observational study and&#xD;
      no treatment decision nor clinical intervention will be done based on results during this&#xD;
      study and all collected data will be used only for the goal of the study and for obtaining&#xD;
      FDA IDE for a follow-up study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the early stage of mucosal inflammation in patients with inflammatory Bowel Diseases&#xD;
      (IBD), neutrophils flood into intestinal mucosa, phagocytose pathogenic microbes, and promote&#xD;
      mucosal healing and resolution of inflammation. However, large numbers of neutrophils&#xD;
      infiltrating in the inflamed mucosa and accumulating in the epithelium cause damage of&#xD;
      mucosal architecture, compromised epithelial barrier and production of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators. Novel neutrophil-related serum markers are emerging in the literature and are&#xD;
      valid candidates to surrogate markers for mucosal healing (MH). NGAL is an anti-bacterial&#xD;
      protein, whereas MMP-9 is a protein with enzymatic activity towards extracellular matrix&#xD;
      (ECM) and non-ECM components, and is involved in cell signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By formation of a complex between NGAL and MMP-9, NGAL is thought to protect MMP-9 from&#xD;
      autodegradation. Cathelicidin LL37 is the 37 amino acids C-terminal part of human cationic&#xD;
      antimicrobial protein (hCAP)18 and acts as an antimicrobial protein (AMP). It is found in&#xD;
      lysosomes of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as well as keratinocytes and&#xD;
      plays a role in the early host response against invading pathogens via its broad-spectrum&#xD;
      anti-microbial activity. The expression of LL37 was found to be increased in the inflamed&#xD;
      mucosa of patients with UC and CD3. Moreover, increased colonic LL37 expression in&#xD;
      macrophages and epithelium was observed during colitis in UC patients. Chitinase 3 like 1&#xD;
      (CHI3L1), also known as YKL-40, is a 39 kDa secreted glycoprotein member of the glycosyl&#xD;
      hydrolase 18 family although it does not show chitotriosidase activity. It is secreted by&#xD;
      macrophages and neutrophils and acts as a growth factor for vascular endothelial cells and&#xD;
      fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous retrospective single-site study, consisting of serum samples and endoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation before and after anti-TNFa treatment from 176 moderate-to-severe UC patients and&#xD;
      75 healthy controls, showed that the combined use of these markers is statistically&#xD;
      significant and can accurately correlate with the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and identify&#xD;
      endoscopic response to infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADM. An algorithm, the Ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis Response Index (UCRI), a unit-less index ranging from 0 (likely a responder) to 10&#xD;
      (likely a non-responder) was constructed and identified accentually the anti-TNFa&#xD;
      non-responders' patients as measured by endoscopic assessment MES ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycominds, LLC (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) in support of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF) IBD&#xD;
      Venture will conduct this prospective multicenter longitudinal study in the U.S. Following&#xD;
      screening and patient enrollment based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria Imaging, blood&#xD;
      (serum) and fecal samples will be collected at certain predefined time points from bio naïve&#xD;
      (naïve) and from anti-TNFa previously exposed (exposed) active (MES &gt;2) UC patients that will&#xD;
      start an anti-TNFa treatment or switch from one anti-TNFa type to another (infliximab-IFX or&#xD;
      biosimilars, adalimumab-ADM, golimumab-GOM) at time of recruitment. Collected blood and stool&#xD;
      samples will be used to determine the accuracy and prediction value of the UCRI biomarker&#xD;
      panel and algorithm in comparison with endoscopic healing (measured as end point of MES ≤ 2)&#xD;
      and in comparison to fecal Calprotectin. The IFX/ADM/GOM treatment decision and endoscopic&#xD;
      evaluations before and after treatment initiation/switching will be done according to current&#xD;
      clinical practice and Sponsor will not have any influence or responsibilities on those&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
