      The aim of the study is to determine whether or not extra-sheath steroid injections are&#xD;
      inferior to intra-sheath steroid injections in the treatment of DeQuervain's Tenosynovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either the intra-sheath group or the extra-sheath group and&#xD;
      their pre-injection level of pain will be assessed using the visual analog scale. Appropriate&#xD;
      injections will then be administered by 1 of 3 UC Davis hand surgeons. Six weeks post&#xD;
      injection the patients will be reassessed using the visual analog scale and their score at 6&#xD;
      weeks will be compared to their pre-injection score.&#xD;

      Null Hypothesis: Extra-sheath steroid injections are inferior to intra-sheath steroid&#xD;
      injections in the treatment of DeQuervain's tenosynovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis:Extra-sheath steroid injections are not inferior to intra-sheath&#xD;
      steroid injections in the treatment of De Quervain's tenosynovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DeQuervain's Tenosynovitis is a common condition with an estimated incidence of 0.5% in men&#xD;
      and 1.3% in women, usually occurring in the third or fourth decade of life. The condition&#xD;
      involves accumulation of mucopolysaccharide in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist,&#xD;
      narrowing the passageway through which the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor&#xD;
      pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons pass(1). Patients typically present with pain over the radial&#xD;
      styloid that is often exacerbated by grasping, thumb abduction and ulnar deviation of the&#xD;
      wrist. The degree of pain can be measured using the visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS pain scale is a widely used test to effectively measure pain(9). The visual analog&#xD;
      scale we will be using is a 100mm horizontal line with no numbers and only written&#xD;
      descriptors on either end of the line. The written descriptor on the left side of the line&#xD;
      will be &quot;no pain&quot; and the descriptor on the right will be &quot;pain as bad as it could possibly&#xD;
      be&quot;. Patients will be instructed to make a mark on the line where they believe their current&#xD;
      pain fits. The patient's response will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the most effective treatment modality for this condition is ultrasound guided&#xD;
      injection of corticosteroids directly into the sheath where the APL and EPB pass. However, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that injecting corticosteroids outside the sheath will not be inferior. Our&#xD;
      rationale for this hypothesis lies in prior studies examining a similar approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of the related condition, trigger finger. Two separate studies compared the&#xD;
      efficacy of intra-sheath vs extra-sheath steroid injections in this condition and found that&#xD;
      extra-sheath injections were as effective as intra-sheath injections in the treatment of&#xD;
      trigger finger(7,8). These studies lay the groundwork for this approach in DeQuervain's,&#xD;
      however, no clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of intra-sheath versus&#xD;
      extra-sheath steroid injections for the treatment of DeQuervain's tenosynovitis have been&#xD;
      reported to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened and enrolled at their clinic visit at UC Davis Health Center.&#xD;
      Once the patient has qualified for the study, they will undergo either the intra-sheath or&#xD;
      extra-sheath steroid injection. Patient's will return for follow-up appointments at 6 weeks,&#xD;
      6 months and 1 year post injection. We estimate a 2.5 year enrollment period, followed by a&#xD;
      six-month data review period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine whether extra-sheath steroid injection is similarly&#xD;
      effective (i.e., noninferior) to intra-sheath steroid injection at improving pain. The study&#xD;
      sample size will be determined on the basis of an expected standard deviation of 14mm in the&#xD;
      primary outcome of pain improvement and a non-inferiority limit of 14mm. This expected&#xD;
      standard deviation was derived from previous trials that examined the efficacy of steroid&#xD;
      injections for DeQuervain's tenosynovitis (1). The non-inferiority boundary of 14mm was&#xD;
      selected based on a previously calculated minimum clinically important difference (MCID) on&#xD;
      the VAS pain scale of 14mm(5). The primary outcome of interest is the difference between&#xD;
      pre-injection and 6 weeks post-injection VAS scores in each group. Assuming a non-inferiority&#xD;
      test for the difference between two means, we find that a group sample size of 13 in the&#xD;
      intra-sheath and 13 in extra-sheath steroid injection group achieves 80% power to detect&#xD;
      non-inferiority using a one-sided two-sample t-test. The margin of non-inferiority is 14mm.&#xD;
      The true difference between the means is assumed to be 0. The significance level (alpha) of&#xD;
      the test is 0.050. The expected standard deviation is 14mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure we have an adequate number of patients to achieve significance for secondary study&#xD;
      endpoint analysis and allowing for a dropout rate of 15% we plan to enroll 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a double blinded randomized controlled trial with half of the subjects&#xD;
      randomized to receive intra-sheath injection and the other half receiving extra sheath&#xD;
      injection. After signing consent, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized into the study. The consenting researcher&#xD;
      will use a digital Randomizer application (&quot;Randomizer&quot;, available on all smart phones) to&#xD;
      assign the individual to either intra-sheath injection group or extra sheath injection group.&#xD;
      After being randomized, the study arm will be recorded at subject source document and&#xD;
      Enrollment Log. The signed consent will be scanned into the patient's electronic medical&#xD;
      record. The hard copy consents will be stored securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the injection will be ultrasound-guided and the injection solution will be&#xD;
      composed of 1ml of 1% lidocaine and 1ml (20mg) of dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intra-sheath injection group will have all fluid injected directly&#xD;
      into the APL/EPB sheath. In this group of patients, if subcompartments are found upon&#xD;
      ultrasound inspection half of the solution will be deposited into the APL sheath and the&#xD;
      other half will be deposited into the EPB subsheath, as previously described(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients randomized to the extra-sheath injection group, the injection will be given&#xD;
      surrounding the sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, pain will be measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      symptoms/disability will be measured using the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder&#xD;
      and Hand Questionnaire (quickDASH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH questionnaire is a 30 item test commonly administered to patients with upper&#xD;
      extremity disorders that allows them to self-assess the level of disability/symptoms&#xD;
      associated with their disorder(10). The shortened version (quickDASH) reduces the number of&#xD;
      test questions from 30 to 11. There are 5 answer choices for each item of the test and 10 out&#xD;
      of the 11 questions must be answered for the test to be considered valid. Based on the&#xD;
      patients answers to the questions, a score between 0 (no disability) and 100 (severe&#xD;
      disability) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results, including which group the patient was randomized to will be recorded and input&#xD;
      into the appropriate spreadsheet.&#xD;
