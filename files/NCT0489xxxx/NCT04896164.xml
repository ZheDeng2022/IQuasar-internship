  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is a very common complication in bone marrow transplant setting. It is a result of&#xD;
      injury to the gut caused by high dose chemotherapy. Currently there are no universal&#xD;
      protocols that have been accepted as a standard to prevent and treat mucositis in the&#xD;
      transplant setting. Post transplant upto 80% of patients suffer from a severe mucositis.&#xD;
      Proinflammatory cytokines play a major role in the development of mucositis. Interventions&#xD;
      that decrease the levels of these cytokines may be beneficial in preventing mucositis. This&#xD;
      study is aimed at evaluating the role of curcumin in reducing cytokine levels and the&#xD;
      incidence and duration of mucositis in patients undergoing autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is an inevitable side-effect of intensive conditioning therapy used for&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and affects the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      undergoing transplant. The incidence of oral mucositis (WHO grades 3/4 ) with certain&#xD;
      myeloablative conditioning regimens has been reported in up to 90% with range of severe&#xD;
      mucositis (WHO grade 3/4) from 10 to 78%. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-17, TNF-α, TGF-B, IFN-γ and certain prostaglandins play a central role in its&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Transcription factors such as NF-kappa B, modify the genetic expression of&#xD;
      these cytokines and enzymes which are critical in producing tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of agents and methods have been investigated to prevent or reduce mucositis in&#xD;
      transplant setting. Some of them are amifostine, caphasol, palifermin, cryotherapy,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine, glutamine, GM-CSF, histamine, misoprostol, laser therapy and traumeel, but&#xD;
      only palifermin and cryotherapy have shown significant benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin, polyphenol derivative with low toxicity profile, is commonly used in India for its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory actions. Curcumin inhibits various inflammatory cytokines through&#xD;
      inhibition of Nuclear Factor Kappa- β. It is derived from the plant Curcuma longa. In vitro&#xD;
      studies have shown potent anti-inflammatory activity at concentrations of 1 umol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted the first study evaluating the role of curcumin on oral mucositis&#xD;
      in transplant setting. In this pilot study (n=40), patients who received curcumin lozenges&#xD;
      (n=30) had decreased levels of salivary TGF-β, IL-17 and serum PGE2 compared to patients who&#xD;
      did not receive the curcumin lozenges (n=10). Patients who received the curcumin lozenges had&#xD;
      higher levels of serum IL-8 which is a prohealing cytokine. The incidence of grade 3 and 4&#xD;
      oral mucositis and diarrhea was less in those who received curcumin lozenges. Curcumin&#xD;
      lozenges were also well tolerated and none of the 30 patients who were administered curcumin&#xD;
      developed any treatment related grade 3/4 toxicity. This encouraging data is the basis of the&#xD;
      current phase III randomized study comparing curcumin lozenges to placebo, to assess the&#xD;
      ability of curcumin to reduce the incidence and duration of oral mucositis in patients&#xD;
      undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formulation being used is a Solip Lipid Curcumin microParticle (SLCP). The formulation is&#xD;
      developed by Pharmanza Herbals Pvt. Ltd., Gujarat, India. Gota et al reported a phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial of SLCP where upto 4 grams of the formulation containing 20-30% curcumin was&#xD;
      evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with high-risk osteosarcoma (Ref). The&#xD;
      SLCP formulation showed oral bioavailability of curcumin with linear pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
      Average peak plasma concentration of 41 ng/mL was observed at the highest dose level of 4g.&#xD;
      All doses were well tolerated and no adverse events were observed. Based on these&#xD;
      observations (on safety and bioavailability), and the reported anti-inflammatory properties&#xD;
      of curcumin, it was envisaged that it could be potentially useful for the prophylaxis and&#xD;
      treatment of oral mucositis following high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
