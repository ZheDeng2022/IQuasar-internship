      The objective is to evaluate the effect of the association of virtual reality sessions with&#xD;
      usual management on the cumulative consumption of morphine equivalent post-operatively in&#xD;
      adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who have undergone scoliosis surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;PICO G2 4k&quot; helmet from the Chinese manufacturer Pico which is an autonomous virtual reality helmet will be used.&#xD;
The sessions proposed last 20 minutes with a &quot;child pain&quot; protocol. The teenager will be able to choose his universe (forest, beach, mountain, aquatic, space), the voice that accompanies him (man, woman, none), the sound environment of music therapy (6 to choose from).&#xD;
Each patient in the experimental group benefits from a virtual reality program including two daily sessions during their stay in the continuing care unit from the first post-operative day until the third post-operative day. Each session is proposed by a nurse anesthetist from the pain team and trained in the proper use of the equipment.This virtual reality program will be added to the standard analgesic protocol for the experimental group.</description>
