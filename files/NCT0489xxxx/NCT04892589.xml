  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diseases that have implications for the thumb impact its function, and consequently, people&#xD;
      occupational performance. Carpometacarpal joint (CMC) thumb degeneration translates into&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA). Joint congruence, ligament integrity and compression of the joint&#xD;
      surfaces caused by muscle contraction have historically been considered the three basic&#xD;
      pillars for carpus stability. In recent years, a new factor has been proposed to explain&#xD;
      carpal stabilization mechanisms: proprioception. The dorsal ligament complex is the structure&#xD;
      with the highest concentration of mechanoreceptors, especially Ruffini's corpuscles. This&#xD;
      study aims to detect the effect of proprioceptive training on the functional recovery of&#xD;
      people with CMC osteoarthritis in conservative treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The carpometacarpal joint (CMC) of the thumb presents a paradoxical relationship between&#xD;
      mobility and stability that confers it a high mechanical complexity, and it is continuously&#xD;
      subjected to great efforts and repetitive movements during its use that lead to degenerative&#xD;
      changes in susceptible individuals. The thumb CMC join degeneration results in osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint congruence, ligament integrity, and compression of the articular surfaces caused by&#xD;
      muscle contraction have historically been considered the three basic pillars for carpal&#xD;
      stability. In recent years, a new factor has been proposed to explain carpal stabilization&#xD;
      mechanisms: proprioception. All afferents originating from the thumb mechanoreceptors&#xD;
      constitute thumb proprioception. The dorsal ligament complex is the structure with the&#xD;
      highest concentration of mechanoreceptors, especially Ruffini's corpuscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, in conservative treatments, orthotic positioning is paramount. This study aims&#xD;
      to detect the effect of proprioceptive training on the functional recovery of people with CMC&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, from the comparison of a classic conservative orthotic treatment protocol vs.&#xD;
      a conservative orthotic treatment protocol including exercises for proprioceptive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial is proposed within a multicenter study involving the Clínica&#xD;
      Universitaria Reina Fabiola, Argentina and the Centro Tecan. Clínica de la Mano, Spain. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into a control group that will receive orthosis treatment; and an&#xD;
      experimental group that will also receive a home proprioceptive exercise program. Pain will&#xD;
      be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale; functional capacity with the Australian Canadian&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Hand Index Version Functional Subscale; Occupational Productivity Performance&#xD;
      with the Canadian Measure of Occupational Performance; and proprioception with the Joint&#xD;
      Position Sense Test. Follow up: at 30 days and at 90 days. 50 patients will participate.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for pain assessment which is used frequently for clinical and research purposes. It consists of a 10-cm line anchored at each end. The left-hand anchor reads 'no pain' score 0 and the right-hand anchor reads 'worst possible pain' score 10; the patients marked a line to represent their pain level.</description>

    <description>To assess the affection of the hands in rheumatic diseases, with good discriminatory capacity The functional capacity assessment subscale will be used, which provides specific data on the subject's ability to open / close water taps; turn the door handles / knobs; buttoning up; fastening / unbuttoning jewelry; open a new bottle; load a full pot; peel fruits and vegetables; lift large and heavy objects; wring out wet clothes / sponges or rags. This functional subscale evaluates from 9 to 45, with 9 being &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 45 &quot;extreme difficulty&quot;</description>

    <description>Proprioception using active joint position sense (JPS) has been utilized in studies to establish a correlation between therapy intervention and proprioception. The target position of 30 degree CMC abduction will be selected. Joint angle will be measured using a standard clear plastic goniometer.</description>

The COPM enables subjects to identify goals for hand therapy and engage in a subject-specific therapeutic process.
