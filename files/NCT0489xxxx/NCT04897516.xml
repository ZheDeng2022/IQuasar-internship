  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in much of&#xD;
      Latin America and affects people throughout the world. Currently treatment with the only two&#xD;
      drugs effective against the infection, benznidazole and nifurtimox, has significant&#xD;
      limitations including frequent adverse effects in adult patients. However, timely treatment&#xD;
      is key to achieving global objectives of controlling the disease. The standard treatment has&#xD;
      a long duration (60 days). NuestroBen will test the hypothesis that a shorter treatment&#xD;
      regimen of 14 days will be non-inferior to the standard 60-day treatment while improving the&#xD;
      safety profile.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease is a vector-borne parasitic infection affecting an estimated 6 million people&#xD;
      worldwide. Very few people have been able to access antiparasitic treatment for the disease,&#xD;
      and about 20% of those who do initiate treatment are unable to complete it due to the long&#xD;
      duration (2 months) and side effects associated with the current regimen. Benznidazole is one&#xD;
      of only two drugs with proven efficacy against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes&#xD;
      the disease. An earlier Phase 2 clinical trial, BENDITA, indicated 89% of 30 patients treated&#xD;
      with a shorter (2-week) regimen of benznidazole maintained sustained parasite clearance after&#xD;
      12 months of follow-up, with no discontinuations of treatment due to side effects. The&#xD;
      current study will evaluate the shorter treatment regimen with benznidazole in a Phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial. NuestroBen will assess the efficacy and safety of a 2-week regimen of BZN&#xD;
      (300 mg daily), compared to the standard treatment of BZN 5mg/kg/day or 300-400 mg daily&#xD;
      fixed doses for 8 weeks based on historical controls, in terms of reducing and eliminating&#xD;
      the T. cruzi parasite in adults in the chronic phase of Chagas disease with no proven&#xD;
      pathology. Efficacy will be measured through conversion from positive to negative&#xD;
      parasitaemia according to the results of qualitative PCR tests from the end of treatment, and&#xD;
      up to 12 months of follow-up from the beginning of treatment. Safety will be compared&#xD;
      according to the frequency and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
