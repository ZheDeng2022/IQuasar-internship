  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, parallel-controlled study, for evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of sequential immunization of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (adenovirus&#xD;
      type 5 vector) in Chinese healthy adults aged 18-59 years after the priming vaccination of&#xD;
      inactivated vaccine. 300 healthy subjects aged 18-59 years will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
      Of them, 200 subjects who have been vaccinated with two dose of inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine&#xD;
      will be recruited and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a booster dose of inactivated&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Ad5 vectored vaccine at 3~6 months later. Other&#xD;
      100 subjects who have been vaccinated with one dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a booster dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccine or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Ad5 vectored vaccine at 1~3 months later. The occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events within 28 days and serious adverse events within 6 months after vaccination&#xD;
      will be observed. In addition, blood samples will be collected on day 0 before the boosting&#xD;
      with ad5 vectored vaccine and on day 14, 28 and month 6 after the boosting. Serum antibody&#xD;
      levels, cellular immune responses and the subgroups or germlines of the specific B cells will&#xD;
      be analyzed. Each subject will remain in this study for approximately 6 months.&#xD;
