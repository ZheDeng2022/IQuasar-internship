    <textblock>
      Rectal prolapse is a medical condition where rectum is protruding through the anal opening.&#xD;
      The treatment is by surgery that can be performed with an anterior approach through the&#xD;
      abdomen or a posterior perineal approach. The condition is more common in elderly patients&#xD;
      and much more common in women compared to men. All used surgical techniques have advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if an abdominal or perineal&#xD;
      surgical approach is best to correct a rectal prolapse. The outcome measures will be&#xD;
      validated questionnaires on quality of Life (SF-36) and bowel function (modified Wexner&#xD;
      incontinence score) as well as recurrence of the rectal prolapse and surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized multicenter trial with a 2x2 factorial design. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized between perineal and abdominal approach in a first randomization and the perineal&#xD;
      group will then further be randomized into one of two specific operations (delorme or&#xD;
      altemeier) and the abdominal group will be further randomized into suture rectopexy or&#xD;
      resection rectopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for 3 months, 1 year and 3 years and a longterm follow up of up&#xD;
      to 17 years for recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Full thickness rectal prolapse, or procidentia, is a benign but distressing&#xD;
      condition. It is defined as the circumferential protrusion of all layers of the rectal wall&#xD;
      through the anal sphincters. The annual incidence is 2,5 per 100 000, predominantly in the&#xD;
      elderly, and male-to-female ratio is about 1:6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 100 different procedures have been described for surgical treatment of rectal&#xD;
      prolapse and consensus has not yet been reached. Traditionally, perineal procedures have been&#xD;
      reserved for older patients who are not fit for an abdominal operation. The two most common&#xD;
      perineal procedures are Delorme's operation, i.e. mucosectomy and rectal plication, and&#xD;
      perineal rectosigmoidectomy, also known as Altemeier's operation, which is a full-thickness&#xD;
      excision of the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choices between abdominal vs. perineal approach and resection or not were all addressed&#xD;
      in the Swedish rectal prolapse trial with possible differences in bowel function, quality of&#xD;
      life, recurrence rate and complications as end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and randomization This was a multicenter randomized trial with a 2 x 2 factorial&#xD;
      design conducted in 13 sites in Sweden. At inclusion, patients signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form and the attending surgeon contacted the central trial office at the Danderyd Hospital,&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden. Randomization was performed with randomly assigned envelopes, stratified&#xD;
      for each participating center. Patients were randomized between perineal and abdominal&#xD;
      approach (A). The perineal group was further randomized to Delorme's or Altemeier's procedure&#xD;
      (B) and the abdominal group to suture rectopexy or resection rectopexy (C). Patients who were&#xD;
      considered unsuitable for random allocation to a perineal or an abdominal procedure were&#xD;
      included only in (B) or (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation and procedures All patients were clinically examined and diagnosed&#xD;
      with full thickness rectal prolapse. Further examinations with endoscopy, colon transit&#xD;
      studies, anorectal manometry, defecography, endoanal ultrasound and pudendal nerve motor&#xD;
      latency were optional and were performed as indicated at each surgeon's discretion. Operative&#xD;
      procedures were described in the study protocol, see appendix. Abdominal procedures were&#xD;
      performed laparoscopically or as open procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to validate data all questionnaires were gathered at the central trial hospital and&#xD;
      inspected by a second researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedures were identified and standardized to a large extent. Both minimal&#xD;
      invasive and open surgery were allowed. For example the abdominal procedures were described&#xD;
      that mobilization of rectum should be done in the posterior aspect, the lateral ligaments&#xD;
      should not be divided, Suture rectopexy should be done with non-absorbable 0.0 sutures, the&#xD;
      cul de sac should not be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to 220 patients in the first randomization between abdominal&#xD;
      and perineal approach. With 220 patients a difference in recurrence of 13% could be&#xD;
      identified with 90% power in a significance level of 5%. The plan was to analyze the&#xD;
      categorical variables with either Fisher´s exact test or multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A main study office was situated at Danderyd Hospital and randomization was done from this&#xD;
      office at the time when the patient was scheduled for surgery. All hospitals performing&#xD;
      surgery for rectal prolapses in Sweden were invited to the study.&#xD;
