    <textblock>
      The national french survey &quot;Mental health in general population&quot;, showed that the risk of&#xD;
      suicide was significantly increased during exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE),&#xD;
      with an increasing gradient depending on the psychological impact. This included not only&#xD;
      people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but also those confronted with PTE,&#xD;
      presenting or having presented phenomena of reviviscence or at least an element of&#xD;
      psychopathological impact. This risk could concern 30.2% of the population over the entire&#xD;
      lifetime. Internationally, recent reviews of the literature tend to show that victims of&#xD;
      interpersonal violence are more at risk of suicide (OR 1.99 95% CI: 1.73-2.28). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the literature remains heterogeneous, the definitions vague and the temporal proximity of the&#xD;
      violence little taken into account. It is therefore a large-scale phenomenon that remains&#xD;
      little explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase our knowledge in this area, we will focus on patients treated by Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Psychological Cells (CUMP), that is victims of disasters, accidents involving a large&#xD;
      number of victims or events that may have significant psychological repercussions due to the&#xD;
      circumstances surrounding them.&#xD;

      The national french survey &quot;Mental health in general population&quot;, showed that the risk of&#xD;

&#xD;
      To increase our knowledge in this area, we will focus on patients treated by Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Psychological Cells (CUMP), that is victims of disasters, accidents involving a large&#xD;
      number of victims or events that may have significant psychological repercussions due to the&#xD;
      circumstances surrounding them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate the prevalence of suicide risk 30 days after exposure to a potentially traumatic&#xD;
      event, in people treated by a CUMP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives aim to identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main psychiatric disorders at 30 days (depressive disorders, bipolar disorders,&#xD;
           panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, disorder linked to the consumption of alcohol&#xD;
           or other substances, psychotic disorders, eating disorders)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of death by suicide 1 year after the trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence of suicide attempts 1 year after the trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The incidence of suicidal ideation 1 year of trauma Prognostic factors of mortality by&#xD;
           suicide, suicide attempts or suicidal ideation will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of 215 individuals would give a precision of ± 5% to a point estimate equal to 15%&#xD;
      of the prevalence of suicide risk at 30 days. Assuming a 10% refusal rate to participate in&#xD;
      the follow-up visit, this number should be increased to 240 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number of 215 patients would give 80% power to a logistic regression model of the binary&#xD;
      primary endpoint (Y, risk of suicide at 30 days) on a binary independent variable (X) in the&#xD;
      presence of a binary covariate (Z). to detect, with an alpha risk of 0.05, an odds ratio&#xD;
      equal to 2.50. This number is calculated under the assumption of a baseline risk for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint Y of 0.15, the independence of observations, a prevalence of the independent&#xD;
      variable X of 50%, a prevalence the covariate Z of 50% and an odds ratio of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint Y associated with the covariate Z of 1.50. This number is calculated for a&#xD;
      two-tailed Wald test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that our study could have a real impact on CUMP practices and suicide risk&#xD;
      prevention. In fact, the CUMP represents an original device and the context of the emergency&#xD;
      and support groups may overlook the risk of suicide for some patients. In addition, there is&#xD;
      currently no systematic monitoring planned within the CUMPs. It is therefore an innovative&#xD;
      and particularly topical subject that could change clinical practices but also the&#xD;
      organization of the healthcare offer. Indeed, several treatment centers for psychotrauma are&#xD;
      currently being deployed at the national level (including a center in Lyon, within the&#xD;
      Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL)) and an important work of coordination of treatment structures&#xD;
      is in progress.&#xD;

        Patients fulfilling the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and having signed the consent&#xD;
        will be included. Within 30 days (± 5 days), an appointment, by videoconference, will be&#xD;
        made by the CUMP of the Grenoble center for the completion of the MINI scale and screening&#xD;
        for suicidal behavior. This interview will be carried out either with the psychiatrist or&#xD;
        the psychologist or with the psychiatric resident. If the patient does not answer, the&#xD;
        trusted third party or the attending physician will be contacted by telephone in order to&#xD;
        investigate the causes or to detect a possible death by suicide. The patient will be&#xD;
        followed up one year after inclusion by telephone to detect the number of suicide attempts&#xD;
        and/or death.&#xD;
