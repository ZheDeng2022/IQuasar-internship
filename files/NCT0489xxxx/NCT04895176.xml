      Single-cohort retrospective study evaluating the incidence and prognostic markers of heart&#xD;
      failure following acute coronary syndrome treated by percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the most common cause of heart failure (HF) world-wide.&#xD;
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has deeply improved short and long-term&#xD;
      survival after ACS, but his impact on incidence of downstream heart failure still remains&#xD;
      unclear and heart failure after ACS represents the major driver of late morbidity, mortality&#xD;
      and healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many predictors and determinant of heart failure after MI have been evaluated, however, to&#xD;
      date, the optimal combination of parameters to predict heart failure after MI needs to be&#xD;
      defined and very little is known about the prognostic markers in unstable angina setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to show the incidence of heart failure after acute coronary artery syndrome, and the&#xD;
           relation between the type of ACS and following incidence of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to clarify which features could be routinely identified as prognostic markers. This&#xD;
           study is a multi-center non-randomized, single-cohort retrospective study including&#xD;
           consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome treated by percutaneous coronary&#xD;
           intervention between 2017 and 2019, without known previous heart failure (baseline EF &gt;&#xD;
           40% and no medical therapy with loop diuretics), with at least 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to anticipate that the main findings of the present study will fill&#xD;
      fundamental knowledge gaps regarding incidence of heart failure following coronary events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among this, the study could suggest specific clinical and epidemiological features related to&#xD;
      the risk of development of HF, leading to a better medical treatment and reducing risk for&#xD;
      further hospitalizations.&#xD;
