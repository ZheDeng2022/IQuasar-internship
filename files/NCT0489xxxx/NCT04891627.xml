  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia caused by defects in insulin secretion or insulin resistance. With the&#xD;
      progressive deterioration of the beta cells with the addition of insulin resistance, this&#xD;
      chronic metabolic disease occurs.(1) It has been shown that poor glycemic control predisposes&#xD;
      to periodontal disease, and there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease&#xD;
      and DM.(2) The common pathogenic mechanism between diabetes and periodontal disease is due to&#xD;
      increased production of various inflammatory mediators such as matrix metalloproteases,&#xD;
      RANKL, prostaglandin E2, cytokines and chemokines.(3,4) Currently there is no data&#xD;
      relationship between CSF-1 and IL-34, periodontal disease and diabetes.The aim of this study&#xD;
      was three stage: First, to assess GCF levels of IL-34 and CSF-1 in stage III and grade C&#xD;
      periodontitis (SIII-GC-P) patients with and without T2DM. Second, to compare these molecules&#xD;
      levels in GCF with systemically-periodontally healthy (H) individuals. Third, to investigate&#xD;
      the correlation between biochemical parameters and clinical parameters.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria for H groups consisted of individuals with clinically healthy gingiva on a&#xD;
      stable periodontium who had a bleeding on probing (BOP) score of less than 10% and probing&#xD;
      depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm and showed no clinical attachment loss (CAL) or radiographic bone loss.&#xD;
      Individuals who did not have systemic disease with at least 20 permanent teeth were included&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for SIII-GC-P patients were based on the new classification published in&#xD;
      2017.23,24,25 Individuals with an interdental CAL ≥ 5 mm, PPD ≥ 6 mm with radiographic bone&#xD;
      destruction continuing to the middle or apical part of the root and a maximum loss of 4 teeth&#xD;
      because of periodontitis were considered as group of SIII periodontitis (in 30% and more&#xD;
      regions). During the diagnosis of periodontitis, care was taken that CAL did not originate&#xD;
      from gingival recession of traumatic origin, tooth decay extending to the cervical of the&#xD;
      tooth, CAL seen in the distal of the second molar associated with the extraction or&#xD;
      malposition of the third molar, lesion in the marginal periodontium of endodontic origin, or&#xD;
      vertical root fracture. Radiographic bone destruction was assessed from the tooth, which&#xD;
      demonstrated the very serious bone destruction as a proportion of root length. If there is&#xD;
      rapid bone loss compared to the biofilm and the % of root bone loss /age &gt; 1.0; it was&#xD;
      determined as GC periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for T2DM patients were based on the American Diabetes association&#xD;
      published in 2010. Individuals to the T2DM group; It was selected from individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with T2DM for more than 5 years by their own physicians according to daily plasma glucose&#xD;
      (200 mg / dl) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6.5%).26 Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and&#xD;
      presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) were measured at four sites.27,28,29 Probing depth (PD)&#xD;
      and attachment loss (AL) were used during the clinical periodontal assessment at six sites&#xD;
      per tooth except the third molar. All periodontal assessments were conducted with a manual&#xD;
      probe (Williams, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) by an experienced calibrated periodontist (AD)&#xD;
      masked to the groups. Tooth loss due to periodontitis was also evaluated with the&#xD;
      participants' own reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AL and PD were measured in ten periodontitis patients who were not included in the study for&#xD;
      a calibration exercise. Intra-examiner reliability of the parameters was achieved by&#xD;
      obtaining intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.86 for PD and 0.84 for CAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking GCF samples GCF samples were collected in the morning hours 24-48 h after the clinical&#xD;
      periodontal evaluation. GCF was obtained from the buccal part of the interdental area of&#xD;
      single rooted teeth using paper strips (Periopaper; Proflow). In periodontal healthy control&#xD;
      group, GCP was obtained from the regions without BOP and inflammation, whereas in the&#xD;
      periodontitis group, GCF was accumulated from the regions where the most radiographic bone&#xD;
      loss and PD were observed. After the existing plaque was removed with a sterile curette, the&#xD;
      region was insulated with cotton rolls and air-dried, and then the paper strip was placed in&#xD;
      the gingival sulcus and left for 30 s to absorb the fluid. Paper strips infected with oral&#xD;
      fluids were not included in the study. The paper strips were moved to sterile tubes and&#xD;
      maintained at -40°C until analyses.&#xD;
