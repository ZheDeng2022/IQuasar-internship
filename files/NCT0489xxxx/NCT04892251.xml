  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial aims to assess the preliminary efficacy of ketamine as an adjunct&#xD;
      for a mindfulness-based intervention for opioid use disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a Stage 1 randomized controlled trial to test a&#xD;
      potential optimization of the evidence-based Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE)&#xD;
      intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD). Here we will add Ketamine to MORE (MORE+KAP) and&#xD;
      test the MORE+KAP intervention versus the standard MORE intervention in a sample of patients&#xD;
      receiving medications for OUD (MOUD; e.g, buprenorphine). The primary aim to is evaluate the&#xD;
      extent to which MORE+KAP improves OUD treatment relative to MORE. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      identify the psychobiological mediators of MORE+KAP.&#xD;
