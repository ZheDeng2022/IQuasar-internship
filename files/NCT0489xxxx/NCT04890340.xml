  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study Objective is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the liquid biopsy system versus&#xD;
      the gold standard mammography (or MRI, or Ultrasound) diagnosis in patients with suspected&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women of the required age group, in case of suspicion of breast cancer, are sent to clarify&#xD;
      the diagnosis for mammography or ultrasound of the mammary glands, or MRI. Based on the&#xD;
      results of these studies, a biopsy is prescribed to make a final diagnosis. Before a biopsy&#xD;
      to diagnose the presence / absence of breast cancer, patients do the blood sampling one time.&#xD;
      The blood is processed in the Sponsor's laboratory. The test results are compared with the&#xD;
      data obtained from the biopsy. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the method will be&#xD;
      determined on the basis of the obtained data on the sensitivity and specificity of the test&#xD;
      in relation to the reference method.&#xD;

the absolute total number of matches between the results of the test system and mammography based on histological confirmation of the diagnosis;&#xD;

the specificity of the test by groups, particularly: the ratio of the number of true-negative test results to the total number of patients in the group with no character. A group of samples from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer will be divided into 4 subgroups depending on the biological subtype of cancer identified on the basis of IHC analysis (luminal A, luminal B, HER2/neu, triple negative), also for the subgroups obtained the primary measured values will be calculated to identify these quantities based on the biological subtype of breast cancer.</description>

      ARNA technology in general and the ARNA Breast test in particular are performed in a&#xD;
      specialized laboratory. The courier service ships whole blood from the Clinic to the&#xD;
      Laboratory. Thus, direct contact of the patient with the reagents does not occur, which&#xD;
      increases the safety of the system. Plasma will be isolated from the sample in the&#xD;
      Laboratory. Plasma is processed with a set of reagents, including inorganic and organic&#xD;
      solutions and sets of specially synthesized biological components (oligonucleotides), for&#xD;
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the content of DNA fragments of&#xD;
      selected oncological genes in a woman's blood plasma. The remaining plasma will be kept&#xD;
      frozen for retests upon request. Samples will be not transferred to other countries.&#xD;
