    <textblock>
      The aim of CABOTEM study is to demonstrate the safety and activity of the Cabozantinib and&#xD;
      Temozolomide combination in Lung and GEP-NENs patients, progressing after a first line&#xD;
      therapy, including target therapies (everolimus, sunitinib) and / or chemotherapy, in the&#xD;
      approved setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, mainly originating&#xD;
      from the gastro-entero-pancreatic system and the lung. Molecular targeted therapy of NENs&#xD;
      with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved for GEP-Lung NENs and with the&#xD;
      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (multiTKI) sunitinib (VEGFR, PDGFR, KIT) for PAN-NENs. There&#xD;
      is still an unmet need for further medical therapies including novel targeted therapies, the&#xD;
      knowledge of the data on the role of the sequences of the therapies and the definition of new&#xD;
      biological predictors of outcome and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib targets VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, and RET. Cabozantinib is an oral, potent&#xD;
      inhibitor of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and&#xD;
      RET that produces robust antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and antiinvasive effects in&#xD;
      preclinical models. It has been shown to improve outcomes in advanced renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      patients in both the first-line and second-line settings and is also approved for&#xD;
      progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that activation of the MET signalling pathway may also play a&#xD;
      role in the growth of neuroendocrine tumours. Increased expression of MET correlates with&#xD;
      decreased overall survival in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. In preclinical pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumour models, various multi-TKIs with combined anti-VEGF and anti-MET&#xD;
      efficacy have shown enhanced angiogenesis inhibition, as well as suppression of tumour&#xD;
      invasion and metastasis . Given the strong theoretical rationale for combining anti-VEGF and&#xD;
      anti-MET activity in neuroendocrine tumours, in USA will start randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      phase III trial, named CABINET to evaluate the effects in terms of PFS in patients with&#xD;
      advanced neuroendocrine tumours after progression on everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an on-going clinical trial, Chan et al. showed, in patients with progressive, well&#xD;
      differentiated, grade 1-2 carcinoid and treated with cabozantinib 60 mg po qd and without&#xD;
      limit to prior therapy, 21.8 mo (95% CI, 8.5-32.0 mo) of mPFS in pts with pNET and 31.4 mo&#xD;
      (95% CI, 8.5 mo-NR) in pts with carcinoid . In this study pNET achieved PR (ORR 15%, 95% CI&#xD;
      5-36%); 15/20 had SD. 6/41 pts with carcinoid achieved PR (ORR 15%, 95% CI 7-28%); 26/41 had&#xD;
      SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The front-line treatment of advanced NENs depends on many clinical and pathological factors&#xD;
      but there are no standard second-line therapies when the disease progress. Although data for&#xD;
      temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemotherapy are still evolving, this treatment may replace&#xD;
      STZ-based regimens in PAN-NENs due to its better tolerability and side effect profile. In&#xD;
      addition, there is evidence that TMZ could also be used in the subgroup of&#xD;
      well-differentiated G3 NETs. There is less clear-cut evidence of a benefit for chemotherapy&#xD;
      in intestinal NETs, but still evolving data suggest that TMZ may be efficacious in particular&#xD;
      patients. In our experiences, an intermittent schedule of metronomic TMZ is effective and&#xD;
      safe in patients with advanced progressive G2-G3 NEN, showing to be a feasible second line&#xD;
      treatment in this setting. This schedule has been also investigated by Chan et al. in 34&#xD;
      patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors demonstrating a good safety profile. D.Shiff et&#xD;
      al. demonstrated that cabozantinib at a dose of 40/60 mg daily plus TMZ for patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed high-grade glioma was generally well tolerated even with the addition of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and also demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interactions with concurrent TMZ. Both&#xD;
      mRNA and protein levels of c-Met were significantly associated with tumour grade progression&#xD;
      and inversely correlated with overall and progression-free survival in high-grade gliomas.&#xD;
      c-Met seems an independent prognostic marker in glioblastoma patients and further analysis in&#xD;
      vitro revealed that downregulating the expression of c-Met dramatically inhibited cell&#xD;
      migration and invasion capacities, enhanced sensitivity to TMZ chemotherapy . Cabozantinib&#xD;
      downregulating c-MET pathway can induce, in addition to antiangiogenic and antiproliferative&#xD;
      effects, also an increased sensitivity to Temozolomide.&#xD;
