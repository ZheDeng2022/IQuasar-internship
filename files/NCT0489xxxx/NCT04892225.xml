    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial will be conducted in which effect of behavioral intervention&#xD;
      (Text message of dietary salt and fluid restriction) on inter-dialytic weight gain in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this is to evaluate the efficacy of a technology&#xD;
      supported intervention for reducing inter-dialytic weight gain and dietary sodium intake in&#xD;
      patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mortality among hemodialysis (HD) patients remains high with cardiovascular causes accounting&#xD;
      for more than one-third of mortality in incident and prevalent end-stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      patients. One factor contributing to poor cardiovascular outcomes is chronic volume overload&#xD;
      ,which is a function of excess fluid intake in relation to residual renal function and fluid&#xD;
      removal with dialysis treatments. Interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) is an easily measurable&#xD;
      parameter in the dialysis unit, routinely assessed at the beginning of the dialysis session.&#xD;
      Very few studies have been designed to determine the direct effect of IDWG on morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Any such effect is confounded by residual renal function and various&#xD;
      comorbidities, the effects of which might be difficult to separate from those of IDWG. Most&#xD;
      attempts to control IDWG have concentrated on requiring patients to reduce fluid and dietary&#xD;
      salt intake. Inter-dialytic weight gain is the result of salt and water intake between 2&#xD;
      hemodialysis sessions. Interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) is commonly used as an indirect&#xD;
      measure of fluid intake in HD patients, while considering the daily urine output of the&#xD;
      patient. It is used along with clinical symptoms and signs and predialysis blood pressure&#xD;
      readings to make decisions regarding the amount of fluid removal during a dialysis session.&#xD;
      IDWG is also used as a basis for fluid and salt intake recommendations. High IDWG has&#xD;
      detrimental effects on survival, cardiovascular outcomes, and quality of life. A higher IDWG&#xD;
      is associated with higher predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure ,uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension which contributes to left ventricular hypertrophy, increasing intradialytic&#xD;
      hypotension as a result of higher ultrafiltration rates , and increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High IDWG is due to poor adherence to fluid restriction and to excessive intake of fluids.&#xD;
      Various strategies and interventions have been proposed to control IDWG such as the reduction&#xD;
      of dietary salt intake, behavioral interventions aimed at improving the adherence to fluid&#xD;
      restriction, the improvement of xerostomia, and the use of lower dialysate sodium&#xD;
      concentration. Despite the severe consequences of non-adherence, it has been estimated that&#xD;
      30%-60% of hemodialysis patients do not adhere to a fluid intake guidelines. Various&#xD;
      restrictions and barriers such as psychological (low motivation) or social (inadequate&#xD;
      support from family, friends), lack of knowledge (lack of understanding of what they were&#xD;
      advised), and lack of self-assessment (being unable to judge overall fluid status, fluid&#xD;
      intake, or salt consumption) have been shown to be related to failed adherence to fluid&#xD;
      restriction strategy. Strategies of behavioral intervention have been used to improve&#xD;
      adherence to fluid restriction and to limit IDWG. These strategies aimed to improve&#xD;
      motivation, knowledge, social support and education of hemodialysis patients. The behavioral&#xD;
      interventions generally used included various approaches, such as behavioral contracting and&#xD;
      weekly telephone contacts with patients, patient self-monitoring and behavioral contracting&#xD;
      upon adherence, stepped verbal and written reinforcement, group-administered behavioral&#xD;
      self-regulation intervention, group education sessions based on trans-theoretical model&#xD;
      (states of change), self-efficacy training, and group or individual cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy. Numerous randomized controlled studies have been performed, but unfortunately, their&#xD;
      results conflict and cannot permit conclusive considerations. It is difficult to compare such&#xD;
      studies because of the differences in terms of duration and sample size. Consequently, it is&#xD;
      hard to define if certain behavioral interventions are more effective than others. However,&#xD;
      what emerges is that the behavioral intervention, although leading to a positive outcome, is&#xD;
      temporary and has limited long-term effectiveness. Modest evidence suggests that behavioral&#xD;
      intervention strategies (e.g., instruction in self-monitoring, behavioral contracting, and&#xD;
      positive reinforcement) may be associated with improved adherence among hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this behavioral study was to evaluate the efficacy of a technology-supported&#xD;
      behavioral intervention (text message) for reducing IDWGs and dietary sodium intake in&#xD;
      patients undergoing intermittent HD. The investigators have devised a relatively simplified&#xD;
      behavioral intervention(a simple text message regarding fluid and salt restriction) as it&#xD;
      will be easier and less cumbersome to perform owing to the educational status and level of&#xD;
      understanding of the local population. Moreover, it is less expensive as compared to other&#xD;
      interventions and less complicated. Another study which used text message as medium of&#xD;
      communication depicted that smoking quit rates for the text messaging intervention group were&#xD;
      36% higher compared to the control group quit rates. Results also suggested that SMS text&#xD;
      messaging technology might be a promising way to improve smoking cessation outcomes. This is&#xD;
      significant given the relatively wide reach and low cost of text message interventions.&#xD;
      Identifying the components that make interventions efficacious will help to increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of such interventions.&#xD;
