  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migrant populations represent an increasing proportion of newly referred people living with&#xD;
      HIV in Canada, particularly in Quebec. Timely HIV care of newly referred patients has&#xD;
      important individual-level health benefits that can result in decreased transmission and&#xD;
      benefit the society as a whole. Yet, the timing of events in the HIV care cascade (from&#xD;
      linkage to care to sustained viral suppression) together with the specific experience of care&#xD;
      of these vulnerable populations (asylum-seekers, international students, patients with no&#xD;
      status) who often face specific psycho-social and/or financial issues, has rarely been&#xD;
      studied. In particular, little is known about their experience of HIV care whether they are&#xD;
      referred to a multidisciplinary clinic or a physician-only clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a context where B/F/TAF will be provided free-of-charge to all enrolled participants&#xD;
      including migrant populations, we aim to investigate what model of care can best address&#xD;
      current deficiencies in the standard HIV care cascade for newly-referred patients, which&#xD;
      often involves delays in linkage to care and starting ART.&#xD;
