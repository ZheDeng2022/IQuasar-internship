  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a digital chronic disease self-management program&#xD;
      designed to provide virtual support and guidance for patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 45% of patients with type 2 diabetes do not achieve adequate glycemic control&#xD;
      (A1C &lt; 7%). When diabetes is uncontrolled, complications develop that threaten health and&#xD;
      endanger life. This study will make an effort to address this growing health challenge and to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of diabetes in this population. More broadly, this study will have&#xD;
      important implications and benefits for the growing diabetes population in the U.S. Study&#xD;
      results will inform future interventions to reduce diabetes and improve outcomes. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the efficacy of a digital chronic disease self-management program will&#xD;
      directly benefit the participants of the program but, in the future, has the potential to&#xD;
      more broadly benefit this population throughout the nation.&#xD;
