  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is to explore the temporal relationships between physical fitness, cognitive, psychosocial&#xD;
      functions, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in COVID-19 survivors over the first 15&#xD;
      months; and to determine the effects of centre-based (CBR), online-based cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation (OBR), and combined centre- and online-based rehabilitation (COBR) on&#xD;
      survivors with initially suboptimal pulmonary functions.&#xD;

    <description>Depending on the preference of participants, they can either choose to join three 60-minute centre-based sessions plus two sessions of 30-minute home exercise per week, or two 60-minute centre-based sessions plus four sessions of 30-minute home exercise per week. Each session will include warm-up and cool-down exercises, aerobic exercises, and progressive strengthening exercises prescribed based on individual ability (Table 1). Aerobic exercises will be performed at 60-75% (up to 85% for fit individuals) of the predicted maximum heart rate. The respective rate of perceived exertion during exercise will be maintained between 4 and 6 out of 10 on the Borg CR scale [10], indicating moderate to strenuous exercise levels. Additionally, physiotherapists will provide education related to COVID-19, energy conservation, and stress management during the program.</description>

    <description>Participants in the OBR group will attend one face-to-face session to learn how to use a mobile application (app) followed by 6 weeks of home exercises. The online treatments will be delivered via the Caspar Health e-system, a German-designed Internet-based system, is available for desktop PCs and as a mobile app for both iOS and Android smartphones. This system will enable patients to follow their therapists' treatment plans in an asynchronous manner. The OBR programme will last for 6 weeks. Participants will be instructed to perform 40 minutes of structured exercises 6 times per week. In the first week, six 40-minute online exercise sessions will be delivered through push notifications on the mobile app.</description>
