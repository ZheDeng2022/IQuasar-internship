  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Yoga has been shown to reduce stress and have benefits for a number of&#xD;
      stress-related disorders. However, the effects of an acute bout of yoga practice on cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic response to and recovery from stress remain unclear. This study aimed to examine&#xD;
      the effect of a single bout of yoga on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      response to and recovery from mental stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: This study was conducted with a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover&#xD;
      design. A total of 44 participants completed two sessions (yoga and video watching (VW)) in&#xD;
      randomly assigned order. After each condition, participants underwent a Stroop task and&#xD;
      mental arithmetic task. Electrocardiogram was measured and HR and HRV for resting, each&#xD;
      condition, and the stress and recovery periods were analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>An experienced yoga instructor led the 30 minutes yoga condition session which consisted of 5 minutes warm up, 5 minutes breathing exercises, and 20 minutes yoga poses practice. The yoga props were used according to each participant's particular body type and needs to help he/she achieve precise yoga postures safely and comfortably.</description>
