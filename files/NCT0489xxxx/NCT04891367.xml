  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating disorder characterized by unwanted&#xD;
      intrusive thoughts and disrupting repetitive rituals. Epidemiological studies estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of impairing OCD to be between 0.5-3.0 % in pediatric populations. Although OCD in&#xD;
      youth is associated with substantial distress and functional impairment, access to&#xD;
      evidence-based psychosocial treatments is limited. This is largely due to the fact that few&#xD;
      clinicians are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments, such as exposure-based&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Therefore it is of great importance to develop treatment&#xD;
      programs that utilize therapist resources in the most efficient way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure-based CBT delivered in the context of a group, rather than individually, is one such&#xD;
      option. However, there are currently no evidence-based group OCD treatment manuals for youth&#xD;
      available to clinicians in Denmark. Therefore this project addresses an important clinical&#xD;
      need. We evaluate a group-based CBT protocol for the treatment of youth with OCD,&#xD;
      benchmarking treatment outcomes against data from a previous trial evaluating&#xD;
      individual-based CBT and by comparing outcomes against a short waiting list period. Further,&#xD;
      we will explore the impact of group-based CBT over a 36-month open follow-up interval on&#xD;
      general functioning, relapse, recurrence rates, and the need for other treatments. Finally, a&#xD;
      brief youth questionnaire assessing overall symptom severity relevant for the evaluation of&#xD;
      outcomes in pediatric OCD will be translated and validated for future clinical and research&#xD;
      use in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will include 72 adolescents with a primary diagnosis of OCD referred for&#xD;
      assessment and treatment at the OCD Clinic at Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital, Psychiatry, Denmark. For benchmarking of treatment outcomes, the&#xD;
      project will compare the results from the group-based CBT with data from 45 Danish patients&#xD;
      previously enrolled in the individual-based CBT of the Nordic Long Term OCD Treatment Study&#xD;
      at the same clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aims and hypotheses. The main objective of the present study is to develop a group delivered&#xD;
      treatment manual for youth with OCD and evaluate its efficacy relative to (1) a waiting list&#xD;
      control condition and (2) outcomes from existing data from a study of individually delivered&#xD;
      CBT using a benchmarking strategy. The efficacy of the new treatment manual will be evaluated&#xD;
      at the end of 13 weeks of acute treatment and at 3-, 6- , 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous research we hypothesize that: (i) G-CBT will show superiority to the&#xD;
      waiting period condition, and (ii) G-CBT will show similar effectiveness compared to I-CBT at&#xD;
      the end of acute treatment as well as at longer-term follow-up assessment points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to evaluate predictors of treatment response to G-CBT and to identify&#xD;
      specific response trajectories, i.e. patterns of symptom fluctuation during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous literature we want to explore whether: (1) youth in families with&#xD;
      higher levels of family conflict, parental blame and lower levels of cohesion will benefit&#xD;
      less from treatment when compared to youth without these family characteristics, (2) lower&#xD;
      levels of initial and intermediate treatment motivation will be associated with lower levels&#xD;
      of treatment gains, and (3) specific patient response trajectories possibly associated with&#xD;
      the onset of specific treatment ingredients (i.e., initial psychoeducation, in session&#xD;
      exposure and response prevention, specific work on obsessions, work meetings with parents,&#xD;
      etc.) and/or with patient characteristics, i.e. OCD subtypes, can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the aim is to develop and/or evaluate relevant Danish versions of clinical&#xD;
      instruments for the assessment of pediatric OCD (symptoms and severity). More specifically,&#xD;
      one aim is to develop and evaluate a short self-rating of OCD severity for youth with OCD,&#xD;
      which can be utilized by therapists during treatment and as a tool for youth's&#xD;
      self-monitoring of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. Eligible patients will be recruited as they are consecutively referred to the OCD&#xD;
      Clinic at Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Aarhus University Hospital,&#xD;
      Psychiatry, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-two adolescents, 13-17 years old will be included in the study, corresponding to&#xD;
      inclusion of approximately 140 adolescents into twenty treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benchmarking sample includes all 13- to 17-year-old Danish participants from the&#xD;
      aforementioned Scandinavian pediatric multicenter OCD CBT study, NordLOTS. NordLOTS data&#xD;
      provide a unique opportunity to benchmark outcomes from the two different CBT formats&#xD;
      delivered at the same clinic. Therefore, the procedures used in the present study are largely&#xD;
      similar to the procedures used in NordLOTS (the Committee of Ethical Science file number:&#xD;
      20070140). Patients for the current study will be included as they are consecutively referred&#xD;
      to the OCD Clinic and enrolled in the standard clinical assessment and treatment procedures.&#xD;
      All assessments will be conducted by experienced external clinician raters (i.e., clinicians&#xD;
      from the clinic who are not acting as therapists in the treatment of the assessed patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to adjust data analyses for possible interdependence of observations due&#xD;
      to group membership, patients who are offered G-CBT treatment (i.e. offered G-CBT as a part&#xD;
      of the standard clinical procedures) but fall for study exclusion criteria (e.g. previously&#xD;
      or presently treated with SSRI's) or patients who do not wish to participate in the extended&#xD;
      assessment procedures in the project (i.e. decline participation after presented with project&#xD;
      information at the first visit to the clinic) will be asked permission to use the following&#xD;
      clinical data according to their clinical record: gender, age, age at OCD-onset, present&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnoses, and CY-BOCS scores at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, end of acute&#xD;
      treatment, and at 3 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The G-CBT manual for adolescents has been developed in the OCD-clinic in Aarhus&#xD;
      and pilot tested in Aarhus and subsequently in collaboration with clinicians at the OCD&#xD;
      Clinic, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Department of&#xD;
      Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Gothenburg, Sweden, who also participated in NordLOTS. The&#xD;
      G-CBT manual is based on the NordLOTS I-CBT manual63 in overall content and structure, with a&#xD;
      few additional elements added with inspiration from previous individual and group CBT&#xD;
      literature12,13,64-67 as well as the author's ideas. The NordLOTS manual is primarily based&#xD;
      on a neurobiological model for psychoeducation, and the main therapeutic ingredient is&#xD;
      exposure and response prevention. The additional or slightly altered elements in the G-CBT&#xD;
      manual include: a) a stronger emphasis on cognitive aspects and goal-setting, b) introduction&#xD;
      of formalized supportive &quot;work-meetings&quot; between children/adolescents and parents, c)&#xD;
      exercises in thought focus strategies, d) verbalization of parents' recognition of the young&#xD;
      patient's work and efforts during the program by a parent speech at the final treatment&#xD;
      session, and e) introduction of an OCD farewell letter during the booster sessions. The&#xD;
      number of individual family and parent sessions is largely modeled after the Australian OCD&#xD;
      Busters manual (albeit, only the published journal paper reporting of this manual was&#xD;
      available at the time of the development of the Danish manual)13. The manual is made up of&#xD;
      three individual family sessions, 13 weekly adolescent group sessions, three parent group&#xD;
      sessions and two adolescent group booster sessions conducted after one and three months. The&#xD;
      adolescent group sessions are conducted by two therapists and the parent group sessions are&#xD;
      conducted by one therapist. The manual contains detailed guiding of therapists for each&#xD;
      session and a comprehensive collection of working sheets for the adolescents to be used&#xD;
      during sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability of primary outcome measures and treatment fidelity ratings Following the previous&#xD;
      procedures from NordLOTS, reliability ratings of primary outcome assessment will be performed&#xD;
      by experienced clinicians on a random sample of 15 % of baseline and week 13 CY-BOCS&#xD;
      interviews. All interviews will be videotaped and uploaded to the research database (RedCAP).&#xD;
      An adaptation of the NordLOTS Treatment Integrity Scale (TIS)9 will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      therapist fidelity to the CBT sessions. All therapy sessions will be videotaped and uploaded&#xD;
      to the research database (RedCAP). A random sample of 15 % of all sessions will be scored by&#xD;
      experienced semi-independent clinicians. In TIS 3 categories of treatment fidelity are&#xD;
      evaluated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 = very poor compliance to 4 = very good&#xD;
      compliance: (1) manual adherence, (2) competence in manual delivery, and (3) therapist&#xD;
      relational competencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and statistical analyses In total, we expect to include 72 experimental&#xD;
      subjects treated with G-CBT and 45 subjects previously included in NordLOTS treated with&#xD;
      I-CBT and completing the program. With reference to NordLOTS we expect a drop-out rate of 10&#xD;
      % during treatment9 and a further 12.5 % drop-out during the one-year post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up period. One-year Outcome for Responders of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.). Expected distribution, standard deviation and&#xD;
      differences in response between waiting period condition and CBT calculated based on data&#xD;
      from two previous studies showing CY-BOCS change scores of -1.09 (SD = 4.86) and 13.2 (SD =&#xD;
      6.41) respectively, indicates that the response within each subject group is normally&#xD;
      distributed with a standard deviation of 5.69 and a change score mean difference between&#xD;
      conditions of 14.29. If this mean difference between conditions holds true for the planned&#xD;
      study we will be able to reject the null hypothesis i.e. that the means of the two conditions&#xD;
      are equal with a probability (power) of 1.000 and a type I error probability of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for sample characteristics as well as outcome measures will be&#xD;
      calculated. In order to assess treatment effect, a multilevel linear mixed model with CY-BOCS&#xD;
      severity score as primary outcome dependent variable including random slopes and intercept&#xD;
      will be applied. To estimate the treatment effect measured with the CGI-S, a generalized&#xD;
      linear effects model will be used. Waiting period vs. treatment condition CY-BOCS change&#xD;
      scores will be estimated using a random effects model in order to adjust for differences in&#xD;
      exposure length in the two conditions. Secondary outcome measures include KINDL, OBQ-CV,&#xD;
      COIS, MFQ, and SCARED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of the 269 patients in NordLOTS, the Aarhus site included 80. Of these, 45 were&#xD;
      adolescents between the age of 13-17. The expected inclusion of 72 adolescents in the current&#xD;
      study will be sufficient for comparative benchmarking and predictor analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the benchmarking analyses participant baseline demographics (age, gender, BQ), clinical&#xD;
      characteristics (CY-BOCS, CGI, KINDL, C-GAS, CBCL, FAS, COIS, MFQ, SCARED, ASSQ) and scores&#xD;
      on outcome measures (primary measures: CY-BOCS, CGI, KINDL; secondary measures: C-GAS, COIS,&#xD;
      MFQ, SCARED, OBQ-CV) will be compared between the two samples using independent samples&#xD;
      t-tests and Fisher's exact test. In order to adjust for possible interdependence of&#xD;
      observations due to group membership, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) will be&#xD;
      calculated for primary outcome measures (CY-BOCS): ICC = (MSbetweengroup -&#xD;
      MSwithingroup)/(MSbetweengroup + [n - 1] MSwithingroup). Pre- to post CY-BOCS change will be&#xD;
      estimated as pre-post effect sizes [ES] where the ES equals the mean difference between&#xD;
      pre-treatment and post-treatment scores divided by the standard deviation of the mean&#xD;
      difference, adjusted by the correlation between the pre- and post-scores. Difference between&#xD;
      the two interventions will be estimated by calculating the standardized mean difference&#xD;
      between the pre-post change scores of the two samples, divided by a pooled estimate of the&#xD;
      post-test standard deviations. Analyses will use an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. A&#xD;
      two-sample t-test for proportions will be conducted in order to examine the difference in&#xD;
      participant completion rate between the current study and the benchmark study.&#xD;
