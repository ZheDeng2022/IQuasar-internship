  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if a web-based tool that collects family&#xD;
      health history is useful for patients being seen in a gynecologic oncology office setting.&#xD;
      This research study is being done because collecting a comprehensive family health history is&#xD;
      critical as it allows physicians to appropriately refer patients for genetic counseling and&#xD;
      genetic testing. However, prior research indicates that the family health history collected&#xD;
      in clinical settings is often inadequate to truly assess the risk of genetic disease.&#xD;
      Therefore we plan to explore a web-based program that guides patients through the collection&#xD;
      of their family health history and uses this information to create clear concise pedigrees&#xD;
      (family tree information) and risk assessment models that can be used by a physician during&#xD;
      the office visit.&#xD;

      Patients presenting for a new patient visit with a gynecologic oncologist will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three methods of collection of family health history (Arm 1 - standard of care&#xD;
      consisting of interview with the physician; Arm 2 - completion of a web-based family health&#xD;
      history tool completed in the clinic waiting room on a computer; Arm 3 - completion of a&#xD;
      web-based family health history tool completed prior to the visit and accessed by an email&#xD;
      link). A new 4th arm was added with 200 chart reviews to retrospectively look back at how&#xD;
      previous family health history was taken for new patients in 2019. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      the quality of the family health history collected, the resulting referral to genetic&#xD;
      services and patient and physician satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>To compare the amount of subjects with a high quality family health history in each of the study arms that properly assesses disease risk. Currently FHH in a gynecologic oncology clinic setting is inadequate to assess disease risk. The use of a web-based FHH collection tool that also offers the providers with a risk assessment tool may address these challenges and increase the comprehensiveness of FHH collection and risk assessment in the gynecologic oncology clinic.&#xD;
For a pedigree to be considered high quality, at least one individual in the pedigree must meet all quality criteria (&quot;high quality relative&quot;).&#xD;
Three generations of relatives&#xD;
Relatives' lineage (e.g. paternal or maternal side)&#xD;
Relatives' gender&#xD;
An up-to-date FHH&#xD;
Pertinent negatives in FHH noted (i.e. no FHH of cancer)&#xD;
Age of disease onset in affected relatives&#xD;
For deceased relatives - the age of death&#xD;
For deceased relatives - the cause of death.</description>

    <description>Web-based tool that collects subject's family health history through a series of questions and generates a pedigree which documents a risk assessment report for the physician to use. The risk assessment report uses standard, validated risk scores including GAIL , CLAUS, BRCAPRO which measure breast cancer risk, and MMRPRO which measures endometrial cancer risk, MELAPRO which measures melanoma cancer risk, and PANCPRO which measures pancreatic cancer risk</description>
