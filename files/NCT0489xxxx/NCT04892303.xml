    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate combined radioactive iodine (RAI, 131-I) and external&#xD;
      beam radiotherapy (XRT) to optimize the radiation dose delivered to treat well differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancers (DTC) with iodine-avid metastases. The investigators hypothesize that precise&#xD;
      dosimetric planning will permit this combined RAI-XRT radiotherapeutic approach to be safe&#xD;
      and permit higher tumor radiation doses than could otherwise be delivered. Patients with&#xD;
      metastatic well-differentiated DTC) that is not completely resectable with macroscopic&#xD;
      invasion of tumor into cervical soft tissues and/or non-resectable distant metastases, are&#xD;
      the target study population. The primary objective is to evaluate safety as defined by the&#xD;
      incidence of maximum grade 3 or greater NCI CTCAE toxicity observed during the treatment&#xD;
      period and for the first 30 days following completion of radiotherapy. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will evaluate efficacy at 6 months and feasibility of this combination to deliver a minimum&#xD;
      cumulative dose of 80 Gy to the index tumors selected prior to treatment initiation. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to enroll 48 subjects at an accrual rate of 1 subject per month over a&#xD;
      study duration of 4 years.&#xD;

      The study goal is to evaluate combined radioactive iodine (RAI, 131-I) and external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy (XRT) to optimize the radiation dose delivered to treat well-differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancers (DTC) with iodine-avid metastases, hypothesizing that this combination&#xD;
      approach is safe and enables delivery of higher local radiation doses than could otherwise be&#xD;
      safely delivered with either radiotherapeutic modality alone. This is an open-labeled, phase&#xD;
      1 clinical trial design that will enroll study subjects with recurrent DTC that is not&#xD;
      completely resectable with macroscopic invasion of tumor into cervical soft tissues and/or&#xD;
      non-resectable distant metastases. Study subjects will have a sub-therapeutic level of&#xD;
      lesional RAI uptake demonstrated in either a pre-treatment diagnostic scan or a previous&#xD;
      post-treatment radioiodine scan, making it unlikely that the patient would fully benefit from&#xD;
      RAI therapy alone. The primary objective is evaluate safety as defined by the incidence of&#xD;
      maximum grade 3 or greater NCI CTCAE grade toxicity observed during the treatment period and&#xD;
      for the first 30 days following completion of radiotherapy. Additional secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will evaluate efficacy at 6 months and feasibility of this combination to deliver a minimum&#xD;
      cumulative dose of 80 Gy (66 Gy, Equivalent dose in 2Gy fractions (EQD2); 2 Gy per fraction)&#xD;
      to the index tumors (up to 3 in each study subject) selected prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 48 subjects at an accrual rate of 1 subject per month over a&#xD;
      study duration of 4 years.&#xD;

          -  18 and 85 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma, collectively&#xD;
             referred to as differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), that is incompletely responsive&#xD;
             to initial surgery +/- 131-Iodine as established by anatomic imaging (CT, MRI, and&#xD;
             Ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DTC that is not completely resectable with macroscopic invasion of tumor into cervical&#xD;
             soft tissues and/or non-resectable distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Iodine avid residual disease, but with a sub-therapeutic level of lesional radioiodine&#xD;
             uptake demonstrated in either a pre-treatment diagnostic scan or a previous&#xD;
             post-treatment radioiodine scan, making it unlikely that the patient would benefit&#xD;
             from radioiodine therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function, including: a) adequate renal function, defined as a measured&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt;70 ml/min/1.73 m2 or normal radioisotope glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (GFR); and b) adequate hematologic function, defined as a platelet count &gt; 50,000&#xD;
             cells/mm3 and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt; 50%&#xD;

             determined by the treating physician and study team, based in part on organ function&#xD;
             defined above. Toxicities from previous therapies must have recovered to CTCAE v5.0&#xD;
             grade 2 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously identified cardiac disease will be eligible, as Sodium Iodide&#xD;
             I-131 (131I NaI) is not expected to cause cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is sexually active, premenopausal, and does not agree to use accepted,&#xD;
             effective forms of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any criteria that would contraindicate radioiodine therapy or external beam&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient having alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) low and intermediate risk tumors, not&#xD;
             meeting the guidelines for either radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment or External beam&#xD;
             radiotherapy (EBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with advanced central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease, critical&#xD;
             lesions in the hip and spine, etc. that would make RAI treatment prior to EBRT&#xD;
             potentially harmful, with respect to worsening of disease as a result of the&#xD;
             recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having recent exposure to iodinated contrast (within 6 weeks, that could&#xD;
             render RAI treatment ineffective).&#xD;
