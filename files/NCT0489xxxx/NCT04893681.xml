      The waterBEST study is a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group study evaluating dental caries-preventive effects of fluoridated bottled water&#xD;
      compared to non-fluoridated bottled water in 4-year-old children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      study evaluating dental caries-preventive effects of fluoridated bottled water compared to&#xD;
      non-fluoridated bottled water in 4-year-old children. Children will be allocated at random to&#xD;
      receive either fluoridated or non-fluoridated commercially available water bottles delivered&#xD;
      to households during a 3½ year intervention period. During the intervention period,&#xD;
      parents/guardians/caregivers will be interviewed quarterly to monitor children's general&#xD;
      health and a dental screening will be conducted annually. Children's fingernail clippings&#xD;
      will be collected annually and analyzed to determine the fluoride content as a biomarker of&#xD;
      total fluoride intake. Dental caries experience, the primary endpoint, will be determined&#xD;
      once in a dental examination conducted by a study dentist close to the time of the child's&#xD;
      4th birthday. For the primary aim, a least-squares, generalized linear model will estimate&#xD;
      efficacy and its one-tailed, upper 80% confidence limit using the number of decayed, missing&#xD;
      and filled primary tooth surfaces as the dependent variable.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Masking will be managed by the a Data Management System which will execute three tasks:&#xD;
Study participants' treatment group allocation will be stored in a dataset accessible only to the masked data manager&#xD;
A separate dataset will record unique identification codes that will be affixed as labels to 5-gallon bottles of water; the same dataset will also record the fluoride content of the bottle's water. After the barcode label is affixed, the vendor's color-coded label signifying fluoride content, will be removed, thereby masking the contents.&#xD;
When new water bottles are to be delivered to a study participant's dwelling, the Data Management System will execute a bottle allocation routine that will retrieve the study participant's study group assignment and select from the supply of masked bottles the necessary number of masked bottles that conform with the study participant's treatment group assignment.</masking_description>

    <measure>dmfs index</measure>
    <time_frame>Dental examination in year 4</time_frame>
    <description>The number of primary tooth surfaces that are decayed, missing or filled will be enumerated during dental examinations of children near the time of their 4th birthday. Decay will be assessed clinically at the threshold of macroscopic enamel loss, as per criteria defined by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. Five surfaces per tooth will be enumerated in all primary teeth (maximum = 20 teeth per child), yielding a count of affected surfaces that can range from 0 (no dental caries experience) to 100 (worst possible extent of dental caries experience). The lower-case abbreviation &quot;dmfs&quot; signifies disease in the primary dentition, a convention used to distinguish it from equivalent measures for the permanent dentition, where an uppercase abbreviation is used, as defined for the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Heading heading &quot;DMF Index&quot;.</description>

    <description>Fluoride content of fingernail clippings will provide a biomarker of total fluoride intake at intervals of 1, 2 and 3 years after randomization. Fluoride content will be measured in mg/kg using a hexamethyldisiloxane-facilitated diffusion assay of fingernail clippings collected from study subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The parent/guardian/caregiver understands and consents to procedures described in&#xD;
             parental permission and consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child is male or female, aged 2 months to 6 months at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has no serious illnesses requiring frequent inpatient hospitalization, as&#xD;
             reported by the parent/caregiver/guardian at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child does not use fluoride supplements, as reported by the parent/caregiver/guardian&#xD;
             at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child either drinks water (either plain water, or water mixed with something) or is&#xD;
             likely to drink water by their first birthday, as reported by the parent/&#xD;
             caregiver/guardian at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child's primary dwelling at the screening visit has tap water contains ≤0.60 mg/L&#xD;
             F, based on measurement of a tap water sample made at Dr. Godebo's laboratory. (For&#xD;
             children who live at more than dwelling, the primary dwelling is defined as the one at&#xD;
             which they usually sleep at least four nights per week.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/guardian/caregiver states at the screening visit the child will initiate&#xD;
             fluoride supplementation before the child's 4th birthday&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The parent/caregiver/guardian anticipates that the child will move to an address more&#xD;
             than 30 miles from Kinston, NC before the child's 4th birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators determine that a child living at the same dwelling has already been&#xD;
             enrolled in the study. (This means that if two or more children fulfilling the&#xD;
             inclusion criteria live at the dwelling, the parent will be asked to select one such&#xD;
             child to be the study participant.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anything that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would place the&#xD;
             participant at increased risk or preclude the participant's full compliance with or&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
