  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, longitudinal study on the My Diabetes&#xD;
      Care mobile (MDC-m) intervention to assess usage patterns, user experience, and to uncover&#xD;
      errors in functionality prior to a larger interventional trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 65 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be enrolled and given access to My&#xD;
      Diabetes Care mobile (MDC-m). My Diabetes Care mobile (MDC-m) is a multi-faceted patient&#xD;
      portal intervention for mobile devices that is designed to help patients better understand&#xD;
      their diabetes health data as well as promote and support self-management. MDC uses&#xD;
      infographics to facilitate patients' understanding of their diabetes health data (e.g.,&#xD;
      HbA1c, LDL), incorporates motivational strategies and access to an online patient support&#xD;
      community, and provides literacy level-appropriate and tailored diabetes self-care&#xD;
      information. Patients will be invited by mail to be screened for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
      Interested patients will be able to complete an electronic consent form and enroll online via&#xD;
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap™) version 5.0.8. Study participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires electronically via email using REDCap™ at two time points: baseline (T0) and&#xD;
      one-month follow-up (T1). Participants will complete an baseline questionnaire (T0) including&#xD;
      basic demographic questions, items about computer usage and internet access, and validated&#xD;
      measures of health literacy and eHealth literacy. Each participant will have access to the&#xD;
      MDC-m for 1 month.&#xD;

    <measure>Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>One-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a valid measure of usability and assesses users' perceptions of ease of use, likability of the interface, and overall satisfaction using a 5- point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The ten items are scored on a five-point Likert scale. The item scores are summed and then converted to a score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on prior research, a score above 68 would be above average and a score of 85 or above suggests excellent usability. The SUS has been used in several studies of patient facing health information technology (the article describing its psychometric properties has been cited over 500 times) and has excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.91).</description>

    <description>User analytics for My Health at Vanderbilt and My Diabetes Care will be captured during the study period and will include: participants' total number of MDC-m visits, total duration of MDC-m visits, number of health data-related tasks performed (e.g., clicks on specific health data such as most recent LDL cholesterol), and number of informational-seeking tasks performed (e.g., click links to embedded educational materials).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Diabetes Knowledge Instrument (SDKI) is a valid measure of diabetes knowledge with an emphasis on controlling blood glucose through diet, recognizing symptoms of abnormal blood glucose, and using healthy eating to prevent complications. It also includes items on foot care and the importance of physical activity for preventing cardiovascular complications. The SDKI is a uni-dimensional, 13-item scale with scores ranging from 0 to 13 (number of items answered correctly). SDKI demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.73) in a multi-ethnic sample of older adults suggesting the instrument can be used to measure diabetes knowledge in diverse populations (Quandt et al. Diabetes Educator, 2014).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activity (SDSCA), developed by Toobert and Glasgow (1994), is a 12-item multidimensional instrument to assess levels of diabetes self-care across five domains: overall diet (2 items), dietary intake of specific foods (3 items), exercise (3 items), medication taking (2 items), and SMBG (2 items). The instrument is based on the self-reported frequency of completing recommended activities during the past 7 days. An example item includes &quot;How often did you follow your recommended diet over the last 7 days?&quot; All responses are converted to percentages. Higher percentages represent better self-care on each subscale. The SDSCA has been used in a number of settings and studies and has been recommended for a standardized evaluation of quality improvement interventions in T2DM in Canada (Majumdar et al., 2005).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) is a valid measure of diabetes self-efficacy (i.e., how confident they feel about their ability to carry out multiple self management tasks). The uni-dimensional, 8-item scale is scored on a five-point Likert scale. The total PDSMS score can range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating more confidence in self-managing one's diabetes. PDSMS has excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.83). PDSMS scores were associated with observed percentage of low blood sugars (r = .21), BMI (r = -.22), percentage of high blood sugars (r = -.36), average blood glucose (r = -.27), and A1C (r = -.25). Thus, the PDSMS appears to be validly associated with important self-management behaviors as well as with indicators of health status and diabetes control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale is a reliable and valid measure of medication adherence. The 12-item ARMS has good internal consistency reliability (α=0.81). Responses range from 1=&quot;none of the time&quot; to 4=&quot;all of the time,&quot; and are summed to produce an overall adherence score ranging from 12-48, with higher scores representing more problems with medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-5) is a valid measure of diabetes distress. The five-item, uni-dimensional scale has scores that range from 0 to 20, with higher scores suggesting greater diabetes-related emotional distress. The PAID-5 has excellent excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.86) and is associated with measures of depression and hemoglobin A1c.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge of Diabetes Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Unique study specific items to assess participants' knowledge of measures of diabetes health status (i.e., Hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, and flu vaccination status). Each multiple choice item has one correct answer and the unit of measure is the percent of items answered correctly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Unique study specific items to assess participants' attitudes toward social comparisons (2 items) and goal-based comparisons (2 items) regarding their diabetes health status. Each items is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from '1=strongly disagree' to '5=strongly agree'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Readiness for Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Four-item assessment of stage of change based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change. It includes questions one item each assessing the participants stage of change for: (1) physical activity, (2) medication management, (3) glucose self-monitoring, and (4) diet. There are five response options per item that categorize the participants' current TTM stage of change for the item: (a) Precontemplation, (b) Contemplation, (c) Preparation, (d) Action, and (e) Maintenance.</description>
