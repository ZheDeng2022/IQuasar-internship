  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination against COVID-19 is a major public health issue to control the epidemic and&#xD;
      reduce the number of severe infections and deaths. Three vaccines currently received use&#xD;
      authorization in France: two mRNA vaccines and one recombinant viral vector vaccine.&#xD;
      Immunogenicity data demonstrate that they induce the development of neutralizing antibodies&#xD;
      and IgG directed against the viral S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). However,&#xD;
      there are currently no data on the persistence over time of the humoral response induced by&#xD;
      vaccination, and data are still incomplete on cellular immunogenicity. No immune correlate of&#xD;
      protection has been established for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, these data come from assays carried out with current vaccines developed against&#xD;
      a lineage of SARS-CoV-2 known as wild type (without genetic mutations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to monitor in hospital staff the temporal evolution of&#xD;
      humoral immunity induced by anti-COVID-19 vaccines by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assays (ELISA), at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the last injection of vaccine.&#xD;

      -  All medical, para-medical, medico-technical and administrative staff of the&#xD;
           Clermont-Ferrand university hospital will be informed of the protocol through&#xD;
           intra-hospital communication. The inclusion visit will be scheduled within 3 months +/-&#xD;
           14 days after the last injection of the vaccine. For volunteers who have not received&#xD;
           their first injection, they will be offered to participate in the sub-study including an&#xD;
           additional visit on the day of vaccination. They will be free to accept or refuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As recruitment is consecutive, an anonymous list of potentially eligible subjects (with&#xD;
           demographic data: age, sex; nature of the vaccine received) will be kept, in order to&#xD;
           verify afterwards if the sample is representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Five visits over 21 months, 6 over 24 months for the subgroup included on the day&#xD;
                of vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. An interview with an investigator during the first visit, to collect the following&#xD;
                data: hospital function, age, sex, weight, height, possible comorbidities exposing&#xD;
                to a serious COVID-19 infection, possible COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination,&#xD;
                date of vaccination and type of vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A self-questionnaire to update clinical data if necessary during the following&#xD;
                visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A blood test at each visit, i.e. 2 tubes of 5 mL (antibody assays) and 4 tubes of 1&#xD;
                mL (cellular immunity assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Blood samples will be stored at -80°C, before destruction at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of suspecting symptoms of COVID-19 during follow-up, molecular testing of&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infection will be offered and performed from nasopharyngeal swab or saliva&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
