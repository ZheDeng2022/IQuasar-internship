      This study (protocol 9-HPV-3003) is an immunogenicity and safety study in the subjects (9-19&#xD;
      years of age) who received the 9-valent HPV recombinant vaccine compared with the subjects&#xD;
      (20-45 years of age). In this study, we will assess whether the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      9-valent HPV vaccine given 3-dose schedule in the subjects (9-19 years of age) in noninferior&#xD;
      to that in the subjects (20-45 years of age) receiving 3 doses, while assessing the safety of&#xD;
      this vaccine.&#xD;
