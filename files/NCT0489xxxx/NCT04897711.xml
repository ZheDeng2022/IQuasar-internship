      There exist very few effective treatments that ease the intelligibility burden of dysarthria.&#xD;
      Perceptual training offers a promising avenue for improving intelligibility of dysarthric&#xD;
      speech by offsetting the communicative burden from the speaker with dysarthria on to their&#xD;
      primary communication partners-family, friends, and caregivers. This project, utilizing&#xD;
      advanced explanatory models, will permit identification of speaker and listener parameters,&#xD;
      and their interactions, that allow perceptual training paradigms to be optimized for&#xD;
      intelligibility outcomes in dysarthria rehabilitation. This work addresses this critical gap&#xD;
      in clinical practice and sets the stage for extension of dysarthria management to&#xD;
      listener-targeted remediation-advancing clinical practice and enhanced communication and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes for this population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There exist very few effective treatments that ease the intelligibility burden of dysarthria,&#xD;
      and all of these require cognitive and physical effort on the part of the speaker to achieve&#xD;
      and maintain gains. Therefore, individuals with intelligibility deficits whose cognitive and&#xD;
      physical impairments limit their ability to modify their speech are currently not viable&#xD;
      treatment candidates. This constitutes a significant health disparity that disproportionately&#xD;
      affects those clinical populations with developmental, cognitive, and/or significant&#xD;
      neuromuscular impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this critical gap in current dysarthria management, we shift the weight of&#xD;
      behavioral change from the speaker to the listener. While a novel concept for dysarthria&#xD;
      management, the idea is firmly rooted in the field of psycholinguistics and supported by our&#xD;
      programmatic body of research showing that listener-targeted perceptual training paradigms&#xD;
      (wherein listeners are familiarized with the degraded speech signal and provided with an&#xD;
      orthographic transcription of what the speaker is saying) result in statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant intelligibility gains in dysarthria. Further, we have preliminary&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that these intelligibility outcomes may be influenced by&#xD;
      hypothesis-driven speaker parameters, such as acoustic predictability of speech rhythm cues,&#xD;
      and listener parameters, such as expertise in rhythm perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A requisite next step to bringing listener-targeted perceptual training closer to clinical&#xD;
      implementation, and the overarching goal of this clinical trial, is the systematic and&#xD;
      rigorous analysis of the speaker and listener parameters, and their interactions, that&#xD;
      modulate, and in some cases optimize, perceptual training benefits of intelligibility&#xD;
      improvement. To achieve this aim, we utilize an existing database of dysarthric speech (20&#xD;
      speakers with dysarthria) and a large cohort of listeners (n = 400) across two&#xD;
      well-established testing sites, Utah State University and Florida State University. Thus, the&#xD;
      key deliverable resulting from this work will be explanatory models that account for the&#xD;
      unique and joint contributions of speaker and listener parameters on the magnitude of&#xD;
      intelligibility improvement following perceptual training with dysarthric speech.&#xD;
