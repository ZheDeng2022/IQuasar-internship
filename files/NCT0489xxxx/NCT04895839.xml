  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year over 20,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Canada with the majority&#xD;
      undergoing some form of treatment option. Radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy are&#xD;
      common procedures that are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, they&#xD;
      typically incur both short- and long-term side effects (e.g. urinary incontinence, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, reduced physical function, etc) that can negatively impact one's quality of&#xD;
      life. This program of research aims to address the most critical needs of PC survivors: the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of interventions to address the quality of life impact of PC. This&#xD;
      study will test the Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Program (PC-PEP) in 400 men, a&#xD;
      comprehensive intervention aimed at educating and teaching the men life skills/habits in&#xD;
      order to improve their mental health issues, fitness levels and overall quality of life, and&#xD;
      to decrease treatment related side effects. The program also aims to improve the overall&#xD;
      health of the participants in the long term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a survey study of almost 400 survivors of prostate cancer (PC), the investigators found&#xD;
      that 17% of them suffered currently from mental health issues, and most were not on&#xD;
      medication to address this issue. Compounding issues included urinary and sexual disfunction,&#xD;
      poor attendance to support groups, intimacy, problems sleeping and other health problems. To&#xD;
      address these many issues directly, with the endorsement of physicians and patients attending&#xD;
      our regional PC integrative care conference (April 2018) and expanding on pre-habitation&#xD;
      (pre-surgery) science, the investigators created a Patient Empowerment Program (PEP) to be&#xD;
      delivered from day one of diagnosis, to educate and teach the men and partners life&#xD;
      skills/habits which are aimed to improve their fitness levels and quality of life, and to&#xD;
      decrease treatment related side effects. This program is in line with the Auditor General of&#xD;
      Nova Scotia's 2017 report endorsing the use of bottom-up evidence-based interventions,&#xD;
      created from actively engaging patients in development and process. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      trial PC-PEP for men undergoing curative treatment for PC versus a control group receiving&#xD;
      standard care. The PC-PEP program includes in-person and multimedia informational, physical&#xD;
      activity, pelvic floor, stress reduction, and relationship/connection training. The men are&#xD;
      connected with other participants to increase social support and maximize compliance.&#xD;
      Technology is used to deliver daily alerts to patients to remind them to engage in the&#xD;
      program. A PC-PEP feasibility study of 30 men, over 28 days, showed that the program is&#xD;
      feasible, leads to positive outcomes in patients and is highly (9.79/10) endorsed by&#xD;
      patients. It is predicted that PC-PEP will improve mental health (primary outcome) and other&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes of patients compared with 'usual care'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, wait-list controlled clinical trial for men newly diagnosed with PC is&#xD;
      currently underway. This next phase will open the program to more men and expand the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Participants in the PC-PEP will receive the intervention for six months.&#xD;
      Introducing a comprehensive empowerment program from day one of diagnosis may mitigate&#xD;
      against the high levels of mental distress, short and long-term, suffered by hundreds of Nova&#xD;
      Scotian men undergoing curative PC treatment every year, and the burden that treatment&#xD;
      related side effects will place on our health care system. Given that the study has the&#xD;
      endorsement of patients, clinicians and administrators at Nova Scotia Health, if proven&#xD;
      successful it will have the evidence base needed to change the current standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>The 6 months &quot;at home&quot; program focuses on aerobic and strength training, pelvic floor muscle exercises, meditation, social connection, and overall healthy lifestyle practices supported with daily text message/email reminders. The aerobic (5 times/week) and strength (2 times/week) program will comprise of a single 30-minute session daily and will be individualized to each participant. Pelvic floor muscle training will include three, 10-minute sessions and mediation for 10 minutes daily. Intimacy and Connection component of PC-PEP consists of engaging in at least one form of intimacy practice prescribed, per day. Social connection will be fostered by pairing participants up with peers from the study. To encourage program compliance, study participants will receive 3 daily reminders to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises per day plus an additional motivational email daily containing helpful tips.</description>
