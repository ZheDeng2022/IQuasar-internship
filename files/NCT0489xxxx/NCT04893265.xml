      This study develops and evaluates the &quot;INdividual and Family-Oriented Responsive Messaging&#xD;
      EDucation&quot; (INFORMED) intervention in increasing knowledge about COVID-19 testing and&#xD;
      decreasing decisional conflicts of getting tested for COVID-19. A 2-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will compare INFORMED delivered by LHW educational outreach plus Short Message Service&#xD;
      (SMS) text messaging to SMS text with LHW support.&#xD;

      This project &quot;Getting Asian Americans INFORMED to Facilitate COVID-19 Testing and&#xD;
      Vaccinations&quot; is to identify and address sociocultural, ethical and behavioral barriers&#xD;
      related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing and vaccination to enable Asian&#xD;
      Americans to make well-informed decisions about getting tested for COVID-19. Asian Americans&#xD;
      have experienced high rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality rates when&#xD;
      compared to non-Hispanic whites particularly among those who tested positive. Excess COVID-19&#xD;
      related deaths observed in Asian Americans are in part due to under-testing or delayed&#xD;
      testing. Asian Americans may face multiple challenges, including sociocultural (limited&#xD;
      English proficiency, lack of trust, excess fears and social stigma related COVID-19), ethical&#xD;
      (lack of proven benefits of various guidelines, unequal access to testing resources), and&#xD;
      behavioral (tobacco and e-cigarette use, other competitive behaviors) factors. The pandemic&#xD;
      is rapidly evolving and presents urgent needs to develop highly efficient channels to&#xD;
      communicate accurate, easily comprehensive, cultural appropriate and practical information.&#xD;
      This application is a supplement to a parent R01 &quot;A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian&#xD;
      American Male Smokers,&quot; as known to the public as a community-based intervention research&#xD;
      program &quot;Healthy Family Project.&quot; Leveraging the community partnerships and the individual /&#xD;
      family-based LHW intervention approaches developed by the study team, the proposed aims are:&#xD;
      (1)Develop and evaluate &quot;INdividual and Family-Oriented Responsive Messaging EDucation&quot;&#xD;
      (INFORMED) intervention in increasing knowledge about COVID-19 testing and decreasing&#xD;
      decisional conflicts of getting tested for COVID-19. A 2-arm randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      compare INFORMED delivered by LHW educational outreach plus SMS text messaging to SMS text&#xD;
      with LHW support. (2) Conduct in-depth prospective investigation of sociocultural, ethical&#xD;
      and behavioral factors related to COVID-19 testing in Chinese, Hmong and Vietnamese American&#xD;
      over-time. In addition, factors affecting acceptance for vaccination research trial&#xD;
      participation and vaccination uptake and how vaccination acceptance is associated with&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing uptake will be explored.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of participants who have decisional conflicts for getting tested of COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Decision conflicts is measured by the 4-item Decision Making Conflict (SURE) test which asks whether participants: 1) know enough about benefits and harm; 2) clear about which benefits and harms matter most; 3) have enough support/advice to make a choice; and 4) feel sure about the best choice regarding getting tested for COVID-19. Each item is scored either 0 or 1. The total score ranges from 0 to 4. A score at 3 or lower is considered as having some decisional conflict.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a weekly SMS Text or instant message on a topic related to COVID-19 testing over 12 weeks. In addition, participants will receive as-needed messages on updates of COVID-19 testing related information. The messages will be responsive to the rapid evolving developments and changes related to COVID-19 testing guidelines. Some of the messages will include a link to allow participants to get to the entire message/information on the study website.</description>
