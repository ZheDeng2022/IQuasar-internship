      This pragmatic randomized controlled study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      moxibustion therapy on diabetes peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

      Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical effects of moxibustion&#xD;
      for treating diabetes peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Subjects who have participated in the moxibustion treatment will have greater&#xD;
      improvement in people with diabetes with signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy than the&#xD;
      control group after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Subjects with diabetes peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy will be recruited from the community. 30 subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      moxibustion groups and control groups in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Subjects in the moxibustion group will receive three times per week for 12&#xD;
      weeks; control groups will be allocated to the waitlist will receive no moxibustion&#xD;
      treatments throughout the 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain assessment measured with the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline pain at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs (LANSS) Pain Scale is based on analysis of sensory description and bedside examination of sensory dysfunction, and provides immediate information in clinical settings. The possible scores range from 0 to 24, with a score of 12 or greater considered to be suggestive of neuropathic pain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment measured with the Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline pain at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment measured with the Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline pain at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are based on patient responses to questions about pain intensity. 0 indicates no pain; 10 indicates the most pain imaginable. The NPS is only for use in patients who have already been diagnosed with neuropathic pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of functional performance capacity with 6 minutes walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline results at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline results at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-report outcome instrument developed to assess physical function for individuals with foot and ankle related impairments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline results at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is provides accurate long-term index of average blood glucose level</description>

    <measure>Serum Albumin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline results at 8 weeks</time_frame>
