  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe and better understand the scars of subjects that&#xD;
      have been treated with Stratagraft tissue vs autograft.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients who have previously been participants in the STRATA2016&#xD;
      study protocol. The patients will have comprehensive scar examinations conducted including&#xD;
      the use of imaging, scar scale scores, pain and itch scales, scar volume measurements, and&#xD;
      non-invasive skin measurements resulting in quantitative metrics of skin elasticity,&#xD;
      stiffness, and color. Tissue biopsies will also be collected for histologic investigations&#xD;
      into the scar. Each patient will have a biopsy taken of the autografted site, the Stratagraft&#xD;
      site, and an area of normal, un-injured skin.&#xD;

    <description>Histologic measurements will be compared between scars originating from Stratagraft-treated burn wounds vs. autograft-treated burn wounds. The data will be normalized to uninjured skin.&#xD;
The specific parameters being measured include epidermal thickness (microns), dermal thickness (microns), scar cellularity (percentages), and rete ridge ratios (ratio of basement membrane length over epidermis length).</description>

    <description>Digital images and 3D photography will be used to qualitatively characterize scars.&#xD;
Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples will be used to generate sections which will be stained with Massons trichrome (overall collagen), Pircosirius red (type I and III collagen), Verhoeff Van Geison (elastin), and Fontana Masson (melanin) stains. These stained sections will be imaged and used to qualitatively characterize scar resulting from Stratagraft-treated burn wounds and SOC-treated burn wounds. Images will be normalized to uninjured skin.</description>
