  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia (cancer of blood cells). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess how well venetoclax + obinutuzumab (VenG) works and how&#xD;
      safe they are in adult participants with CLL who were previously treated with VenG. Adverse&#xD;
      events and change in disease activity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an approved drug for the treatment of CLL. Study doctors put the participants&#xD;
      in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms, based on when symptoms of CLL came back after&#xD;
      previous treatment with VenG. Approximately 75 adult participants with CLL who have been&#xD;
      treated with VenG will be enrolled in the study in approximately 60 sites worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive intravenous (IV) obinutuzumab + oral venetoclax (VenG) in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles for a total of 6 cycles per cohort, followed by 6 to 18 cycles of venetoclax alone,&#xD;
      for a total treatment of 12 to 24 cycles, depending on the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;
