  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective open-label randomized tral, 100 patients with elective off-pump coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass (OPCAB) or minimal invasive direct coronary bypass (MIDCAB) surgery were&#xD;
      enrolled. Before surgery, if a patient had iron deficiency anemia, the patient was randomized&#xD;
      to receive Ferinject®(Ferric carboxymaltose, n=50) or placebo (normal saline, n=50),&#xD;
      respectively. A single dose should not exceed 1000mg of iron per day or 20mg per kg body&#xD;
      weight. In addition, the administration of 1000mg of iron should not exceed once a week.&#xD;
      Administration to patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease is once daily,&#xD;
      and the maximum dose should not exceed 200 mg (4 ml) of iron. Patients weighing less than 35&#xD;
      kg should not exceed 500 mg total iron dose. It uses intravenous infusion and can be&#xD;
      administered up to 1,000mg (20ml) as the maximum iron once. For intravenous infusion, this&#xD;
      drug is diluted with 0.9% sterile physiological saline solution.&#xD;

      -  Perioperative blood loss and iatrogenic hemodilution lead to postoperative anemia which&#xD;
           correlates with infections, and poor physical function, mobility and recovery with&#xD;
           subsequent increases in the length of hospital stay and mortality. Preoperative anemia&#xD;
           management reduce intraoperative blood loss such as normothermia, antifibrinolytics and&#xD;
           cell salvage are key strategies to ameliorate postoperative anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient screening method Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) under&#xD;
           median-sternotomy, or minimal invasive direct coronary bypass (MIDCAB) undertaken under&#xD;
           median-sternotomy Among them, the selection/exclusion criteria are checked and the&#xD;
           subjects of the study are screened. * Inclusion/ exclusion criteria **Inclusion:&#xD;

             -  Patients with Preoperative iron deficiency anemia Among Patients scheduled for&#xD;
                cardiopulmonary coronary artery bypass graft under median sternotomy in&#xD;
                cardiovascular surgery **Exclusion: - a) Patients who underwent iron correction&#xD;
                treatment (oral, injection, blood transfusion) within 2 months prior to surgery b)&#xD;
                Patients taking anticoagulants before surgery c) Patients taking and administering&#xD;
                drugs that can cause bone marrow suppression, such as anticancer drugs, before&#xD;
                surgery d) Patients with chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease&#xD;
                undergoing dialysis e) Patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft for&#xD;
                emergency surgery f) Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions and side&#xD;
                effects to iron drugs g) Minor (under 20 years old) 3) Definition of iron&#xD;
                deficiency anemia (if all criteria a to c in the following items are satisfied)&#xD;

                  3. Hb&lt;12.0g/dL for women or Hb&lt;13.0g/dL for men * The primary goal of this study&#xD;
                     was the effect of intravenous administration of ferric carboxymaltose on&#xD;
                     postoperative hemoglobin levels in patients with preoperative iron deficiency&#xD;
                     anemia among patients requiring cardiopulmonary coronary artery bypass&#xD;
                     grafting due to coronary artery disease. It is to analyze the effect compared&#xD;
                     to the control.&#xD;
