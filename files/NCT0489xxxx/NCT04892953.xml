  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial finds out the effect of local consolidative therapy and durvalumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer that has 3 or fewer lesions of&#xD;
      progression (oligoprogressive) and greater than 3 lesions of progression (polyprogressive)&#xD;
      after chemoradiation and anti-PD-l1 therapy. Local consolidative therapy, such as surgery&#xD;
      and/or radiation, after initial treatment may kill any remaining tumor cells. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with durvalumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving local consolidative therapy and durvalumab&#xD;
      may help to control the disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. Biomarker analyses on tumor biopsies pre-radiation, while on systemic therapy (cycle 2),&#xD;
      and optional at progression, as well as blood collections pre-radiation, pre-durvalumab,&#xD;
      while on systemic therapy (cycle 2), every other restaging scan, and optional at progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Microbiome analyses on stool sample pre-radiation, pre-systemic therapy, and at&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A (OLIGOPROGRESSIVE): Patients undergo LCT consisting of radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
      surgery, then receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B (POLYPROGRESSIVE): Patients undergo LCT consisting of radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
      surgery, then receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive one of the&#xD;
      following chemotherapy options: carboplatin and paclitaxel on day 1, carboplatin on day 1 and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, 15, or carboplatin on day 1 and gemcitabine on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with non-squamous histology receive pemetrexed on day 1 every&#xD;
      21 days for cycles 1-4, pemetrexed and durvalumab IV on day 1 every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;

             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage III NSCLC (AJCC 7th and 8th edition) patients who received standard&#xD;
             chemoradiation followed by durvalumab therapy with either progressive disease or&#xD;
             persistent disease. Persistent disease defined as residual positron emission&#xD;
             tomography (PET) avidity 6 months after completion of initial definitive therapy and&#xD;
             confirmed with biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For lung adenocarcinoma patients, patients must not harbor any EGFR sensitizing&#xD;
             mutations, ALK fusion, ROS1 rearrangements, RET fusions, or MET exon 14 skipping&#xD;
             mutations where there are standard of care therapy options available. For patients&#xD;
             with histologies other than adenocarcinoma, EGFR and ALK status is not required.&#xD;
             Adenocarcinoma patients may be consented prior to the EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status being&#xD;
             known, but EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status must be determined prior to initiating therapy.&#xD;
             EGFR, ALK, and ROS ALK status may be determined using either tumor- or plasma-based,&#xD;
             Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified assays. For patients with NSCLC,&#xD;
             not otherwise specified (NOS), EGFR testing is not required, as the frequency of&#xD;
             alterations is exceedingly rare in this histology&#xD;

             apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent&#xD;
             hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or&#xD;
             hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician&#xD;

             durvalumab). This is defined as any progression on the first 3-month imaging scan&#xD;

             therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies) =&lt; 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. This 28 day washout&#xD;
             period is not required for durvalumab. If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred&#xD;
             due to the schedule or pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of an agent, a longer wash-out&#xD;

             metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and&#xD;
             show no evidence of intracranial progression). Treated brain metastases will be&#xD;
             counted as lesions treated as part of the protocol. In addition, any neurologic&#xD;
             symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment&#xD;

             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C patients with a past or resolved HBV&#xD;
             infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence&#xD;

&#xD;

             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;

                  neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy. NOTE:&#xD;
                  Patients with endocrine AE of =&lt; grade 2 are permitted to enroll if they are&#xD;
                  stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of&#xD;
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
