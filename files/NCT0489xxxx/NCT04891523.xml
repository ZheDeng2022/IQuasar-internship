      Targeting human microbiota, in particular those of the gastrointestinal tract, by means of&#xD;
      prebiotics, probiotics, symbiotics or antibiotics has gained interest for its potential in&#xD;
      the management of human health. Oral bacterial communities have been extensively studied over&#xD;
      the last decade both in normal and pathological states; however, little data are available on&#xD;
      the possibility to modify microbiota composition in a controlled and 'non-aggressive' manner&#xD;
      by using probiotics, in order to improve oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva contains microorganisms attached to exfoliated human cells and released from oral&#xD;
      biofilms; its microbiota is most similar (proportionally) to those of the dorsal and lateral&#xD;
      tongue. In addition, bacteria belonging to genera Porphyromonas, Tannerella and Treponema,&#xD;
      which contain species associated with periodontitis, are consistently identified in saliva.&#xD;
      Salivary microbial communities are relatively stable and thus potentially interesting as an&#xD;
      indicator of oral and general health. Indeed, it has been suggested that interventions aimed&#xD;
      at improving oral health should target mucosal microbiota (to which saliva is most similar)&#xD;
      in addition to dental microbial communities. Whole saliva also constitutes an alternative to&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid when analysing analytes present in periodontal pockets. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that saliva reflects a consensus inflammatory status of the whole mouth with&#xD;
      potentially significant clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain K12 of Streptococcus salivarius is available internationally as a food supplement,&#xD;
      notably for oral hygiene. Several studies investigated the effectiveness of S. salivarius as&#xD;
      a probiotic in the context of pharyngeal infections, halitosis, plaque formation and caries.&#xD;
      Our study will focus on the effects of supplementation with this commercially available oral&#xD;
      probiotic on the resident microbiota and inflammatory markers in order to identify signatures&#xD;
      associated with resistance/susceptibility to colonization by probiotic strains.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, prospective, cross-over, randomized, double-blinded study in which all&#xD;
      participants will receive placebo and active probiotic treatment, 15 of which will first be&#xD;
      treated with placebo and then will be given probiotics. The other 15 participants will first&#xD;
      get probiotics and then, after a 3-week wash out period, the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess changes in salivary microbiota profiles and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers following S. salivarius probiotic treatment. Our secondary objective is&#xD;
      to identify correlations between specific salivary microbial taxa (subspecies to phylum&#xD;
      levels) and inflammatory markers. Clinical outcome is not the focus of this study, although&#xD;
      basic information about the oral health (Oral Hygiene Index) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOTICS-O (Burgerstein) probiotic that will be used is a commercial food supplement available&#xD;
      over the counter in the pharmacy as blister packs of 30 lozenges containing 10^9 CFU of S.&#xD;
      salivarius K12. Participants will let melt the lozenge after tooth brushing in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo lozenges (inactivated probiotic) will have the same look, taste and smell as the&#xD;
      active treatment lozenges, and they will be administered in the same way as the active&#xD;
      treatment lozenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic analysis of the microbiota:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indexed paired-end metagenomic libraries will be prepared using DNA extracted from saliva and&#xD;
      sequenced for 2x150 cycles on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument to generate 5-10 million&#xD;
      read pairs per sample. Our standard metagenomic analysis pipeline (HUGE-MAP) will be used; it&#xD;
      includes: (i) read quality filtering; (ii) removal of replicate sequences; (iii) removal of&#xD;
      read pairs that match human genome sequence and, (iv) classification of read pairs with CLARK&#xD;
      against the collection of NCBI reference and representative bacterial, archaeal and fungal&#xD;
      genomes, as well as Latest RefSeq NCBI genomes of prophages and DNA virus families whose&#xD;
      members may infect humans. Functional assignments i.e. profiling the presence/absence and&#xD;
      abundance of microbial gene families and pathways will be performed using MG-RAST server.&#xD;
      Bacterial abundance will be measured by qPCR and/or relative to the number of reads obtained&#xD;
      from the spiked calibrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using a customized 6-plex Bio-Plex Pro Hu Screening Panel (Bio-Rad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samplings will be performed at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.&#xD;
