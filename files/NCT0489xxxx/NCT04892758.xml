  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective&#xD;
        cohort design comparing mometasonefuroate/formoterol 200/10ug with formoterol 12 ug in&#xD;
        patients with persistent asthma previously receiving medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
        The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180&#xD;
        days before initiation of mometasone-furoate/formoterol or formoterol. (Note: the&#xD;
        formoterol dose used in the trial was 10ug ; in the replication, we will use the market&#xD;
        available dose which is 12 ug).&#xD;

        full code and algorithm definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible cohort entry dates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mometasone-furoate/formoterol was approved by FDA on June 24, 2010 for the management of&#xD;
        asthma. The initial eligible cohort entry date was the first date after June 24, 2010 for&#xD;
        both the databases investigated (IBM MarketScan, Optum CDM). The last date eligible as&#xD;
        cohort entry date was the end of available data for IBM MarketScan and Optum&#xD;
&#xD;
        CDM. The following eligible cohort entry dates were included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optum CDM: June 24, 2010 - June 30, 2020 (end of available data)&#xD;
&#xD;

             additional, excluded asthma medication (other than SABA) as judged by the clinical&#xD;
             investigator at any time from the Screening Visit up to and including the Baseline&#xD;
             Visit&#xD;
