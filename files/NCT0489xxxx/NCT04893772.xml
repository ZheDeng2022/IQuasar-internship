  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although individuals following commercial intermittent fasting programmes consume meal&#xD;
      replacement products during fasting days, further behavioural variables such as time of food&#xD;
      consumption, sleep quality and duration, appetite and mood may significantly impact weight&#xD;
      loss and intervention success. This project aims to assess behavioural patterns (dietary&#xD;
      intake, sleep, meal timing, physical activity), mood and appetite on both fasting and&#xD;
      non-fasting days and to investigate whether these are associated with weight loss.&#xD;
