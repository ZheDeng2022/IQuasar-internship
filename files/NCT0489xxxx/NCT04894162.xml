      This research seeks the views of patients who are admitted to hospices and specialist&#xD;
      palliative care units (SPCUs) regarding whether they would consider being involved in&#xD;
      different types of clinical research. This is a questionnaire based study of inpatients in&#xD;
      the North East of England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be used to inform healthcare professionals about the research which patients&#xD;
      may or may not be interested in, as well as enabling future research design to be supportive&#xD;
      of patient preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the interventions used within specialist palliative care lack a strong evidence base&#xD;
      with guidelines often based on a mixture of expert opinion, anecdotal evidence or&#xD;
      extrapolated from research in other patient groups rather than robust clinical research.&#xD;
      Previous studies have highlighted multiple potential barriers to expanding research within&#xD;
      the palliative care setting. Barriers include a lack of funding compared to other medical&#xD;
      specialties and a lack of institutional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ongoing barrier to research in this field is that the nature of the population makes&#xD;
      patient recruitment to research challenging. This may be associated with professionals in&#xD;
      palliative care being reluctant to ask patients if they would want to be involved in research&#xD;
      as they feel that it would be inappropriate to potentially burden patients who are very&#xD;
      unwell with research which is unlikely to change the disease outcome for the individual.&#xD;
      However, many recognise that it is important to understand what patients themselves think&#xD;
      about the potential to take part in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main research question will help us to ascertain whether patients admitted under&#xD;
      Palliative Medicine in our region would welcome the opportunity to be involved in clinical&#xD;
      research. Previous studies have been at a single site with small numbers of patients, whereas&#xD;
      our research will aim to recruit a larger number of patients and will be a multi-centre study&#xD;
      involving a range of inpatient settings including an independent hospice, two National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) Palliative Care Units. These centres are across the north-east region&#xD;
      (Northumbria and Newcastle) and accept admissions from a mixture of affluent and less&#xD;
      affluent areas. It will also involve patients with both malignant and non-malignant disease.&#xD;
      Previous studies have not surveyed patients that were described as &quot;too unwell&quot;, therefore as&#xD;
      a secondary outcome we will be recording how well patients are functionally (by recording&#xD;
      performance status- AKPS) to examine if those patients who are most unwell would still want&#xD;
      to be involved in research. There is a gap in current knowledge of whether those patients&#xD;
      with advanced disease and close to end of life would still find it rewarding to have the&#xD;
      opportunity to be involved in research of some sort and whether it is fair to exclude them&#xD;
      from being offered opportunities to be involved based on their advanced disease status.&#xD;

      Research Question: Do patients who are cared for in specialist inpatient units in the North&#xD;
      East of England want to take part in in research? If not, why not?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference in desire to participate in research between patients with&#xD;
           malignant and non malignant disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference in desire to participate in research for patients with lower&#xD;
           functional status?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference in desire to participate in research for those closer or further&#xD;
           away from death?&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the start date of the study all consecutive admissions to the hospice or specialist&#xD;
      palliative care units will be offered the opportunity to take part in the research study&#xD;
      within 72 hours of their admission if they have capacity and they are under the care of the&#xD;
      specialist palliative care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opportunity to take part will be offered by a designated member of the of the&#xD;
      multi-professional team with training in capacity assessment. This will occur at three&#xD;
      designated times during the week to ensure both minimal disruption to patient care provision&#xD;
      and that patients are given the opportunity to participate within 72 hours of their&#xD;
      admission. Whilst the researchers appreciate only recruiting three times a week may miss&#xD;
      patients with a very short length of stay it is felt that the risk of this is outweighed by&#xD;
      reducing disruption to patient care and facilitating participation across multiple sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with information using a patient information leaflet. This leaflet&#xD;
      will make it clear that the decision to take part will have no impact on their usual care,&#xD;
      and they are able to withdraw at any point in the future. The leaflet can either be read by&#xD;
      the patient or read to the patient depending on the presence of any difficulties with reading&#xD;
      (incl. literacy level, visual impairment and fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient wishes to participate, they will be asked to sign a consent form and then&#xD;
      given the research questionnaire to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be placed in a sealed envelope will be given back to a member of the&#xD;
      healthcare team, or deposited in a collection box situated at a (manned) front desk or&#xD;
      reception area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once completed consent forms and research questionnaires are received, the data will be&#xD;
      transferred by the research team on each site to an on-site database. At this point,&#xD;
      demographic details will be added on to the database to include age, gender, postcode,&#xD;
      performance status and main diagnosis. The patient's NHS number will be included on the&#xD;
      database, in order to be able to assess the patient outcome following completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaire after 3 and 6 months. This enables the important question regarding whether the&#xD;
      desire to participate in research changes with a shorter prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completed research questionnaires will be gathered three times a week and stored in a locked&#xD;
      drawer of a locked office on each research site. No patient identifiable information will be&#xD;
      transferred between sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive research questionnaires for all eligible patients will be gathered. A minimum&#xD;
      sample size of 100 patients will be recruited so that we would have a minimum ratio of events&#xD;
      to predictor variables (age and sex) of 10, allowing us to perform meaningful analysis and&#xD;
      minimise the risk of overfitting and type II error inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data regarding the patient's underlying condition and functional status will be&#xD;
      collected contemporaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data regarding the patient's location of care will be collected at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
