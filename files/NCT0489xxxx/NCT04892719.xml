      This is a pilot study to determine the feasibility and utility of Novel Functional Lung&#xD;
      Imaging and Ventilation (4DxV) Analysis software in measurement of lung ventilation&#xD;
      abnormalities and diagnosis of CLAD after lung transplantation. 4DxV is a technology&#xD;
      developed by 4Dx (4Dx Limited, Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, CA) and is a novel&#xD;
      computational approach to the data obtained from standard fluoroscopic imaging that measures&#xD;
      tissue motion of the lung at all locations and in all phases of breath. These motion&#xD;
      measurements are used to calculate 4-dimensional ventilation (4DxV) of lung tissue to provide&#xD;
      variety of outputs. The investigators will establish the sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      accuracy of this technology in diagnosis of CLAD compared to CT scan and pulmonary function&#xD;
      results in patients with a known diagnosis of CLAD based on established diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 4DxV scans will be able to detect quantitative ventilation abnormalities in patients&#xD;
           with established CLAD and the severity of the abnormalities will correlate with severity&#xD;
           of PFT decline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4DxV will be able to diagnose patients with CLAD of the bronchiolitis obliterans&#xD;
           syndrome (BOS) phenotype grades 0 (CLAD free) vs grades 1-3&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Fluoroscopic chest imaging with 4Dx technology software analysis</intervention_name>
    <description>4DxV utilizes a novel software algorithm to analyze data from cinefluoroscopy images to calculate regional ventilation and pulmonary function changes. Cinefluorography uses a fluorescent screen with X-rays to make real-time moving images the lung described below. This is the same x-ray fluoroscopy that is used in clinical imaging and the fluoroscopic imaging time is approximately 1 minute leading to an effective radiation dose of 2 mSv (200 mRem). This is significantly lower that the radiation exposure from a standard chest CT. Fluoroscopy images are acquired at each of five views for approximately enough time to capture at least one complete, continuous breath. The subject is required to remain in the same position for each of the five fluoroscopy imaging sequences. These images will be analyzed by the novel 4Dx technology to provide the 4Dx lung function analysis report.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recipient of a first bilateral lung transplantation performed at Duke University at&#xD;
             least one year prior to written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest performed at Duke as standard of care after&#xD;
             transplantation but within 1 year prior to written informed consent 4a. CLAD grades 1,&#xD;
             2,or 3 (per ISHLT 2014 criteria [Meyer et al 2014]) prior to or at the time of&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 1 is defined as a fractional decrease in FEV1 to 66-80% of post-transplant&#xD;
                  baseline FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 2 is defined as a fractional decrease in FEV1 to 51%-65% of post-transplant&#xD;
                  baseline FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 3 is defined as a fractional decrease in FEV1 to &lt;= 50% of post-transplant&#xD;
                  baseline FEV14b. CLAD free status (defined as most recent FEV1 at the time of&#xD;
                  screening &gt;90% of post-transplant baseline FEV1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Recipients of a single lung transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recipients of a redo-lung transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recipients of bone marrow or stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Recipients of a multi-organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with hospital admissions(excluding admissions for planned treatment of the&#xD;
             CLAD and/or rejection)within one month of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are unable to lie flat on the fluoroscopy table&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women (by subject's verbal report). Lung transplant recipients are routinely&#xD;
             counseled to avoid pregnancy due to the teratogenic effects of necessary&#xD;
             immunosuppressant medications. Pregnancy after lung transplantation is therefore&#xD;
             extremely rare. As this is a minimal risk study which does not involve an experimental&#xD;
             therapy, invasive devices, or increased risk procedures, pregnancy testing is deemed&#xD;
             unnecessary for this population for this study.&#xD;
