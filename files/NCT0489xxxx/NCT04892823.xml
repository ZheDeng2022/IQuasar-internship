      This project aims to elucidate the important protective elements of social relationships and&#xD;
      identify concrete, modifiable behavioral factors that contribute to biological and phenotypic&#xD;
      aging in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors and can be used to develop&#xD;
      biologically informed interventions to improve quality of life and prolong the healthspan of&#xD;
      individuals with accelerated aging.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine associations between social support, strain, and isolation and phenotypic aging&#xD;
      over the 1-year recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine associations between social support, strain, and isolation and biological aging&#xD;
      over the 1-year recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Test biological aging as a mediator linking social processes and phenotypic aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test sex differences in Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopting a prospective design, participants will complete comprehensive assessments of social&#xD;
      processes at 100 days and 1 year after HCT that combine reports of social support, strain,&#xD;
      and isolation with a naturalistic observation tool, the Electronically Activated Recorder&#xD;
      (EAR), which captures ambient sound bites to assess social interactions in survivors' daily&#xD;
      lives16. At each time point, participants will also provide reports of symptoms to&#xD;
      characterize phenotypic aging, including cognitive, physical, and functional complaints, and&#xD;
      blood samples to assess biological aging, including cellular senescence, DNA damage, SASP,&#xD;
      and cellular stress using genome-wide RNA sequencing. Relevant clinical information that&#xD;
      could influence biological aging will also be collected from patients' medical records to&#xD;
      consider as covariates.&#xD;

    <description>Raw gene expression data will be quantile-normalized and log2-transformed. Similar to Aim 1, multiple regression models will examine each social process as separate predictors of change in cellular senescence marker p16INK4a over the 1-year period, accounting for covariates. Mixed linear models will examine associations between each social process and deoxyribonucleic acid damage response (DDR) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene profiles, estimated by maximum likelihood to account for systematic differences across genes by treating them as repeated measurements with an unstructured covariance matrix. Bioinformatics analyses will use regression models to identify genes with &gt; 1.5-fold difference.</description>
