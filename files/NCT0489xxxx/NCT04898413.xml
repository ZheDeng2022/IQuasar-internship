  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with more people worldwide having dementia, the number of people with dementia and&#xD;
      their family caregivers have increased in Japan. However, psychological support for family&#xD;
      caregivers of people with dementia is still limited in Japan. The purpose of this pilot study&#xD;
      is to examine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a group-based acceptance and commitment&#xD;
      therapy (ACT) for family caregivers of people with dementia in Japan compared to a&#xD;
      group-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). This study also preliminarily examines the&#xD;
      efficacy of combining psychological intervention for family caregivers (group-based ACT/CBT)&#xD;
      with psychological intervention for their care recipients (group-based reminiscence therapy).&#xD;

      This study employs quasi-experimental design to investigate the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the group-based ACT for family caregivers of people with dementia compared to the&#xD;
      group-based CBT. Both interventions consist of eight sessions, each lasting about 90 minutes,&#xD;
      through face-to-face or Zoom video conferencing over the course of four months. Family&#xD;
      caregivers will be assigned to either the ACT or CBT interventions. Pre-, post-intervention,&#xD;
      and 6 month follow-up measurements assess depression, anxiety, quality of life, cognitive&#xD;
      appraisal of caregiving (i.e., subjective burden and positive aspect of caregiving), possible&#xD;
      process factors (i.e., caregiving self-efficacy, experiential avoidance, and commitment),&#xD;
      care recipients' behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and so on. This&#xD;
      study also preliminarily examines the efficacy of combining psychological intervention for&#xD;
      family caregivers (i.e., the group-based ACT/CBT) with those for their care recipients (i.e.,&#xD;
      group-based reminiscence therapy). The group-based reminiscence therapy will be held once a&#xD;
      month, each lasting about 60-90 minutes, over the course of about nine months.&#xD;

This scale comprises 26 items on three negative appraisal subscales (feelings of restriction of social life, anxiety about continuing caregiving, and distress of the relationships with others) and three positive appraisal subscales (fulfillment of caregiving roles, affection toward the caretakers, and self-growth by caregiving). Positive appraisal subscales are used. Scale scores range from 6 to 24 for fulfillment of caregiving roles, 4 to 16 for affection toward the caretakers, and 3 to 12 for self-growth by caregiving.
