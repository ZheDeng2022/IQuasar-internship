      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention&#xD;
      (MBSRI) on the reduction of stress, anxiety, and depression in people with COPD and their&#xD;
      family caregivers. The experimental group will receive the MBSRI and the control group an&#xD;
      informational intervention on stress management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People affected by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and their family caregivers&#xD;
      (named dyads) often suffer from psychological distress, because of the physical problems and&#xD;
      social isolation imposed by the disease. Such psychological distress can influence the&#xD;
      ability of patients and caregivers to manage the disease. Mindfulness-based interventions&#xD;
      have showed benefits in improving the psychological status in various clinical situations. A&#xD;
      8-week mindfulness based-stress reduction intervention will be offered to a group of COPD&#xD;
      patient-caregiver dyads and its effectiveness will be assessed comparing the effects on a&#xD;
      control group to whom an informational intervention on stress reduction will be carried out.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in perceived stress measured by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at 8 weeks and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived stress entails the feelings or thoughts that an individual has about how much stress they are under at a given point in time. It will be measured in patients and caregivers using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) that is a 10 item-self-report instrument: its score ranges from 0 to to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores) (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16-weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in anxiety level measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) at 8 weeks and 16 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The anxiety level will be measured in patients and caregivers using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Its scores range from 0 to 21. Cut points of 5, 10, and 15 represent mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety. Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores) (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16-weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in depression measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 8 weeks and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The depressive symptoms in patients and caregivers will be measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Its score range from 0 (no symptoms) to 27 (nearly daily symptoms). Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores) (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16-weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in subjective quality of sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 8 and 16 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The quality and patterns of sleep in patients and caregivers will be measured by PSQI that is a self-report questionnaire measuring seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. The global score ranges from 0 to 21, the higher the score, the worse the sleep quality. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores) (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16-weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mindfulness experience measured by Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at 8 and 16 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mindfulness abilities in patients and caregivers will be measured by a self-reported questionnaire, FFMQ, that comprises 39 items assessing five facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Higher global score shows a higher mindfulness disposition. Change = (8 weeks- baseline score), (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16 weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life measured by Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) at 8 and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The physical and mental health-related quality of life of patients and caregivers will by measured by the SF-12 that comprises 12 items. Higher the scores the better the quality of life. Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores), (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16 weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in impact of the COPD on patient's life measured by COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at 8 weeks and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a 8-item instrument that assesses health-related quality of life and symptom burden in COPD patients. Range of CAT scores from 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact. Change = (8 weeks- baseline scores), (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16 weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient's dyspnea measured by the Modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) at 8 and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC is a 5-point (0-4) scale that will be used to measure the severity of dyspnea in patients. Higher scores mean worse dyspnea. Change = (8 weeks-baseline scores), (16 weeks-baseline scores), and (16 weeks-8 weeks scores).</description>

    <description>The 8-group sessions of MBSR will be conducted once a week, lasting two and a half hours, with two additional sessions in the following two months. Between sessions, participants will have to practice at home for 45 minutes a day, 6 days a week. For the practice, patients and caregivers will be provided with audio files containing the meditations proposed in the classroom, readings, and the diary of the practice. During the sessions, the following mindfulness-based techniques will be introduced: body scan; sitting meditation; awareness movement exercises; and walking meditation.The sessions will be held face to face or online using common videoconferencing platforms, such as Skype or Zoom, based on the preferences of the participants. This will facilitate the participation of patients and caregivers, overcoming the obstacles related to travel. The course will be taught by certified mindfulness teachers with experience in MBSR interventions on patients with respiratory diseases.</description>
