  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, open-label phase 1 study to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      M-CENK and N-803 for subcutaneous administration, cryopreserved in subjects with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of two cohorts: cohort 1 includes&#xD;
      subjects with newly diagnosed high-risk solid tumors who have not received prior treatment&#xD;
      for high-risk tumors; and cohort 2 includes subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) solid&#xD;
      tumors who have progressive disease after receiving ≥ 2 prior therapies. The two cohorts will&#xD;
      be conducted simultaneously.&#xD;
