  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators are examining the feasibility and acceptability of an expanded&#xD;
      and technology-assisted aftercare program with persons released from a crisis stabilization&#xD;
      unit (CSU) who were brought to the CSU by choice of law enforcement. Investigators are&#xD;
      assessing the critical elements of CSUs, examining the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      pairing mobile and technology-assisted aftercare to improve treatment access and retention;&#xD;
      and developing a study protocol to be used in a future multisite randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crisis stabilization units provide law enforcement officers an alternative to jail for&#xD;
      individuals experiencing a substance use or mental health disorder crisis contributing to&#xD;
      criminalized behavior. This study is designed to assist with the diversion of individuals&#xD;
      toward treatment and away from subsequent contact with law enforcement through piloting&#xD;
      mobile and technology assisted aftercare services to persons released from a CSU. One of the&#xD;
      largest barriers to the effectiveness of CSUs is retaining the individual in treatment after&#xD;
      discharge. Logistical factors including transportation, stable housing, and long waitlists&#xD;
      for community-based treatment decrease treatment access. These factors may also be&#xD;
      complicated by an individual's understanding of the importance of remaining in treatment as&#xD;
      well as their motivation to continue. To overcome these barriers and enhance the impact of&#xD;
      CSUs, investigators are developing an expanded model which includes mobile and&#xD;
      technology-assisted modalities that address psychological, behavioral, and&#xD;
      medication-assisted treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a mixed methods design, combining a randomized controlled trial and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews into the feasibility of the pilot program, mobile and technology assisted&#xD;
      aftercare. The randomized controlled trial consists of a 1:1 comparison of the pilot CSU&#xD;
      aftercare services and the treatment as usual (TAU) services for persons releasing from a&#xD;
      CSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n=24) are recruited into the study prior to their discharge from a CSU.&#xD;
      Research team members are alerted of potential eligible participants who meet study criteria&#xD;
      and are soon-to-be discharged by CSU staff. At this point, research team members approach the&#xD;
      eligible participants to conduct the recruitment and consent process. Due to the short length&#xD;
      of stay in a CSU, the research team does one-to-one randomization and pre-randomize of the&#xD;
      pool of participants prior to recruitment. For example, the pre-randomization may results in&#xD;
      Tx Tx Ctrl Tx Ctrl Ctrl assignments for each sequential enrollment in the study. Or it may&#xD;
      result in a different pattern Ctrl Txt Ctrl, etc. Participants are notified of their&#xD;
      randomization status at the end of the consent and baseline data collection interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot program of mobile and technology assisted aftercare service connects participants&#xD;
      with a Community Support Specialist (CSS) who provides mobile aftercare (i.e., meet the&#xD;
      client in their homes or other community settings) up to once a week for 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants also have 24/7 access to behavioral health mobile applications on a smart phone.&#xD;
      Mobile apps recommended to participants include, moodtools-depression aid, virtual hope box,&#xD;
      recovery path, and intellicare hub. All mobile apps have undergone one or a combination of&#xD;
      RCTs, clinical trials, and/or developed with mental health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected through participant interviews and collection of health and administrative&#xD;
      records from agency collaborators. Participants will complete a total of 4 interviews over a&#xD;
      period of 6 months. Baseline interviews will be conducted at study enrollment. Time 1 (T1)&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted 2 weeks post-discharge from the CSU. Time 2 (T2) interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted 3 months post-discharge from CSU. Time 3 (T3) will be conducted 6 months&#xD;
      post-discharge from the CSU. The investigators are monitoring trends in participants during&#xD;
      their participation in the pilot program and all consented participants for the treatment and&#xD;
      control groups will complete a series of interviews. The assessed trends include readmission&#xD;
      to a CSU, employment stability, financial stability, criminal justice involvement, perception&#xD;
      of social support, use of acute and long-term services, and multiple psychosocial measures&#xD;
      listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the mobile and technology-assisted&#xD;
      aftercare is also assessed through qualitative interviews and focus groups with our community&#xD;
      mental health partner. This qualitative data will be used to create a protocol for CSU&#xD;
      aftercare that can respond to diverse jurisdictional characteristics leading to CSU aftercare&#xD;
      services that are feasible and scalable.&#xD;
