  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre cohort study in which the accuracy and the diagnostic&#xD;
      yield of the Stool Processing Kit (SPK) in combination with Xpert Ultra MTB/RIF (Ultra) on&#xD;
      stool samples will be assessed using a microbiological reference standard and a composite&#xD;
      reference standard among children with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FIND and partners have developed a simple Stool Processing Kit (SPK) that will enable&#xD;
      processing of large numbers of stool samples, removal of PCR inhibitors which can be used at&#xD;
      level 1 health facilities in low and middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPK is not a diagnostic kit as such but rather a sample processing method. This study&#xD;
      aims to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert Ultra MTB/RIF (Ultra) combined&#xD;
      with SPK for TB detection using microbiological confirmation on respiratory specimens&#xD;
      (defined as: sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and/or gastric aspirate) as the reference&#xD;
      standard. We will further evaluate operational characteristics, including implementation&#xD;
      considerations that will be needed for the potential roll out of the SPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a comparison of the performance of the SPK with up to two other cnetrifuge-free&#xD;
      stool processing methods will be done on the same stool samples. The first is a method&#xD;
      developed by researchers at the KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation (Single One Step Stool) which&#xD;
      does not require any additional reagents other than the Ultra Sample Reagent. The second is a&#xD;
      method developed by the Paediatric Asian African Network for Tuberculosis and HIV Research&#xD;
      (PAANTHER) group, the Optimized Sucrose Flotation method. Another diagnostic candidate, the&#xD;
      urine Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) test will be assessed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, if the sensitivity of any of these tests is shown to be promising this may support&#xD;
      further research and provide other alternatives to respiratory samples.&#xD;
