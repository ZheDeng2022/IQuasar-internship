  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate Talk STEM Familia (TSF) effects on student and parent scientific&#xD;
      academic vocabulary knowledge and usage, scientific academic vocabulary (SAV) learning&#xD;
      behaviors, academic self efficacy, and satisfaction with the program, including acceptance of&#xD;
      the technology and its usability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators will work with research practice partners Lane Educational Services&#xD;
      District (ESD) to disseminate bilingual electronic and printed recruitment materials to&#xD;
      Latinx families in the elementary and middle schools throughout the 16 school districts in&#xD;
      Lane County, OR. Recruitment materials will direct families to contact the project's&#xD;
      bilingual staff by phone to receive study details and, following a brief screen, to engage in&#xD;
      an informed consent process. 300 eligible Latinx English-learner parent/student dyads will be&#xD;
      recruited. Students will be in grade 4-8; families will speak primarily Spanish in the home;&#xD;
      and families will have a smartphone, tablet, or computer and Internet access at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will administer the pre-test to all 300 parent/student dyads via Qualtrics&#xD;
      and randomize 150 parent/student dyads to the TSF treatment, 150 parent/student dyads to the&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual control condition. Each family will be assigned a non-identifiable user&#xD;
      name linked only to their non-identifiable participant ID. The Investigators will then send&#xD;
      the TSF program materials and links to the treatment group. These materials will include&#xD;
      graphic and video tutorials on TSF set-up and use, including set-up of a wireless bridge that&#xD;
      allows researchers to monitor the non-identifiable program usage. Bilingual telephone support&#xD;
      will be provided during the 1-month set-up period and throughout the 24-week TSF intervention&#xD;
      period. During the intervention, families in the treatment group will be asked to use TSF for&#xD;
      24 weeks. During that time, they will receive 3 notifications/week that prompt them to engage&#xD;
      in program games and activities targeting 72 scientific academic vocabulary (SAV) words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half way through the 24-week intervention period, the Investigators will administer the&#xD;
      mid-test via Qualtrics to all 300 parent/student dyads and following the 24-week&#xD;
      intervention, the Investigators will administer the post-test via Qualtrics to all 300&#xD;
      parent/student dyads. Pre-, mid-, and post-test surveys will measure gains in knowledge and&#xD;
      usage of the 72 SAV words TSF targets, academic self-efficacy, and academic enabling&#xD;
      behaviors. Treatment group dyads will also complete a usability, technology acceptance, and&#xD;
      consumer satisfaction survey at post-test. All 300 parent/student dyads will receive a smart&#xD;
      speaker at pretest, and $100 at mid-test and post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following post-test, parent/student dyads in the treatment-as-usual control condition will&#xD;
      receive TSF program materials.&#xD;

    <description>This study has one intervention and two arms: experimental and treatment as usual. Participants randomized to the treatment condition will receive the TSF technology in addition to the vocabulary instruction, monitoring, or resources delivered by English Language Development programs (ELD) and schools. TSF will deliver frequent, brief, dual-language exercises to help families learn, practice and apply SAV words in conversation. Audio-visual lessons will support learning at all literacy levels, regardless of prior familiarity with STEM subjects. The complete TSF tool will contain approximately 72 minutes of video modeling and 12 hours of interactive exercises delivered over 24-weeks in brief, interactive, easy to assimilate lessons.</description>
