      Phase 1, Partially Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Combined Single Ascending Dose&#xD;
      with Food Effect Cohort Trial (Part 1) and Multiple Ascending Dose Trial (Part 2) to Evaluate&#xD;
      the Safety, Tolerability, and PK of TBAJ-587 in Healthy Adults&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, partially blinded, placebo-controlled, combined single ascending dose&#xD;
      (SAD) trial with a food-effect cohort (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial (Part&#xD;
      2) to be conducted in one trial centre in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Has a single ascending dose (SAD) design with up to 6 planned dose levels with a&#xD;
      food-effect cohort at one of the dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first SAD cohort will be separated into 2 groups. A sentinel group of two participants (1&#xD;
      active and 1 placebo) will be dosed at least 72 hours before the remaining 6 participants (5&#xD;
      active and 1 placebo). The other cohorts will not be separated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First cohort: current total duration and scheduling of safety and PK sampling is based on the&#xD;
      assumption that the expected t1/2 will be 26 days which will ensure coverage for PK and&#xD;
      safety out to approximately 5 half-lives. Refer to Section 1.2.1 Schedule of Assessments &amp;&#xD;
      Procedures for more details. However, the sampling schedule may change depending on the&#xD;
      observed PK profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Dose Level cohorts: scheduling of safety and PK sample collection will be based on the&#xD;
      PK data collected from previous cohorts and could require that the participants return to the&#xD;
      clinic for up to 20 weeks or longer after dosing, depending on what is learned about the&#xD;
      half-life of TBAJ-587.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food-Effect Cohort: Based on exposure levels from preceding SAD cohorts, one of the planned&#xD;
      cohorts and the specific dose will be selected for the food effect (FE) cohort which will&#xD;
      study the effect on PK after a high-calorie, high-fat meal. The food effect on the PK of&#xD;
      TBAJ-587 will be studied in one of the previously completed cohorts using a parallel group&#xD;
      design involving two groups, one group dosed fasted and the other group dosed after a meal.&#xD;
      Additional participants will be recruited to reach a total of 9 active participants,&#xD;
      inclusive of the previously dosed participants, in the fasted group, and 9 additional active&#xD;
      participants will be recruited for the group dosed with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The decision to proceed to the next cohort will be based on 7 days of PK (24-Hour&#xD;
      sample for Day 7 collected on the morning of Day 8) and approximately 14 days of safety data.&#xD;
      A Dose Escalation Meeting (DEM) will take place after the Day 7 PK profile data is available&#xD;
      depending on the time required for PK analysis. The EC will be notified on the outcome of the&#xD;
      DEM and the next cohort will start once the EC grants approval. The scheduling and duration&#xD;
      of the PK and safety data collection for the DEM may be revised based on what is learned&#xD;
      about the PK and safety from the initial cohorts during Part 1 of the trial. This PK and&#xD;
      safety data might also impact the scheduling of the PK collection/sampling and safety&#xD;
      assessments for the remainder of the cohorts in Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to be monitored for safety at time points indicated in the&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessments and Procedures in Section 1.2.1 which may continue up to&#xD;
      approximately 20 weeks after the last dose if indicated by interim PK analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Part 1 (SAD), pharmacokinetic and safety data along with rationale for choosing&#xD;
      the doses for the multiple ascending dose (MAD) part, Part 2, will be submitted to the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (EC). The trial will not proceed to Part 2 until the Sponsor, in conjunction with&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator (PI) and members of the Safety Review Committee (SRC) at the DEM,&#xD;
      has determined that adequate safety, tolerability, and PKs from the Part 1 cohorts have been&#xD;
      demonstrated and all required parties, including the EC, have provided approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Has a multiple ascending dose (MAD) design. Three cohorts are planned for Part 2 and&#xD;
      will be determined based on model predictions of steady state AUC exposures and safety from&#xD;
      Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this MAD part, each participant, based on current assumptions, is expected to be&#xD;
      administered TBAJ-587 or matching placebo daily for 28 days with corresponding PK and safety&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: It is anticipated that the safety and PK sampling for deciding on escalating to the&#xD;
      next dose will be through the morning of Day 15, which will include the PK profile on Day 14&#xD;
      and approximately 21 days of safety data. The DEM will be scheduled after the Day 14 PK&#xD;
      profile data is available depending on the time required for PK analysis. The EC will be&#xD;
      notified, and the next cohort will start once the EC grants approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and PK collection/sampling schedule for the MAD may be revised based on what is&#xD;
      learned about the PK and safety from Part 1 of the trial. Furthermore, with regard to the&#xD;
      DEM, the timing and duration of the Safety and PK sampling needed to decide on escalating to&#xD;
      the next dose will also be determined and finalized based on the PK data obtained from Part&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to be monitored for safety at time points indicated in the&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessments and Procedures in Section 1.2.2 and may continue up to approximately&#xD;
      20 weeks after the last dose if indicated by interim PK analysis. Parts 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohorts: up to three additional cohorts in Part 1 and one additional cohort in&#xD;
      Part 2 may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by the Sponsor to repeat a dose level or to&#xD;
      study another dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation to the next cohort (i.e. next dose level), the decision for the trial to&#xD;
      progress to the planned MAD cohorts (Part 2), any changes to the PK sampling and safety&#xD;
      assessment time points, or the decisions on additional cohorts will not take place until the&#xD;
      Sponsor, in conjunction with the PI and members of the SRC at the DEM, has determined that&#xD;
      adequate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics from the previous cohort have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort. The EC should be notified, and the&#xD;
      decision can only be implemented once the EC grants approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim PK analyses (the prediction PK model may be modified if necessary) and safety&#xD;
      assessments will be performed for the dose escalation decisions, to select the intermediate&#xD;
      dose for the food effect cohort, and to reconsider (if needed) the sampling time points as&#xD;
      the trial progresses. All samples will be sent for analysis and the bioanalytical lab will be&#xD;
      unblinded and run the analysis on active treatment participants only. Data from the analysis&#xD;
      used for the dose escalation meetings will only include active treatment participants and&#xD;
      will be blinded by participant for the Sponsor trial team, PI and SRC members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the trial. Physical examinations, safety laboratory, vital&#xD;
      signs, serial Electrocardiograms (ECGs), Holter monitoring and serial blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for safety and PK assessment of TBAJ-587 and metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As data from each cohort is informative for dose escalation decisions in subsequent cohorts,&#xD;
      review of unblinded data will be conducted by 2 experienced individuals not directly involved&#xD;
      in the study, one of whom must be a physician. Upon completion of the review, they will&#xD;
      communicate to the study team and SRC modifications, if any, that should be implemented for&#xD;
      subsequent cohorts.&#xD;
