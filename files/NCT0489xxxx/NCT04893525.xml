  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label RCT at four Emergency Departments (EDs) in British&#xD;
      Columbia and Alberta. The purpose of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing and standard dosing take-home induction regimens at&#xD;
      enabling patients to successfully complete the induction regimen, and at retaining patients&#xD;
      on opioid agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomize our enrolled patients to receive take-home microdosing or standard dosing&#xD;
      packages of buprenorphine/naloxone. For the microdosing arm, patients immediately start&#xD;
      taking low doses that increase to effective levels without requiring them to go into&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that ED patients provided buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing packages will be&#xD;
      more likely to successfully complete the induction period compare to patients provided&#xD;
      standard dosing packages. We furthermore hypothesize that those provided microdosing will be&#xD;
      more likely to be retained in opioid agonist therapy, and will experience lower overdose,&#xD;
      mortality, and healthcare utilization subsequent to their ED visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centered, open-label RCT will be carried out at four emergency departments (EDs)&#xD;
      across Canada, two in British Columbia (Vancouver General Hospital and St. Paul's Hospital)&#xD;
      and two in Alberta (Royal Alexandra Hospital and Northeast Health Centre). The investigators&#xD;
      will randomize the selected patients to receive take-home microdosing or standard dosing&#xD;
      packages. These will include a five-day regimen in a bubble package, along with&#xD;
      over-the-counter adjunctive medication. The details of the different regimens are outlined in&#xD;
      the &quot;Study Arms&quot; section of this page, and the adjunctive medication regimen is highlighted&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of ED-initiated&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone take-home standard dosing and microdosing interventions for patients&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder identified at the four study ED's, with regard to a) successful&#xD;
      completion of the induction period (primary outcome) and b) retention on opioid agonist&#xD;
      therapy at 30, 90, and 365 days following ED visit, or decreasing overdose, mortality and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be whether the patient filled a prescription for&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone within two weeks of their ED visit (binary variable). If this occurs,&#xD;
      the investigators presume that the patient successfully completed the induction regimen&#xD;
      provided, followed up with a healthcare provider able to prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone,&#xD;
      and was subsequently prescribed ongoing buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The investigators&#xD;
      chose a two-week period, recognizing that patients receiving take-home packages from the ED&#xD;
      may not start taking the induction regimen immediately after the ED visit, but instead may&#xD;
      decide to delay the start of their regimen to a time that is more convenient to them. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that most patients would decide to start within two weeks of their&#xD;
      ED visit. This hypothesis is supported by peer advisors on the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include retention on OAT, which will be assessed using provincial&#xD;
      pharmacy records (PharmaNet and PIN) up to 30, 90 and 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine fatal or non-fatal overdose, mortality, ED visits,&#xD;
      physician visits, admissions, and days admitted within 30, 90 and 365 days (timeframes&#xD;
      plausibly attributable to ED interventions). The investigators expect that successful OAT&#xD;
      initiation would lead to decreased healthcare use, consistent with our previous work&#xD;
      indicating high admissions among persons with recent OUD diagnoses and OAT discontinuation.&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess patients' self-reported experiences with study regimens,&#xD;
      withdrawal, precipitated withdrawal, and comfort via participant surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will offer co-interventions to both the intervention and control groups that will&#xD;
      be outlined in study-related pre-printed clinical ordersets. This will include symptomatic&#xD;
      treatment of nausea/vomiting (dimenhydrinate: 50 mg PO q6h prn - 6 doses), and pain or&#xD;
      myalgias (acetaminophen: 975 mg po q6h prn - 6 doses) (ibuprofen: 400 mg po q6h prn - 6&#xD;
      doses), to use in the first two days of inductions, when the investigators expect withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms to be most challenging, especially for standard dosing. Those receiving microdosing&#xD;
      may experience breakthrough withdrawal if they do not take an adequate dose of overlapping&#xD;
      opioid. Of note, enrolled patients will also be offered counselling with ED social workers to&#xD;
      aid with social or other patient needs (e.g., housing, transportation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT builds on interventions, recruitment, and follow-up procedures successfully tested&#xD;
      in a feasibility study. The study team has expertise in emergency and addictions medicine,&#xD;
      peer engagement, community overdose prevention, biostatistics, health economics, and RCT&#xD;
      implementation, including the high-profile SALOME trial comparing heroin and hydromorphone&#xD;
      treatments in our target population. Knowledge users from provincial health ministry and&#xD;
      regions will ensure scale-up. The study team are engaging people with lived experience&#xD;
      throughout study design, implementation, and interpretation to ensure relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ascertain our primary and secondary outcome measures relating to&#xD;
      completion of induction and retention on OAT, on records of prescriptions filled in&#xD;
      provincial pharmacy databases: PharmaNet in BC, and the Pharmaceutical Information Network in&#xD;
      Alberta. The investigators specifically selected partner sites in BC and Alberta to allow our&#xD;
      team to access these provincial administrative databases for outcome ascertainment, which&#xD;
      will minimize losses to follow-up and strengthen the reliability of our results. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess secondary outcomes of overdose and mortality by linking our study&#xD;
      cohort to the BC Centre for Disease Control Overdose Cohort (for patients enrolled in BC),&#xD;
      and to provincial Vital Statistics data (Alberta and BC). The investigators will assess&#xD;
      secondary outcomes related to healthcare utilization by linking our study cohort to&#xD;
      provincial databases on emergency department visits (National Ambulatory Care Reporting&#xD;
      System) and hospitalizations (Discharge Abstract Data) in Alberta and BC. We will access all&#xD;
      administrative databases through Population Data BC (PopData BC) and Alberta Health Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will inform urgent development of effective ED buprenorphine/naloxone programs to&#xD;
      improve OAT access for people at high risk of overdose. The investigators will leverage our&#xD;
      networks of policy makers, public health leaders, and health providers to enable rapid&#xD;
      dissemination of findings in guidelines and policies across Canada.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include ED patients ≥18 years of age with opioid use disorder who are being&#xD;
        discharged from the ED. We will define opioid use disorder as non-medical opioid use in the&#xD;
        previous 30 days and a positive score for opioid dependency based on the validated Rapid&#xD;
        Opioid Dependence Screen (RODS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will also be assessed by the treating physician or degree of clinical opioid&#xD;
        withdrawal, based on the clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) score. Patients will be&#xD;
        eligible for the take-home study interventions if they have a COWS score &lt;=12, as a score&#xD;
        greater than 12 would mean the patient is a candidate for standard buprenorphine induction&#xD;
        in the ED at that moment in time, and would therefore not be eligible for outpatient study&#xD;
        interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active withdrawal at time of ED assessment (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score [COWS]&#xD;
             &gt;12)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe communication barriers that inhibit patients' understanding of study procedures&#xD;
             and interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking opioids for cancer or palliative-care related indications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are deemed unsafe to approach by ED providers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incarceration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not a resident of the province in which they are seeking care (BC or Alberta)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Actively receiving OAT, defined as having filled a prescription for one of the&#xD;
             following medications in the 5 days prior to ED presentation: buprenorphine/naloxone,&#xD;
             methadone, sustained release morphine, injectable hydromorphone, injectable&#xD;
             diacetylmorphine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction or&#xD;
             strictures) or any diseases/conditions that affect bowel transit (e.g., ileus of any&#xD;
             type).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected surgical abdomen (e.g., acute appendicitis or pancreatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe CNS depression, increased cerebrospinal or intracranial pressure, and head&#xD;
             injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complicating patient factors that make home inductions from the ED unsafe and/or that&#xD;
             require expert consultation for consideration of induction in an observed setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These factors include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory or liver dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent withdrawal or intoxication from sedatives (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active prescription for sedative medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors within the past 14 days&#xD;
