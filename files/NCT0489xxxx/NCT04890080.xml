      110 COPD patients who were participated in the PR program were included in the study. Resting&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many studies, it has been reported that baroreceptor activity and heart rate variability&#xD;
      decrease and resting heart rate (RHR) increases in COPD patients due to changes in cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic function. Among the recommendations regarding pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and&#xD;
      exercise training in COPD patients, approaches such as including practices targeting RHR and&#xD;
      developing implementation strategies that improve the cardiovascular system are recommended.&#xD;
      The primary aim of our study is to examine the effect of comprehensive exercise training&#xD;
      consisting of breathing, aerobic and strengthening exercises on RHR in COPD patients, and&#xD;
      secondarily to determine the factors that affect RHR change after PR in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 COPD patients who were participated in the PR program were included in our retrospective&#xD;
      study. Resting Heart Rate , pulmonary functions, functional capacity, perception of dyspnea,&#xD;
      quality of life and psychological symptoms compared before and after PR.&#xD;

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD); The HADS questionnaire has seven items each for depression and anxiety subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three, with three denoting highest anxiety or depression level. A total subscale score of &gt;8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>Exercise training consisted of supervised breathing, aerobic, strengthening and stretching exercises for 8 weeks, 2 days a week. Breathing exercises included pursed lip, diaphragmatic, thoracic expansion and basal expansion exercises. Strength training included the lower and upper extremities, and it was performed 8-10 repetitions, either against gravity or using free weight, according to patient tolerance.</description>
