  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this mechanistic study is to evaluate the vasodilatory effects of&#xD;
      AZD3427 in adult patients with heart failure and will be performed at approximately 2 study&#xD;
      sites in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll patients in 2 cohorts in parallel: 1 cohort of patients with heart&#xD;
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 1 cohort of patients with heart failure&#xD;
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Each cohort plans to enroll at least 7 evaluable&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the same sequence of 5 intra-arterial (IA) infusions into the&#xD;
      brachial artery, consisting of a baseline saline infusion of approximately 20 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by 3 sequential infusions of AZD3427 at ascending doses of approximately 10 minutes&#xD;
      (each) and a washout saline infusion of approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the study will last at least 51 days and up to 99 days, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of 1 to 42 days (which will include baseline echocardiography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single-day treatment period during which patients will stay at study site until at&#xD;
           least 4 hours after the end of infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up period of 49 to 56 days after the end of the last infusion including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call on Day 2 (within 24 ± 6 hours post-infusion) A follow-up visit on Day&#xD;
      8 (+ 3 days) A follow-up visit on Day 29 (± 2 days) A follow-up visit on Day 50 (+ 7 days)&#xD;
