  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A remotely administered study, non-randomized, non-blinded, controlled parallel assignment&#xD;
      phase 2 trial to determine if oral inosine or inositol hexaphosphate will provide an&#xD;
      effective long-term therapy to combat or slow neural damage progression either concurrently&#xD;
      with existing iron chelation therapy or during the natural course of the disorder. Clinical&#xD;
      changes in hearing, balance, and mobility, and cognition will be assessed for 36 months&#xD;
      through patient-reported outcomes of study assigned assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsules containing over-the-counter dietary supplement formulas of inosine 500 mg or 500 mg&#xD;
      of inositol hexaphosphate(IP6) will be taken orally, two capsules two times per day for 36&#xD;
      months. Initial screening will determine patient arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before dosing begins, patients will submit copies of previous audiogram results (3yrs),&#xD;
      radiology reports (3yrs), and MRI series (3yrs) if available and complete baseline assessment&#xD;
      activities: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) administered remotely, Timed Up, and Go&#xD;
      (TUG), 2-Minute Walk Test (2-MWT), The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale,&#xD;
      iSS-QoL (custom) patient outcome reported&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will take place four times: baseline, end-of-year 1 (12mo), end-of-year 2 (24mo),&#xD;
      end-of-study (36mo).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Slow the Rate of Clinical Decline</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Deceleration of clinical decline will be quantified by evaluating three primary areas- hearing, balance and mobility, and cognition. End-of-study quantifiable slowing of the historical and year-1 mean rate of decline across all three study areas with a measurable increase on Year-3 iSS-QOL from Year-1 iSS-QOL scoring.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Adverse Event Development [Safety and Tolerability}</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic use of antioxidants through a safe, effective dose range and schedule to the extent that the risk-benefit relationship is acceptable for the patient. Evaluation will include the overall adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Improved Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of change in points on the iSS-QoL(custom) from baseline assessment to end-of-study will be scored based on 16 questions with a point range of 1-5. Higher end-of-study scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of change in points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale from baseline assessment to end-of-study will be assessed for patients in each treatment group. The MoCA assesses attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Points (range 0-30) are awarded for the correct completion of MoCA tasks. Cognition decline will be defined as ≥ 3pt decline of total MoCA score from baseline assessment to final 36mo testing assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Hearing</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline audiogram will be compared to the post-study audiogram for each patient. The hearing levels in decibels against the frequency in hertz will be compared pre-study, baseline, and end-of-study for average rate-of-decline. A paired t-test will be used to determine statistical significance in the average difference in the threshold hearing level at any particular frequency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Mobility and Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG), 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT), and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale will be scored individually. The baseline score will be compared to the annual and end-of-study scores for each patient. A paired t-test will be used to determine statistical significance in the average difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Hemosiderin Reduction (IP6 Arm)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Visible hemosiderin deposition reduction on MRI series from baseline visit to end-of-study. MRIs will be objectively analyzed for changes in iron deposition.</description>
