      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness. It is caused by influenza viruses that&#xD;
      infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Vaccines are given to teach the body to&#xD;
      prevent or fight infection. Researchers want to study a new vaccine to prevent the seasonal&#xD;
      flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the FluMos-v1 vaccine is safe and how the body responds to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-50 who received at least one licensed flu vaccine from 2016 through&#xD;
      the 2019-2020 influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened through a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested for COVID-19. They may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the FluMos-v1 vaccine or the Flucelvax vaccine. It will be injected&#xD;
      in the upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a diary card for 7 days. They will record any symptoms they have.&#xD;
      They will be given a thermometer to check their temperature. They will also be given a ruler&#xD;
      to measure any skin changes at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have about 10 study visits. They will be asked how they are feeling and if&#xD;
      they have taken any medications. They will have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have oral mucosal samples collected using a thin swab. They may have nose&#xD;
      and throat secretions collected using a thin swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have optional apheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in a&#xD;
      vein in one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be&#xD;
      returned through a needle in a vein in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 40 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of the mosaic quadrivalent influenza vaccine&#xD;
      VRC-FLUMOS0111-00-VP (FluMos-v1). The hypotheses are that the FluMos-v1 vaccine is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable and will elicit an immune response. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the investigational vaccine in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are&#xD;
      related to immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine and dosing regimen compared with the&#xD;
      licensed inactivated seasonal Flucelvax (Registered Trademark) quadrivalent influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (QIV) in Healthy Adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational vaccine FluMos-v1 was developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC),&#xD;
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is composed of the&#xD;
      following 4 influenza strains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: A/Idaho/07/2018&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: A/Perth/1008/2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/Victoria lineage: B/Colorado/06/2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/Yamagata lineage: B/Phuket/3073/2013&#xD;
&#xD;
      FluMos-v1 is supplied in a single-use vial at a concentration of 180 mcg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA licensed inactivated 2020-2021 QIV Flucelvax(Registered Trademark) was developed by&#xD;
      Seqirus, Inc. and is composed of the following 4 influenza strains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/Victoria lineage: B/Washington/02/2019-like virus&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/Yamagata lineage: B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flucelvax(Registered Trademark) is supplied in a single-use syringe at 15 mcg HA of each of&#xD;
      the four influenza strains, for a total of 60 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FluMos-v1 and Flucelvax(Registered Trademark) will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in&#xD;
      the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults between the ages of 18-50 years inclusive will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single dose of&#xD;
      FluMos-v1 vaccine in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1A-1B, five subjects will receive a&#xD;
      dose of 20 mcg of FluMos-v1. If the 20 mcg dose is assessed as safe and tolerable, enrollment&#xD;
      will begin for Group 2A-2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 2A-2B, subjects will receive a dose of 60 mcg of FluMos-v1. In Group 3A-3B, subjects&#xD;
      will receive the licensed QIV Flucelvax(Registered Trademark) and may enroll at any time&#xD;
      after the study is open to accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol requires 1 vaccination visit, about 8 follow-up visits, and a telephone contact&#xD;
      on the day after vaccination. For all groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a 7-day diary card. Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and&#xD;
      monitoring of hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for 40 weeks following vaccine administration and through an&#xD;
      influenza season.&#xD;
