  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the product M89 probiotic fractions in&#xD;
      improving the symptoms of rosacea patients with sensitive skin after 30 days of treatment, in&#xD;
      comparison with an area treated with the habitual skin care product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 women with sensitive skin (positive reaction to stinging test), suffering from persistent&#xD;
      centrofacial erythema of rosacea with no more than 3 papules and pustules apply the product&#xD;
      on half a face, twice a day, for 30 days. The subjects use their habitual skin care product&#xD;
      on the other side of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product efficacy is supported by significant improvements in the mean basal values of the&#xD;
      following instrumental parameters: skin hydration (increase), trans-epidermal water loss&#xD;
      (decrease), skin erythema (a* parameter decrease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and the tolerability of the product is also showed by a visual clinical&#xD;
      assessment of the face skin conditions and by stinging test. Digital images of the face of&#xD;
      the subjects were also taken at each control time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the volunteers express their judgement on the efficacy and the pleasantness of&#xD;
      the product by means of a self-assessment questionnaire.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The test was carried out in a temperature and humidity-controlled room (24 ± 2 °C; 50 ± 10 %&#xD;
      r.h.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 female subjects, between 20 and 60 years old, phototype I-IV according to Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      type classification, with sensitive skin (positive reaction to stinging test) and suffering&#xD;
      from persistent centrofacial erythema of rosacea with no more than 3 papules and pustules&#xD;
      were selected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers were asked not to wash their face for at least 2 hours before performing the&#xD;
      assessments and not to apply any products on the face for 12 hours before the basal visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were recruited for the study if they showed a positive response to stinging test&#xD;
      performed with the application of a solution at 15% lactic acid on the nasolabial folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers rated the burning/stinging/itching/painful sensations perceived on each&#xD;
      nasolabial fold after 2.5 and 5 minutes from the application, on the basis of the following&#xD;
      scale: 0=no burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation; 1=mild&#xD;
      burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation; 2=moderate burning/stinging/itching/painful&#xD;
      sensation; 3=severe burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the sum of the score of the two time points was ≥ 3 for each nasolabial fold, the subject&#xD;
      was considered a 'stinger', a subject with sensitive skin and could be selected for the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected subjects filled in a questionnaire on sensitive skin. The subjects applied the&#xD;
      product M89 Probiotic Fractions on half a face, twice a day, in the morning and in the&#xD;
      evening, for 30 days. They put two drops of the product in the palm of their hand and gently&#xD;
      massage with their fingertips on half face. The face skin had to be cleaned and dried before&#xD;
      the application of the product. The subjects used their standard skin care product on the&#xD;
      side of the face not treated with M89 Probiotic Fractions. The subjects were allowed to use&#xD;
      their habitual foundation and makeup products on the whole face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side of application of the product M89 Probiotic Fractions (right or left side of the&#xD;
      face) was randomized among the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of subject number and subsequent placement on the randomization chart were&#xD;
      made in order of appearance at the study centre on the first day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations were performed at the baseline, after 15 days and/or after 30 days&#xD;
      of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental Evaluations: baseline, after 15 days and after 30 days of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin hydration by Corneometer CM825&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) by Tewameter TM 300 MDD 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin erythema by Chromameter CR400&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements were performed on the cheeks, on the same location at each control time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital images of the face of the subjects were also taken by means of Fotofinder Dermoscope&#xD;
      Ver. 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation: baseline, after 15 days and after 30 days of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visual clinical evaluation of each side of the face was performed by the technician related&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  erythema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  desquamation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of papules and pustules (visual count)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were asked to refer about skin tightness, skin dryness, burning, itching,&#xD;
      stinging sensations perceived on each side of the face answering to the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin tightness: Do you feel skin tightness? Skin dryness: Does your skin feel dry? Burning&#xD;
      sensation: Do you suffer from burning sensation of your skin? Itching sensation: Do you&#xD;
      suffer from itching sensation of your skin? Stinging sensation: Do you suffer from&#xD;
      stinging/tingling sensation of your skin? The parameters erythema, desquamation, skin&#xD;
      tightness, skin dryness, burning, itching and stinging were scored according to a 0-10 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stinging Test: baseline, after 15 days and after 30 days of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A solution at 15% lactic acid was applied on the nasolabial folds of each subject. The&#xD;
      volunteers rated the burning/stinging/itching/pain sensations perceived on each nasolabial&#xD;
      fold after 2.5 and 5 minutes from the application, on the basis of the following scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0=no burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mild burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. moderate burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. severe burning/stinging/itching/painful sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Skin Surface Biopsy technique (SSSB): after 30 days of treatment The face of the&#xD;
      volunteers was cleaned with ether to remove traces of sebum. Then a drop (about 0.05 ml) of&#xD;
      cyanoacrylate glue was homogeneously applied to an area of 1 cm 2 at one end of a microscope&#xD;
      slide. Then the slide (SSSB 1) was put against one cheek. The slide was left in place until&#xD;
      the cyanoacrylate changed in consistency and then gently removed. A second SSSB (SSSB 2) was&#xD;
      performed at the same site immediately after the first. The procedure was repeated on the&#xD;
      other cheek in order to collect slides related to both the areas (treated with M89 and with&#xD;
      the habitual skin care product). The SSSB 2 were analyzed with a microscope (x40) and the&#xD;
      Demodex density (number of Demodex in 1 cm2) was determined for each slide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction questionnaire: after 15 days and after 30 days of treatment The subjects&#xD;
      expressed their opinion on the efficacy and the pleasantness of the product by filling in a&#xD;
      questionnaire referred to the side of the face treated with M89 Probiotic Fractions.&#xD;
