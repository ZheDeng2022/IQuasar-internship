    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study will be focused on the following issues. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      effect of radial extracorporeal shock wave on the pressure pain threshold and disability in&#xD;
      stroke hemiplegic shoulder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Further understanding of rotator cuff tendon impairment and other shoulder soft tissue&#xD;
      structural abnormalities in stroke patients may help clinicians in assigning more complete&#xD;
      therapeutic plans to hemiplegic patients. The radial extra-corporeal shock-wave therapy has&#xD;
      promising results in patients with musculoskeletal problems and in those with various causes&#xD;
      of HSP, including spasticity, rotator cuff problems, adhesive capsulitis, and complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The pain pressure threshold (PPT) assessment by using pressure algometer procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain pressure threshold measurement will be obtained in the same order for all patients.The pressure will be applied with 0.785 cm2 rubber tip at a rate of 1 kg/cm2/sec 27 at the site of measurement. The measurement will at the mid-belly of the deltoid of the painful shoulder. The tip of the algometer will be positioned on this specific point. By pushing the algometer, the force will be applied to the mid belly of deltoid gradually increased. The patients will not allowed to see the algometer display in any moment, and, as soon as the volunteers experience a painful sensation, they say &quot;stop&quot;, the algometer will immediately release and the force (in Kpa) will be read from the display. Pain pressure threshold will be measured three times per patient on each site and the average will be calculated and will be used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder range of motion assessment by using magnetic inclinometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Total shoulder flexion will be measured with full elbow extension and leading with the thumb to ensure consistent rotation. The inclinometer will placed along the shaft of the humerus perpendicular to the plane of motion. Total shoulder abduction will be measured with full elbow extension and leading with the thumb to ensure consistent rotation. The inclinometer will placed along the shaft of the humerus perpendicular to the plane of motion.</description>
