      This is a prospective study aimed at direct comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of treatment of children from 6 years of age suffering from moderate and severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis using a genetically engineered biological drug and classical immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical and anamnestic data, compliance with the inclusion / exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      the study included 160 patients from 6 years old, with moderate / severe atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial indices were assessed: SCORAD- Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (index for assessing&#xD;
      the severity of atopic dermatitis); NRS- numeric rating scale for itch; CDLQI - The&#xD;
      Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index; POEM- Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure&#xD;
      (personalized assessment of eczema) and laboratory parameters: alanine aminotransferase,&#xD;
      aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase,&#xD;
      gamma-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum albumin, blood urea&#xD;
      specific IgE to food and household allergens, indicators of a clinical blood test, indicators&#xD;
      of a general analysis of urine, indicators of a biochemical analysis of urine (creatinine,&#xD;
      urea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the presence of concomitant allergic pathology (bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis), the&#xD;
      CSMS [Combined Symptom and Medication Score] were additionally assessed (Scale for assessing&#xD;
      nasal symptoms of rhinitis, taking into account the need for medication); VAS - Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (visual analog scale); ACT- Asthma Control Test. Subsequently, systemic therapy was&#xD;
      prescribed: metorexat (40 people), mycophenolate mofetil (40 people), cyclosporine (40&#xD;
      people) dupilumab (40 people).&#xD;
