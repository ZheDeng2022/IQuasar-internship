      1. Main purpose Objective to study the tolerance and safety of single and multiple&#xD;
           administration of repeated 28-day cycles of AL8326 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Secondary purpose 1) Preliminary analysis of the pharmacokinetic characteristics and&#xD;
           efficacy of repeated 28-day cycles of AL8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           tumors; 2) According to the results of phase I tolerance test and pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
           appropriate dosage and regimen were recommended for phase II clinical trial;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safetyand efficacy of 28-day cycles of AL8326&#xD;
      therapy. The study is divided into three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part I To evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and general safety during the first&#xD;
           28-day cycle of Al8326 therapy and to evaluate the MTD. It will include a evaluation of&#xD;
           3 subjects per cohort in a 3+3 design in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part II Subject will receive a dose from Part 1 of this study for continuous 28-Day&#xD;
           cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part III This design adopts 3 + 3 dose de-escalation method for exploration. At the same&#xD;
           time, the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics were observed.&#xD;
