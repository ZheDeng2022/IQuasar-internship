      The investigators study aimed to observe the effect of motor learning-based&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation on quality of life in children with cerebral palsy during the Covid-19&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy; It is defined as a permanent, non-progressive disorder that occurs as a&#xD;
      result of the effects of the developing fetal or infant brain for different reasons in&#xD;
      prenatal, perinatal or postnatal periods. Children with cerebral palsy experience fundamental&#xD;
      limitations in the postural control of static and dynamic tasks such as sitting, standing,&#xD;
      and walking. However, children with cerebral palsy need rehabilitation. The COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      prevents effective provision of rehabilitation services for children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
      However; Lack of access to rehabilitation services in individuals with cerebral palsy during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for alternative and complementary methods.&#xD;
      During the Covid-19 pandemic process, the tele-rehabilitation process will be able to achieve&#xD;
      functional and social participation in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

    <description>The 35-item PedsQL consists of seven subscales: Daily Activities, School Activities, Movement and Balance, Pain, Fatigue, Eating Activities, Speaking and Communication. The scale consists of a child self-report and a parent report. The scale questions the degree of problems the children have experienced in the last month. Item scores are converted linearly backwards on a 0-100 scale (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0), so higher scores indicate better health-related quality of Life.Subscale scores are calculated by dividing the total score of the items answered by the number of items answered. There is no scale total score, subscales have calculated mean scores. The higher the average score for an area (subscale) indicates that there are fewer problems in that area and the higher the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Telerehabilitation İntervention:&#xD;
Training videos will be sent to the families of the children in the tele-rehabilitation group before starting to work. With the training videos, it is aimed to teach the exercises to be done to the families. Treatment will be applied by their families for 8 weeks, 2 days a week, 40 minutes a day. Physiotherapist will attend the sessions by video conference method. Video conference calls will be made by phone over the WhatsApp application.&#xD;
Motor learning:&#xD;
The first 10 minutes will start with active stretching Functional lying in a sitting position, Functional lying with feet together in a standing position. rolling the pilates ball on the wall, walking on its side. Going up and down stairs at different heights. Walking across different surfaces and obstacles. Getting up from chairs of different heights, sitting and extending the object taken from the ground. Functional exercises suitable for the child's level.</description>
