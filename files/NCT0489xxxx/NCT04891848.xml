  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is the most common neurological complaint accounting for % 1 to % 4 in the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED).Every year, nearly one million people with headache attacks have been&#xD;
      consulted by healthcare professionals at the emergency room in the United States.The&#xD;
      International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) divided headaches into two main&#xD;
      groups: primary headaches and secondary headaches. The vast majority of cases who presented&#xD;
      with acute headache attack in ED had a diagnosis of primary headache disorders (tension- type&#xD;
      headache, migraine, cluster- type headache, and other primary headaches). However, secondary&#xD;
      headache is often associated with underlying intracranial pathologies, and noted in % 10 of&#xD;
      cases in emergency rooms. Despite the frequent presence of primary headaches, limited time&#xD;
      setting and busy periods of medical assessment, leading diagnostic and therapeutic options&#xD;
      due to the pathophysiological factors to be overlooked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study in the emergency care setting has explored the role of inflammation in&#xD;
      patients with acute migraine and TTH. Investigators aimed to explore inflammatory markers&#xD;
      [white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio&#xD;
      (NLR), and platelet / lymphocyte ratio (PLR)] in complete blood count (CBC) among MA, MO, and&#xD;
      TTH participants who admitted to ED with acute headache attack and healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      Study design This prospective study was completed at an emergency care of a tertiary referral&#xD;
      hospital between May 2018 and May 2019. The hospital admits a total of 45.000 adult emergency&#xD;
      patients per year. This study was approved by the local ethics Committee of Kocaeli&#xD;
      University (KOU/KAE: 2018/192) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written and&#xD;
      informed consent form was obtained from all individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Investigators screened 720 patients who admitted to the ED with an acute&#xD;
      headache attack. Clinical evaluation was performed by an experienced neurologist.&#xD;
      Consequently, 51 patients with MA, 51 patients with MO, and 48 patients with TTH according to&#xD;
      the diagnostic criterias of ICHD-3 and 80 age- and gender matched healthy controls were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Detailed sociodemographic and clinical data collected using&#xD;
      face-to-face interview. Visual analog scale (VAS) documented to measure the intensity of pain&#xD;
      in patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators included adult participants aged between 18 and 65 years. Also, subjects were&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion if their body mass index (BMI) ranges were between18 kg/m2 and 30&#xD;
      kg/m2. Patients with secondary headaches, trauma, malignancy, chronic inflammatory disorders,&#xD;
      infectious diseases, hematologic abnormalities, a prior history of surgery (within the&#xD;
      preceding 6 months), receiving analgesics, antibiotics, blood transfusion and other blood&#xD;
      products, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis Complete blood count (CBC) parameters [WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte,&#xD;
      platelet] of patients and control groups were obtained from 2 cc peripheral venous blood&#xD;
      samples (purple K3 EDTA tubes, Beckman Coulter DXH 800 Analyzer) during admission. NLR and&#xD;
      PLR were calculated by dividing absolute neutrophil to absolute lymphocyte count and absolute&#xD;
      platelet to absolute lymphocyte count, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis SPSS 17.0 statistical software package program (IBM Corporation, USA)&#xD;
      was used for the analysis. Descriptive data were presented using numbers, percentages (%) ,&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variables were analyzed by using chi-square (χ2) test.&#xD;
      Normality tests (Shapiro-Wilks, Lilliefors, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov) were used for all&#xD;
      parameters. Due to the non-normal distribution of CBC values, Kruskal-Wallis and Tamhane's T2&#xD;
      post hoc tests were used to compare between patients with MA, MO, TTH, and healthy controls.&#xD;
      A p value ≤ 0.05 considered statistically significant.&#xD;
