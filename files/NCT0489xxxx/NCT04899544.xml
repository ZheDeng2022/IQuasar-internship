  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of a 16-week center-based Pivotal&#xD;
      Response Treatment (PRT-C) versus home-based Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT-H) in targeting&#xD;
      social communication deficits in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with&#xD;
      significant language delay. The two groups will also be compared to a control group that&#xD;
      consists of children who are receiving treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
