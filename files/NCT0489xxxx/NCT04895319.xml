      The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and was conducted in compliance with the&#xD;
      World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on medical research. A total of 335&#xD;
      patients who underwent oral and maxillofacial reconstruction were recorded from Jan 2014 to&#xD;
      Jun 2020. Reconstruction with computer-assisted surgery ( CAS), which included, virtual&#xD;
      surgical planning, computer-aided design-computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) surgical&#xD;
      guides/templates and pre-bent plates on 3D printed models. Reasons for tissue defect were&#xD;
      oncologic, osteoradionecrosis, trauma and osteoporosis. Patients undergoing dental implant&#xD;
      placement and orthognathic surgery were excluded. Finally, 136 patients were selected and the&#xD;
      reasons for partial or abandon surgical plan performance were described and analyzed.&#xD;
