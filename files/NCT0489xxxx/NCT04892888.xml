  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a survey of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in Japanese people at high risk of&#xD;
      developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. The study sponsor will not be involved in how the&#xD;
      participants are treated but will provide instructions on how the clinics will record what&#xD;
      happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to check for side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in&#xD;
      this group. This will be from the first vaccination to 28 days after the second vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of visits to the clinic will depend on the clinic's standard practice.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (Adverse Event: AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. It does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (Including laboratory abnormalities), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Specified AEs (Local Reactions) at the Vaccination Site</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Specified AEs (Local reactions) at the vaccination site are defined as injection site pain, redness and swelling. The participants will evaluate the symptoms at the vaccination site (local reactions) and systemic symptoms (systemic events) and will record with the health observation diary. Percentage of participants with specified AEs (local reactions) at the vaccination site will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Specified AEs (Systemic Events)</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Specified AEs (Systemic events) are defined as vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, malaise, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The participants will evaluate the symptoms at the vaccination site (local reactions) and systemic symptoms (systemic events) and will record with the health observation diary. Percentage of participants with specified AEs (systemic events) at the vaccination site will be reported.</description>
