  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus the investigator's choice of chemotherapy will&#xD;
      be assessed compared to placebo plus the investigator's choice of chemotherapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of chemotherapy-candidate hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is superior&#xD;
      to placebo and chemotherapy in regards to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) or overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) in participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score&#xD;
      (CPS) ≥1 and ≥10.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 33 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The PFS in participants with a CPS of ≥10, as assessed by BICR, will be presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 75 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTD is defined as the time to the first onset of a ≥10-point deterioration (decrease) from baseline in diarrhea score (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 17). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The TTD, as assessed based on a ≥10-point deterioration (decrease) from baseline in diarrhea score, will be presented in participants with a CPS of ≥10. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.
