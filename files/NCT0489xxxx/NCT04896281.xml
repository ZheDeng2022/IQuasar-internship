  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphenylalaninemia is not only present in patients with congenital phenylketonuria. In&#xD;
      adults with critical illness, hyperphenylalaninemia is noted in some patients and is&#xD;
      associated with high mortality rate. Hyperphenylalaninemia can cause metabolic acidosis,&#xD;
      brain dysfunction, and metabolic disturbance. We would like to see whether the&#xD;
      phenylalanine-free milk for congenital phenylketonuria is also effective in lowering the&#xD;
      blood phenylalanine concentrations in patients with critical illness in ICU and&#xD;
      hyperphenylalaninemia.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intensive care unit often suffer from problems such as high metabolic rate&#xD;
      and high tissue breakdown rate under the severe stress of critical diseases. Phenylalanine is&#xD;
      an amino acid in the human body and is rich in muscle tissue. However, current studies have&#xD;
      found that if the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood is abnormally increased, it may&#xD;
      indicate that the tissue is decomposing in large quantities. This phenomenon may be related&#xD;
      to disease severity. Our recent observational study of patients in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      found that patients with elevated blood phenylalanine had a four-fold increase in mortality&#xD;
      within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common cause of phenylalanine concentration elevation in the blood is a rare disease&#xD;
      that occurs in infants with congenital metabolic abnormalities, called congenital&#xD;
      phenylketonuria (PKU). The abnormally elevated phenylalanine concentration can lead to&#xD;
      toxicity and cause brain hypoplasia, mental retardation, consciousness disturbance, and even&#xD;
      seizure. These PKU patients must be treated with milk diet that contains low amount of&#xD;
      phenylalanine in order to lower the phenylalanine concentrations. At present, in medicine,&#xD;
      although there have been clear medical care strategy for infants with congenital PKU, there&#xD;
      is still no clear medical care strategy for adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research purpose: To investigate whether patients with high blood phenylalanine concentration&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit can reduce the blood phenylalanine concentration by a diet without&#xD;
      phenylalanine, so as to develop personalized high-quality and specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to have complete study in 30 patients (based on our previous study, to recruit 30&#xD;
      patients with high phenylalanine, we need 100 ICU patients for screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol Phenylalanine-free milk will be fed for 3 days after enrollment. The&#xD;
      milk is purchased from ABBOTT company. The content of the whole nutrition for a daily need is&#xD;
      also personalized based on the calculation by our dieticians. After the completion of the&#xD;
      study, diet will be back to normal diet for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end points: the 3-day study period completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and examination for Phenylalanine measurement (DBS) Fasting phenylalanine&#xD;
      level will be measured by LC/MS-MS using the dry blood spot method (blood sample is collected&#xD;
      by finger sting) in all included patients in the next morning after informed consent signed.&#xD;
      Blood applied on filter cards is dried for at least 3 h at room temperature. DBS cards are&#xD;
      stored at room temperature for 0-6 days prior to analyses. Phenylalanine concentrations in&#xD;
      DBS are measured with LC-MS/MS, using a calibration curve in 0.1 N HCl. The report will be&#xD;
      received one day after dry blood spot collected. Once the result of measurement shows the&#xD;
      concentration of phenylalanine &gt;112 uM, this patient is enrolled for formal study. All&#xD;
      enrolled patients will take the measurement of phenylalanine levels by dry blood spot every&#xD;
      12 hours for the following 4 days until study protocol finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylalanine measurement by UPLC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the meanwhile, fasting blood will be collected by venipuncture in EDTA-containing tubes on&#xD;
      the morning of screening, 2 and 4 days after diet intervention. The collected blood will be&#xD;
      used to measure phenylalanine level by UPLC (ultra-performance liquid chromatography). Plasma&#xD;
      samples (100μL) are precipitated with 10% sulfosalicylic acid. After protein precipitation&#xD;
      and centrifugation, derivatization is initiated by AQC in acetonitrile. Amino acids are then&#xD;
      analyzed using the ACQUITY UPLC System, consisting of a Binary Solvent Manager, a Sample&#xD;
      Manager, and a Tunable UV detector. We use EmpowerTM 2 Software to control the system and&#xD;
      collect data. Separations are performed on a 2.1×100mm ACQUITY BEH C18 column at a flow rate&#xD;
      of 0.70mL/min. The average intra-assay coefficient of variation is 2.6% for phenylalanine.&#xD;
      The total coefficient of variation is 2.7% for phenylalanine. The detection limit is 3.3μM&#xD;
      for phenylalanine. The linear range is 25-500 μM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APACHE II scores Disease severity is evaluated by calculating APACHE II score on the first&#xD;
      day of ICU admission.&#xD;
