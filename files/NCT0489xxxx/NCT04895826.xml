    <textblock>
      Back pain affects one-third of the UK population every year with a huge impact on the health&#xD;
      service and economy. The aim of this study is to test the validity of a computer-vision (CV)&#xD;
      technology that uses cameras on phones/tablets/webcams to assess a person's movement and&#xD;
      function with the ultimate goal to use the CV system to screen for back pain conditions.&#xD;
      Participants with and without back pain will be included in the study and they will be asked&#xD;
      to perform standard functional movements that would be used for a physiotherapy assessment&#xD;
      for a back condition. The participants will also perform these movements in front of a camera&#xD;
      for video recordings to be analysed by the CV system. The measurements by the CV system will&#xD;
      be compared to the measurements by the physiotherapist. Additionally, participants will&#xD;
      perform and record videos of the same set of movements at home to test the feasibility of the&#xD;
      CV system in a home environment.&#xD;

      Back pain affects one-third of the UK population every year with a huge impact on the health&#xD;
      service and economy. One specific back pain condition is Axial Spondyloarthropathy (AxSpa),&#xD;
      which is an inflammatory spinal arthritis that causes pain and stiffness. This life-long&#xD;
      condition presents in the early twenties as 'regular' back pain. Due to its similarity to&#xD;
      other back pain conditions, there is an average 8.5-year delay to diagnosis. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to test the validity of a computer-vision (CV) technology that uses cameras on&#xD;
      phones/tablets/webcams to assess a person's movement and function with the ultimate goal to&#xD;
      use the CV system to screen for back pain conditions, such as AxSpa. The CV system&#xD;
      development is led by the GoodBoost Wellbeing Limited and The National Axial&#xD;
      Spondyloarthritis Society (NASS) is supporting the recruitment of people living with AxSpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CV system that has been developed is a form of artificial intelligence video analysis&#xD;
      which is able to automatically measure specific functional movements captured on video. To&#xD;
      validate this CV system, this study is designed to compare it to the clinical gold standard&#xD;
      measurement by a physiotherapist. Participants with and without back pain will be included in&#xD;
      the study and they will be asked to perform standard functional movements that would be used&#xD;
      for a physiotherapy assessment for a back condition. The participants will also perform these&#xD;
      movements in front of a camera for video recordings to be analysed by the CV system. The&#xD;
      measurements by the CV system will be compared to the measurements by the physiotherapist.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will perform and record videos of the same set of movements at&#xD;
      home to test the feasibility of the CV system in a home environment.&#xD;
