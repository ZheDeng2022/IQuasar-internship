    <textblock>
      The current markers of inflammation that govern antibiotic treatment have their significant&#xD;
      limitations, especially in patients with burns. According to previously published data, the&#xD;
      newly proposed marker of infectious inflammation, the Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS),&#xD;
      appears to be a suitable diagnostic tool in distinguishing between inflammation of infectious&#xD;
      and non-infectious origin in these patients. The other advantage is its low price.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare ICIS with other used indicators of inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      burns both children and adults.&#xD;

      Improving the use of antibiotics is an important patient and public health issue. The misuse&#xD;
      of antibiotics has contributed to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, which has&#xD;
      become one of the most serious and growing threats to public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prompt initiation of antibiotics to treat infections has been proven to reduce morbidity&#xD;
      and save lives, however, up to 30% of all antibiotics prescribed in ITUs are either&#xD;
      unnecessary or inappropriate. One of the key problems is early and reliable detection of&#xD;
      infection. Specificity of clinical signs and routine laboratory markers is low and they&#xD;
      usually cannot distinguish among changes caused by the primary insult, inflammatory reaction,&#xD;
      and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard of systemic bacterial and fungal infection, i.e. positive blood culture,&#xD;
      has a sensitivity of less than 75 per cent and its contamination has been found in up to one&#xD;
      third of results. Sputum and urine cultures are contaminated even more. Moreover, culture&#xD;
      results are usually not known earlier than after 48 hours and antibiotic treatment should be&#xD;
      started earlier in many cases, especially in the case of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New diagnostic modalities have been developed to sort out difficulties with early and&#xD;
      reliable diagnosis of a presence of infection, for example measurement of Procalcitonin (PCT)&#xD;
      or Presepsin level, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight detector mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS), DNA hybridisation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests,&#xD;
      eventually polymerase chain reaction electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR ESI-MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCT examination is the most used laboratory test from the modalities mentioned above. Despite&#xD;
      many positive characteristics (i.e. fast dynamics of plasma changes, higher sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity than C-reactive protein, ability to distinguish between G+ and G- infection), PCT&#xD;
      specificity drops in patients with ARDS, burns, multiple injuries, rhabdomyolysis, lysis of&#xD;
      lymphocytes, extreme metabolic situations, organ perfusion failure and after large surgical&#xD;
      procedures. It is also worth mentioning the relatively high cost of this examination,&#xD;
      limiting the use of this marker for routine screening, especially in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limiting factor for the use of the other diagnostic methods mentioned above is their&#xD;
      availability and price, or the fact that they are not reimbursed by health insurance&#xD;
      companies. Thus, the need for a reliable, cost-effective and available marker to facilitate&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy continues to be a burning problem, especially in intensive care, where the&#xD;
      development of SIRS is part of the disease in many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS) has been proposed as a suitable diagnostic indicator&#xD;
      for the presence of infection in these patients. Five parameters are used to calculate this&#xD;
      score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of neutrophil segments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of immature granulocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean fluorescence intensity of neutrophil segments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in haemoglobin concentration of mature and young cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of antibody secreting lymphocytes These parameters characterize the early innate&#xD;
           immune response. The maximum ICIS value is 20. ICIS changes occur in the order of hours&#xD;
           and are capable of detecting early local and systemic infection prior to the development&#xD;
           of clinical symptoms. The advantages are the low cost of the examination which can be&#xD;
           used to routinely screen patients, the speed of results (up to 15 min), sensitivity,&#xD;
           assessment of the severity of infection, and the fact that no extra blood sample is&#xD;
           needed. Measurements are done from a blood sample taken for differential blood count by&#xD;
           flow fluorescence cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, ICIS suitability and accurance in both adult and pediatric burn patients has&#xD;
      not been proved yet. This study is aimed to investigate ICIS reliability in burns.&#xD;
