    <description>The pain of the subjects will be evaluated by two independent observers and with a blind result between them, coinciding with the application of two painful procedures used in routine practice: suction of tracheal secretions and the pressure in the nail bed by means of a pressure algometer. In addition, a painless procedure will also be performed to establish an element of control with the procedures painful. This will consist of the application of gentle friction with a cloth gauze, on a part of healthy skin tissue of the patient. The measurement will be performed twice for each patient and procedure depending on the level of sedation, so that the first measurement will be performed with a deeper sedation level and the second with a change in sedation level to moderate-mild.&#xD;
In turn, the pain assessment will be carried out in three moments: first or baseline measurement, during the application of the painless and 15 minutes after finishing the procedures.</description>
