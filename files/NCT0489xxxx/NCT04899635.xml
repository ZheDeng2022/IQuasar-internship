  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical behaviour of human heart to&#xD;
      explore the concept of myocardial fatigue in response to a temporal range of preload,&#xD;
      afterload and drug-induced inotropy using in-vitro contractile assays.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A continuum of pathological states from fatigue, injury to damage of the myocardium has been&#xD;
      proposed which complements the continuous spectrum of HF and reconciles the seemingly&#xD;
      disparate plethora of mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of HF. Unlike skeletal muscle&#xD;
      where mechanical stress can be readily removed upon fatigue, an impaired left ventricle&#xD;
      continues to receive preload from the right ventricle and cannot rest, maintaining cardiac&#xD;
      output only at the expense of increasing filling pressures (as in HF with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction). If concurrently faced with high afterload from vascular stiffness,&#xD;
      ventricular-arterial decoupling occurs, driving mechanical inefficiency and diminishing&#xD;
      cardiac output (as in HF with reduced ejection fraction). Chances of recovery is linked to&#xD;
      the degree of fatigue, cardiomyocyte loss and replacement with non-contractile fibrosis.&#xD;
      Assuming that the myocardium is in a state of chronic fatigue before reaching advanced stages&#xD;
      of fibrosis, cases such as aortic stenosis or hypertensive heart disease may potentially be&#xD;
      reversible if the pathological load is promptly removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be re-synthesizing existing knowledge of the biomechanical behaviour of&#xD;
      healthy and diseased cardiac myocytes and muscle in a new light of the theoretical constructs&#xD;
      of myocardial fatigue, aligned with the existing energy-starvation theory. It will be a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study. Just as Frank-Starling's relationship between preload and cardiac&#xD;
      output emerged from pre-clinical studies on muscle behaviour with subsequently major clinical&#xD;
      implications, this study represents a necessary steppingstone to adding a new layer of&#xD;
      insight into the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF).&#xD;

        Human cardiac tissues (atrial appendages and ventricular tissue biopsies) are obtained from&#xD;
        patients undergoing elective or inpatient open-heart surgery, namely coronary artery bypass&#xD;
        grafting and valvular replacement. If available, explanted failing hearts are also&#xD;
        recruited for experimentation. A control population consists of healthy donor hearts that&#xD;
        are deemed non-transplantable and collected by the Arden Tissue Bank at UHCW.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adult patients between 18 to 85-years old undergoing open-heart surgery who can&#xD;
             undergo the consent process for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy donor hearts that are deemed non-transplantable and consent received from a&#xD;
             legal representative&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This criterion is kept to a minimum since the availability of human myocardial samples are&#xD;
        finite and dependent on the limited number of patients undergoing cardiac surgery annually&#xD;
        within the local hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not have the mental capacity to undergo the consent process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the safety of researchers, patients with evidence of ongoing blood-borne&#xD;
             infections such as HIV, or a recent positive test for COVID-19 (within 10 days of last&#xD;
             PCR test).&#xD;
