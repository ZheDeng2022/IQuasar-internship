  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying how well newly diagnosed breast cancer that has tested&#xD;
      positive for a protein called HER2 responds using one of two different combination of&#xD;
      HER2-directed therapies as a treatment after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drugs involved are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab SC (Herceptin Hylecta)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II adjuvant study for women and men with Stage I HER2-positive&#xD;
      invasive breast cancer. Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment arms in&#xD;
      this study and receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla) and trastuzumab SC (Herceptin Hylecta)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: paclitaxel and trastuzumab SC (Herceptin Hylecta) This research study is looking&#xD;
           to see if the study drug T-DM1 followed by trastuzumab SC will have less side-effects&#xD;
           than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.The&#xD;
           study is also looking to learn about the long-term benefits and disease-free survival of&#xD;
           participants who are treated with T-DM1 followed by trastuzumab SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-DM1 is an antibody-drug conjugate; it is made up of an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a&#xD;
      cytotoxic drug, DM1 (chemotherapy). T-DM1 functions as a targeted cancer therapy because it&#xD;
      targets HER2-positive breast cancer cells directly, limiting exposure of the rest of the body&#xD;
      to chemotherapy. More specifically, the trastuzumab in T-DM1 first binds to the HER2 protein&#xD;
      on the surface of the breast cancer cells and the DM1 then enters the cells and can cause&#xD;
      them to die, preventing tumor growth. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not&#xD;
      approved T-DM1 for use on its own in patients with stage I, II, or III breast cancer.&#xD;
      However, it has been approved for use in (a) advanced or metastatic, previously treated&#xD;
      breast cancer and (b) in some patients receiving postoperative treatment after preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy and surgery have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab SC is a subcutaneous form of trastuzumab.Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      which are disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. Paclitaxel and trastuzumab&#xD;
      are considered a standard-of-care regimen in early breast cancer. Trastuzumab is FDA-approved&#xD;
      to be administered as an IV (intravenous) or subcutaneous (muscular injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for a year in total and will be followed for 5&#xD;
      years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 500 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genentech is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study and supplying&#xD;
      trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab SC (subcutaneous).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have HER2-positive Stage I histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma&#xD;
             of the breast. Patients must have node-negative (N0) or micrometastases (N1mic) breast&#xD;
             cancer according to the AJCC 8th edition anatomic staging table.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then no further axillary&#xD;
                  dissection is required, and the patient is determined to be node-negative. If an&#xD;
                  axillary dissection without sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to determine&#xD;
                  nodal status, at least six axillary lymph nodes must be removed and analyzed, and&#xD;
                  determined to be negative, for the patient to be considered node-negative.&#xD;
                  Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters ≤ 0.2 mm by either H&amp;E or&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be considered node-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2 cm is considered&#xD;
                  a micrometastasis. Patients with a micrometastasis are eligible. An axillary&#xD;
                  dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a micrometastasis&#xD;
                  found by sentinel node evaluation. In cases where the specific pathologic size of&#xD;
                  lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal investigator&#xD;
                  will make the final determination as to eligibility. The investigator must&#xD;
                  document approval in the patient medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have an area of a T1aN0, ER+ (defined as &gt;10%), HER2-negative cancer&#xD;
                  in addition to their primary HER2-positive tumor are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2-positive: defined as 3+ by immunohistochemistry. FISH results will not be&#xD;
             considered for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: HER-2 status must be confirmed to be positive by central review by NeoGenomics prior&#xD;
        to patient starting protocol therapy. Patients previously having had HER2&#xD;
        immunohistochemical testing by NeoGenomics do not need to undergo retesting for central&#xD;
        confirmation of HER2 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: DCIS components will not be counted in the determination of HER2 status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER/PR determination is required. ER and PR assays should be performed by&#xD;
             immunohistochemical methods according to the local institution standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral breast cancers that individually meet eligibility criteria are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible, as long as each tumor&#xD;
             individually meets eligibility criteria. Central confirmation is needed for any site&#xD;
             of disease that is tested to be HER2-positive by local testing (unless testing was&#xD;
             previously done by NeoGenomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of ipsilateral DCIS are eligible if they were treated with&#xD;
             wide excision alone, without radiation therapy. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             contralateral DCIS are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤ 90 days between the planned treatment start date and the patient's most recent&#xD;
             breast surgery for this breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age with any menopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental&#xD;
             mastectomy (lumpectomy), with either a sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e. no tumor on ink).&#xD;
                  The local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the&#xD;
                  pathology report. If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep)&#xD;
                  margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was&#xD;
                  performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise,&#xD;
                  if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin)&#xD;
                  margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been&#xD;
                  removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e. lumpectomy) must not have any&#xD;
             contraindications to radiation therapy. Radiation to the conserved breast is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received up to 4 weeks of tamoxifen therapy, or other hormonal&#xD;
             therapy, for adjuvant therapy for this cancer. Patients cannot receive adjuvant&#xD;
             hormonal therapy during protocol treatment for the first 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior oophorectomy for cancer prevention is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone partial breast radiation (duration ≤ 7 days) prior to&#xD;
             registration are eligible. Partial breast radiation must be completed prior to 2 weeks&#xD;
             before starting protocol therapy. Patients who have undergone whole breast radiation&#xD;
             are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in a window study (treatment with an investigational&#xD;
             agent prior to surgery for ≤ 2 weeks) are eligible. Patients must have discontinued&#xD;
             the investigational agent at least 14 days before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC ≥ 1000/mm3,&#xD;

                  institutional normal range. Serum alkaline phosphatase should be ≤ 1.5x&#xD;
                  Institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal patients must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test, including&#xD;
             women who have had a tubal ligation and for women less than 12 months after the onset&#xD;
             of menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             be willing to use one highly effective form of nonhormonal contraception or two&#xD;
             effective forms of nonhormonal contraception by the patient and/or partner.&#xD;
             Contraceptive use must be continued for the duration of the study treatment and for 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatment. Hormonal birth control methods are not&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have tumor tissue available, and a tissue block of sufficient size to&#xD;
             make 15 slides, which must be sent to DFCI for correlative research. If a tissue block&#xD;
             is unavailable, sites may send one H&amp;E-stained slide and 15 unstained sections of&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded tissue on uncharged slides. Slide sections should be 4-5 microns in&#xD;
             thickness. It is also acceptable to submit 2 cores from a block of invasive tissue&#xD;
             using a 1.2 mm diameter coring tool. If tumor is not available, the investigator must&#xD;
             document why tissue is not available in the patient medical record, and that efforts&#xD;
             have been made to obtain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to read and understand English in order to participate in the quality of&#xD;
             life surveys. If patient does not read and understand English, the patient is still&#xD;
