  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of behavioral activation to increase everyday movement and reduce the amount of&#xD;
      time spent daily in positions of prolonged standing and sitting. This intervention is call&#xD;
      Movement-Oriented Behavioral Activation (MOBA). Participants will undergo a 60-minute&#xD;
      screening that includes health and lifestyle questionnaires, mobility testing and a&#xD;
      six-minute walk. Participants will complete the same procedures after completing MOBA. Each&#xD;
      participant will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or a wait-list group. Both&#xD;
      groups will participate in the same 12-week MOBA group protocol, but the intervention group&#xD;
      participates first. During MOBA sessions, participants will set movement goals to reduce&#xD;
      total time spent sitting and standing, and learn exercises and strategies to get more&#xD;
      physical activity throughout the day and evening. At the end of the 12-week group, all&#xD;
      participants, including those on the wait-list will be asked to complete the same&#xD;
      questionnaires, mobility testing, and 6-minute walk as the beginning of the study. Total&#xD;
      study duration for the intervention group is about 4 months. Total study duration for&#xD;
      wait-list group will be about 8 months, which about half of that time spent in the waiting&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pilot cohort will be composed of food service workers drawn employee by sponsor's&#xD;
        organization. The age range was chosen to target the critical window for establishing the&#xD;
        long-term geroprotective benefits of increasing movement-oriented behaviors. The workplace&#xD;
        cohort was chosen because their work demands are characterized by a high level of&#xD;
        stationary activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) individuals with moderate or greater depression severity (PHQ-9 &gt; 14); and 2)&#xD;
        individuals with significant mobility limitation, defined as inability to complete 6&#xD;
        Minute-Walk Test.&#xD;
