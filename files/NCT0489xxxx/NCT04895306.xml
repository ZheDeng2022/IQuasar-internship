  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether testosterone replacement results in greater&#xD;
      improvement in pain perception, pain tolerance, sexual function, physical function and&#xD;
      quality of life when compared with placebo in women with chronic back pain treated with&#xD;
      opioids who have low testosterone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial will&#xD;
      evaluate pain and quality of life outcomes associated with 3 months of treatment with&#xD;
      testosterone or placebo in women aged 60 years or older with chronic non-cancer back pain who&#xD;
      are taking opioid analgesics for at least 6 months and have low testosterone.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Interference Subscale score of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference Subscale of the BPI is specifically relevant to patients with chronic back pain who are using opioids and correlates strongly with the patient's quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Algometer-induced Pressure Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A digital pressure algometer at the trapezius muscle and the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb was used to measure pressure pain thresholds. Higher values represent a better tolerance of pressure pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weighted Pinprick Stimulator-induced Mechanical Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted pinprick stimulators are used to assess mechanical pain. Lower values represent better tolerance of pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ice Water-induced Cold Pain and Its After-sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cold-pressor tests measure cold-induced pain and its sensation. Time was measured when a participant reached pain tolerance in cold water and after sensation. Higher values of time in Cold pain tolerance and lower values of time in Cold pain after-sensation (30 seconds) represent better tolerance of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by Short Form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 measures 8 domains of the QoL: physical function, bodily pain, vitality, role limitations due to physical problems, general health perceptions, emotional well-being, social function, and role limitations due to emotional problems. Each domain is scored separately from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better health-related QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood and well-being, assessed using the by Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) affectivity balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS affectivity balance scale includes 10 questions evaluating positive and negative affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function, assessed using the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to walk for 6 minutes at a comfortable pace on a premeasured flat surface; gait speed will be calculated by the distance walked (m) in 6 minutes. The 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) is an objective test of physical function validated in older adults and in women with chronic low back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function assessed by the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>For this 13-item questionnaire, women rate each item in terms of frequency from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Items are summed to create a total score ranging from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more sexually related distress</description>
