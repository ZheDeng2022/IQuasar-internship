      This trial is a multicenter, single arm, open label, nonrandomized, phase Ib / IIA trial that&#xD;
      will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of AL8326 in patients with small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC).Three treatment groups were used in this trial, and the study population,&#xD;
      sample size, and basic design of each group were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients with small-cell lung cancer without disease progression (in remission [PR&#xD;
      or Cr] or stable disease [SD] status) after first-line platinum containing chemotherapy were&#xD;
      included, with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Patients who relapsed or progressed after first-line platinum containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens, with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Patients with small cell lung cancer who have relapsed or progressed after at least&#xD;
      one line of treatment (including first-line platinum containing therapy, second-line single&#xD;
      agent or other) with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.&#xD;
