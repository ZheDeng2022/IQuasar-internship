    <textblock>
      This study was set out to assess the effect of stretch-shortening (SSC) exercises on&#xD;
      gait-symmetry and balance in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). Forty-two&#xD;
      children with UCP were randomly allocated to the control group (n = 21, received standard&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation) or the SSC group (n =21, received standard rehabilitation plus SSC&#xD;
      exercises). Both groups were assessed for ait-symmetry and balance pre and post-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-two children with UCP were recruited from the Physical Therapy Outpatient Clinic of&#xD;
      Collee of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, King Khalid&#xD;
      Hospital, and a tertiary referral hospital, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Their age ranged between&#xD;
      8 and 12 years, were functioning at levels I or II according to the Gross Motor Function&#xD;
      Classification System, and had spasticity level 1 or 1+ per the Modified Ashworth Scale.&#xD;
      Children were excluded if they had fixed deformities, underwent neuromuscular or orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery in the last 12 months, submitted to BOTOX injection in the past 6 months, attentional&#xD;
      neglect, cardiopulmonary problems preventing them from performing high-intense exercise&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gait-symmetry Indices: Gait symmetry indices (Spatial and temporal) were measured&#xD;
           through a 3D motion analysis system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Balance capabilities: several aspects of balance including sensory organization,&#xD;
           reactive balance, and rhythmic weight shift were tested through a Pro Balance Master&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control and SSC groups received a standard rehabilitation program for 45 minutes, twice a&#xD;
      week for eight consecutive weeks. The program comprised advanced balance training, and gait&#xD;
      training exercises, postural and flexibility exercises, strength training exercises.&#xD;
      Additionally, the SSC group received an SSC exercise program for 30 minutes, twice/week for&#xD;
      eight weeks per the National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines and American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics safety standards. The SSC program consisted of ten unilateral and&#xD;
      bilateral lower limb plyometrics in the form of hopping/bounding/jumping activities. The SSC&#xD;
      training was preceded by a warm-up for 5 minutes and ended up with a 5-min cooldown.&#xD;
