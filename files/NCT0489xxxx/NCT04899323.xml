  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study conducted in the emergency department of the Nantes University&#xD;
      Hospital and the Confluent Private Hospital, over a period of 5 months, based on hemodynamic&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient admitted to an emergency department with a sepsis syndrome requiring&#xD;
      vascular filling, the pulmonary ITV and the aortic ITV were measured at each phase of&#xD;
      vascular filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional study, the management of patients will not differ from usual&#xD;
      practices and vascular filling should not be delayed in any case. Emergency doctors who are&#xD;
      already experts in ultrasound, monitoring vascular filling by measuring the aortic ITV, will&#xD;
      have to measure the pulmonary ITV after each filling of 250cc of Ringer's Lactate in 10&#xD;
      minutes with a limited amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of ITV measurements and vital parameters should be recorded for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure quality, the emergency doctors will first receive a short training&#xD;
      (presentation of the study and review of the measurements requested). In addition,&#xD;
      measurement records will be analyzed at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this study, the correlation between the variation of the aortic and pulmonary&#xD;
      ITV could be compared. The objective would be to promote the monitoring of these unstable&#xD;
      patients via the pulmonary ITV. This measurement would be easier to perform than the aortic&#xD;
      ITV, which is currently only performed by emergency doctors who are experts in hemodynamic&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
