    <textblock>
      A prospective, single arm, non-randomized FIH feasibility study to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      safety and performance of the Xeltis hemodialysis access graft in subjects older than 18&#xD;
      years with end-stage renal disease, who plan to undergo hemodialysis for at least the first 6&#xD;
      months after study access creation, and are deemed not suitable for fistula creation by the&#xD;
      operating surgeon.&#xD;
