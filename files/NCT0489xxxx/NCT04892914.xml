  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate if the Embr thermal device is useful for men who&#xD;
      experience bothersome hot flashes as a result of prostate cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Embr thermal device is a smart device that is worn on the inside of the wrist. It is&#xD;
      about the size of a smart watch. The Embr thermal device produces cooling or warming&#xD;
      temperature sensations that make some people feel slightly cooler or warmer. This objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate if the Embr thermal device is useful for men who experience&#xD;
      bothersome hot flashes as a result of prostate cancer treatment. The study will take place&#xD;
      over 4 weeks. The primary outcome is feasibility of the Embr thermal device in men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Secondary outcomes include preliminary efficacy of the device, which will&#xD;
      include the change in hot flash interference sleep measures (sleep impairment and fatigue).&#xD;
      This is a remote study--all study assessments will be completed electronically.&#xD;

    <measure>Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), change in score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 2, 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale is a 10-item self-report measure that assesses the interference on several aspects of functioning associated with hot flashes. This valid and reliable self-report measure is widely used in prostate cancer research. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater interference.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Sleep Disturbance short form 4a, change in score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 2, 4</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance SF 4a is a 4-item self report measure of perceived difficulties falling asleep and staying asleep, as well as sleep satisfaction. The 4 items are scored 1-5 where 1 is good quality and 5 is poor quality for a total score range of 4 (good quality) to 20 (poor quality).</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment short form 8a, change in score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment SF 8a is an 8-item self reported measure of perceived alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours. The 8 items are scored 1-5 where 1 is good quality and 5 is poor quality for a total score range of 8 (good quality) to 40 (poor quality).</description>

    <measure>Epworth sleepiness scale, change in score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 2, 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a widely used measure of daytime sleepiness. Scores range from 0 to 24; scores of greater than 10 indicate excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
