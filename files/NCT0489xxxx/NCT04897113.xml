  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reaching active aging makes it important to implement new methods affecting the biological&#xD;
      age of a person. Biochemical parameters of a blood test are aging biomarkers that are ones of&#xD;
      the most accessible for testing. We know that, with age, there is increase in levels of LDL,&#xD;
      triglycerides, homocysteine and other biomarkers relating the body state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of extracorporeal hemocorrection showed good results in this area. For instance, the&#xD;
      use of plasmapheresis is very effective during prophylaxis, treatment and rehabilitation&#xD;
      after various diseases/injuries. The main effects of plasmapheresis are related to removal of&#xD;
      endo- and exotoxins, including products of lipid peroxidation, and to draining effect as a&#xD;
      result of a heavy flow of interstitial fluid containing products of pathometabolism into the&#xD;
      blood stream within concentration gradient (by &quot;dynamic equilibrium&quot; in concentration of&#xD;
      different substances in intracellular, interstitial and intravascular compartments). These&#xD;
      effects are also related to release of receptors, their sensitization to their own&#xD;
      neurohumoral regulation mechanisms, to insulin, in particular (as consequences, lower glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, lower substrate glycation).&#xD;

      Reaching active aging makes it important to implement new methods affecting the biological&#xD;
      age of a person. Biochemical parameters of a blood test are aging biomarkers that are ones of&#xD;
      the most accessible for testing. We know that, with age, there is increase in levels of LDL,&#xD;
      triglycerides, homocysteine and other biomarkers relating the body state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the initial approaches of anti-ageing therapy is detoxification, reocorrection and&#xD;
      immunocorrection. Methods of extracorporeal hemocorrection showed good results in this area.&#xD;
      For instance, the use of plasmapheresis is very effective during prophylaxis, treatment and&#xD;
      rehabilitation after various diseases/injuries. The main effects of plasmapheresis are&#xD;
      related to removal of endo- and exotoxins, including products of lipid peroxidation, and to&#xD;
      draining effect as a result of a heavy flow of interstitial fluid containing products of&#xD;
      pathometabolism into the blood stream within concentration gradient (by &quot;dynamic equilibrium&quot;&#xD;
      in concentration of different substances in intracellular, interstitial and intravascular&#xD;
      compartments). These effects are also related to release of receptors, their sensitization to&#xD;
      their own neurohumoral regulation mechanisms, to insulin, in particular (as consequences,&#xD;
      lower glucose tolerance, lower substrate glycation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, at this stage, experts assess effectiveness and organize data of existing prevention&#xD;
      methods for premature aging and correction of aging biomarkers, as well as develop&#xD;
      comprehensive programs for drug-free and pharmacological intervention. Introduction of the&#xD;
      body detoxification method based on extracorporeal hemocorrection (developed in FGBU Russian&#xD;
      Scientific Center for Medical Rehabilitation and Balneology of Ministry of Health of Russian&#xD;
      Federation) may extend the range of effective and safe methods within such programs, as well&#xD;
      as lower patients' biological age and, thus, lower risks of developing age-related diseases,&#xD;
      decrease number of disability cases, which can contribute to life prolonging and improvement&#xD;
      of its quality.&#xD;

An assessment of the &quot;phenotypic age&quot; will be carried out (Morgan E. et al., 2018). For counting, 10 markers are used: albumin, creatinine, glucose, C-reactive protein, percentage of lymphocytes, average cell volume, distribution width of erythrocytes, alkaline phosphatase, leukocyte count, chronological age.</description>

The following markers are used for calculation by this method: albumin, glucose, urea, cholesterol, total protein, sodium, creatinine, hemoglobin, total bilirubin, triglycerides , HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (Friedewald), calcium, potassium, hematocrit, MCHC, MCV, platelets, erythrocytes (erythrocytes), weight, height.&#xD;
