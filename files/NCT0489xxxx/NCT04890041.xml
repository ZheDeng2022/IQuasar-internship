    <textblock>
      This single-center study aims to study the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in Chinese&#xD;
      adult ITP patients. This study will be conducted in adult ITP patients who had not responded&#xD;
      to eltrombopag or rhTPO in the previous treatment .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag&#xD;
      in adult ITP patients who had not responded to eltrombopag or rhTPO in the previous&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 eligible subjects will be enroll ed in this study.The dose will be adjusted according to&#xD;
      the subject platelet count during the period from week 1 to week 8.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will receive avatrombopag treatment with an initial dose once a day. Platelet counts will be obtained weekly during the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until the 8th week of the study. The dose adjustment range is 20 mg~ per week to 40 mg per day to maintain the platelet level between 50×10^9/L and 150×10^9/L. If the platelet count does not reach to 30×10^9/L after taking avatrombopag 40 mg once a day for 4 consecutive weeks, the treatment will be stopped. If the platelet count is more than 400×10^9/L after taking avatrombopag 20 mg once a day for 2 consecutive weeks, the treatment will be stopped.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Men and women greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants diagnosed with chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 12 months duration) and an average of 2 platelet counts &lt; 30x10^9/L at least&#xD;
             7 days, do not have evidence of other causes of thrombocytopenia (e.g.,&#xD;
             pseudothrombocytopenia, myeloid fibrosis). The physical exam should not suggest any&#xD;
             other diseases which may cause thrombocytopenia other than ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with Eltrombopag or rhTPO was ineffective (platelet count &lt;&#xD;
             30x10^9/L after treatment, or platelet count increased less than twice the baseline&#xD;
             value, or bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio and activated partial thromboplastin&#xD;
             time must have been within 80% to 120% of the normal range with no history of&#xD;
             hypercoagulable state.&#xD;

          -  A history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), lymphoproliferative disease,&#xD;
             myelodysplastic tumor, and leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of arterial or venous thrombosis (stroke, transient ischemic attack,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) within 3 months&#xD;
             before screening, and the following 2 or more risk factors: including estrogen hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy or contraceptive therapy, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
             high blood pressure medications, cancer or any other family history of arterial or&#xD;
             venous thrombosis, or patients who were taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs at&#xD;
             the beginning of the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., congestive&#xD;
             heart failure [CHF] New York Heart Association Grade III, arrhythmia known to increase&#xD;
             the risk of thromboembolic events [e.g., atrial fibrillation], coronary artery stent&#xD;
             placement, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hereditary prethrombotic syndromes (e.g., thrombin factor V Leiden mutation,&#xD;
             prothrombin G20210A mutation, or hereditary antithrombin (ATIII) deficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with concurrent malignant tumor diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood creatinine &gt;1.2 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN) .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known allergy to avatrombopag or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or who intend to become pregnant in the near future are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
