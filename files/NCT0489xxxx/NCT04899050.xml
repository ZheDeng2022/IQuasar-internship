      This is a Pilot study, open-label study consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a&#xD;
      4-week dose-titration treatment period to dose of up to 20 mg/kg/day BID of CBD (Epidiolex),&#xD;
      and a 30 day safety follow-up period following the last dose of study medication.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        10.1 Existing clinical patients diagnosed with Genetic (Idiopathic) Generalized Epilepsy&#xD;
        will be reviewed and asked if they are willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10.2 Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that the subject has been informed of&#xD;
        the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives,&#xD;
        potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women 16 to 55 years of age who are able to read and&#xD;
        understand the written and spoken local language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical diagnosis of IGE (including, but not limited to, CAE, JAE, juvenile myoclonic&#xD;
        epilepsy, or Jeavons syndrome) with absence seizures consistent with the International&#xD;
        League against Epilepsy Revised Classification of Seizures (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absence seizures, by history on average once per hour, persisting despite standard of care&#xD;
        (SOC) treatment, defined as treatment with at least 2 AEDs appropriate for the patient's&#xD;
        epilepsy syndrome. SOC failure, per investigator discretion, will be defined as&#xD;
        insufficient clinical response or intolerable side effects, which precludes use of the&#xD;
        appropriate AED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observation of at least 3 instances of generalized discharges of approximately 2.5 - 4 Hz&#xD;
        lasting &gt;2 seconds via 24-hr ambulatory EEG&#xD;
&#xD;
        On stable doses of one or more antiepileptic medication(s) for at least 30 days. If a&#xD;
        subject is not on medication, adequate documentation justifying lack of therapy may be&#xD;
        acceptable for the subject after Greenwich Biosciences review. Ketogenic, modified Atkins&#xD;
        diet (MAD), or low glycemic diet with stable carbohydrate ratio for at least 30 days before&#xD;
        screening is an acceptable antiepileptic therapy. Vagal nerve stimulation at stable&#xD;
        settings (for at least 30 days before screening), without use of the magnet, is also&#xD;
        acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with reproductive capability, including all males and WOCBP, must agree to&#xD;
        practice continuous abstinence or adequate contraception methods (appropriate double&#xD;
        barrier method or oral, patch, implant, or injectable contraception) from as soon as&#xD;
        feasible during screening period until at least 30 days after the last dose (i.e.,&#xD;
        intermittent abstinence based on &quot;rhythm,&quot; temperature monitoring, or other means of timing&#xD;
        is not acceptable). WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
        undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and/or&#xD;
        bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea&#xD;
        for ≥12 consecutive months without another cause, and a documented serum follicle&#xD;
        stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥35 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able and willing to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and&#xD;
        other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10.3 Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of surgical intervention for treatment of epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional seizure (clinical and electrographic) types, including, but not limited to,&#xD;
        epileptic spasms, generalized tonic seizures, atonic seizures, or focal seizures. Subjects&#xD;
        with GTCS or myoclonic seizures are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inadequately treated psychotic or mood disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, major depression,&#xD;
        bipolar disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of severe intellectual disability, severe autism spectrum disorder, or severe&#xD;
        developmental disorder such that the subject cannot sign the ICF or cannot cooperate with&#xD;
        the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of positive urine drug screen for drugs of abuse, except if this is explained by&#xD;
        use of an allowed prescription medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant hepatic (AST/ALT or bilirubin ≥2 × ULN) or renal disease (creatinine clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        ≤39 mL/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A current C-SSRS score of 4 or 5 at screening or history of suicide attempt within the past&#xD;
        year. Study team members have been trained on the administration of this assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any other condition and/or situation that causes the investigator to deem a subject&#xD;
        unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of CBD&#xD;
        (Epidiolex) or planning to receive an investigational agent during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent legal use of CBD obtained from state dispensaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10.5 Students, Employees, those that are socially and/or economically disadvantaged and&#xD;
        Wards of the state will not be included in this research population.&#xD;
