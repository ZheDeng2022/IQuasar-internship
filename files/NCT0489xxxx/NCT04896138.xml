  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data and specimens will be collected longitudinally from patients seen in the UVA&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) clinic in order to describe the phenotypic expression of&#xD;
      various interstitial lung diseases. Samples will also be collected from a control group for&#xD;
      comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be entered into a repository for future research purposes or screening for new&#xD;
      studies that become available. This data will help identify trends and hopefully lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the disease progression, treatment options, and outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the clinical course of patients with ILD will allow description of the natural&#xD;
      history of these diseases and prospective analysis of the following specific questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can surrogate physiological markers of disease progression be used in place of&#xD;
           mortality? Mortality of a defined cohort of patients will be developed. The surrogate&#xD;
           markers include but are not limited to serial cardiopulmonary exercise testing,&#xD;
           pulmonary function testing, 6-minute walk testing, HRCT scanning and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do alternative assessments such as quality of life (QOL) questionnaires provide early&#xD;
           prediction of physiological change as measured by the previously described parameters?&#xD;
           Periodic QOL questionnaires are regularly conducted in clinic and will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does rate of deterioration as measured by these previously described parameters affect&#xD;
           response to therapy? If we pre-identify rapid decliners from stable subjects, does this&#xD;
           variable affect the response to whatever therapy is applied?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can genetic analysis, genomics, proteomics, microbial and other biomarkers in the blood&#xD;
           and cheeks provide insight into the polymorphisms and other elements related to the&#xD;
           etiology and pathology of the lung damage?&#xD;
