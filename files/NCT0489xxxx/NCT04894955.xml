  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MARIA® breast imaging system is a CE-marked radiofrequency (RF) medical imaging device.&#xD;
      The system employs an electromagnetic imaging technique that exploits the dielectric contrast&#xD;
      between normal and cancerous tissues. The use of artificial intelligence will provide&#xD;
      additional, novel functionality to the MARIA® system but requires participant data in order&#xD;
      to develop and validate the machine learning algorithms that aim to increase the accuracy and&#xD;
      overall clinical utility of the device. This study aims to collect data from sites for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous and existing trials have been focused on and designed to assess sensitivity of&#xD;
      different versions of MARIA® when used on symptomatic subjects. This study will consider&#xD;
      those measures, but the primary endpoint will be the collection of the data required for&#xD;
      developing and validating machine learning-based enhancements of the MARIA® system. Data that&#xD;
      are diverse in terms of subject characteristics, including disease state, presentation of&#xD;
      disease, and variation of normal anatomy are requisite for the creation of accurate and&#xD;
      well-characterized machine intelligence. As such, the recruitment criteria is broad in order&#xD;
      to encompass all kinds of subjects that are representative as possible of the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the current stage in development of the MARIA® system a need has been identified to&#xD;
      acquire additional data for validation of a lesion classification algorithm specific to women&#xD;
      with larger breasts. This need has guided the study size calculation; however, additional&#xD;
      data from all shell sizes continues to be important for further lesion classifier development&#xD;
      and the development of additional functionality, including automated breast density&#xD;
      assessment. Therefore, as part of this study subjects across the entire intended use&#xD;
      population will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data points that are collected via this study have been selected as those that are&#xD;
      required for the purposes of machine learning first and foremost, with any secondary&#xD;
      endpoints utilising only existing available information. In addition to this data, a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be provided to each participant to obtain valuable feedback on the scan&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undertake the same scan procedure, requiring them to have both breasts&#xD;
      scanned using the MARIA® system. The MARIA® scan will be in addition to any standard&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures, including imaging, that comprise the standard of care and will have no&#xD;
      effect on the participant's diagnosis or treatment. While there is no direct benefit nor&#xD;
      detrimental effect from this study to the participants, the study has potentially significant&#xD;
      implications for future learning and for the breast imaging landscape.&#xD;

    <description>The ground truth diagnosis for each participant will be obtained from clinical diagnosis information pertaining to histology and imaging. This will ultimately lead to a binary classification for that patient of either a benign or malignant diagnosis. This will then be compared to the classification that the AI has determined for that area of the breast volume.</description>

    <description>After consent has been given, the participant's breast will be fitted by the operator using a clear plastic cup to ascertain their corresponding MARIA® cup insert size. Once this has been determined, participants will be required to lie prone with their breast pendent through an aperture in the MARIA® participant bed. The cup insert will contain a layer of coupling fluid. The hemispherical cup inserts and array are brought into contact with the breast. A scan sequence comprising of two complete scan rotations will then be performed, which takes around 5 minutes. The participant will then be assisted to adjust their positioning, and the scan sequence performed on the other breast.</description>
