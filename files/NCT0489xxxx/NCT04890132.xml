  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the role of noise in the vestibular system, and in particular&#xD;
      its effects on the variability (precision) of vestibular-mediated behaviors. The&#xD;
      investigators will study vestibular precision in normal subjects and patients with peripheral&#xD;
      vestibular damage, and will investigate its potential plasticity. The goals are to develop a&#xD;
      better understanding of the role noise plays in the vestibular system in normal and&#xD;
      pathologic populations, and to determine if the brain can learn to improve signal recognition&#xD;
      within its inherently noisy neural environment, which would result in improved behavioral&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate vestibular precision by quantifying the variability&#xD;
      in behavioral responses that result from the neural noise inherent to the peripheral and&#xD;
      central vestibular systems. Because neural noise contaminates the signals that are transduced&#xD;
      by the ear and processed by the brain, vestibular-mediated behavioral responses vary even&#xD;
      when identical stimuli are provided. In this study, the investigators focus on vestibular&#xD;
      precision in human subjects and investigate its sources, its effects on behavior, and its&#xD;
      degradation when the periphery is damaged and its potential plasticity. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate: (1) Vestibular precision in normal subjects - physiology: A)&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the angular and linear vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) using&#xD;
      novel motion combinations that reinforce or cancel eye movement responses, which will allow&#xD;
      us to determine the distribution and magnitude of noise produced in the sensory (canal,&#xD;
      otolith) pathways and in the oculomotor pathway. The investigators hypothesize that normal&#xD;
      subjects will demonstrate a bimodal distribution of noise with either sensory or motor&#xD;
      predominance, and that subjects with more sensory noise will demonstrate other behavioral&#xD;
      characteristics that reflect this characteristic (e.g., higher perceptual thresholds); and B)&#xD;
      The investigators will assay vestibular noise from trial-trial variations in the VOR and will&#xD;
      compare VOR dynamics with those predicted by a Bayesian model using the assayed noise. The&#xD;
      investigators predict variations in VOR dynamics across subjects, age and stimulus amplitudes&#xD;
      will be consistent with Bayesian processing of noise. Potential confounding factors will be&#xD;
      carefully controlled, including attention, fatigue, and non-vestibular cues. (2) Vestibular&#xD;
      precision after peripheral damage - pathophysiology: A) The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      changes in vestibular precision that occur when one vestibular nerve is damaged (by a&#xD;
      vestibular schwannoma, VS) and after the damaged nerve is surgically sectioned, and will&#xD;
      investigate if precision measurements can provide evidence of pathologic noise produced by&#xD;
      the damaged nerve and therefore help predict clinical outcome when the nerve is sectioned.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that changes in signal reliability due to the VS will be&#xD;
      traceable to both the reduced redundancy caused by loss of afferent fibers and to aberrant&#xD;
      noise generated by the damaged vestibular nerve and that changes in precision after&#xD;
      neurectomy will correlate the outcome measures that characterize patient disability; and B)&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the plasticity of vestibular precision in the oculomotor and&#xD;
      perceptual realms with the goal of determining if precision can be improved. Using novel&#xD;
      training approaches that provide challenging signal extraction tasks, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that participants will improve their vestibular precision on the trained task. As&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures, the investigators will determine if training one behavior&#xD;
      generalizes to the non-trained behavior and if patient's symptoms are affected by improved&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects are rotated in yaw using a pseudo-random sum of sines motion (0.5 - 2.0 Hz), view a monitor 1 m away, and are instructed to move their avatar through a maze using a joystick. The size of the maze becomes smaller in real-time when they are successful so that the patient is at the limit of their acuity. This task requires patients to optimize dynamic visual acuity to threshold-level images while rotating. We predict that VOR precision will gradually improve during training and that after training VOR precision will be better than the pre-training data. The sham task is as above but the acuity required to see the maze will set at a much larger level so baseline visual precision will be adequate to perform the task easily.</description>
