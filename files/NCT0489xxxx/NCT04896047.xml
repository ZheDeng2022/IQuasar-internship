  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 50% of dialysis patients and 20% of&#xD;
      patients with non-dialyzed CKD and reduce quality of life and survival. The pathophysiology&#xD;
      of uremic sarcopenia is multifactorial (accumulation of toxins, metabolic disturbances, etc.)&#xD;
      and poorly characterized. These pejorative factors are associated with malnutrition and a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. Currently, there are no strategies to combat sarcopenia with the&#xD;
      exception of physical activity, which is only possible for a limited number of patients due&#xD;
      to their comorbidities. Developing new pharmacological strategies to combat sarcopenia is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGF19 is a growth factor produced in the ileum involved in metabolic homeostasis. In the&#xD;
      laboratory, a new function of FGF19 has been discovered. FGF19 acts as a hormonal factor&#xD;
      stimulating muscle mass and strength. Preliminary studies had shown a decrease in the&#xD;
      concentration and secretion of FGF19 in response to a meal in haemodialysis patients.&#xD;
      However, the link between FGF19, muscle mass and CKD has never been demonstrated. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the relationship between the concentration and secretion of FGF19 and&#xD;
      muscle function in a large population of patients with CKD of different stages. Given the&#xD;
      hormonal communication between the bone and the muscle, the investigators will also recover&#xD;
      the bone histological parameters from a bone biopsy if dialysis patients are to benefit from&#xD;
      this as part of their follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a decrease in FGF19 concentration and secretion in CKD is&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in muscle mass and strength.&#xD;
