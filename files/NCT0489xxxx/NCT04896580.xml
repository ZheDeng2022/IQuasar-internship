  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether nature-based activities provide benefits for&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors. The investigators want to know whether a nature-based exercise&#xD;
      program is feasible. Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and have completed cancer&#xD;
      treatment will be recruited for this study. The study will enroll up to 20 people in total.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer survivors (n=20) will engage in three months of moderate intensity walking&#xD;
      sessions three times a week in a nature and park conservation area. All walks will be&#xD;
      supervised by certified clinical Exercise Physiologists (EP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will be 50-minutes in total (5-minute warm-up, 40 minute walk, 5 minute cool-down&#xD;
      and stretch). Session intensity will be tracked with Fitbits. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      reach a moderate intensity heart rate, defined as 40%-59% heart rate reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys, physical assessments and collection of biomarkers at&#xD;
      baseline and at end of study. Participants also have the option to participate in a 1 hr&#xD;
      qualitative exit interview about their participation experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note. During COVID pandemic, sessions will be socially distanced one-on-one with an EP. After&#xD;
      the pandemic, they will take place in small groups (3-5 participants). Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to keep the same days and walk session times throughout the intervention.&#xD;
