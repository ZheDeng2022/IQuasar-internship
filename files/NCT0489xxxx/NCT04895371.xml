    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2 (SARS-Cov-2), is a multisystem infectious disease which has led to a global pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to multisystem nature of this disease, it can cause a variety of early and late&#xD;
      complications. New studies have revealed some of the long-term sequelae of this disease, such&#xD;
      as neurological injuries, arterial or venous thrombosis, cardiac, brain strokes, etc. which&#xD;
      need to be taken into consideration during management of patients. Many COVID-19 survivors&#xD;
      who require critical care may also develop psychological, physical and cognitive impairments.&#xD;
      These patients may develop various impairments because of hospitalization owing to extended&#xD;
      immobilization and many hours bed ridden; these include neuromuscular complications, severe&#xD;
      muscle weakness and fatigue, joint stiffness, dysphagia, psychological problems, reduced&#xD;
      mobility, low quality of life, frequent falls, and even quadriparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given impacts of COVID-19 on global health care system, innovative approaches in managing&#xD;
      patients are needed. This is the reason that tele-medicine is becoming a trendy title for&#xD;
      researchers . Tele-medicine is a tool to connect patients and health care professions while&#xD;
      maintaining social distancing and restrictions . Digital health interventions can help&#xD;
      provide self-monitoring tools, field updates, exercise protocols, and psychological support.&#xD;
      Depending on the funding and facilities provided by the health care system, tele-medicine can&#xD;
      be designed and employed in each country uniquely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy interventions can be also delivered through modern digital communication tools.&#xD;
      Tele-physiotherapy is a field of physiotherapy which has the advantage of providing therapy&#xD;
      wherever is most convenient for the patient through the use of modern digital communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidences from other outbreak of viruses in the coronavirus strain epidemics,&#xD;
      many of the discharged patients after COVID-19 pneumonia are likely to have residual&#xD;
      impairment even some years after hospitalization. Not only discharged COVID-19 patients, but&#xD;
      also other members of the society might need physiotherapy in this crisis. Despite this need,&#xD;
      social distancing should be taken into account and human lives can't be put in danger.&#xD;
      Tele-physiotherapy provides a great opportunity for therapists to communicate with their&#xD;
      patients, assess and treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since some months ago, different organizations have started the&#xD;
      tele-physiotherapy/tele-rehabilitation program to manage the patients' complications after&#xD;
      COVID-19. This research team have developed a tele-rehabilitation guideline for&#xD;
      physiotherapists to help them how to use tele-physiotherapy program for patients after&#xD;
      COVID-19 hospitalization. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      tele-physiotherapy program in patients discharged after COVID-19.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The participants will be randomly allocated to Tele-physiotherapy or control groups.&#xD;
The sample size was calculated to identify clinically relevant effects on the primary outcome, the distance of six-minute walk test. The calculation was performed using STATA 16 software. Presuming a two-sided significance level (α) of 0.05, the power of 80% (β=0.20) and standard deviation based on the results of a relevant study in COVID-19 survivors which assessed the distance of six-minute walk test. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 54m was reported and considered to be clinically significant. Repeated measurement of ANCOVA was used for the calculation with a baseline and two follow-up measurements (correlation of repeated measurement=0.499). After considering 20% possible participants attrition, It was determined that a sample size of 72 participants would be required to detect a significant change, 36 in each group.</intervention_model_description>
