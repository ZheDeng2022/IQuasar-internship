      The focus of our work is openness, learning and person-centred involvement following patient&#xD;
      safety incidents in health care. We will explore patients, carers and relatives' perspectives&#xD;
      on what is important to them, what facilitates and impedes their involvement in patient&#xD;
      safety reviews and what matters to them. We are interested in exploring how patient, carer&#xD;
      and relative involvement can assist reconciliation, organisational and national learning.&#xD;
      Information gained will be used to support the development of national guidance around&#xD;
      involving people in a compassionate and caring way and how their experience could help&#xD;
      organisational and national learning when things go wrong in health care.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scotland is committed to a person-centred approach to social care and health services. This&#xD;
      includes a duty of candour towards service users and families when things go wrong. Typical&#xD;
      of service users and families who are involved in patient safety incidents or make complaints&#xD;
      about services is the stated intent that they &quot;don't want anyone else to go through what they&#xD;
      have experienced&quot;. Inherent in this sentiment is the desire that services learn from&#xD;
      feedback, safety incidents, complaints and near misses where unnecessary harm is caused (or&#xD;
      could have been) when interacting with health care services. Current guidance suggests health&#xD;
      and care providers offer an explanation of the incident, an apology, and a commitment to&#xD;
      prevent recurrence. There is growing recognition among health care providers and policy&#xD;
      makers that when things go wrong, the patient or their families should be heard and&#xD;
      participate in the incident investigation process (Kok et al 2018). Guidance on how best to&#xD;
      involve patients, carers and relatives in a caring and compassionate manner is lacking and&#xD;
      current practice variable. The joint commission for openness and learning is committed to&#xD;
      understanding and learning what 'good' patient involvement in patient safety reviews could&#xD;
      look like as part of improving patient safety in health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a larger programme of work being undertaken by NHS Education for&#xD;
      Scotland (NES) and Health Improvement Scotland (HIS) on behalf of the Scottish Government.&#xD;
      The focus of our work is openness, learning and person-centred involvement following patient&#xD;
      safety incidents in health care. We will explore patients, carers and relatives' perspectives&#xD;
      on what is important to them, what facilitates and impedes their involvement in patient&#xD;
      safety reviews and what matters to them. We are interested in exploring how patient, carer&#xD;
      and relative involvement can assist reconciliation, organisational and national learning.&#xD;
      Information gained will be used to support the development of national guidance around&#xD;
      involving people in a compassionate and caring way and how their experience could help&#xD;
      organisational and national learning when things go wrong in health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors that facilitate and impede patient, carer and relative involvement&#xD;
           using patient perspectives to guide and strengthen how the NHS involves, communicates&#xD;
           and learns with patients their carers and relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore how to involve people in a compassionate and caring way and how their&#xD;
           experience can be harnessed to assist national and organisational learning&#xD;

    <description>This study will explore the perceptions of patients, carers and relatives who have experienced a patient safety event. Telephone interviews will be undertaken lasting up to 60 minutes This study involves NHS patients, their carers or relatives. We will ask participants about their experience of being involved a patient safety event and the barriers and enablers to participation in the review. We will ask what 'good' patient involvement in patient safety reviews should look like from those with lived experience. This is because we wish to understand from their perspective what matters to them when things go wrong and how best to involve them.</description>
