  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with intestinal stomas (especially an ileostomy) can have, despite development of&#xD;
      better ostomy products, problems with leakage which influence their quality of life&#xD;
      negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this, Coloplast has developed a new supporting ostomy product, which has an&#xD;
      adhesive sensor layer that should be place underneath the baseplate normally used by the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm design. Open-labelled Study duration: 21 days + 3 days.&#xD;
