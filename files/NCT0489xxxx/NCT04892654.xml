  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) HIV treatments are associated with increased&#xD;
      quality of life, and a normalisation of life expectancy in people living with HIV. However,&#xD;
      long-term use of cART can lead to side-effects through exposure to drug-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason researchers are interested in looking at alternative therapies that might&#xD;
      expose patients to fewer and less severe side effects while providing the same quality of&#xD;
      care as antiretroviral therapies most often used to treat HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if the study drug combination that is being&#xD;
      tested (doravirine + dolutegravir) is safe compared with other triple cART regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, open label study to assess the efficacy of switching from suppressive triple&#xD;
      cART to doravirine + dolutegravir dual cART in people living with HIV (PLWH) with an&#xD;
      undetectable viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-based software will randomise participants 2:1 to either the (1) experimental arm&#xD;
      (early switch group) to take two-pill regimen for 96 weeks, or (2) control arm (delayed&#xD;
      switch group) where participants continue their current triple cART regimen for 48 weeks,&#xD;
      then switch to the two-pill regimen for another 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral load will be measured at each study visit to determine the percentage of participants&#xD;
      in each treatment arm with undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels at week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research urine and bloods will be taken, as well as questionnaires completed at&#xD;
      baseline and every 24 weeks to further investigate safety, tolerability, and quality of life&#xD;
      from switch of suppressive triple cART to doravirine + dolutegravir dual cART.&#xD;
