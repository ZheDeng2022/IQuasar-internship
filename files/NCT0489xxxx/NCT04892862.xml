  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to objectively analyze the effects of the non-vascularized autograft taken from&#xD;
      the radius and the dorsal and volar surgical approach on the preop and postop wrist&#xD;
      kinematics and the movements we use frequently in daily life, and to present the results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 20 working male patients between the ages of 20-50 who do not have active additional&#xD;
      diseases will be included in the study, and those who have not previously had trauma or&#xD;
      surgical intervention on the same extremity, and who do not have vascular and neurological&#xD;
      fields, These patients will be followed-up at the itf orthopedic clinic and the medical&#xD;
      faculty orthopedics clinic. their patients will be After the preop and postop union is&#xD;
      provided to the patients who will be divided into 2 groups of at least 10 people (in the 12th&#xD;
      month postop), the wrist motion analysis will be performed with the XSENS MTw Awinda 17&#xD;
      sensor full body motion capture system in the Bahçeşehir University biomechanics laboratory&#xD;
      (separate on the healthy side). In addition to the rum, 5 movements such as personal wc&#xD;
      cleaning, drinking coffee from the cup will be stimulated by looking at the healthy side.&#xD;

    <time_frame>preoperation , avarage of first year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Each item has five response options. The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability)-this is called the DASH score. The DASH questionnaire is used as an indicator of the impact of an impairment on the level and type of disability we expect decrease after operation</description>

    <measure>HAND MAYO SCORE</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperation , avarage of first year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo Wrist Score -- OrthoToolKit Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating a worse wrist condition and 100 indicating a better wrist condition. Original Literature: Cooney, W. P., et al. &quot;Difficult wrist fractures.</description>

    <measure>VAS SCORES</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperation , avarage of first year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot;</description>
