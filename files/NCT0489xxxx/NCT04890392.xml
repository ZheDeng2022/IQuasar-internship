  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the treatment of advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer is a research&#xD;
      hotspot in the academic community. In Asia, Siewert type II and type III are the main types&#xD;
      of advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer. The current consensus in the academic&#xD;
      community for the treatment of this part of the tumor is based on the principles of diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of gastric cancer, of which the value of neoadjuvant therapy in this part of&#xD;
      the tumor has been paid more and more attention by scholars. However, there is no highly&#xD;
      recognized neoadjuvant therapy. The current situation will promote the development of&#xD;
      advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer to accurate preoperative staging, more&#xD;
      accurate population screening, more accurate targets and molecular markers. Immunotherapy is&#xD;
      a promising application in oncology. Several PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are approved by&#xD;
      FDA for the clinical treatment of melanoma and other tumors. Previous clinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that PD1/PD-L1 has limited efficacy in digestive tract tumors. However, on ASCO in&#xD;
      2020, Asian analysis of KEYNOTE-062 study showed that in HER-2 negative advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer with PD-1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 1 and CPS ≥ 10, the OS of PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      treatment was superior to that of chemotherapy group, with 24-month OS rate (CPS ≥ 1, 45% VS&#xD;
      23%, CPS ≥ 10, 54% VS 27%). Meanwhile, the results of PACIFIC study phase III clinical trial&#xD;
      showed that the 3-year OS of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody combined with radiotherapy in advanced&#xD;
      unresectable lung cancer was as high as 57%, which is expected to completely rewrite its&#xD;
      clinical practice. Immunotherapy is promising in cancer therapy. This study intends to use&#xD;
      immunotherapy combined with SOX (S-1 + Oxaliplatin) as a neoadjuvant therapy for advanced&#xD;
      gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer.&#xD;
