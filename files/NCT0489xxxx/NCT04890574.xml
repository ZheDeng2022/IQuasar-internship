  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the CellMist™ System in the&#xD;
      treatment of deep second degree burns (II°B) in a prospective, multicenter, feasibility pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years of age inclusive with a ≤ 30% Total Body Surface&#xD;
      Area (TBSA) that requires surgical or enzymatic debridement and split thickness skin grafting&#xD;
      (STSG) on any body surface excluding the face, joints, perineum and hands will be considered&#xD;
      for participation in this study. CellMist™ solution (autologous epidermal and dermal cells)&#xD;
      will be administered, via the System Skin Gun™, will be evenly distributed to aid in burn&#xD;
      healing. Healing, pain and treatment-related adverse events will be evaluated at follow-up&#xD;
      visits. Data concerning safety of the CellMist™ System will be collected. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated in terms of treatment and serious related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in up to 9 total visits (screening, treatment and 7 follow-up&#xD;
      study visits) over a period of 52 weeks. Up to 14 subjects will be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      within this at up to 4 institutions.&#xD;

          1. Is between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has at least one discrete deep second degree (II°B) thermal burn injury (≤ 30% Total&#xD;
             Body Surface Area (TBSA)) that requires surgical or enzymatic debridement and split&#xD;
             thickness skin grafting (STSF) on any body surface excluding the face, joints,&#xD;
             perineum and hands;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Agrees to abstain from any other surgical treatment of the wound(s) for the duration&#xD;
             of the study unless determined by the Principal Investigator to be medically&#xD;
             necessary;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment with CellMist™ occurs with 7 days of burn injury;&#xD;
