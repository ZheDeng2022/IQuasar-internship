      Background and study aims: Executive functions (EF) and social functions are important for&#xD;
      self-regulation, problem solving, and attaining future goals yet they are impaired in Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Physical exercise (PE) is found to enhance these central cognitive&#xD;
      and social impairments in ASD. While limited research has begun to target these impairments&#xD;
      in clinical samples, the presence of sub-clinical traits of ASD (refer to as broad autism&#xD;
      phenotype (BAP)) in the general population is more common than the 1% prevalence of ASD.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is crucial to study these impairments in the sub-clinical individuals. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the effectiveness of PE in enhancing the EF and social functions in&#xD;
      the BAP adolescents. Method: Participants will be recruited from the local community and they&#xD;
      should be between the age of 7-20 years without any psychiatric disorders. Expected results:&#xD;
      PE is predicted to be effective in reducing the EF and social impairments in these&#xD;
      adolescents. Implications: These findings can inform us with the knowledge to design a&#xD;
      community-based PE training targeting EF problems in these adolescents with BAP in the local&#xD;
      context. Ultimately, this training can be incorporated to the curriculum of the primary and&#xD;
      secondary schools targeting BAP and associated impairments in adolescents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Executive functions (EF) refer to goal-directed cognitive processes consisting of three major&#xD;
      components including cognitive flexibility (mental flexibility), inhibition (inhibitory&#xD;
      control) and working memory. These components interact with each other and play a crucial&#xD;
      role in a range of life outcomes including mental and physical health, school and job success&#xD;
      and marital harmony. In addition, higher EF is associated with better problem solving,&#xD;
      reasoning and planning skills as well as social functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by social&#xD;
      communication and interaction impairments, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of&#xD;
      behavior. Individuals with ASD have EF impairments which are linked to the restricted and&#xD;
      repetitive behaviors that characterise this condition. The prevalence of ASD is increasing&#xD;
      with as many as 1 in 68 individuals, which further augments the burden to the ASD&#xD;
      individuals, their families and society. Hence, it is essential to investigate the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism of ASD and design a cost-effective training that can be widely adopted in the&#xD;
      community to reduce impairments arising from ASD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, ASD traits occur on a continuum, and increasingly there is recognition of a&#xD;
      broader autism phenotype (BAP) in those that show sub-clinical symptoms. Similarly, these&#xD;
      individuals also show impairments in executive function and social functions, making this&#xD;
      group an important target for the development and implementation of interventions. As such,&#xD;
      we can deliver appropriate training at an earlier stage to prevent associated impairments in&#xD;
      those with ASD traits. Therefore, instead of ASD, the present study examines the individuals&#xD;
      with BAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given EF impairments along with social function deficits are found in the sub-clinical&#xD;
      individuals with BAP, is the training pertaining to ASD applicable to these individuals? In&#xD;
      prior literature, physical exercise (PE) has been proved to enhance EF and social functions.&#xD;
      For instance, regular PE can enhance cerebral blood flow and increase the formation of new&#xD;
      blood vessels in a number of brain regions that are involved in EF and social functions. More&#xD;
      specifically, PE is shown to enhance the performance of EF in healthy children and&#xD;
      pre-adolescents and those with ASD. For example, it was found that PE including jogging&#xD;
      significantly decreased the repetitive and off-task behaviors and the level of aggression in&#xD;
      individuals with ASD. Nevertheless, although PE is shown to be beneficial to reduce the&#xD;
      symptoms and EF as well as social impairments in ASD, whether it produces the same positive&#xD;
      outcomes in the non-clinical individuals. To address the research questions listed above,&#xD;
      this proposed study aims to investigate whether PE training enhances the EF and social&#xD;
      functions in the adolescents with BAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the benefits of physical exercise have been studied in the ASD, BAP is under studied&#xD;
      in prior literature. This proposed study will extend from the current literature to&#xD;
      investigate the non-clinical group who have autistic traits with a longitudinal and&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design (RCT). The findings of this proposed study have multiple&#xD;
      levels of significance and implications. For instance, if the hypotheses are supported, the&#xD;
      PE training which is more cost-effective than psychotherapy in treating EF and social&#xD;
      functioning deficits and associated impairments can be promoted to school settings.&#xD;
      Ultimately, it can be incorporated to the curriculum of the primary and secondary schools to&#xD;
      reduce BAP and associated impairments in the adolescents. Secondly, by examining those with&#xD;
      sub- clinical symptoms, this research will contribute to early trainings approaches for the&#xD;
      condition. Lastly, this proposed study can also help promote physical activities among&#xD;
      adolescents which can further decrease mental and health issues in the local context.&#xD;
