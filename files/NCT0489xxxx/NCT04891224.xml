  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to understand the use of a mobile app (titled Pathway) to help&#xD;
      patients track depression symptoms, medications, side effects, and goals in addition to the&#xD;
      usual care with their doctor. Investigators will compare the effect of the app over 6 months&#xD;
      and examine whether the app can increase engagement between patients and their doctor and&#xD;
      help in the management of illnesses as patients start a new treatment for depression. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that using an app to facilitate management of depression symptoms,&#xD;
      medication use, and side effects will help patients and their providers understand their&#xD;
      response to medications and lead to better response and improvements in depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pre- and post- study design will be utilized to assess the impact of implementing the&#xD;
      Pathway Platform in the primary care setting. The Pathway Platform consists of a mobile app&#xD;
      for patients and a care team interface that can be accessed through Epic (electronic medical&#xD;
      record system). Up to 20 primary care sites will be identified to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Care team members involved in depression management will receive education on evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical practices for depression care, such as measurement-based care practices and shared-&#xD;
      decision making. Clinics with behavioral resources will also receive additional education on&#xD;
      behavioral health integration. Training on how to onboard patients to use the Pathway&#xD;
      Platform and utilize electronic medical records to view data collected in the Pathway&#xD;
      Platform will also be provided. Study outcomes identified in this protocol will be assessed&#xD;
      among 200 patients who will be enrolled in the Pathway Platform (post-implementation cohort).&#xD;
      Outcomes will also be assessed in another 200 patients from the same participating clinics&#xD;
      prior to study implantation (pre-implantation cohort). Implementation success will be&#xD;
      evaluated by comparing study outcomes among the two cohorts with a total sample size of 400&#xD;
      patients (of which 200 will receive the intervention and 200 will not). The primary outcome&#xD;
      is PHQ-9 utilization over six months and will be compared between the pre- and post-&#xD;
      implementation cohorts. Additional process measures will be compared, including&#xD;
      shared-decision making, medication adjustments, referrals to behavioral health, primary care&#xD;
      follow-up post hospitalizations, and remission and response. Data collected in the Pathway&#xD;
      Platform will also be evaluated to explore pre-defined patient outcomes.&#xD;
