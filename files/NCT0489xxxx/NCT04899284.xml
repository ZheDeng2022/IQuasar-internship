  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of early bimanual stimulation in babies with&#xD;
      clinical signs of underuse of one hand. The observation focuses on the developmental curve of&#xD;
      hands use. The intervention is provided by the family environment and takes place in the&#xD;
      child's familiar surroundings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital hemiplegia, often referred to as Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP), is characterized&#xD;
      by a unilateral or asymmetrical brain injury that occurs around birth and impacts the&#xD;
      development of manual skills and motor abilities of one side of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affected children frequently develop hemiplegia with major limitations in the use of their&#xD;
      impaired hand, resulting in poor bimanual coordination, thus impacting the performance of&#xD;
      daily activities at home, school and in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several intensive therapy approaches currently exist, including the bimanual approach (BIM)&#xD;
      which aims to improve the use of the affected hand as an assisting hand in daily functional&#xD;
      activities. These approaches have long been established as effective, however, with these&#xD;
      children reaching 90% of their potential gross motor skills around the age of 5, or even&#xD;
      earlier in some cases, there is a growing interest in earlier approaches, well before school&#xD;
      age. It has also long been established that during the first year of life, there is a&#xD;
      critical time frame for hand motor development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have thus set up an intensive bimanual stimulation program for infants&#xD;
      showing early signs of UCP, delivered by the family environment, in the child's familiar&#xD;
      surroundings, under the guidance of a therapist, over a period of 2 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Hand Assessment in Infants (HAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 months with a weekly evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The HAI was developed for infants 3 to 12 months of age; the test is performed by filming the baby during a 10-minute play session. The examiner stimulates the baby with specific toys to induce hand actions, separately and together. Scoring includes 12 unimanual and five bimanual items, each scored on a 3-modality response scale (0, 1 or 2 points). The HAI provides a score for each of the upper limbs (out of 24 points), allowing quantification of possible asymmetry in the form of an index, as well as an interval measure of hand use (the total raw score out of 58 is converted to a scale from 0 to 100 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 months with a weekly evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The children will wear two accelerometers (one on each wrist) several times a week, during specific time sessions (training-game time guided by the parents and free play time). The data will be recorded on three axes (vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral) and will be converted into activity quantity, with calculations such as the amplitude of the average vector, and the ratio of use between the two upper limbs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2 months with a weekly evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>A maximum of 2 objectives will be determined with the parents: they will have to involve the use of the upper limb in practical situations of daily life, where a clear asymmetry of use has been observed, in order to be able to assess the evolution.&#xD;
The methodology used will be GAS 3 markers, the final score will be expressed on a 5-level ordinal scale, between (-2) and (+2), where (-2) corresponds to the initial level, (-1) to progress without having reached the expected level, (0) to reaching the expected level, (+1) to progress beyond the expected level, and (-2) to the most favourable result for the given objective.</description>
