      This is a randomized, double-masked, two-treatment, single-period, parallel design, multiple&#xD;
      dose at multiple clinical trial sites designed to demonstrate bioequivalence with clinical&#xD;
      endpoint in subjects with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes.&#xD;

      Subjects with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both the eyes and meeting&#xD;
      all the mentioned inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be identified.&#xD;
      Qualifying Intra Ocular Pressure (IOPs) following wash-out, at baseline (Day 0 at anytime of&#xD;
      the day) should be ≥ 22 milli meter mercury (mm Hg) and ≤ 34 mm Hg in each eye and any&#xD;
      asymmetry of IOP between the eyes no greater than 5 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive one drop of investigational product (either A or B) in both the eyes&#xD;
      every evening at approximately 10:00 pm ± 2 hours for 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will undergo clinical evaluations throughout the study in order to assess&#xD;
      efficacy and safety. Study subject primary endpoint evaluation will be assessed after 2 weeks&#xD;
      (day 14) and 6 weeks ( Day 42) of treatment for each study subject deemed eligible for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary bioequivalence comparison is between the test and reference products for the mean&#xD;
      difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) of both eyes between the two treatment groups at six&#xD;
      time points, i.e., at 00.00 hours (between 8:00am and 10:00 am), 04.00 hours (at 4 hours&#xD;
      after 00.00 hours) and 08.00 hours ( at 8 hours after 00.00 hours) on Day 14 (week 2) and Day&#xD;
      42 (week 6) visits.&#xD;
