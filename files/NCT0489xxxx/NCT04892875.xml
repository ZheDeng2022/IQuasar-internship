  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation in combination with the investigational study drugs zimberelimab (AB122) and&#xD;
      etrumadenant (AB928) in subjects with a locally advances head or neck cancer. The study will&#xD;
      also ask how the study drugs change the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The microbiome that lives in the mouth and on the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune cells as they respond to a skin wound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scarring (fibrosis) caused by radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing a screening phase, subjects will be assigned to one of three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Subjects who will receive cisplatin, radiation and zimberelimab followed by&#xD;
           zimberelimab only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Subjects who will receive cisplatin, radiation, zimberelimab and etrumadenant&#xD;
           followed by zimberelimab and etrumadent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Subjects who will receive cisplatin and radiation followed by an observation&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three cohorts will be followed for a 24 months following the conclusion of the&#xD;
      chemoradiation.&#xD;
