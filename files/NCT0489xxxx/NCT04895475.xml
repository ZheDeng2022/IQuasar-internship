    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to conduct a prospective longitudinal surveillance&#xD;
      research study, enrolling approximately 60 lactating mothers who receive the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccine, and then following their clinical and laboratory parameters for up to 12 months. The&#xD;
      overall goal is to investigate the characteristics of antibody formation in lactating women&#xD;
      receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, documenting the antibody isotypes, titers, duration, and&#xD;
      transfer into milk over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the global and pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) continues,&#xD;
      many knowledge gaps remain regarding the epidemiology and transmission of infection, the&#xD;
      immunological responses after viral exposure, and the immunological protection after vaccine&#xD;
      administration. Cincinnati had its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 14, 2020, and&#xD;
      despite extensive shelter-in-place and social distancing efforts, community spread has&#xD;
      continued over the past 10 months with several distinct infection surges. As SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccines are becoming available in early 2021, it is important to understand the&#xD;
      immunological effects of these vaccines and to contrast them to the effects of natural&#xD;
      infection. Of particular interest are the immunological effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for&#xD;
      lactating women, and whether breast milk will include secretory antibodies against the virus&#xD;
      that potentially confer protection to the breastfeeding infant. The investigators have a&#xD;
      unique but time-limited opportunity to track the humoral immunological responses of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among lactating women. The investigators designed Antibody Detection&#xD;
      of Vaccine-Induced Secretory Effects (ADVISE) to collect and analyze serial breast milk&#xD;
      samples for secretory antibody responses, along with periodic blood testing of the mothers&#xD;
      and their breastfeeding children. In ADVISE, the investigators will document the prevalence&#xD;
      and cumulative incidence of secretory antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and gain&#xD;
      insights into the protective immunological effects of elective vaccine administration.&#xD;

      Breast milk: A small amount of breast milk (up to 10 mL) will be collected by the mother and&#xD;
      frozen for future analysis. One breast milk sample per week is requested during the first&#xD;
      eight weeks of study participation or until 3 months after the final vaccine dose (whichever&#xD;
      is longer). Samples can be provided at an increased frequency (up to five times per week) in&#xD;
      special circumstances such as a recent COVID infection or childbirth, or off schedule at the&#xD;
      time of weaning, at the request of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood: Finger-stick blood samples will be collected from study participants at baseline and&#xD;
      then every two weeks for four consecutive samples or until 3 months after the final vaccine&#xD;
      dose (whichever is longer) for serologic testing. Blood will be collected monthly from 3&#xD;
      through 6 months after final vaccination, and quarterly thereafter. Volumes of blood will be&#xD;
      up to 0.5 mL at each collection, using small-sample Mitra devices from a finger stick.&#xD;
