      Retrospective observational study of the efficacy and safety of statin monotherapy or statins&#xD;
      in combination with ezetimibe in patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy in both primary&#xD;
      and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The study will include patients&#xD;
      receiving lipid-lowering therapy in both primary and secondary prevention of CVD who have&#xD;
      received therapy of interest for ≥ 3 months in the 2 years preceding the signing of informed&#xD;
      consent, i.e. statins as monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe in a stable mode&#xD;
      (without dose adjustment and/or statin replacement). Effectiveness of therapy will be&#xD;
      evaluated based on the data on changes in baseline levels of total cholesterol (CS), low&#xD;
      density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides (TG), data on&#xD;
      which will be obtained from primary medical records. Demographic and anthropometric data on&#xD;
      patients, information on the history of hyperlipidemia and concomitant diseases will also be&#xD;
      obtained. Also, the study will collect data on the development of adverse reactions of&#xD;
      particular interest during therapy (liver/muscle damage, major cardiovascular events (MACE).&#xD;
