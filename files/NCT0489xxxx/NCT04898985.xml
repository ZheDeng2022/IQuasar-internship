      Five hundred (500) patients participating in the LLS COVID-19 Registry, who have shown either&#xD;
      no antibody or limited antibody response by way of the Spike Antibody test to one of the&#xD;
      vaccinations authorized for emergency use (EUA) by FDA will participate in the LLS T-cells,&#xD;
      Blood Cancer and COVID-19 Clinical Research Study. They will be followed for at least ten&#xD;
      years (in the COVID-19 Registry). In addition, 500 patients with similar blood cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, also participating in the LLS COVID-19 Registry, who have shown full Spike&#xD;
      antibody response to one of the vaccinations authorized for emergency use (EUA) by FDA will&#xD;
      also be enrolled the LLS T-cells, Blood Cancer and COVID-19 Clinical Research Study for&#xD;
      comparison (as a control arm) and will also be followed for at least 10 years (in the&#xD;
      COVID-19 Registry).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LLS has partnered with Adaptive Biotechnologies, to provide their ImmunoSEQ research assay to&#xD;
      accumulate data about patients with blood cancer, who have received an FDA authorized&#xD;
      vaccination, and depending on the type of cancer, have developed no antibodies or limited&#xD;
      antibodies, to determine if these individuals have developed T-cells. While antibodies have&#xD;
      been a mainstay in measuring the immune response to vaccines, for COVID-19, it has become&#xD;
      clear that the T-cell response is necessary for a complete picture of immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hundred (500) patients participating in the LLS COVID-19 Registry, who have shown either&#xD;
      no antibody or limited antibody response by way of the Spike Antibody test to one of the&#xD;
      vaccinations authorized for emergency use (EUA) by FDA will participate in this Research&#xD;
      Study. They will be followed for at least ten years (in the COVID-19 Registry). In addition,&#xD;
      500 patients with similar blood cancer diagnosis, also participating in the LLS COVID-19&#xD;
      Registry, who have shown full Spike antibody response to one of the vaccinations authorized&#xD;
      for emergency use (EUA) by FDA will also be enrolled in this Research Study for comparison&#xD;
      (as a control arm) and will also be followed for at least 10 years (in the COVID-19&#xD;
      Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be advised that ImmunoSEQ is not an FDA authorized/approved diagnostic assay&#xD;
      and that as a &quot;research assay&quot; results cannot be shared with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process for patients to participate in the LLS T-cells, Blood Cancer and COVID-19&#xD;
      Clinical Research Study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LLS will identify who is eligible and who will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ciitizen will send an email to eligible patients to invite them to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be sent a study page Password and instructed not to share it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients will visit the LLS T-cells, Blood Cancer and COVID-19 Clinical&#xD;
           Research Study-specific page. Patients will be advised to read the entire Consent Form&#xD;
           and, if satisfied, patients will be asked to enter the password and then sign the pop-up&#xD;
           consent by entering Name, Email, and Phone Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 24 hours, patients will receive an email notifying them that their unique lab&#xD;
           slip has been uploaded into their Ciitizen account. To access, patients will login to&#xD;
           their Ciitzen account with their User ID/Password credentials for the LLS T-cells, Blood&#xD;
           Cancer and COVID-19 Clinical Research Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will schedule a blood draw at a LabCorp facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Note: Patients will be informed that Study results CAN NOT be shared with patients&#xD;
           individually; only in aggregate once the Study concludes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And, at any time, should patients have any questions, LLS contact information is on the&#xD;
           front page of the Informed Consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing electronic signature to the informed consent, this Research Study requires&#xD;
      patients who have received an FDA authorized vaccination, and depending on the type of&#xD;
      cancer, have developed no antibodies or limited antibodies, to provide one blood sample of&#xD;
      less than 3ccs drawn at any LabCorp facility (at no cost to patients). LabCorp facility&#xD;
      locations can be found online at&#xD;
      https://www.labcorp.com/labs-and-appointments-advanced-search.&#xD;
