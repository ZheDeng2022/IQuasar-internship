      Describe a behaviour intervention to analyse self-care engagement in heart failure patients.&#xD;
      Allocate patients with heart failure into 2 arms study: a control group and an intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to medical record at admission, a pilot study was described and included 63&#xD;
      patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III. Patients were&#xD;
      recruited in a hospital setting after discharge from a heart failure unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were allocated into a control group (n=33) and an intervention group (n=30) through&#xD;
      the computerised random allocation generator at http://random.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study was performed during three months per patient, with four moments of&#xD;
      assessment (baseline, first-week follow-up, first-month follow-up, third-month follow-up).&#xD;

    <description>A nurse provides the intervention with expertise in Heart Failure and addresses reinforcements on: a) an explanation on signs and symptoms of Heart Failure and how to recognise them; b) importance on daily fluid management, by planning 1.5-2 litres of liquids per day (e.g., soup, milk, coffee, water, tea and yoghurts); and c) when doctors or nurses should be contacted (when symptoms escalation or a weight gain of 2 kg in three days or 5 kg in a week were detected).</description>

    <description>The patient receives a leaflet, which includes information about HF, primary symptoms, awareness of its detection and the fluid management plan. It also receives a weight diary, which helps him/her recall weight fluctuation and contact the nurse or doctor to call for help in a previous stage and avoid hospitalisation. Patients have to explain what they understand by HF, on follow-ups contacts, which are the main symptoms, if they are experiencing any of them and which difficulties managing fluid restriction and weight control. The leading investigator validates the information and teaches back contents if required.</description>
