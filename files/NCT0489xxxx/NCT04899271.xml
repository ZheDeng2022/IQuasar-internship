  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate whether a 12 month treatment with ladarixin is effective to improve glycemic&#xD;
           control in newly diagnosed T1D adult patients with preserved beta-cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the safety of ladarixin in the specific clinical setting&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It will&#xD;
      randomize approximately 75 adult patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) and preserved&#xD;
      beta-cell function (fasting C-peptide &gt;0.205 nmol/l) at baseline. Patients will be assigned&#xD;
      (2:1) to receive either oral ladarixin treatment (400 mg b.i.d. for 13 cycles of 14 days&#xD;
      on/14 days off - treatment group) or placebo (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be competitive among the study sites, until the planned number of patients&#xD;
      is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ladarixin and placebo will be both administered for 1 year. All patients will be followed-up&#xD;
      for 18 months from the 1st administration of the study medication. The study database will be&#xD;
      locked and data analyzed when the last patient randomized has completed month 12 follow-up&#xD;
      visit. After this time point, the follow-up will continue under open-label conditions up to&#xD;
      month 18,&#xD;

    <description>The sample size of the study is calculated on the &quot;proportion of patients with a HbA1c &lt; 7% and daily insulin requirement &lt;0.50 IU/Kg/day&quot;, a post-hoc composite endpoint derived from data of the phase 2 trial (MEX0114), considering a larger effect size expected from the longer treatment length (one year versus 3 months).&#xD;
The time frame for the primary endpoint has been set at Month 12 (Week 52) in order to evaluate the potential of ladarixin effects on a long-term projection.</description>

    <measure>2-hour AUC of C-peptide response to the MMTT</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 6, 12 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>C-peptide level is a widely used measure of pancreatic beta-cell function. The MMTT is one of the methods for its estimation. The MMTT was performed after an overnight fast, at baseline (within 1 week prior to randomization), and at each follow-up visit on weeks 13±1, 26±2, and 52±2.&#xD;
Prior to the test, patients withheld long-acting insulin on the morning of the test. Rapid-acting and short-acting insulin were allowed up to 6hrs and 2 hrs, respectively, before the test. The test was rescheduled if the patient had a capillary glucose value of &gt;200mg/dL or &lt;70mg/dL.&#xD;
After 2 pre-meal basal samples had been drawn between -20 to 0 min (basal 1 and basal 2), patients were given 6mL/kg of a high protein nutritional drink up to a maximum of 360mL, to be drunk within 5 min. Post-meal samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min after the meal at Months 6, 12 and 18.</description>

    <measure>Time in range (TIR) by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 6, 12 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) continually monitors glucose plasma levels through an external device that's attached to the body, and gives real-time updates.Time in range is the amount of time the patient spends in the target blood sugar (blood glucose) range-between 70 and 180 mg/dL for most people.&#xD;
The time in range method works with the individual CGM's data by looking at the amount of time blood sugar has been in target range and the times it has been high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia).&#xD;
This data is helpful in finding out which types of foods and what activity level causes patient's blood sugar to rise and fall.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HbA1c levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 6, 12 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c measurement can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes providing that stringent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values, and there are no conditions present which preclude its accurate measurement.&#xD;
An HbA1c of 6.5% is recommended as the cut point for diagnosing diabetes. A value of less than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests.</description>
