  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, multi-national, investigator initiated and lead retrospective&#xD;
      analysis assessing the safety and the clinical use of covered stents for the treatment of the&#xD;
      dysfunctional vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no limitations on the type of covered stent use, the reason, or the length of the&#xD;
      treatment area. The only limitations are the one owed to covered stent diameter and that&#xD;
      patients included in the study should be treated for only one treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for inclusion, the outcome measures and the variables that should be recorded&#xD;
      are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also no limitation if data has been previously published in another study, however&#xD;
      data as part of an ongoing study, or of a study in press cannot be submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to previous experience from similar studies it is known that it will be difficult to have&#xD;
      data available for all re-interventions. Thus, study will focus on primary patency and&#xD;
      safety. Nevertheless, centers should provide data regarding circuit survival (thrombosis,&#xD;
      abandonment, surgical revision, patient's death). Terms and definitions of outcome measures&#xD;
      are provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study's final follow-up date is March 31st, 2021. Patient should have a minimum follow-up of&#xD;
      6 months to be included in the study at that timepoint, unless circuit is no longer in use&#xD;
      (thrombosis, abandonment, surgical revision, patient's death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a scientific committee's approval is needed for the data collection, it is the center's&#xD;
      responsibility to acquire it. If this is waived due to the nature of the study, this should&#xD;
      also be stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of data will be recorded so hopefully, a lot of meaningful evidence will come&#xD;
      up from this effort. As seen below, situations out of those allowed in the instructions for&#xD;
      use for covered stents are included (ruptures, pseudoaneurysms, cannulation zone placement&#xD;
      etc).&#xD;
