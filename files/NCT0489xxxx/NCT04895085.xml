  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the factors parents consider when&#xD;
      deciding whether their child will go to school in-person or attend from home. Investigators&#xD;
      are also interested in learning whether access to in-home COVID testing is of value to&#xD;
      parents and also whether it affects decision-making about returning to school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done at UW-Madison in partnership between the Department of Pediatrics&#xD;
      and the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. A total of 50 caregivers (plus&#xD;
      their children with medical complexity) will participate in this study. Additionally, 20&#xD;
      caregivers involved in the study may also be invited to participate in a one-hour, virtual&#xD;
      visit in which the caregiver demonstrates and discusses how they perform in-home COVID&#xD;
      testing with their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study may help researchers advance their understanding of in-home testing&#xD;
      strategies for children with medical complexity.&#xD;

    <description>BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen System (Abbott) is a point-of-care, lateral flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in direct anterior nasal (nares) swabs. Internal controls are built into the testing system and results are available in 15 minutes.&#xD;
The use of the BinaxNOW system is authorized under the Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization. The test is allowed for over-the-counter, non-prescription use with or without symptoms. The test may be used with children two years and older with the help of sample collection by an adult, and the test may be self-administered by anyone aged 15 years or more.</description>
