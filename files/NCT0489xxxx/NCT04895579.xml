  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study focuses on unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      patients who have disease progression while on Durvalumab consolidation after concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation with a goal of cure. The overall hypothesis of this study is that the addition&#xD;
      of Copanlisib to Durvalumab will be well-tolerated at a biweekly schedule. It will test&#xD;
      whether the addition of Copanlisib to Durvalumab can overcome resistance to Durvalumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment will be administered in outpatient settings. Durvalumab will be administered as&#xD;
      infusion intravenously once every two weeks on D1 and D15, every 28 days (10 mg/Kg based on&#xD;
      body weight). Copanlisib will be given as infusion intravenously on D1, D15 in a 28-day cycle&#xD;
      (flat dose). The starting dose of Copalisib will be 60 mg D1 and D15. It will be reduced to&#xD;
      45 mg for the first dose reduction and to 30 mg for the second dose reduction. The Durvalumab&#xD;
      dose will remain constant when Copanlisib is reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the appropriate dose is determined, e.g. Copanlisib 60 mg iv d1, 15, q4w, in the&#xD;
      dose-finding phase, this will become the recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated at the dose-expansion phase to increase our understanding of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and to confirm safety as well as initial efficacy in this population.&#xD;

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval between the date patients are started on Copanlisib treatment to the date of disease progression, death or last follow-up, whichever occurs first. Patients who are intolerant to treatment and removed from study by the principal investigator or withdraw from the study will be treated as censored data for the PFS analysis.</description>

    <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time interval between the initial response to therapy and subsequent disease progression or relapse. Non-responders will be assigned a DOR equal to zero.</description>
