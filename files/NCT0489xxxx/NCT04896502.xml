  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is about comparing asthma home assessments/interventions by telemedicine compared&#xD;
      to providing education alone. Interactive Video (IAV) defines telemedicine. It allows two-way&#xD;
      communication in real-time with both audio and visual communication between the subject and&#xD;
      someone from the study team. It is similar to using Face Time on a mobile device. Asthma home&#xD;
      assessments/interventions are used to identify things in a home that can make asthma symptoms&#xD;
      worse, called triggers. Reducing these triggers in the home can improve asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In this study, supplies will be given to some participants to help reduce or remove triggers&#xD;
      from the home. One example is dust mites. These are microscopic bugs that are found in every&#xD;
      home, cannot be seen by the naked eye, and make asthma symptoms worse. Part of the study&#xD;
      includes collecting two dust samples from home to check dust mite levels at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study and at the end. This study may help elucidate whether telemedicine home assessments&#xD;
      work better than education alone at lowering dust mite levels and improving a child's asthma&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>For the proposed study, participants will randomized to receive TM home assessments/interventions performed by a trained home visitor (HV) or standard of care asthma trigger education by the HV. Those who are randomized to TM home assessments/interventions will complete a baseline home assessment and two follow-up visits, 2 months apart. Visits will assess the presence of potential asthma triggers in the home and frequency of asthma symptoms/exacerbations. TM participants will be provided education and materials necessary to reduce asthma triggers in the home. Follow-up visits will assess the interval change in presence of asthma triggers, change in daily asthma symptoms/exacerbations, and participant/family retention of education.</description>
