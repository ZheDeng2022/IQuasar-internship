  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50.&#xD;
      Neovascular AMD, the most serious and severe form, is characterized by the appearance, spread&#xD;
      and growth of subretinal new vessels. One of the major molecular mediators is vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-vitreous (IVI) injection of an anti-VEGF can slow the progression of neovascular AMD&#xD;
      and stabilize vision in the majority of cases. Aflibercept (Eylea®) is one of the anti-VEGF&#xD;
      molecules approved in Belgium to treat neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of its use, aflibercept was first injected monthly and then according to the PRN&#xD;
      &quot;reactive&quot; protocol (Pro Renata). Over time, a new treatment strategy has emerged: the&#xD;
      &quot;treat-and-extend&quot; (T&amp;E). This is individualized patient care, the objective of which is to&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of injections while ensuring inactivity of the disease. This begins with&#xD;
      the loading dose, i.e. 3 injections given 4 weeks apart. Thereafter, the interval is&#xD;
      lengthened in increments of 1 or 2 weeks provided that the visual and anatomical results&#xD;
      remain stable. In the event of deterioration, the interval is shortened while keeping a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 weeks between each IVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of aflibercept, when used in a proactive T&amp;E regimen, was&#xD;
      demonstrated in the randomized controlled trial, ALTAIR. However, data on T&amp;E used in&#xD;
      practice is still lacking. routine, and particularly the number of injections and treatment&#xD;
      intervals over a minimum 24 month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective study carried out at the CHU Brugmann is to determine the&#xD;
      number of injections and the intervals necessary to have encouraging results in terms of&#xD;
      visual acuity, over a treatment period of at least one year.&#xD;
