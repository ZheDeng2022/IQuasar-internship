  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physician burnout is a global issue characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,&#xD;
      and low levels of personal accomplishment. Recent evidence suggests that&#xD;
      organization-directed interventions were more likely to lead to reductions in burnout when&#xD;
      compared to physician-directed interventions. More specifically, the leadership behaviors of&#xD;
      the direct physician supervisor play a critical role in the well-being of physicians they&#xD;
      supervise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the aims of this project are: 1) To improve our understanding of the prevalence of&#xD;
      burnout and professional satisfaction of physicians working at the Ottawa Hospital (TOH), and&#xD;
      2) To evaluate the relationship between the leadership qualities of direct physician&#xD;
      supervisors (i.e. Division and Department Heads) and the well-being and burnout of their&#xD;
      physicians. Specifically, a cross-sectional survey will be completed by physicians at TOH to&#xD;
      assess their levels of burnout and satisfaction and the leadership qualities of their direct&#xD;
      physician supervisors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physician burnout is a global issue characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,&#xD;
      and low levels of personal accomplishment. Burnout symptoms as high as 50% have been&#xD;
      documented worldwide. According to the 2018 National Physician Health Survey, 30% of Canadian&#xD;
      Physicians and Residents are experiencing burnout, with 26% high emotional exhaustion and 15%&#xD;
      high depersonalization. Physician burnout is associated with low job satisfaction, decreased&#xD;
      quality of patient care, reduced productivity, high job turnover, and early retirement from&#xD;
      clinical practice. However, evidence suggests burnout is reversible and even preventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that organization-directed interventions were more likely to lead to&#xD;
      reductions in burnout when compared to physician-directed interventions. More specifically,&#xD;
      the leadership behaviors of the direct physician supervisor play a critical role in the&#xD;
      well-being of physicians they supervise. To date, we are unaware of any study that has&#xD;
      examined the relationship between organizational leadership and degree of burnout and&#xD;
      professional satisfaction in a Canadian tertiary care centre. Understanding physician burnout&#xD;
      and professional satisfaction has strategic importance to the health of the physician, the&#xD;
      patient, and the organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study of 2813 physicians at the Mayo clinic found that each 1-point increase in&#xD;
      supervisor's leadership score was associated with a 3.3% decrease in the likelihood of&#xD;
      burnout and 9% increase in satisfaction of physicians. Furthermore, 11% and 47% of the&#xD;
      variation of burnout and satisfaction, respectively, was attributed to the leadership rating&#xD;
      of the physician's supervisor. The findings from this study further highlight the importance&#xD;
      of prioritizing leadership as a key performance indicator, but it is necessary to first&#xD;
      determine whether the Mayo Clinic's findings can be translated to a Canadian tertiary care&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the aims of this project are: 1) To improve our understanding of the prevalence of&#xD;
      burnout and professional satisfaction of physicians working at TOH, and 2) To evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between the leadership qualities of direct physician supervisors (i.e. Division&#xD;
      and Department Heads) and the well-being and burnout of their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will use Shanafelt et al's study as a guide to investigate leadership qualities at&#xD;
      TOH. A cross-sectional online survey will be completed by physicians at TOH that will assess&#xD;
      their levels of burnout and satisfaction and the leadership qualities of their direct&#xD;
      physician supervisor.&#xD;
