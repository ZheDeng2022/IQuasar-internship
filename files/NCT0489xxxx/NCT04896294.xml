  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, three-arm parallel groups study of the effect of&#xD;
      toothpastes containing Ca-hydroxyapatite (HAP), Mg-Zn-hydroxyapatite (Zn-Mg-HAP), or&#xD;
      fluoroapatite (FAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of toothpastes containing Ca-hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      (HAP), fluoroapatite (FAP), and Mg-Zn-hydroxyapatite (Mg-Zn-HAP) on dentin hypersensitivity&#xD;
      associated with dental abrasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. Thirty consent patients aged 35-45 with dentin hypersensitivity&#xD;
      associated with abrasion will be recruited for the study. The study will have 2 phases:&#xD;
      preparatory phase (recruitment of the patients, standardization of their oral hygiene&#xD;
      protocols, wash-out period, calibration of the researchers and training) and the main part&#xD;
      (double-blind, randomized, parallel groups study of toothpastes effect). Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups (group 1 - toothpastes with Ca-HAP, group 2 - toothpastes with&#xD;
      Zn-Mg-HAP, group 3 - toothpastes with FAP). Clinical examination will be performed at the&#xD;
      baseline, after 2 and 4 weeks, and will include patient's interview, oral hygiene level&#xD;
      assessment (OHI-S), and dentin sensitivity testing (Shiff's index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will be no statistically significant differences in dentin&#xD;
      sensitivity level between the study groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) represents a sharp, short pain arising from exposed&#xD;
      dentin in response to various stimuli which cannot be ascribed to any other form of dental&#xD;
      defect or pathology. The use of toothpastes containing various HAP-formulations has become&#xD;
      one of the most common methods for dentin hypersensitivity management. However, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of literature concerning the comparison of the effect of different HAP-formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, three-arm parallel groups study of the effect of&#xD;
      toothpastes containing Ca-hydroxyapatite (HAP), Mg-Zn-hydroxyapatite (Zn-Mg-HAP), or&#xD;
      fluoroapatite (FAP). The groups will include adults with DH diagnosed clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of toothpastes containing Ca-hydroxyapatite,&#xD;
      fluoroapatite, and Mg-Zn-hydroxyapatite on dentin hypersensitivity in patients with dental&#xD;
      abrasion. The sample size was determined according to the trial by Vano et al. (2017), where&#xD;
      similar design was used. The power was set at 80%, alfa-level was set as 0.05, the means in&#xD;
      the study groups were 2.65Â±0.68 and 1.72. The allocation ratio was equal to 1. The resultant&#xD;
      target sample size comprised 10 participants in each group (7 participants according to&#xD;
      sample size calculations plus 30% to account for possible drop-out), 30 patients total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized on&#xD;
      Baseline/Screening Visit in a 1:1:1 ratio to the Group 1, 2, or 3 in accordance with a&#xD;
      computer-generated schedule prepared by a third-party person, who will not participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is estimated to complete enrollment within 1 week from study initiation; however,&#xD;
      enrollment will remain open until the study goal is met. The duration of this study for each&#xD;
      subject will be a maximum of eight (8) weeks: 4 weeks - preparatory period and 4 weeks -&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the study with the subject and obtain written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assign the subject a unique screening/enrollment number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review and record medical history, and medication history to determine eligibility based&#xD;
           on inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document vitals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document all current medications, including medications over-the-counter and herbal&#xD;
           medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administer OHI-S and Shiff test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The allocation concealment will be performed by the use of containers numbered by a&#xD;
                &quot;third party&quot; (person, who will not participate in the study). The toothpastes in&#xD;
                white bottles without any titles will be placed in the containers. The weight of&#xD;
                the pastes and bottles in different groups will be the same. The patient on&#xD;
                enrolment will receive a sealed container with a toothpaste. Neither patients nor&#xD;
                researchers will be aware of the type of a toothpaste received by each patient&#xD;
                (double blinding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit (2 weeks from the baseline visit) - all groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simplified Oral Hygiene index (OHI-S),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schiff test for the assessment of enamel sensitivity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit (2 weeks from the second visit) = Final Study Visit - all groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simplified Oral Hygiene index (OHI-S),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schiff test for the assessment of enamel sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess for complications following treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document all current medications, including medications over-the-counter and herbal&#xD;
           medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory phase of the study &quot;Wash-out&quot; period and patient training Most recruited patients&#xD;
      with DH are using desensitizing products, and a &quot;wash-out&quot; period will be included before&#xD;
      subjects enter the main phase of the study. During this time, the potential study population&#xD;
      should not use desensitizing, and their home-care regimen and products will be standardized&#xD;
      (provision of identical toothpastes and identical soft toothbrushes). Oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions will be given and the compliance with the recommendations will be controlled&#xD;
      with weekly visits to the dental office. The participants will be familiarized with the&#xD;
      assessment techniques and trial procedures. Initial sensitivity measurements will be made so&#xD;
      that erratic and inconsistent responders can be identified and eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualification and calibration of the observers The clinical examinations will be performed by&#xD;
      two dentists who are the members of Therapeutic Dentistry Department, Sechenov University,&#xD;
      Moscow, Russia. The examiners will be trained and calibrated to obtain an intra- and&#xD;
      inter-examiner agreement of 90%, using Kappa statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main phase of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty people aged 35-45 will be examined and randomly assigned to one of the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will use toothpaste containing HAP. Group 2 will use toothpaste containing Mg-Zn-HAP.&#xD;
      Group 3 will use toothpaste containing FAP. The allocation concealment will be performed by&#xD;
      the use of containers numbered by a &quot;third party&quot; (person, who will not participate in the&#xD;
      study). The toothpastes in white bottles without any titles will be placed in the containers.&#xD;
      The weight of the pastes and bottles in different groups will be the same. The patient on&#xD;
      enrolment will receive a sealed container with a toothpaste. Neither patients nor researchers&#xD;
      will be aware of the type of a toothpaste used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol The assigned toothpastes and uniform toothbrushes should be used twice&#xD;
      daily according to the technique which was used during the preparatory phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will use the prescribed toothpastes for a month. Control examinations will be&#xD;
      carried out in the following periods: 2 weeks and 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simplified Oral Hygiene index (OHI-S), Schiff test for the assessment of enamel sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schiff test is performed to assess enamel sensitivity in all groups as follows: air from&#xD;
      air/water syringe is applied perpendicular to the cervical areas of all teeth from a distance&#xD;
      of 1 cm for a second. Enamel sensitivity is estimated in accordance with the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - no reaction,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - discomfort but the patient does not insist on stopping the test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - discomfort, accompanied by a request to discontinue the test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - severe pain reaction with pronounced motor reactions aimed at the immediate&#xD;
           termination of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and reporting. Data will be collected at the following points: at baseline,&#xD;
      and after 2 and 4 weeks of the assigned toothpastes use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the study will be maintained for two (2) years after the date the investigation is&#xD;
      completed, terminated or until the records are no longer required to support the protocol,&#xD;
      whichever date is later. Patient records and data are eligible for inspection and/or copying&#xD;
      by applicable regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping Data entry will be completed in the RedCap database (which&#xD;
      will cover all the created CRFs). The data will be exported into CSV file format, which will&#xD;
      then be used for data analysis. Only de-identified data will be used for data analysis. All&#xD;
      hard copy documents will be shredded within five years after completion of the study upon&#xD;
      Sponsor approval. Collected de-identified data will be sent to a biostatistician for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes. It is the expectation that all of the tested toothpastes (HAP, Mg Zn HAP,&#xD;
      FAP) will show comparable outcomes. Improvements in tooth hypersensitivity are expected in&#xD;
      all groups. Data interpretation and the statistical significance of the results will be&#xD;
      described later in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions. There is no expectation of any adverse outcomes or reactions due to a&#xD;
      patient using the assigned toothpastes. However, hypersensitivity reactions to some of the&#xD;
      toothpastes' components are still possible. All participants will be given access to contact&#xD;
      info of the investigators. Any adverse reactions should be reported immediately to the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for Withdrawal or Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is not compliant with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event that in the opinion of the Investigator would be in the best interest of&#xD;
           the subject to discontinue study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation requiring discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for&#xD;
           any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan All analyses will be performed using per-protocol population: the&#xD;
      researchers will analyse all subjects who did not substantially deviate from the protocol as&#xD;
      to be determined on a per-subject basis by the study principal investigator immediately&#xD;
      before database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality and sphericity of distribution will be assessed with Shapiro-Wilk and Leven's&#xD;
      tests, respectively. The data will be presented as means, standard deviations and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for each group at each timepoint of the study. Three-way repeated&#xD;
      measures mixed ANOVA model will be performed followed by post-hoc Nemeniy test with&#xD;
      adjustment for multiple comparisons. All summary tables will be structured with a column for&#xD;
      each timepoint and rows for each toothpaste used in the order (HAP, Zn-Mg-HAP, FAP) and will&#xD;
      be annotated with the total population size relevant to that table/treatment, including any&#xD;
      missing observations.&#xD;
