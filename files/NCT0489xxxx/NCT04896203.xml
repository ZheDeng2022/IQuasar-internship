      Descriptive study, in which the haemostatic profile of ambulatory patients with IBD will be&#xD;
      analyzed by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and other techniques, such as thrombin&#xD;
      generation test and platelet function study by flow cytometry. The results of these&#xD;
      measurements will be subsequently compared between the different IBD patient groups,&#xD;
      stratified by activity and other risk factors, as well as with healthy controls, in order to&#xD;
      define in which of these situations a significant prothrombotic risk exists, and which part&#xD;
      of the coagulation cascade conditions that risk. After this, we will describe the incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence of thromboembolic events in the follow-up of these patient groups. Finally, an&#xD;
      attempt will be made to determine, according to the results of the study if any of the&#xD;
      situations outside the classic recommendations would be subsidiary to receive&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis for the thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the possible state of hypercoagulability of ambulatory&#xD;
      patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, stratified according to the characteristics of&#xD;
      their disease, by using ROTEM as well as the thrombin generation test. Platelet function will&#xD;
      also be evaluated by flow cytometry.&#xD;
