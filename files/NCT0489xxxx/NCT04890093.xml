  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug PEN-866 can remain in tumor cells longer than it does in normal cells. It also may&#xD;
      be more effective than other drugs at treating Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn if combining PEN-866 with other drugs can treat certain cancers in&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if the combination of PEN-866 with vincristine and temozolomide can be used to treat&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with solid tumors that have returned after or did not respond to&#xD;
      standard treatments, or for which there are no standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 12-39 years who have solid tumors, Ewing sarcoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma that&#xD;
      returned after or did not respond to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and eye exam. They will&#xD;
      have heart function tests. They may have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.&#xD;
      They will give blood and urine samples. They may have a tumor biopsy. Some samples will be&#xD;
      used for genetic testing. Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 3 drugs for up to 18 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days. They will get&#xD;
      PEN-866 and vincristine by IV infusion (a tube in their vein) on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle.&#xD;
      They will take temozolomide by mouth on Days 1-5 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about their physical, mental, and social health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. They may be contacted&#xD;
      by phone or email for the rest of their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan is a prodrug of an inhibitor of topoisomerase 1 (active metabolite is SN-38) with&#xD;
      known activity in sarcomas, however it has limitations including suboptimal bioavailability&#xD;
      and systemic side effects including severe diarrhea and bone marrow suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical evidence has demonstrated that prolonged exposure to topoisomerase 1&#xD;
      inhibition produces superior responses in pediatric-type sarcomas, compared to shorter&#xD;
      exposures of irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEN-866 is a novel molecule consisting of SN-38 conjugated to a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)&#xD;
      inhibitor that has been shown to have a pharmacokinetic (PK) advantage over irinotecan in&#xD;
      preclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical data have shown that PEN-866 acts as a tumor delivery agent for&#xD;
      SN-38, allowing SN-38 to remain in tumor cells substantially longer than it remains in normal&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, PEN-866 has superior efficacy&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics compared to irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEN-866 has completed phase 1 testing in adults as a single agent but has yet to be tested in&#xD;
      any combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vincristine/irinotecan/temozolomide (VIT) is a standard relapse regimen for several pediatric&#xD;
      sarcomas, with objective responses reported in a subset of subjects with Ewing sarcoma and&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of PEN-866 that&#xD;
      can be combined with vincristine and temozolomide in adolescent and young adult (AYA)&#xD;
      subjects (12-39 years) with relapsed or refractory solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Determine the objective response rate (CR + PR by RECIST v1.1) of the combination of&#xD;
      vincristine, temozolomide and PEN-866 at the RP2D in AYA subjects (12-39 years) with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma after a maximum of 18 cycles of the&#xD;
      combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 12 and &lt; 39 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of a relapsed or refractory solid tumor and have archival tissue available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate performance status and adequate major organ function and have recovered from acute&#xD;
      toxicity of all prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 12 and &lt; 39 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma and have archival&#xD;
      tissue available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must not have received prior combination therapy with irinotecan and temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate performance status and adequate major organ function and have recovered from acute&#xD;
      toxicity of all prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of PEN-866 given&#xD;
      in combination with vincristine and temozolomide in adolescents and young adults with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 portion will use a standard 3 + 3 design with limited dose escalations to define the&#xD;
      MTD or the highest safe dose tested of PEN-866 when given in combination with standard dosing&#xD;
      of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8) and temozolomide (100 mg/m2 orally on days 1-5)&#xD;
      given in 21 day cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 component will use Simon minimax two-stage phase II trial design and will enroll two&#xD;
      expansion cohorts of subjects (Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Ewing sarcoma cohort, up to a total of 25 evaluable subjects will be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the rhabdomyosarcoma cohort, up to a total of 17 evaluable subjects will be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential additional phase 2 expansion cohort may open for enrollment with an amendment if&#xD;
      there are subjects with diagnoses other than rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma who have&#xD;
      demonstrated possible benefit from this combination by experiencing a response in the phase 1&#xD;
      portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum number of treatment cycles is 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 12 subjects will be required to determine the MTD during phase 1, and a maximum&#xD;
      of 42 (25+17) evaluable subjects will be accrued for the phase 2 cohorts. To allow for a&#xD;
      small number of inevaluable subjects and to accommodate screen failures, the accrual ceiling&#xD;
      will be set at 64.&#xD;

        Laboratory of Pathology, NCI or participating site s Pathology Department. A formalin fixed&#xD;
        tissue block or at least 5 unstained slides (10 micron thick) of archival tumor sample must&#xD;
        be available at the time of enrollment. Subjects under 18 years old without adequate&#xD;
        archival tissue available may opt to undergo pre-treatment biopsy if it can be performed&#xD;
        with minimal morbidity. In the event that a subject under 18 cannot safely undergo biopsy&#xD;
        and does not have adequate archival tissue available, enrollment will be at the discretion&#xD;
        of the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        NOTE: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of PEN-866&#xD;
        in subjects &lt;18 years of age, children &lt;12 years of age are excluded from this study but&#xD;
        will be eligible for future pediatric trials. Since the study population of interest is&#xD;
        relapsed or refractory sarcomas which is typically seen in adolescents and young adults,&#xD;
        and per FDA recommendations for enrolling adolescents in disease/target-appropriate adult&#xD;

&#xD;
        The Cockcroft-Gault equation should be used for calculation of creatinine clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) &lt;= 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) for&#xD;
             age&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  SGOT (AST) &lt;= 150 U/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with Gilbert s syndrome are excluded from the requirement of a normal bilirubin&#xD;
        unless they are found to have the UGT1A1 28/28 genotype. Gilbert s syndrome is found in&#xD;
        3-10% of the general population, and is characterized by mild, chronic unconjugated&#xD;
        hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or overt hemolysis. NOTE: Adult values&#xD;
        will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and determining eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiac Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Shortening fraction of &gt;=27% or ejection fraction of &gt;= 50% by echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc interval &lt; 470 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with toxicities from prior therapies must have resolution of these&#xD;
                  toxicities to &lt;= Grade 1, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy and&#xD;
                  alopecia which must resolve to &lt;=Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with treated brain metastases (CNS as primary tumor not eligible) are&#xD;
                  eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed&#xD;
                  therapy shows no evidence of progression. Subjects must be asymptomatic from&#xD;
                  their brain metastasis and not require corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to start&#xD;
                  of therapy (C1D1). Subjects with remote history of spinal cord compression are&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
                  leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
                  immediate t is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle&#xD;
                  of therapy. Subjects must be asymptomatic or have disease controlled with surgery&#xD;
                  and radiation and should not require steroids within 4 weeks prior to start of&#xD;
                  therapy (C1D1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects on effective&#xD;
                  anti- retroviral therapy with no detectable viral load on any tests within the&#xD;
                  last 6 months are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load&#xD;
                  must be undetectable on suppressive therapy within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
                  treated and cured. For subjects with HCV infection who are currently on&#xD;
                  treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load within&#xD;
                  the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If 18 years old or older, must be willing to undergo tumor biopsy before&#xD;
                  treatment and have available archival tissue. If biopsy is contraindicated,&#xD;
                  enrollment must be approved by the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects ages 12-17 years old without archival tissue available may opt to&#xD;
                  undergo pre- treatment biopsy if it can be performed with minimal morbidity. In&#xD;
                  the event that a subject 12-17 cannot safely undergo biopsy and does not have&#xD;
                  adequate archival tissue available, enrollment will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women of childbearing potential (WCBP): negative serum Beta human chorionic&#xD;
                  gonadotropin (Beta hCG) pregnancy test during screening. A negative pregnancy&#xD;
                  test is also required within 8 days before first treatment; screening results may&#xD;
                  be used for treatment if they fall within the required window.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male and female subjects of reproductive of reproductive potential must agree to&#xD;
                  use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
                  abstinence) from the time of consent, for the duration of therapy, and for 6&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

             other agents used in study (vincristine and temozolomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have previously discontinued vincristine, temozolomide, or irinotecan due&#xD;
             to severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of grade 4 vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy of&#xD;
             constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require medication with any of the inhibitors of UGT1A1, substrates of&#xD;
             CYP1A2 or substrates of the P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1 transporters, or any&#xD;
             prohibited medications. Subjects discontinuing these drugs must undergo a washout of&#xD;
             2-weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known bone marrow metastatic disease causing decreased blood counts&#xD;
             below the hematologic parameters are excluded from the phase 1 component due to the in&#xD;
             ability to be evaluable for hematologic toxicity, however they are eligible for phase&#xD;
             2, with transfusion support.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina within 6 months prior to start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  New York Heart Association Class III - IV heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of&#xD;
                  resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congenital long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension despite use of antihypertensives for management of&#xD;
                  hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  As judged by the investigator, evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any medical, psychological, or social condition that would interfere with the&#xD;
                  subject s participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other uncontrolled intercurrent systemic illness that would limit compliance&#xD;
                  with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of PEN-866 on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown, and vincristine and temozolomide are cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents which are known to be teratogenic. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with PEN866, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             PEN866. These risks also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to start of therapy (C1D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  UGT1A1 Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects identified with a UGT1A1 28/28 genotype will be excluded from the phase 1&#xD;
        component of the study. In phase 2, they may receive PEN-866 with altered dosing- see&#xD;
        Section. Subjects who are known to not be homozygous for UGT1A128/28 genotype (i.e., 1/1 or&#xD;
        1/28) may receive the enrolling cohort dose level of PEN-866 on C1D1 during phase 1 and the&#xD;
        RP2D of PEN-866 during phase 2.&#xD;
