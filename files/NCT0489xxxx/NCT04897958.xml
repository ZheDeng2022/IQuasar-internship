    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        Subjects were selected on the basis of having at least one diagnosis code indicating&#xD;
        prostate cancer, male sex, and a history of artherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
        contrast to the the PRONOUNCE RCT trial, patients cannot be required to have had&#xD;
        established tumor staging information, angiography-verified stenosis/occlusion of vessels,&#xD;
        and a lack of planned cardiac surgery at the time of treatment initiation due to poor&#xD;
        capture of this information administrative data. All patients were required to have&#xD;
        continuous enrollment for 365 days prior to cohort entry to ensure incident use of the&#xD;
        study drugs.&#xD;
