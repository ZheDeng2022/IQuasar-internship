  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, effective clinical intervention methods for anxiety mainly include anti-anxiety&#xD;
      drug treatment, psychotherapy and acupuncture-related treatment. Most of the anti-anxiety&#xD;
      drugs are benzodiazepines, which have a very direct sedative effect, but frequent use is&#xD;
      prone to drug dependence, excessive sedation and other shortcomings. Psychotherapy is&#xD;
      expensive and not well accepted by the general public. Acupuncture-related treatments are&#xD;
      adopted by more and more doctors and patients due to its advantages of small adverse&#xD;
      reactions and low costs. Acupuncture has the effects of relieving anxiety and reducing pain,&#xD;
      and can play a great role in the perioperative period. Systematic reviews have found that&#xD;
      acupuncture has a significant effect on anxiety, and it is better than the drug control&#xD;
      group. At the same time, the acupuncture effect can also relieve postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and prevent postoperative discomfort. However, although acupuncture is used to&#xD;
      relieve anxiety in neurology and neurosurgery, onychomycosis, gynecology and other clinical&#xD;
      departments and has drawn considerable conclusions, acupuncture intervention relieves anxiety&#xD;
      during the perioperative period of thoracic surgery. There is still a lack of systematic&#xD;
      research on the efficacy evaluation. Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoints Point Stimulation&#xD;
      (TEAS) technology originated from traditional Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion. It is a&#xD;
      type of peripheral stimulation that delivers low-frequency pulse currents to the human body&#xD;
      through the skin to achieve a therapeutic effect. In contrast, TEAS has the advantages of&#xD;
      being non-invasive, easy to repeat, safe, and low in cost, and is easy to be accepted by&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, replacing the traditional acupuncture technology with TEAS technology&#xD;
      has a more unique advantage in clinical application. As chest CT examinations become more&#xD;
      common, the detection rate of early lung cancer has gradually increased in recent years. As&#xD;
      the mainstream treatment of thoracic surgery, thoracoscopic surgery is widely used&#xD;
      clinically. Therefore, how to make the majority of patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery&#xD;
      have a better diagnosis and treatment experience is an urgent clinical problem.&#xD;

      At present, video-assisted thoracoscopy is the most commonly used surgical method in thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. Compared with traditional open thoracic surgery, this minimally invasive technique&#xD;
      has the advantages of small surgical mouth, less bleeding, and quick recovery. Both have&#xD;
      greatly benefited. However, after being admitted to the hospital for surgical treatment due&#xD;
      to illness, the change of identity and environment makes the patient inevitably anxious, and&#xD;
      affects the patient's psychology and physiology throughout the perioperative period.&#xD;
      Therefore, perioperative anxiety is a common phenomenon in patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
      treatment, and the incidence is about 11%-80%. As far as thoracic surgery patients are&#xD;
      concerned, before surgery, patients are mainly worried about the risks of surgery, anesthesia&#xD;
      accidents and the quality of life in the future, and after surgery, they will worry about&#xD;
      their own recovery and follow-up treatment. This kind of uneasy feeling can cause bad mental&#xD;
      state and produce different degrees of negative emotions. On the one hand, it may lack a&#xD;
      positive attitude towards postoperative treatment. On the other hand, patients are prone to&#xD;
      expand normal postoperative discomfort such as wound pain. Additional use Analgesic drugs. At&#xD;
      the same time, the anxiety reaction itself can affect the body's physiological and&#xD;
      psychological functions through the central nervous system, endocrine, and immune system,&#xD;
      leading to insomnia, acute delirium, arrhythmia and other adverse events, and aggravating&#xD;
      postoperative complications, directly affecting the prognosis and prognosis of patients.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation not only harms the patient's body and mind, but also increases the extra&#xD;
      hospitalization costs due to the prolonged treatment time. Studies have also shown that&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety will increase the amount of intraoperative anesthetic drugs, delay the&#xD;
      recovery after anesthesia, and directly aggravate the side effects of anesthetics. Therefore,&#xD;
      perioperative anxiety has received extensive clinical attention.&#xD;
