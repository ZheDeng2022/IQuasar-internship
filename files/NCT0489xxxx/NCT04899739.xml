  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest oncological pathologies. The only&#xD;
      effective curative tool is the surgery. Before the intervention, an endoscopic ultrasound is&#xD;
      performed on the patient to carry out the biopsy of the main tumor. In this study, the&#xD;
      echoendoscopie will be extended to lymph node staging away from the surgical field in order&#xD;
      to implement a simple classification of lymph nodes, based on non-invasive ultrasound&#xD;
      criteria. This would facilitate the location and qualification of peripancreatic lymph nodes&#xD;
      and distant from the tumor, and therefore the staging of the tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nowadays pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest oncological pathologies today. Even after&#xD;
      curative surgery, considered the only effective curative tool, 5-years survival does not&#xD;
      exceed 5%. Before surgery, an endoscopic ultrasound is performed on the patient to carry out&#xD;
      the biopsy of the main tumor. However, the evaluation being devoted to the pancreas, this&#xD;
      study wishes to extend echoendoscopie to lymph node staging away from the surgical field. The&#xD;
      proposed study is based on the hypothesis that the implementation of a simple classification&#xD;
      of lymph nodes, based on non-invasive ultrasound criteria, would facilitate the location and&#xD;
      qualification of peripancreatic lymph nodes and distant from the tumor, and therefore the&#xD;
      staging of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the video data obtained will be collected in a computer database in order&#xD;
      to create an artificial intelligence lesion detection and qualification tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to recruit 45 adult patients, male or female, with a solid or cystic&#xD;
      pancreatic tumor and for whom a surgical resection (first line and after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment) is planned. The main objective is to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a&#xD;
      simple classification &quot;benign / malignant&quot; of the nodes, established by the endoscopist using&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound criteria's, compared to the gold standard (anatomopathology).&#xD;
