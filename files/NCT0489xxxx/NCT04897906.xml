      This research will be carried out in a quasi-experimental design to determine the effect of&#xD;
      maternity care and neonatal care training given to primiparous pregnant women on parental&#xD;
      self-efficacy and mother-infant attachment in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: There is no difference in parental self-efficacy and mother-infant attachment in the&#xD;
      postpartum period between pregnant women who received training during pregnancy and did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a difference in parental self-efficacy and mother-infant attachment in the&#xD;
      postpartum period between pregnant women who received and did not receive education during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      The number of people to be included in the study was made with the power analysis made&#xD;
      considering the previous studies. With the G * Power (3.1.9.7.) Program, the number of&#xD;
      samples for each group was determined as n = 34 at 80% power, 5% error and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval. Considering the losses in data collection, 20% was added to each group and it was&#xD;
      decided to recruit a total of 80 people, 40 people for the experimental group and 40 people&#xD;
      for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women included in the research sample will be divided into two groups as&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. Data will be collected by sending via an online&#xD;
      questionnaire created by the researchers. Before the online questionnaire is sent to the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups, the experimental-control days will be determined randomly by&#xD;
      a lottery drawn by a third person (blinding). Pregnant women who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the determined&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained in the study will be analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences) for Windows 22.0 program. Significance value will be considered as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number, percentage, mean and standard deviation will be used as descriptive statistical&#xD;
      methods in the evaluation of data. Pearson correlation and regression analysis will be&#xD;
      applied among the continuous variables of the study. The t-test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      quantitative continuous data between two independent groups, and the One-way Anova test will&#xD;
      be used to compare the quantitative continuous data between more than two independent groups.&#xD;
      After the Anova test, the Scheffe test will be used as a complementary post-hoc analysis to&#xD;
      determine the differences.&#xD;
