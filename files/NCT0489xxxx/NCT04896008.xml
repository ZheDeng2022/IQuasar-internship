      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of sotatercept treatment (plus maximum&#xD;
      tolerated background PAH therapy) versus placebo (plus maximum tolerated background PAH&#xD;
      therapy) on time to first event of all cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH&#xD;
      worsening-related hospitalization of ≥ 24 hours, in participants with WHO FC III or FC IV PAH&#xD;

      Study A011-14 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      sotatercept when added to maximum tolerated background PAH therapy on time to first event of&#xD;
      all-cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH worsening related hospitalization of ≥ 24&#xD;
      hours, in participants with WHO FC IV PAH or WHO FC III PAH at high risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with symptomatic PAH (WHO FC III or FC IV at high risk of mortality) who present&#xD;
      with idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), drug-&#xD;
      or toxin-induced, post-shunt correction PAH, or PAH presenting at least 1 year following the&#xD;
      correction of congenital heart defect. Participants must have a Registry to Evaluate Early&#xD;
      and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) Lite 2 risk score of ≥ 10 and be on maximum&#xD;
      tolerated combination background PAH therapy.&#xD;
