  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is evaluating the anti-tumor activity and side effects of panobinostat in treating&#xD;
      patients with osteosarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor/atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor&#xD;
      (MRT/ATRT), and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase II, multi-centre study evaluating the anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      continuous, low dose of panobinostat in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors&#xD;
      stratified by primary histology into osteosarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor/atypical teratoid&#xD;
      rhabdoid tumor (MRT/ATRT), and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified at study entry by tumor type into three strata: osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      MRT/ATRT and neuroblastoma [osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma arms are closed to enrolment].&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled onto the study following completion of their conventional therapy&#xD;
      including chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment and completion of a three-week wash out&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat will then be administered as a continuous oral dose (starting at a de-escalated&#xD;
      dose of 8mg/m2 per day), for up to 12 courses, a total of 48 weeks. The minimum dose is&#xD;
      2mg/m2 per day. Dosing will follow a dose de-escalation or escalation scheme for each stratum&#xD;
      which will be determined by biological effect of the drug (measured in patient peripheral&#xD;
      blood samples) and levels of toxicity (measured by dose limiting toxicity and adverse events&#xD;
      observed). Dose levels for subsequent enrolments in each strata will be based on the&#xD;
      de-escalated or escalated dose in each cohort. The final dose per strata will be that which&#xD;
      achieves significant biological effect with acceptable toxicity that is maintained for a 4&#xD;
      week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients or their parents/guardians will be required to maintain a drug diary to monitor drug&#xD;
      usage throughout the trial. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years from completion of&#xD;
      study therapy.&#xD;
