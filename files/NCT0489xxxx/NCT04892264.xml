    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and effect of belantamab mafodotin given together&#xD;
      with lenalidomide and daratumumab in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come&#xD;
      back (relapsed), does not respond to treatment (refractory) or for which the patient has not&#xD;
      received treatment in the past (previously untreated). Belantamab mafodotin is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, called belantamab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called mafodotin. Belantamab is a&#xD;
      form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface&#xD;
      of cancer cells, known as BCMA receptors, and delivers mafodotin to kill them. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      is an immunomodulatory drug (altering the immune effects on the tumor cell). Daratumumab is a&#xD;
      drug that is a monoclonal antibody that is directed towards a protein on the myeloma cell.&#xD;
      Giving belantamab mafodotin together with lenalidomide and daratumumab may kill more cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of belantamab mafodotin, followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive belantamab mafodotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and daratumumab IV over 90 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Treatment with belantamab mafodotin repeats every 56 days for up to 12 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with lenalidomide and&#xD;
      daratumumab repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Beginning cycle 13, patients receive belantamab mafodotin IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 of odd number cycles, lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21, and daratumumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment with belantamab mafodotin repeats every 56 days, and every 28&#xD;
      days for lenalidomide and daratumumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Treatment with belantamab mafodotin repeats every 56 days (every other cycle) for&#xD;
      up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment&#xD;
      with lenalidomide and daratumumab repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;

      cycles, lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21, and daratumumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
      and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1 of subsequent cycles.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

      receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to&#xD;
      12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Beginning cycle 13, patients receive belantamab mafodotin IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 of even numbered cycles, lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21, and daratumumab IV over 90&#xD;
