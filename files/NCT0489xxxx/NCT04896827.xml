  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain (CP) is disabling for people triggering important costs for society. A deficit&#xD;
      of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) is one of the CP mechanisms. DNICs are&#xD;
      evaluated in research setting using a CPM protocol (conditioned pain modulation). There is a&#xD;
      lack of reference values on the effectiveness of DNICs. Wider research on DNIC will help to&#xD;
      understand CP and to develop a clinical screening test evaluating DNICs. This study aims more&#xD;
      specifically to determine whether it is possible to develop a facial recognition system to&#xD;
      automate pain measurement and the effectiveness of pain control mechanisms.&#xD;

      This study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and validate a predictive tool (using deep learning and artificial&#xD;
           intelligence) to estimate the efficacy of pain control mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate references values for facial expressions of pain control mechanisms in&#xD;
           healthy and in chronic pain participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population will be healthy volunteers and volunteers with chronic pain, male and&#xD;
      female, stratified by age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference values (healthy volunteers) will be established via a non-parametric method for&#xD;
      a standard conditioned pain modulation (CPM) protocol in which two &quot;stimuli tests&quot; of the&#xD;
      same intensity and nature (heat) will be applied before and after the application of another&#xD;
      &quot;conditioning stimulus&quot; (cold water bath). The perceived pain difference between the 1st and&#xD;
      2nd stimuli tests will reflect the intensity of the DNICs. Participants' facial expressions&#xD;
      will be captured simultaneously by three cameras during the CPM testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be compared to those from volunteers suffering with chronic pain. The&#xD;
      clinical decision rule will result from clinical and paraclinical elements correlating with&#xD;
      the amplitude of the efficacy of CPM (serum noradrenaline, intensity of pain, heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements, psychometric questionnaires assessing anxiety, depressive&#xD;
      feelings and pain catastrophizing). Logistic regression analysis will determine the best&#xD;
      predictors of a CPM deficit.&#xD;
