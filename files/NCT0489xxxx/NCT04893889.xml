  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Heart failure with preserved systolic function encompasses several different&#xD;
      diseases, but which have diastolic dysfunction and its components in common: myocardial&#xD;
      stiffness and altered relaxation. Myocardial stiffness represents an important parameter for&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis, but only changes in relaxation are evaluated in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Cardiac elastography has been proposed as a diagnostic modality for noninvasive assessment of&#xD;
      myocardial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of our study is to investigate the potential of myocardial elastography by&#xD;
      shear waves to assess myocardial stiffness by non-invasively quantifying diastolic myocardial&#xD;
      elasticity (EMD) in Fabry disease (DF) and cardiac amyloidosis (AC ) in the ATTRh form and&#xD;
      correlate with other complementary imaging and laboratory tests (electrocardiogram, 2D&#xD;
      echocardiogram, troponin and BNP) and with a 6-minute walk test and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: 60 adults will be prospectively included: 20 patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease, 40 patients with hRTRT (20 with cardiac involvement) and 20 patients as a control&#xD;
      group. Echocardiography, electrocardiogram and laboratory evaluations will be performed. The&#xD;
      elastocardiographic assessment of myocardial stiffness will be performed in ultrasound&#xD;
      equipment (Canon, Aplio i800) using a multifrequency convex transducer, under specific&#xD;
      adjustment of the equipment to perform myocardial elastography.&#xD;
