  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of progressive resistance training compared with&#xD;
      aerobic training, among those with hemophilia. Participants will be divided into two groups.&#xD;
      The control group will receive an aerobic exercise protocol, and the resistance group will&#xD;
      follow a resistance training program. Each group will receive a total of eight sessions.&#xD;
      Target muscles are deltoids, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective and objective assessment will be performed for each group, to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of each intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant's height, weight and age will be recorded for pre-test anthropometric data.&#xD;
      Height will be measured using a stadiometer, and weight will be measured with an electronic&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sessions will be conducted twice a week, for 8 weeks. The control group will be&#xD;
      administered a standard physical therapy intervention program which will consist of active&#xD;
      muscle stretching and aerobic exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexion, extension and abduction at the shoulder joint for anterior, middle and&#xD;
           posterior fibers of deltoid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexion and extension at the elbow for biceps and triceps trachii&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexion and extension at the knee joint for quadriceps and hamstring muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plantar flexion at the ankle joint for gastrocnemius and soleus Three sets of ten&#xD;
           repetitions of each exercise will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will undergo a progressive resistance training program consisting of&#xD;
      active muscle stretching and resistance training. Exercise for intervention group will&#xD;
      consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resisted flexion, extension and abduction at the shoulder joint for anterior, middle and&#xD;
           posterior deltoid, using dumbbells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resisted flexion and extension at the elbow for biceps and triceps trachii, using&#xD;
           dumbbells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resisted flexion and extension of knee joint for quadriceps and hamstring muscles, using&#xD;
           therabands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resisted dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of gastrocnemius and soleus, using therabands&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance will be increased on basis of progressive overload principle. Three sets of ten&#xD;
      repetitions will be performed per muscle group. Initial weight of the dumbbells will be 1kg&#xD;
      and will be increased by 0.5kg per week. Therabands used will be Yellow, Red, Green and Blue.&#xD;
      Resistance for therabands will be upgraded every two weeks. Treatment time per group will be&#xD;
      approximately 40 minutes. Exercises will be progressed in a gradual manner to give&#xD;
      participants time to build muscle strength.&#xD;

    <measure>Manual Muscle Testing - Daniel &amp; Worthingham's</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post intervention (week 8 - the analysis will be conducted on the first week immediately after the end of the training)</time_frame>
    <description>An objective marker to determine muscle strength. It ranges from 0-5&#xD;
0 no movement of muscle&#xD;
flickering movement of muscle&#xD;
full range of motion in a gravity minimized position&#xD;
full range of motion against gravity, without resistance&#xD;

    <measure>Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS v2.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post intervention (week 8 - the analysis will be conducted on the first week immediately after the end of the training)</time_frame>
    <description>The HJHS measures joint health, in the domain of body structure and function (i.e. impairment), of the joints most commonly affected by bleeding in hemophilia: the knees, ankles, and elbows. It can be used when there is a need for orthopedic intervention, or as an outcome measure of physiotherapy interventions.&#xD;
A scoring system is present, which combines the score of these questions, with a global gait score, to give an overall score. The greater the score, the poorer the outcome.&#xD;
The HJHS 2.1 provides a total score (higher score is worse; max=124), joint specific scores, and a global gait score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post intervention (week 8 - the analysis will be conducted on the first week immediately after the end of the training)</time_frame>
    <description>The second subjective marker. This will be used to assess the subjective workload of exercises, and to note if exercise intensity decreases over time.&#xD;
The values range from 6-20, with 6 rated as 'no exertion', and 20 rated as 'maximal exertion'.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HEP-Test-Q (Hemophilia and Exercise Project)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post intervention (week 8 - the analysis will be conducted on the first week immediately after the end of the training)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective marker of this study. This measure will assess the quality of life. It is a scale specifically designed for people with hemophilia.&#xD;
The HEP-Test-Q consists of 25 items pertaining to 4 domains 'mobility', 'strength &amp; coordination', 'endurance' and 'body perception' and one single item, which assesses changes in physical functioning in comparison to the previous year.&#xD;
The recall period for the assessment of physical functioning is over &quot;the past four weeks&quot;.&#xD;
The response options range on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;.&#xD;
Some of the items have to be re-coded. Subscales and the total score are transformed to a scale of 0-100 with high scores indicating better physical functioning.</description>
