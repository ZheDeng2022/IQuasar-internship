  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chios mastic is a natural product with strong antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antioxidant properties, and well-established benefits for dyspeptic disorders. The aim of the&#xD;
      present study is to investigate the effectiveness of a natural aqueous extract of Chios&#xD;
      mastic (mastic water), a by-product of Chios mastic processing, in the management of&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome. This will be a 3-month randomized double-blind controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome under standard medication. Participants&#xD;
      will be blindly randomized to a low-dose mastic group, which will receive a carbonated water&#xD;
      enriched with Chios mastic water (0.06%), a high-dose mastic group, which will receive a&#xD;
      carbonated fruit juice enriched with Chios mastic water (0.55%), or one of the two control&#xD;
      groups, which will receive an identical placebo water/fruit juice with no active ingredients.&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated in terms of anthropometric indices, lifestyle habits, severity&#xD;
      of IBS-related gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, as well as biochemical,&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, both pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chios mastic is the resin of the mastic tree (Pistacia Lentiscus var. Chia), produced&#xD;
      exclusively in the southern part of the Greek island of Chios. References about its medical&#xD;
      use from local populations for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders or as a cosmetic&#xD;
      agent can be found in ancient texts. Nowadays, this versatile resin has been rediscovered,&#xD;
      not only as a traditional remedy and aromatic agent, but as a potent phytotherapeutic product&#xD;
      with strong anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. In 2015, Chios&#xD;
      mastic was recognized as a herbal medicinal product by the European Medicines Agency (EMA),&#xD;
      with two therapeutic indications: mild dyspeptic disorders and skin inflammation/healing of&#xD;
      minor wounds (EMA/HMPC/46758/2015). Over the last years, Chios mastic is widely used in&#xD;
      medicinal products, food supplements and cosmetics and has become the object of intense study&#xD;
      in the fields of Nutrition and Pharmacotechnology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disease characterized&#xD;
      by adverse changes in bowel function (frequency of bowel movements and/or stool composition)&#xD;
      and abdominal pain. The clinical presentation of IBS usually includes symptoms of abdominal&#xD;
      pain, flatulence, bloating, diarrhea and constipation that often alternate, while&#xD;
      postprandial discomfort in the upper abdomen, feeling of fullness, nausea, vomiting and back&#xD;
      pain are less commonly reported. IBS affects approximately 7-16% of the general population,&#xD;
      and leads to reduced functionality and productivity and a significant deterioration in&#xD;
      quality of life due to its various intestinal manifestations. The first-line pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments for IBS aim at alleviating symptoms and include antispasmodics or anticonvulsants&#xD;
      for abdominal pain, antidiarrheal medication and laxatives for constipation. Dietary&#xD;
      modifications, such as the avoidance of foods that aggravate gastrointestinal symptoms and&#xD;
      various types of exclusion diets, are also applied as adjunctive therapies for IBS&#xD;
      management, but evidence of their effectiveness remains scares and inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of foods/beverages enriched with Chios mastic could constitute a promising&#xD;
      complementary approach for the management of IBS, in combination with current first-line&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments. The aim of the present interventional study is to explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a natural aqueous extract of Chios mastic in the management of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 3-month parallel, randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial in a sample of 60 adult patients with IBS. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be adult (18-65 years old) otherwise healthy individuals with an IBS diagnosis based on&#xD;
      ROME IV criteria under stable medication. Participants will be excluded on the basis of the&#xD;
      presence of other chronic gastrointestinal diseases, the presence of other serious&#xD;
      comorbidities, or recent significant changes in lifestyle habits. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to a low-dose mastic group (LDMG), a low-dose control group (LDCC), a high-dose&#xD;
      mastic group (HDMG) or a high-dose control group (HDCC). The LDMG will be provided with 600&#xD;
      mL of a sparkling water (mastiqua) containing the natural mastic aqueous extract (0.06%) to&#xD;
      be consumed daily (3 bottles of 200 mL each). The HDMG will be provided with 600 mL of a&#xD;
      sparkling fruit juice (mastiqua lemon) containing the natural mastic aqueous extract (0.55%)&#xD;
      to be consumed daily (3 bottles of 200 mL each). The LDCC and HDCC will receive the same&#xD;
      quantity of a placebo sparkling water or fruit juice, respectively. For each type of drink&#xD;
      (water and fruit juice), the intervention and placebo drinks will be unlabeled and identical&#xD;
      in appearance and organoleptic characteristics, including the characteristic Chios mastic&#xD;
      aroma. Randomization will be performed by an investigator with no clinical involvement, while&#xD;
      all patients and study team members will be blinded to patient allocation in study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will continue their standard medical treatment which must remain stable&#xD;
      throughout the trial. The study physician will systematically record potential side-effects&#xD;
      and will be in charge of terminating the intervention if needed. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed in terms of anthropometric indices (body weight, height, waist circumference, and&#xD;
      body composition), lifestyle habits (diet and physical activity habits), the presence and&#xD;
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life both pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;
      In addition, blood samples after a 12-hour fast and morning urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      to measure biochemical, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.&#xD;
