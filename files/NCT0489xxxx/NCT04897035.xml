  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>LYMQOL (LYMphedema Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (LYMQOL), a validated disease-specific QoL tool, was also administered at baseline and at month 3. Overall QoL is scored on a single item by the patient on a scale of 1-10. The outcome measure is assessed as a difference or change from baseline LYMQOL at day zero and month 3.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Limb Volume Maintenance or Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Limb volume measurement is performed by using a calibrated tape measure to measure circumference from the ankle and at 4cm increments to the waist region. Measurements are taken for both lower extremities. Volume is calculated based on cylindrical segment analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapy adherence tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Therapy adherence tracked via the mobile app that records usage per day. Outcome measure will be evaluated based on recommended use of 45 minutes per day over the duration of 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) 1-5 and study survey were administered at the end of the study to measure patient satisfaction. The six-item questionnaire was used to document the time of day the device was used, if daily activities were supported during use, function, and symptoms. The VAS was administered to previous users of pneumatic compression devices to assess preference and likelihood to recommend to others with lymphedema.</description>
