  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn injuries can result in long term physical and mental sequelae, not only from the&#xD;
      scarring but also the painful dressings. The standard of care today remains use of antibiotic&#xD;
      topical dressings while awaiting demarcation of the burn depth, with surgical excision and&#xD;
      grafting for deep partial thickness and full thickness areas. Demarcation can be appreciated&#xD;
      on admission for full thickness burns but is often a prolonged process that can last weeks.&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of the depth of the burn is a complex decision that often is made&#xD;
      more challenging by the presence of the proteinaceous pseudoeschar and the coagulated dermis&#xD;
      itself. Surgical debridement is relatively 'coarse' and by its very nature requires removal&#xD;
      of a thin layer of viable tissue to reach the level that is vascularized enough to support a&#xD;
      skin graft. There has been growing interest in the use of adjuncts to reduce the amount&#xD;
      tissue debrided and potentially reduce the need for surgery itself. Operatively, there have&#xD;
      been some reports that use of hydro-dissection devices (Versajet™) may allow a more&#xD;
      controlled debridement, resulting in less viable tissue being sacrificed. There is also a&#xD;
      growing experience with enzymatic debridement, especially with Bromolein, derived from&#xD;
      Pineapple (NexoBrid®). Neither of these have been shown to definitively improve care in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, (RCTs) and there is suggestion that in some settings may&#xD;
      actually cause harm.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A relatively recent entry into the 'space' of non-surgical burn wound debridement is&#xD;
      Plurogel®. Unlike Bromolein, Plurogel® is a concentrated surfactant in the form of a stable,&#xD;
      viscous gel. Each micelle has a hydrophilic outer surface that softens and loosens wound&#xD;
      debris, and a hydrophobic inner core that traps debris. The micelles link to form a matrix&#xD;
      that continually expands and contracts. This creates a cleansing/rinsing action that disrupts&#xD;
      the surface tension holding slough and necrotic tissue in place. PluroGel® helps in creating&#xD;
      a moist wound healing environment, which softens, loosens and drives slough and necrotic&#xD;
      debris away from the wound bed, promoting autolytic debridement. PluroGel® is approved for&#xD;
      use in burn injuries in Canada, however there are no randomized control trials (RCTs) to&#xD;
      support its use. As Plurogel® appears to fill a much-needed niche in burn wound care, and as&#xD;
      our centre seeks to be innovative in patient care, we trialed Plurogel® on some of our&#xD;
      appropriately consented burn patients. The anecdotal experience is that the eschar lifted&#xD;
      within about a week and there was visible wound healing. Healing time appeared to be reduced&#xD;
      as the product would gently debride while still providing a moist wound bed encouraging wound&#xD;
      healing. Team members began to value the new product. This early positive experience is the&#xD;
      impetus for us to embark on a pilot RCT to provide evidence for us to continue to use this&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
