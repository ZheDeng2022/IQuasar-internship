  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pragmatic trial will generate knowledge about strategies used to de-escalate&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy in patients with juvenile spondyloarthritis&#xD;
      with sustained inactive disease and are treated at one of the 21 participating pediatric&#xD;
      healthcare systems. This open label study will be conducted in the setting of routine&#xD;
      clinical care and will compare the risk and timing of flare (Aim 1) and patients' lived&#xD;
      experiences (Aim 2) across three arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is a prospective, 12-month pragmatic randomized trial embedded within routine&#xD;
      clinical care. Children with spondyloarthritis who have maintained inactive disease on a&#xD;
      clinically prescribed standard dosing of a TNFi for 6 months or longer will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment. Children will be randomized to one of the following alternative approaches:&#xD;
      continued fixed standard dosing (arm 1), fixed longer dosing intervals of TNFi (arm 2), or&#xD;
      stopping TNFi (arm 3). The recommended visit frequency is every 3 months through the study&#xD;
      endpoint at 12 months. After subjects have followed their treatment assignment for 12 months,&#xD;
      those who have not flared may modify their treatment regimen as per shared decision making&#xD;
      between themselves and the treating physician. All participants will be monitored for 24&#xD;
      additional months for long-term outcomes after the intervention period.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to juvenile spondyloarthritis (JSpA) flare</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>JSpA flare is defined as clinically meaningful worsening in ≥3 of the following: caregiver/patient assessment of well-being, physician assessment of disease activity, caregiver/patient assessment of pain, physical function, and active joint count. Meaningful change for well-being, disease activity, and pain are an increase of ≥2 on visual analogue scale (range 0-10 with higher scores indicating poorer well-being, higher disease activity, and higher magnitude of pain). Meaningful change in function is defined as ≥3 unit change in the PROMIS mobility or upper extremity T-scores. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short forms include 8 questions and a T-score of '50' represents the healthy population mean score with standard deviation of 10. Active joint count is defined as the number of joints with swelling or, in the absence of swelling, limitation of motion accompanied by pain or warmth as per the physician examination.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference (as measured by the PROMIS short form) of children with spondyloarthritis in the three treatment arms. The PROMIS short form is a validated questionnaire that measures the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life.The PROMIS short form includes 8 questions and a T-score of '50' represents the healthy population mean score with standard deviation equal to 10.</description>
