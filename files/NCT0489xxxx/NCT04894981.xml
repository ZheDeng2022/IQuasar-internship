  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of the choice of visual feedback solution (immersive via&#xD;
      CAVE and VR headset; non-immersive via screen only) on driving performance and quality of&#xD;
      experience on a physical driving simulator and its acceptability to wheelchair drivers with&#xD;
      neurological disorders.&#xD;

      The device under investigation is an electric wheelchair driving simulation solution driving&#xD;
      simulation solution for electric wheelchairs, based on a physical physical simulation device&#xD;
      that integrates software allowing virtual virtual immersion. This device will be coupled with&#xD;
      three visual simulation solutions: a virtual reality helmet, a CAVE (virtual reality room&#xD;
      where video virtual reality room where video projectors display content on four sides) and a&#xD;
      non-immersive projection (screen only, non-immersive virtual reality solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device is intended to allow patients who may acquire a power wheelchair to train in a&#xD;
      virtual environment, which is conducive to the safety of the training, its repetition, and to&#xD;
      produce more varied training environments, richer and more adapted to specific and&#xD;
      individualised needs. These solutions could facilitate access to real driving for patients&#xD;
      who are currently experiencing learning difficulties.&#xD;

    <description>The cognitive load of tests under each conditions will be measured by the NASA-Task Load Index. It is in the form of six scales where the participant must assign a score between zero and one hundred to each of them, score indicating a growing level of intensity. Three dimensions relate to the demands imposed on the subject (mental, physical and temporal demands) and three to the interaction of a subject with the task (effort, frustration and performance)</description>
