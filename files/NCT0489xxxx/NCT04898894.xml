      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the best dose of venetoclax and&#xD;
      selinexor when given with chemotherapy drugs in treating pediatric and young adult patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) that has come&#xD;
      back (relapsed) or did not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of selinexor and venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
           chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML or ALAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the rates of complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete&#xD;
           count recovery (CRi) for patients treated with selinexor and venetoclax in combination&#xD;
           with chemotherapy at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the overall survival of patients treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore associations between leukemia cell genomics, BCL2 family member protein&#xD;
           quantification, BH3 profiling, and response to therapy as assessed by minimal residual&#xD;
           disease (MRD) and variant clearance using cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the quality of life of pediatric patients undergoing treatment with selinexor&#xD;
           and venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy and explore associations of clinical&#xD;
           factors with patient-reported quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of selinexor when administered in combination with&#xD;
           venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the clinical and genetic features associated with exceptional response to the&#xD;
           combination of venetoclax and selinexor without the addition of chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include two phases. The dose-escalation phase will characterize the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax&#xD;
      plus selinexor with and without chemotherapy. Two expansion cohorts (cohort A, patients&#xD;
      without prior exposure to venetoclax; cohort B, patients with prior exposure to venetoclax)&#xD;
      will further assess the safety and will explore the efficacy at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing of venetoclax and selinexor will be based on tolerability. Venetoclax will be given&#xD;
      orally (po) once daily on days 1 through 21 and selinexor will be given orally (po) starting&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, and 15 OR 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17. Beginning on day 16, patients also receive&#xD;
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) daily on days 16-20, cytarabine IV daily on days&#xD;
      16-20, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days&#xD;
      16-20. G-CSF may be omitted or extended at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
      Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy will be given prior to cycle 1, but may be delayed if&#xD;
      clinically indicated. IT cytarabine, IT methotrexate, and IT&#xD;
      methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine (MHA) are all acceptable. Patients without evidence of&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) leukemia will receive no further IT therapy during cycle 1.&#xD;
      Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly IT therapy beginning on day 8, until the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is scheduled to begin on Day 16; however, patients with exceptional responses&#xD;
      may, at the discretion of the treating physician, receive chemotherapy (fludarabine and&#xD;
      cytarabine) on days 16-20 and continue venetoclax through day 21 and selinexor through day 15&#xD;
      or 17 according to dose level. Alternatively, exceptional responders may continue venetoclax&#xD;
      through day 28 and selinexor once or twice weekly according to dose level without&#xD;
      chemotherapy and then undergo re-evaluation at day 29. For patients who do not receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy on day 16-20, chemotherapy may be omitted completely or may be given on days&#xD;
      30-34 at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive up to 4 cycles of therapy in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

               -  Patients with late first relapses, defined as the re-appearance of leukemia after&#xD;
                  the achievement of remission and greater than one year of diagnosis, may be&#xD;
                  enrolled in the dose expansion portion of the study after safety data from the&#xD;
                  dose escalation portion is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow as assessed by morphology or flow&#xD;
        cytometry. However, if flow cytometry cannot be performed or if an adequate bone marrow&#xD;
        sample cannot be obtained (e.g., in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with&#xD;
        marrow fibrosis), patients may be enrolled if there is unequivocal evidence of leukemia&#xD;
        with ≥ 5% blasts in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, patients in all categories must not be eligible to undergo curative therapy,&#xD;
        such as immediate HCT, because of disease burden, time to identify a stem cell donor, or&#xD;
        other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function defined as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;

             Research Hospital must be ≤ 24 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status: Lansky ≥ 50 for patients who are ≤ 16 years old and Karnofsky ≥&#xD;
             50% for patients who are &gt; 16 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of myelosuppressive therapy or&#xD;
             hypomethylating agents and the first doses of venetoclax and selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 24 hours must have elapsed since the completion of low-dose or non-&#xD;
             myelosuppressive therapy, such as hydroxyurea or low-dose cytarabine (up to 100&#xD;
             mg/m^2/day), or leukapheresis, and the first doses of venetoclax and selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who have received prior HCT, there can be no evidence of GVHD and greater&#xD;
             than 60 days must have elapsed since the HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of any calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
             (e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, within 3&#xD;
             days of the first dose of venetoclax or during the administration of venetoclax.&#xD;
             During the dose-escalation portion of the trial, we discourage the use of strong CYP3A&#xD;
             inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) within 3&#xD;
             days of the first dose of venetoclax or during the administration of venetoclax.&#xD;
             However, if an azole is required for the treatment or prevention of fungal infection&#xD;
             during any phase of the trial, venetoclax dosing will be reduced to 60 mg/m^2 (100 mg&#xD;
             max) in patients who require treatment with voriconazole and reduced to 40 mg/m^2 (70&#xD;
             mg max) in patients who require posaconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Male or female of reproductive potential must&#xD;
             agree to use effective contraception for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Down syndrome, acute promyelocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic&#xD;
             leukemia, or bone marrow failure syndromes are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection. Patients with infections that are controlled on concurrent&#xD;
             anti-microbial agents are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impairment of GI function or GI disease that, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             physician, may significantly alter the absorption of venetoclax or selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cerebellar toxicity or cerebellar neurological findings on exam.&#xD;
