  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study of tucatinib in combination with either vinorelbine or&#xD;
      gemcitabine and trastuzumab in patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This phase I/II study will assess the recommended dosing of tucatinib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab and either vinorelbine or gemcitabine in patients with advanced, HER2+ breast&#xD;
      cancer. The study will be conducted as a parallel cohort study looking at optimal dose and&#xD;
      safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Gemcitabine + Tucatinib + Trastuzumab: Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously on Days 1 and 8. The investigational study drug (tucatinib) will be&#xD;
      administered as 300mg by mouth taken twice a day of every day in each cycle. Trastuzumab will&#xD;
      be administered per package insert on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Vinorelbine + Tucatinib + Trastuzumab: Vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. The investigational study drug (tucatinib) will&#xD;
      be administered as 300mg by mouth twice a day of every day in each cycle. Trastuzumab will be&#xD;
      administered per package insert on Day 1 of each 2 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Cycle length is 21 days.&#xD;
