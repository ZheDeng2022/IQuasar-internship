      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a devastating pandemic. By early February 2021, more&#xD;
      than 102 million people were infected globally with more than 2.2 million reported deaths.&#xD;
      Current treatments are approved for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 only. No&#xD;
      treatment is approved to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 in the early stages of&#xD;
      disease. Previous studies have indicated that amantadine is effective against severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome corona virus 1 (SARS-CoV-1). Trials are needed to determine if this&#xD;
      translates to a beneficial effect in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesize that preemptive&#xD;
      therapy with amantadine of non-hospitalized high-risk adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      disease will prevent disease progression and hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center study with two&#xD;
      treatment arms; oral amantadine or placebo. Individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      and one of following; i) age ≥ 40 years or ii) ≥ 18 years of age with at least one&#xD;
      comorbidity or iii) ≥ 18 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) above 30 will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. We plan to enroll 121 persons in each arm, with a total of 242 participants.&#xD;
      Follow up period is 90 days. The primary outcome is disease severity on day 14 assessed by&#xD;
      the 8-point COVID outcome scale proposed by the world health organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals by the Ethics Committee and National Competent Authorities will be obtained prior&#xD;
      to study initiation. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and&#xD;
      presented at international conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will contribute with important knowledge on the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of oral amantadine in the treatment of non-hospitalized high-risk individuals with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused more than 2.2 million deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most infected cases present with mild respiratory symptoms and fever, and spontaneously&#xD;
      recover within two weeks. However, for approximately 20% of the cases, the disease will&#xD;
      progress to pneumonia and in the most severe cases respiratory failure, multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, and death. Individuals aged ≥ 50 years of age and adults with known comorbidity&#xD;
      or obesity are at particular risk of a severe course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the past year treatments have proven to be beneficial for severe COVID-19 in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. However, no treatment has been proven to inhibit progression&#xD;
      from mild to severe COVID-19. Such a treatment could potentially have major impact on&#xD;
      long-term morbidity and mortality especially in areas with limited access to vaccines. The&#xD;
      fastest way of identifying such a treatment may be repurposed drugs. Other benefits of&#xD;
      repurposed drugs include affordable prices and known safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amantadine is a potential treatment candidate that for years has been employed in the clinic&#xD;
      for treatment of influenza virus A infection and for treatment of dyskinesia associated with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a potential repurposing of amantadine for the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus(SARS CoV-2) infection has&#xD;
      been suggested. Two viroporins have been identified in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, Protein E&#xD;
      and Protein 3a, with strong similarities to the viroporins in the deadly coronavirus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-1. The expression of both Protein E and 3a has been shown to promote SARS-CoV-1&#xD;
      replication and virulence, and the deletion of SARS CoV-1 protein E gene attenuates the&#xD;
      virus. Amantadine has previously been shown to bind and inhibit protein E. Knocking down E&#xD;
      protein ion channel activity in SARS CoV-1 decreases edema accumulation, which is the major&#xD;
      determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, levels of&#xD;
      inflammasome-activated interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 were&#xD;
      reduced in the lung airways of the animals infected with viruses lacking E protein ion&#xD;
      channel activity, indicating that E protein ion channel function is required for inflammasome&#xD;
      activation. All these key cytokines promote the progression of lung damage and ARDS&#xD;
      pathology. As such, by potentially blocking protein E ion channel activity, amantadine may&#xD;
      prevent severe progression of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we hypothesize that amantadine can ameliorate&#xD;
      disease progression in persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The aim of the study is to investigate if early preemptive therapy with amantadine&#xD;
      in non-hospitalized high-risk adult individuals with COVID-19 disease can limit disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study comparing amantadine&#xD;
      with placebo 1:1. Follow up is 90 days in total, with close follow up during the first 14&#xD;
      days, and severe adverse events (SAE) monitoring throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-testing will be&#xD;
      identified through lists from laboratories performing the tests and recruited through&#xD;
      invitation letters as well as online advertisement. If they fulfill all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and choose to consent to enrollment after&#xD;
      thorough oral and written information, they will proceed to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Unblinded personnel at the regional pharmacy will perform&#xD;
      randomization into one of two arms (ratio 1:1). The randomization list will be generated&#xD;
      centrally in random blocks. Blinded personnel will not have access to the randomization key.&#xD;
      All investigators, outcome assessors, and study participants will be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency unblinding can be performed if necessary, for the welfare of the study participant.&#xD;
      Efforts should be made to avoid unblinding. If the treatment of a patient has been unblinded,&#xD;
      the treatment course must be discontinued, but the patient will still be subject to follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP Data collection will be a combination of assessments by a&#xD;
      physician, trained medical student or nurse at day 1 and 7 and self-reporting, using online&#xD;
      questionnaires at day 2-6, 14, 28 and 90. Study participants will be followed for a total of&#xD;
      90 days. Moreover, data will be retrieved from medical files and the Danish national patient&#xD;
      registry and the civil registrations system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL Apart from the participant's own withdrawal of written consent, participants will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the study if the investigator finds it necessary due to the participant&#xD;
      safety. Safety reasons comprise any unintended serious adverse event related to the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No participants will be registered as lost to follow up. Protocol violation will be reported&#xD;
      if participants do not receive the full dose of study drug, or fail to answer one or more of&#xD;
      the questionnaires, unless the patient has been admitted to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both active treatments and placebo treatment will be prepared, packaged and labeled by&#xD;
      pharmacists at the pharmacy of the Capital region in Denmark. To assure full blinding for&#xD;
      both participants and investigators all treatment will be covered in non-transparent&#xD;
      identical capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment adherence will be assessed through the daily web-based questionnaires on day 2-6&#xD;
      and by collection of the empty medicine box at assessment on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amantadine Participants randomized to active treatment with amantadine will receive a daily&#xD;
      dose of 200 mg amantadine with 100 mg (1 capsule) two times a day for a total of five days.&#xD;
      Patients with reduced renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 35-60&#xD;
      ml/min)) will receive the same dose on day one, but from day 2-5 a reduced dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      once a day (daily dose 100mg) will be administered. Safety of amantadine is well tested for&#xD;
      treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A at 200 mg a day for up to six weeks. Amantadine has&#xD;
      a half-life of 17 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to receive placebo will receive non-active lactose monohydrate oral&#xD;
      placebo capsules. The number of placebo capsules are equal to the number of amantadine&#xD;
      capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS Amantadine has previously been used in the treatment of Influenza&#xD;
      A and has been shown to reduce Influenza A virus shedding and shorten the duration of&#xD;
      symptoms by about a third, if administered early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current in vitro studies indicate that similar properties may be present against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      An older study has shown an effect of amantadine on coronaviruses and a recent study proposes&#xD;
      that amantadine can be used to mitigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As amantadine could potentially disrupt the lysosomal pathway, decrease the replication of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 as well as virus induced inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, it may&#xD;
      serve as a potent therapeutic leading to better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effects of amantadine include nausea, dizziness (lightheadedness), and&#xD;
      insomnia. Blurry vision and/or impaired mental acuity may occur. Less frequently (1 to 5%)&#xD;
      reported adverse reactions are: Depression, anxiety and irritability, hallucinations,&#xD;
      confusion, anorexia, dry mouth, constipation, ataxia, livedo reticularis, peripheral edema,&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension, headache, somnolence, nervousness, dream abnormality, agitation, dry&#xD;
      nose, diarrhea and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING Oral and written consent, including medical record access, must be given by the&#xD;
      participant at the initial assessment. Once the informed consent is obtained, investigators,&#xD;
      sponsor, representatives of the sponsor and the relevant regulatory authorities will have&#xD;
      direct access to the patient's medical record. Information in the medical record will be&#xD;
      accessed to the extent that it is necessary for the completion of the study, as well as&#xD;
      control including self-monitoring, quality control and monitoring by regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data on day 1, SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on day 7, primary and secondary outcomes;&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, need of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization are retrieved from&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data on participants will be registered and kept in a single electronic case report form&#xD;
      (eCRF) under one study patient identification number (ID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor and investigators are obliged to handle all data on study participants confidentially&#xD;
      in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation [21] and the Data Protection Act.&#xD;
      The primary investigator is responsible for completing eCRFs for all trial participants. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, the primary investigator will extract data from the electronic database&#xD;
      in order to perform the planned analyses on primary and secondary outcomes. Study data will&#xD;
      subsequently be published only in pseudonymous form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The primary endpoint is clinical status on day 14 on an eight point ordinal&#xD;
      scale. The assumed probabilities of being in a certain clinical state on day 14 are shown&#xD;
      below. If we want to detect an odds ratio for a higher ordinal scale score of 0.5 with&#xD;
      placebo as reference group and a simulated power of 80% a target sample size of 121 patients&#xD;
      per arm is needed. Thus, a total sample size of 242 participants is required. Rates of&#xD;
      hospitalization, oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilation, organ support and mortality are&#xD;
      estimated based on epidemiological COVID-19 data reported from the Danish Serum Institute and&#xD;
      descriptive studies from Denmark, California and Iceland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptor Score Probability No limitations to activities. 1 0.526 Limitations to activities.&#xD;
      2 0.354 Hospitalized no oxygen therapy. 3 0.028 Oxygen by mask or nasal prongs. 4 0.048&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen. 5 0.028 Intubation and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      6 0.012 Ventilation + additional organ support, 7 0.004 Extra corporal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
      (ECMO) Death. 8 0.000&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean&#xD;
      with standard deviation and t-tests are applied. Non-normally distributed continuous&#xD;
      variables are presented as median with 25% and 75% quantiles and Mann-Whitney tests are&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data are presented as counts with frequencies. For categorical data we use&#xD;
      chi-square test if cell counts are above 5 and Fisher's exact test or simulation if cells are&#xD;
      below 5. The primary endpoint will be assessed using a proportional odds model adjusting for&#xD;
      age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) and vaccination. The primary analysis will be&#xD;
      intention to treat, however we will also provide a per protocol analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests are done at a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive, inconclusive as well as negative outcomes of the study will be published. The study&#xD;
      will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.clinicaltrialregister.eu prior to&#xD;
      initiation. Additionally, trial results will be up-loaded to EudraCT as soon as possible, and&#xD;
      no later than 1 year after trial completion. Data will subsequently be published at&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrialregister.eu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNDING The initiative for this study was taken by the sponsor, and medical doctors at the&#xD;
      Departments of Infectious Diseases at Hvidovre Hospital. The study is a cooperation between&#xD;
      researchers in the two institutions. The study will be set up and completed by staff at&#xD;
      Departments of Infectious Diseases at Hvidovre Hospital. The sponsor has provided the idea&#xD;
      for the study, background knowledge of the effects of amantadine on SARS-CoV-2 and has&#xD;
      achieved funding from a private fund. The study is funded with 2.000.000 DKK from the private&#xD;
      foundation BioInnovation Institute (BII). Study participants and the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark will be informed, if additional funding has been&#xD;
      granted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor and investigators are independent of economic or competing interests. Participants&#xD;
      will not be financially reimbursed. Results from the study are only for scientific and public&#xD;
      use and have no commercial interest.&#xD;
