    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized study involved 228 individuals with primary inguinal hernia,&#xD;
      operated in our departments, between January 2015 to February 2018. The duration of hospital&#xD;
      stay, operative time, duration of returning to routine activities, postsurgical sequels and&#xD;
      recurrence rates estimated. We randomly allocated it into two groups: mesh repair was applied&#xD;
      to 166 patients (Group 1) and combined both mesh, and darn repair applied to 162 patients&#xD;
      (Group 2).&#xD;

      Background In spite of the era of laparoscopy still, open repair in primary inguinal hernia&#xD;
      is currently the most commonly performed general surgical operation. To evaluate whether the&#xD;
      combined darn repair plus Lichtenstein compare Lichtenstein repair alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      inguinal hernias regarding postoperative complication and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized study involved with 218 patients with primary inguinal hernia,&#xD;
      operated in our departments, between 2015 and 2018. The duration of the operation time,&#xD;
      hospitalization, and time to return to daily activities and postoperative complication and&#xD;
      recurrence rates were evaluated. We randomly allocated into two groups: Lichtenstein repair&#xD;
      was applied to 169 patients (Group 1), and combined both modified darn repair plus&#xD;
      Lichtenstein repair was applied to 160 patients (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average follow-up period was 48 months. For the alone Lichtenstein procedure, the average&#xD;
      duration of operation was 62 min; the average time to return to routine activities was 21&#xD;
      days. The number of patients with postoperative complications was 12 (11.3 %), and the number&#xD;
      of patients with recurrence was 1 (0. 9%). For darn repair plus Lichtenstein procedure, the&#xD;
      average duration of operation was 72 min; the time to return to daily activities was 21days.&#xD;
      The number of patients with postoperative complication was 13 (11.6%), and no recurrences&#xD;
      were noted. The hospitalization time of the groups was similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-year follow-up, combined mesh and darn better than mesh alone in recurrence rate, both&#xD;
      had the same postoperative complication, hospitalization time and return to routine activity.&#xD;
