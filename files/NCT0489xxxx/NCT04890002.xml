      Objectives: To explore the effects of a far-infrared emitting pyjamas on improving sleep in&#xD;
      adults with poor sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Subjects who wear the far-infrared emitting pyjamas (FIR pyjamas) will have&#xD;
      greater improvement in sleep quality than the subjects in sham pyjamas control group&#xD;
      (sham-pyjamas) at 2, 4 and 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: A pilot randomized sham-controlled trial. Subjects with subjective sleep&#xD;
      complaints will be recruited from the community. 40 subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      far-infrared emitting pyjamas and sham-pyjamas groups in a 1: 1 ratio. Study instrument:&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used as an overall evaluation of sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Subjects in the FIR pyjamas group will received pyjamas with far-infrared&#xD;
      emitting features and will wear it every night for 6 weeks; subjects in the sham-pyjamas&#xD;
      group will receive pyjamas in identical appearance without far-infrared emitting features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the PSQI score. Other measures include&#xD;
      insomnia severity index (ISI), sleep parameters derived from 7-day sleep diary, Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Satisfaction With&#xD;
      Life Scale (SWLS) at 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Acceptability of the far-infrared emitting pyjamas&#xD;
      will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Differences in the questionnaire scores, subjective sleep parameters will be&#xD;
      examined using a mixed-effects model. Clinical significance of sleep improvement between two&#xD;
      groups will be compared with chi-squared test.&#xD;

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-reported evaluation of the overall sleep quality. Subjects will be asked to report the sleep parameters of their sleep problem, use of sleep medicine, disturbance, and daytime dysfunction with 0-3 rating. The time frame of PSQI adopted in this study will be changed from &quot;past 1 month&quot; to &quot;past 2 weeks&quot;. The PSQI is a reliable and validated tool widely used in sleep studies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a seven-item self-rating scale. The subjects rate the severity of insomnia, the distress, and the functional impairment associated with insomnia on a 5-point Likert scale. The ISI is a validated instrument which has been commonly used in clinical trials of insomnia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 7-day daily sleep diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized sleep diary records the bedtime and rising time, from which the total time in bed (TIB) can be calculated. Subjects will be asked to estimate sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time (TST). They will also rate their sleep quality on a 4-point scale (very good, fairly good, fairly bad, and very bad).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-administrated questionnaire, which assess the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a self-rated questionnaire assessing the level of daytime sleepiness in eight common daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 5-item Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The score of SWLS is found to predict mental health which has been used for assessing subjective well-being of subjects with health conditions.</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>MFI is a 20-item scale designed to evaluate five dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation, reduced activity, and mental fatigue.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will be provided the Far-infrared emitting pyjamas. The FIR pyjamas was fabricated by using two textile materials, pure cotton fibres and the proposed man-made FIR fibres with the far-infrared emitting function.</description>

    <description>To control the placebo effect in the FIR pyjamas group, participants in this group will receive pyjamas with identical physical appearance which are produced using the same fabrication process as the pyjamas received in FIR pyjamas group. The sham-pyjamas are made of pure cotton fibres and man-made fibres without the far-infrared emitting function. The participants will be asked to wear the sham-pyjamas daily at night for 6 consecutive weeks.</description>
