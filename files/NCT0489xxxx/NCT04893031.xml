  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although its safety and efficacy in the COVID-19 patient population are still unclear,&#xD;
      tocilizumab is one of treatment. Tocilizumab is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor antagonist widely used to treat CRS secondary to the chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      T cell. In this study the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of Tocilizumab, an IL-6&#xD;
      antagonist administered in the early period in intensive care patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia followed by hypoxic and systemic inflammation is predominant, but who do not&#xD;
      support mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      With this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of Tocilizumab, an IL-6&#xD;
      antagonist administered in the early period in intensive care patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia followed by hypoxic and systemic inflammation is predominant, but who do not&#xD;
      support mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, those with signs of hypoxia and systemic inflammation followed by COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia (SpO2 &lt;90% on room air together with the elevation of any two of the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory markers such as CRP, LDH and Ferritin) and / or acute bilateral infiltrates on&#xD;
      chest radiograph and tocilizumab the patients who received treatment and those who received&#xD;
      standard therapy will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, cases followed up with COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure between March&#xD;
      2020 and March 2021 will be retrospectively evaluated. Tocilizumab was applied as 400 mg -&#xD;
      800 mg iv (depending on weight). A second dose could be given 12-24 h later if the patient's&#xD;
      condition had not improved. Primary end point was determined as intensive care mortality.&#xD;
