    <textblock>
      Patients with colorectal livermetasteses and heavy tumour burden and progression on 1st line&#xD;
      chemotherapy have no other available treatment in Norway today other than 2nd line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The Investigators will randomize patients younger than 70 yrs old to&#xD;
      HAI-floxuridine, or liver-Tx, in addition to 2nd line chemotherapy versus 2nd line&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone. Patients 70yrs and older will be randomized to HAI-floxuridine and 2nd&#xD;
      line chemotherapy versus 2nd line chemotherapy alone. Primary endpoint being overall survival&#xD;
      at 2yrs in the different arms.&#xD;

      1.1 Background - Disease Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent malignant&#xD;
      disease in Norway (Cancer in Norway 2017). About 50% of the patients will have metastatic&#xD;
      disease at time of diagnosis or develop metastatic disease later on. Liver metastases are the&#xD;
      most frequent site of metastatic disease. Liver resection is considered the only curative&#xD;
      treatment option in CRC patients with liver metastases, however only about 20% of the&#xD;
      patients are candidates for liver resection. The treatment option for the majority of the&#xD;
      patients is palliative chemotherapy with median overall survival from start of chemotherapy&#xD;
      of about 2 years and 10-12 months from starting second line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Liver resections for Colorectal Liver metastases (CRLM) While high-quality data&#xD;
      (randomized trials) are lacking, it is generally accepted that the only curative treatment&#xD;
      for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is surgery. Liver resections are generally well&#xD;
      tolerated and safe 1, but some patients recur early and probably have limited or no benefit&#xD;
      from surgery. These are hard to identify upfront. Even following three decades of systematic&#xD;
      liver surgery for CRLM, there is a lack of robust prognostic scoring systems that have&#xD;
      sufficient discriminatory power to serve as selectors for surgery or non-operative treatment&#xD;
      2, 3. Even among patients with very poor prognostic scores, there are some who will survive&#xD;
      five years following surgery 4, and even without surgery 5. Over the decades, the definition&#xD;
      of resectability/un-resectability has been steadily modified. Today, any configuration of&#xD;
      metastases can be deemed resectable as long as a resection will leave behind a working liver&#xD;
      volume of at least 20-30 % of the estimated total liver volume with a functioning arterial&#xD;
      inflow, portal venous inflow, draining bile duct and draining hepatic vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 The grey zone As resections are generally well tolerated and adequate prognostication is&#xD;
      wanting, there is a tendency to offer resections to patients who have borderline resectable&#xD;
      CRLM or who exhibit other non-favourable traits like large or multiple metastases. For&#xD;
      patients who have early recurrence of disease, such resections represent a net loss of&#xD;
      quality-of-life and an unwanted expenditure for society. Exploring the optimal treatment&#xD;
      modality for patients in this grey zone, i.e. with uncertain benefit from surgery, is&#xD;
      important to avoid unnecessary resections and providing the optimal treatment for patients in&#xD;
      a critical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Systemic chemotherapy for CRLM Palliative chemotherapy is in general the only treatment&#xD;
      option for the vast majority of non-resectable patients. The expected median overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) from start of first line chemotherapy is about 2 years and the 5 years OS is about 10%,&#xD;
      although, longer median OS has been obtained in selected patients with good performance&#xD;
      status (ECOG 0-1), no (K)RAS or BRAF mutations and left-sided tumors 6-10. OS from start of&#xD;
      second line chemotherapy is 10-12 months 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Liver transplant for CRLM Liver transplantation (LTX) has emerged as a possible solution&#xD;
      for some patients with unresectable CRLM who otherwise have good prognosis based on available&#xD;
      scorings systems 12, 13. In patients with non-resectable liver only metastases the&#xD;
      investigators have previously shown 5 year OS of 56% compared to 9% in a similar cohort of&#xD;
      patients starting first line chemotherapy 6, but due to lack of donor organs this will never&#xD;
      become the backbone of any treatment modality for a disease as prevalent as CRLM. However,&#xD;
      LTX is probably the best treatment option in highly selected patients with non-resectable&#xD;
      CRLM liver only disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) chemotherapy for CRLM The biological rationale for&#xD;
      intra-arterial chemotherapy is that the hepatic artery rather than the portal vein is&#xD;
      responsible for most of the blood supply to liver tumors. Hepatic Artery Infusion (HAI) of a&#xD;
      cytotoxic drug floxuridine (FUDR) that has a very high first-pass extraction (ca 95 %) in the&#xD;
      liver has shown promising results in selected series for several decades 14-16. It was&#xD;
      developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, USA) but is currently&#xD;
      unavailable in the European Union, because floxuridine is not registered. HAI has however not&#xD;
      gained foothold as a standard treatment option for CRLM, and most publications stem from a&#xD;
      very few centres. The reasons for this lack of dissemination are unknown but could well be&#xD;
      related to the complexity of the treatment algorithm and the lack of modern randomized&#xD;
      trials. In Europe several centers in The Nederlands have recently started the HAI treatment&#xD;
      procedure as adjuvant treatment in CRC patients who have received liver resection. (Buisman&#xD;
      FE et al. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 2019 26: 4599-4607. Of the 20 patients included in the study in&#xD;
      The Nederlands two patients had Clavien-Dindo complication grade III with reoperation due to&#xD;
      replacement of a pump with slow flow-rate and a flipped pump. The treatment administered both&#xD;
      at MSKCC and the two centers in The Nederlands consist of 0.12 mg FUDR/kg/day + 35.000 IE&#xD;
      heparin + 25 mg dexamethasnone in a total volume of 35ml NaCL administered as a continue&#xD;
      infusion for 14 days with dose reduction if liver function is affected (Table 2). At day 15&#xD;
      the pump is emtied and refiled with a low dose heparin solution for continuous infusion to&#xD;
      avoid coagulation of the catheter. A new cycle is started at day 29. The HAI treatment has&#xD;
      been combined with both oxaliplatin and irinotecan regimens combined with 5-FU as systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy 14,16,17 .HAI has also been combined with systemic gemcitabine-oxaliplatin&#xD;
      regimen in patients with non-resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma18 In the study by&#xD;
      D'Angelica in non-resectable CRC patients the response rate was 76%, median overall survival&#xD;
      was 38 months and 23 of 49 patients became resectable and received a liver resection.&#xD;
      Patients having a liver resection had a 3 year overall survival of 80%. In the study by Pak&#xD;
      33 of 64 non-resectable CRC patients received a liver resection with 5 year overall survival&#xD;
      of 36%. These results are better compared to what has been reported by systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      only with median overall survival of about 24 months in most studies. Optimal treatment for&#xD;
      patients with CRLM in the grey zone is therefore not yet defined and there is a definte need&#xD;
      for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize treatment for patients with a large tumour burden and borderline resectability,&#xD;
      the investigators will compare three treatment modalities in a randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      patients that have progressive disease on 1st line of chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Rationale for the Study and Purpose The target population for this study will be patients&#xD;
      who based on traditional preoperative criteria have a very dismal prognosis. They will -&#xD;
      according to the inclusion criteria - have a large tumour burden and have shown progression&#xD;
      on 1st line systemic chemotherapy treatment. Based on previous trials, only 30 % of this&#xD;
      patient group will be alive after two years. These patients have today only one treatment&#xD;
      modality available: 2nd line systemic chemotherapy. Response can, however, only be expected&#xD;
      in a small minority of these patients. As of today, they are not acceptable for inclusion&#xD;
      into any of the liver transplant protocols, and hepatic aretery infusion (HAI) chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment is not offered in Norway (or any other European country, save the Netherlands, as&#xD;
      far as the investigators know).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such a dismal outcome for these patients, an alternative modality that has the potential&#xD;
      to improve survival is highly warranted. While transplantation has such a potential, the&#xD;
      access to donor organs will allways limit the real-life use of such a treatment and the&#xD;
      inclusion of a transplant group in this trial is primarily for proof-of-principle reasons: to&#xD;
      benchmark what the investigators have reason to believe is the optimal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of HAI chemotherapy with FUDR has some inherent risks. A laparotomy is necessary to&#xD;
      apply the catheter and intra hepatic infusion of FUDR has been reported to cause biliary&#xD;
      inflammation and necrosis in a small fraction of the patients. The risk for the latter is&#xD;
      however significantly reduced by concommittant steroid infusion. The experiences published&#xD;
      from the MSKCC (se further) does however suggest that the drug has few systemic side effects&#xD;
      as the first-pass effect in the liver is close to complete, i.e. there is minimal release of&#xD;
      active drug into the systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMP for use in this protocol does not have a marketing authorization in Europa. The&#xD;
      institution that has pioneered the HAI treatment in CRC is Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital&#xD;
      (MSKCC) in New York and the dose is identical to the dose that used in several studies from&#xD;
      MSKCC 14,16 and The Nederlands17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.8 Research hypothesis In patients with large tumour burden and/or borderline resectability&#xD;
      of colorectal liver metastases and progression on 1st line systemic chemotherapy, overall&#xD;
      survival following systemic therapy combined with hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAI),&#xD;
      or liver transplantation, is better than following conventional systemic chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
