  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postpartum PrEP study (PPS) seeks to evaluate how best to improve adherence to PrEP in&#xD;
      postpartum women and to evaluate how acceptable it is to offer HIV self tests for the&#xD;
      participant and partner, and provide enhanced adherence biofeedback following a urine test of&#xD;
      recent PrEP use (measuring tenofovir). The primary outcome is recent PrEP adherence following&#xD;
      the intervention. The secondary outcome is HIV testing uptake in participants' partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant and breastfeeding women in South Africa are at very high risk of HIV acquisition and&#xD;
      vertical HIV transmission during pregnancy, labour and breastfeeding. One-third to half of&#xD;
      perinatal HIV transmission occurs in women who are seroconvert during the pregnancy and&#xD;
      post-partum period. Effective use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could contribute to&#xD;
      eliminating maternal HIV acquisition, and hence mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.&#xD;
      However, PrEP efficacy requires high levels of adherence, and adherence requires high levels&#xD;
      of acceptability, yet there are few data on how best to promote adherence to PrEP in&#xD;
      postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a study of the feasibility and acceptability of an adherence promotion&#xD;
      package in n=100 postpartum women enrolled in an ongoing PrEP study (PrEP-PP; ongoing,&#xD;
      R01MH116771) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a package of&#xD;
      interventions to improve PrEP adherence in pregnancy and postpartum women. Specifically the&#xD;
      package of interventions will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Offer of HIV self-test in women and their partners with counseling on use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Integrating urine based lateral flow assays in enhanced counseling using biofeedback on&#xD;
           adherence levels to postpartum women on PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is recent PrEP adherence at 1-month following the intervention. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is HIV testing uptake in participants' partners.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention includes the provision of an OraQuick HIV self-test (HIVST) for the woman and one test for each of her reported sex partners, along with instructions on how to use and interpret the results. Women were asked to report back within one month if their partner was able to test via a SMS, WhatsApp or by bringing in the test to confirm that he had tested.&#xD;
Women then received adherence based feedback following the urine lateral flow assay (that measures recent tenofovir use in past 48 hours). Study counsellors requested that women provide a urine sample that was tested using the UrSure/Orasure test that provides feedback on the result in 2-3 minutes. Counselors provided counseling based on the results including how to improve daily adherence (for women without tenofovir present in their urine) and importance of condom use.</description>
