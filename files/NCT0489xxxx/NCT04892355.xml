      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different irrigation activation&#xD;
      systems on pain after endodontic treatment in molar teeth with irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis.Post-operative pain values of the participants will be recorded and evaluated with&#xD;
      the VAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain values of the techniques will be compared with statistical evaluation.&#xD;

      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different irrigation activation&#xD;
      systems on pain after endodontic treatment in molar teeth with irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis.Materials and Methods: The study will be carried out on 140 patients with molar&#xD;
      teeth diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis. After the root canal preparation is completed,&#xD;
      the patients will be divided into 4 groups according to the irrigation activation system;&#xD;
      Conventional syringe irrigation (CSI), EDDY, EndoActivator (EA) and Xp-endo Finisher (XPF).&#xD;
      After the irrigation process is completed, the root canals will be filled using gutta-percha&#xD;
      and canal sealer and the treatment will be completed in one session. Pain values at 6, 24,&#xD;
      48, 72 hours and 7 days after treatment will be evaluated at a 0.05% significance level using&#xD;
      the Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;

    <description>Preoperative pain of the patients before the treatment was recorded with the VAS scale. Pain levels were classified as 0: no pain, 1-3: mild pain, 4-6: moderate pain, 7-10: severe pain .After the treatment of the patients, a pain assessment form was given to the patient in order to evaluate the postoperative pain. Patients were asked to mark their pain levels on the VAS scale. The marking procedure was taught to the patients by a blinded researcher from the groups. When the patients came to the control appointment, VAS scales were collected and the data were analyzed.</description>

    <description>During the final irrigation procedure, a 30 - G side vented needle was placed 2 mm shorter than the working length and was applied without agitation. 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl was applied for 1 minute for each channel. Each canal was then washed with 2 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 minute.</description>

    <description>Xp Endo Finisher file was used with VDW Silver (VDW) endomotor at 800 rpm speed and 1 Ncm torque according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Xp Endo Finisher file was placed in the canal, 2 mm shorter than the working length, and was used with slow movements of 7-8 mm amplitude in the canal during activation. 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl was applied for 1 minute for each channel. Each canal was then washed with 2 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 minute.</description>

    <description>An EDDY tip of size 25/04 was used for sonic activation. The EDDY was placed in the duct 2 mm shorter than the working length and the activation process was performed with slow movements with an amplitude of 2-4 mm. In the irrigation process, 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCI was applied for 1 minute for each channel. Each canal was then washed with 2 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 minute.</description>

    <description>Medium Endoactivator tip of 25 / .04 size was used for irrigation activation. Medium type was placed in the canal 2 mm shorter than the working length and activation was performed by making short strokes of 2-3 mm. 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl was applied for 1 minute for each channel. Each canal was then washed with 2 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 minute.</description>
