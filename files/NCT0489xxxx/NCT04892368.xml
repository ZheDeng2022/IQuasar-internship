  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Singapore's population is ageing, and more elderly people are undergoing elective major&#xD;
      surgeries. Frail elderly experience greater functional decline and slower recovery in&#xD;
      physical function after surgery compared to non-frail elderly. Preoperative prehabilitation&#xD;
      aims to enhance both aerobic capacity and physical strength of elderly to attenuate the&#xD;
      post-operative decline in physical function. Singapore General Hospital has a bespoke&#xD;
      preoperative program - Prehabilitation for Elderly Frail Patients Undergoing Elective&#xD;
      Surgeries (PREPARE), where patients receive physiotherapy education and instructions for&#xD;
      home-based unsupervised exercise program (uSEP). A hospital-based supervised exercise program&#xD;
      had also been established but the take-up rate was low (7.6%) due to barriers such as cost&#xD;
      and accessibility. Perioperative supervised exercise training can effect greater gains in&#xD;
      functional capacity and muscle strength compared to no supervision. For the elderly with&#xD;
      limited transport options to the hospital, home-based supervised programmes may be more&#xD;
      convenient compared to hospital-based supervised programmes, but the former is costlier too.&#xD;
      Home-interventions may also empower patients with the skills and confidence to maintain their&#xD;
      physical fitness at home, which increases their likelihood of exercising after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective single-center randomized controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of preoperative prehabilitation with a home-based supervised exercise program&#xD;
      (SEP) for frail elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, compared to the mainstay&#xD;
      of clinical practice, which is a home-based uSEP.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in functional walking capacity from baseline to just before surgery, as measured using the 6-minute walk distance.</measure>
    <time_frame>From recruitment to 2-days before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Distance that the patient can walk in 6 min, along a 15-20m hallway, at a pace that the participants will be tired at the end of the distance. This is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of recruitment, 2 days before surgery, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that assesses generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective, and covers eight domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional &amp; mental health.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of recruitment, 2 days before surgery, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.</description>
