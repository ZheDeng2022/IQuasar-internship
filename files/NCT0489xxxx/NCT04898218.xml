  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in life expectancy women spend more than one-third of their life time in&#xD;
      post-menopausal state leading to osteoporosis in later stages. Therefore a decrease in&#xD;
      temporal-spatial parameters of gait, high risk of fracture, imbalance in functional&#xD;
      parameters, fear of fall and compromised health-related quality of life is observed among&#xD;
      osteoporotic females. Several physical activities and balance training programs have been&#xD;
      implemented globally but nationally no program has yet been designed catering gait balance&#xD;
      and fear of fall altogether as a combined program. Therefore, the aim of this study was to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of Osteoanabolic exercises on Temporal-Spatial gait parameters,&#xD;
      Gait Stability Ratio (GSR) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) among the osteoporotic females.&#xD;
      Moreover, the effectiveness of these exercises was evaluated on dynamic balance using Timed&#xD;
      Up and Go Test (TUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the impact on fear of fall was identified using Fall Efficacy ScaleInternational&#xD;
      (FES-I).&#xD;

      A 3-arm Randomized Controlled Trial was conducted at the Department of Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Sciences, Ziauddin Hospital using the envelope method. The participants were screened on the&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness and You Questionnaire (PARQ &amp;YOU). Ninety-three osteoporotic&#xD;
      females were randomly allocated into three groups; where; participant in group A' received&#xD;
      aerobic training protocol, a participant in group B' resistance training and participant in&#xD;
      group C' Osteoanabolic training. A Frequency Intensity Time Type (FITT) protocol according to&#xD;
      the American College of Sports Medicine for aerobic and resistance training was incorporated&#xD;
      whereas for Osteoanabolic group combination training protocol was used. Twelve weeks of&#xD;
      training was conducted where pre and post readings were calculated using activPAL, TUG, FES-I&#xD;
      and Peripheral DXA Scan.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Warm-up exercises were performed by the participants on a cycle ergometer for a duration of 5-10 minutes. Group A was advised to start walking at a comfortable speed on a treadmill for the duration of 30-60 minutes; the intensity of the exercises was 55-75% of MHR, calculated by using a Karvonen method. Initially with the minimum intensity that was gradually raised up to the intensity of Targeted Heart Rate (THR). Once the THR is achieved the intensity was gradually decelerated and patient proceeded for the cool-down phase for 5-10 min.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group B (Resistance Exercise Group)</arm_group_label>

    <description>Group B was instructed for strengthening exercises of ten major muscle groups that include Biceps, Triceps, Pectoralis Major, Deltoid, Latissimus Dorsi, Abdominals, Back Extensors, Hamstrings, Quadriceps and Calf. The intensity of the weight-bearing exercises was calculated using 1 Repetition Maximum (RM) method.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group C (Osteoanabolic Exercise Group)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group C was performed Osteoanabolic exercise divided into two different phases:&#xD;
Aerobic Conditioning Phase Participants were instructed to walk on treadmill for 30-60 min. The intensity of the exercises was 55-75% MHR, calculated by Karvonen method. Intensity gradually raised up to the Targeted Heart Rate (THR). Once the THR is achieved the intensity was gradually decelerated and patient proceeded for the cool-down phase. The participants performed 3 days per week for 12 weeks on alternative days.&#xD;
Anaerobic (Resistance) Conditioning Phase Resistance training was started on every alternative day of the aerobic conditioning (3 days per week) for 45 min. The intensity of the weight-bearing exercises was calculated using 1 RM method. Resistance training muscle and protocol was the same as for Group B. The participants performed warm-up and cool down similar to that of group A and group B.</description>
