  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Talazoparib has shown clinical efficacy in breast cancer patients with germline BRCA1 or&#xD;
      BRCA2 mutations. Beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, it is plausible that talazoparib may have&#xD;
      activity in patients with homologous recombination defects (HRD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BRCA 1/2 plays an essential role in homologous recombination repair and breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with BRCA 1/2 germline mutation have homologous recombination defects (HRD). Besides&#xD;
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation, a proportion of breast cancer is characterized as having&#xD;
      HRD through germline mutation, somatic mutation, and epigenetic alteration of other&#xD;
      homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (which includes but are not limited to ATM,&#xD;
      BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L)&#xD;
      (5). It is speculated that tumor with HRD may have clinical benefit from PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of talazoparib in advanced breast cancer with HRD is not known. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib in breast&#xD;
      cancer with HRD.&#xD;
