  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to describe the antibiotic use in a neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (NICU) in Germany that is practising integrative medicine. The investigators will review&#xD;
      hospital records to find out how often and how long antibiotics were given to newborns;&#xD;
      compare antibiotic use to other NICU in the same area; describe how sick infected newborns&#xD;
      were (comparing those treated with or without antibiotics); and describe which anthroposophic&#xD;
      medicines were used, how often and if there were safety problems.&#xD;

      A retrospective study, analysing antibiotic use in a level 2 neonatology intensive care unit&#xD;
      (NICU) in Germany over a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. The study will analyse frequency of&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing; compare antibiotic use to other level 2 NICU; compare clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters among neonates with infectious disease diagnosis managed with or&#xD;
      without antibiotics; use and tolerability of anthroposophic medicinal products.&#xD;
