    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine how a virtual model for the management of lung nodules compares&#xD;
      to a face-to-face clinic for patient satisfaction, quality of life and cost.&#xD;

      Initial Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals that have been referred to the Respiratory Outpatient Department of Flinders&#xD;
           Medical Centre for management of a lung nodule will have their referral data screened by&#xD;
           a doctor to determine that the referral meets criteria for management in the outpatient&#xD;
           department and which category of follow-up is required (triaging process).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eligible referrals will be provided to the study's research assistant who will contact&#xD;
           the individual to discuss the study in detail and obtain consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individuals that have consented to participate are randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
           'virtual model' of lung nodule management (a), or the 'face-to-face model' of lung&#xD;
           nodule management (b). Each participant has a 50% chance (1 in 2) of being assigned to&#xD;
           either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The 'virtual model' involves participants' CT scan(s) being reviewed by a&#xD;
                multi-disciplinary team of specialist doctors, nurses and radiologists in a virtual&#xD;
                environment. The team will analyse these scans and make a recommendation for any&#xD;
                follow-up scans, procedures or appointments that may be required. The team will&#xD;
                contact each participant with a phone-call. Participants primary care providers&#xD;
                will also receive a letter describing the review and plan. Participants are not&#xD;
                required to physically attend the hospital or outpatient department for this review&#xD;
                to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The 'face-to-face model' involves a face-to-face appointment in the Respiratory&#xD;
                outpatient clinic at Flinders Medical Centre, where a doctor will review&#xD;
                participants' CT scan(s) and make a plan for any follow-up scans, procedures or&#xD;
                appointments that may be required. Primary care providers will be informed of the&#xD;
                outcome of this visit. Participants are required to physically attend the clinic&#xD;
                appointment for this review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this research study will be asked to complete an initial set of two&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant information questionnaire - collects personal information and contact&#xD;
           details, as well as specific health-related, occupational and lifestyle information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have had their face-to-face appointment or virtual review, they will be&#xD;
      asked to complete four questionnaires at a 1-month and 3-month interval. The questionnaires&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient experience questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient economic impact questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Visit-specific satisfaction instrument (VSQ-9)&#xD;
