  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) associates with reduced risk of stroke&#xD;
      recurrence in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke as reported in the recent CLOSE and&#xD;
      REDUCE trials. The long-term follow-up results of the RESPECT and DEFENSE-PFO trial confirmed&#xD;
      these findings. PFO closure is therefore recommended in patient with cryptogenic ischemic&#xD;
      stroke and PFO according to the current German interdisciplinary guidelines. It is likely&#xD;
      that the number of PFO closure procedures will increase significantly in the near future.&#xD;
      However, new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) appears to increase in patients following this&#xD;
      procedure. In the REDUCE study, new onset atrial fibrillation was detected in 6.6% patients&#xD;
      in the PFO closure group compared with 0.4% in the control group (medical treatment); 59% of&#xD;
      these patients were diagnosed within the first two weeks following the procedure and 83%&#xD;
      within 45 days, respectively. These results were consistent with the CLOSE study: AF was&#xD;
      detected in 4.6% patients in the intervention group vs. 0.9% in the control group. Up until&#xD;
      today, markers to identify and quantify the individual risk of AF onset are lacking.&#xD;
      Furthermore, under-reporting and under-detection of AF occurrence after PFO closure is&#xD;
      likely. This study is designed to to assess the prevalence and and identification of&#xD;
      electrophysiological and echocardiographic parameters of new-onset AF.&#xD;
