  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
      combination of Troriluzole, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, and to learn whether this combination&#xD;
      works in treating melanoma that has spread to the brain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, phase II signal-detection trial with a&#xD;
      non-randomized safety run-in to assess the efficacy and safety of adding troriluzole to&#xD;
      ipilimumab/nivolumab induction and nivolumab maintenance in patients with melanoma that has&#xD;
      metastasized to the brain. Measuring the shrinking or growth of melanoma in participants will&#xD;
      allow researchers to learn about these study drugs and provide information on the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of this combination in treating melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Troriluzole as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved nivolumab, ipilimumab,&#xD;
      and the combination of these two drugs as treatment options for melanoma that has&#xD;
      metastasized to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and nivolumab are drugs that treat cancer by blocking certain molecules in the&#xD;
      body. This blocking action prevents other molecules from binding to cells involved in the&#xD;
      immune system. With these changes, the immune system is more likely to become active, and&#xD;
      will react more intensely when activated. The immune system is able to destroy cancer cells&#xD;
      and reduce the size of tumors, so activating the immune system is an important part of cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Ipilimumab blocks a molecule called CTLA-4, which normally decreases the&#xD;
      activation of the immune system by binding to T-Cells, which are important immune system&#xD;
      cells that can attack cancer cells. Nivolumab blocks a molecule called PD-1, which also&#xD;
      normally decreases the activation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troriluzole is a drug that modulates glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter&#xD;
      in the human body. The primary mode of action of Troriluzole is reducing synaptic levels of&#xD;
      glutamate. This may change parts of the immune system in the brain, which is could improve&#xD;
      treatment outcomes with anti-cancer drugs such as ipilimumab and nivolumab that can work in&#xD;
      the brain. This study is testing Troriluzole's ability to increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment in melanoma that has spread to the brain, as well as&#xD;
      testing the safety of the combination of these three drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this research is expected to last up to 4 years: 1 year of treatment and 3&#xD;
      years of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 108 subjects will take part in this research.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma. All&#xD;
             melanoma subtypes are included, except for ocular melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease in the brain (intraparenchymal brain&#xD;
             metastases), defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured by MRI in&#xD;
             at least one dimension as â‰¥5 mm and â‰¤ 3 cm in longest diameter. See Section 11&#xD;
             (Measurement of Effect) for the evaluation of measurable disease. Measurable disease&#xD;
             in the extracranial compartment (body) is not required. Measurable lesions may not&#xD;
             have received previous treatment with radiation therapy. Prior stereotactic radiation&#xD;
             therapy or SRT (e.g. GammaKnife, CyberKnife) is allowed for lesions other than the&#xD;
             lesions selected as measurable target lesions. Prior craniotomy with resection of&#xD;
             brain metastases is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received prior systemic treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             pembrolizumab, or nivolumab) in any setting (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic).&#xD;
             Prior anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy is allowed (e.g. ipilimumab). Prior targeted therapy&#xD;
             (e.g. BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of troriluzole in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count â‰¥1,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), or in the case&#xD;
                  of Gilbert's disease â‰¤ 3x ULN&#xD;

             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
             treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment,&#xD;
             they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of troriluzole on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because ipilimumab is a pregnancy category C, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of all study drugs.&#xD;
