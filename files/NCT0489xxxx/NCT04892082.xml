  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindful Moment (a web-based mindful and compassionate parenting training) is a self-guided&#xD;
      program for postpartum mothers, based on the Mindful Parenting Training developed by Bögels&#xD;
      and Restifo (2014) and the Mindful with Your Baby Training (Potharst et al., 2017, 2019). The&#xD;
      main goal of this research is to assess the feasibility (e.g., user's adherence, dropout) and&#xD;
      acceptability of Mindful Moment and to gather preliminary evidence of its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial) will be a two-arm trial. Mothers with a child&#xD;
      aged up to 18 months old will be enrolled in the study. A minimum number of 60 mothers will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. After agreeing to participate in the study, the mothers will be&#xD;
      screened for the presence of parenting stress (PSS [Parenting Stress Scale] ≥ 41, Mixão et&#xD;
      al., 2007). In case of 41 points score or more, mothers will be asked to complete baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Then, mothers who completed baseline assessment will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two conditions: the intervention (Mindful Moment program) or the control condition&#xD;
      (Waiting-List control [WLC]). The sample will be recruited online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of Mindful Moment will be evaluated in terms of user's adherence and dropout.&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 16 weeks. The Mindful Moment program will last 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in both conditions will be invited via email to complete baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and follow-up assessment (8-weeks after post-intervention). Assessments&#xD;
      will include self-report questionnaires to assess user's acceptability and satisfaction,&#xD;
      several indicators (e.g., parenting stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, infant's&#xD;
      temperament), and mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment response (e.g., mindful&#xD;
      parenting, self-compassion).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the present study, the feasibility (e.g., user's adherence, dropout), acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a web-based intervention to decrease mothers' parenting stress in the&#xD;
      postpartum period (the Mindful Moment program) will be tested. The design and content&#xD;
      development of the Mindful Moment program was conducted through a formative evaluation&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the birth of a child is a time of great happiness, it is also a period of major&#xD;
      adjustment for parents. This period encompasses several demands and reorganizations (e.g.,&#xD;
      changes in routines, new relationships with partner and family) and psychological and&#xD;
      emotional challenges (e.g., ability to regulate the baby's emotional states and one's own&#xD;
      internal states). These demands often increase stress levels. It is well-stablished in&#xD;
      literature that parenting stress may interfere with sensitive parenting and the ability to&#xD;
      form a secure attachment with the child. It is also well-established that the quality of&#xD;
      parental care is a major determinant of the child's cognitive, social, and emotional&#xD;
      development. Therefore, psychological interventions aimed at helping mothers adjust better to&#xD;
      the postpartum period and develop adaptive parenting skills are much needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness (the capacity to pay nonjudgmental attention to the present moment) and&#xD;
      self-compassion (attitude of kindness toward one's suffering and desire to relieve it) skills&#xD;
      can be highly beneficial for parents since they are well-known psychological resources that&#xD;
      help individuals adaptively cope with stress. Mindful applied to the parenting context can be&#xD;
      defined as a more accepting, emotionally attuned, and compassionate way of parenting and it&#xD;
      is characterized by parenting practices that promote responsive and sensitive care to the&#xD;
      child's needs. Although the scarcity of research during the postpartum period, a few studies&#xD;
      have shown that mindful parenting training may reduce mothers' psychopathological symptoms&#xD;
      and may promote a more positive mother-infant relationship through the promotion of mindful&#xD;
      parenting skills. Likewise, online mindful parenting training seems to be an easily&#xD;
      accessible and valuable intervention for mothers with elevated levels of parenting stress&#xD;
      including in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindful Moment is a self-guided web-based intervention grounded on CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy) principles that also includes recent developments in mindfulness and compassion&#xD;
      based-therapies, specifically for the postpartum context. This program focuses on the&#xD;
      decreasing of parenting stress and the development and enhancement of psychological resources&#xD;
      such as mindful parenting and self-compassion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindful Moment is constituted by 6 modules, each module addressing one or two specific&#xD;
      thematic contents (1. Mindful parenting and parenting stress; 2. Beginner's mind; 3.&#xD;
      Self-compassion and self-care; 4. Reactive vs. responsive parenting; 5. Relationship with&#xD;
      others [social support and communication]; 6. Mindful parenting for life). In each module,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with both psychoeducational content and therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
      Informational material will be given in text format, combined with audio and video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this research is to evaluate Mindful Moment by considering several&#xD;
      indicators: 1) Mindful Moment's feasibility in terms of adherence, dropout and the pattern of&#xD;
      program usage (e.g., number of completed modules, number of pages accessed in each module);&#xD;
      2) Mindful Moment's acceptability in terms of users' global perceptions of the program; and&#xD;
      3) preliminary evidence of Mindful Moment's efficacy in terms of primary (parenting stress)&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes (e.g., mindful parenting; self-compassion; depressive and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design of the trial followed the methodological recommendations for the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of web-based interventions. A usability test was already conducted&#xD;
      through phone-call with 4 mothers who explored the website while verbalizing their experience&#xD;
      and opinions (think-aloud sessions). At the end, a brief questionnaire was completed by each&#xD;
      participant. The results allowed to identify and implement modifications and the final&#xD;
      version of Mindful Moment was achieved, allowing for a pilot RCT efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot RCT will be a two-arm trial, conducted with mothers who presented parenting stress&#xD;
      (PSS ≥ 41 score). The intervention condition (the Mindful Moment program) will be compared&#xD;
      with a control condition (Waiting-List control group). The sample will include mothers who&#xD;
      delivered a baby in the postpartum period (up to 18 months postpartum). Mothers are being&#xD;
      already recruited online through social media and websites and forums focused on motherhood.&#xD;
      The dissemination of the study will also be made in HealthCare Centers, after the approval&#xD;
      already obtained from Regional Administration of Health Center (ARS-Center). A minimum number&#xD;
      of 30 mothers per condition will be required (N = 60). Accounting for the proportion of&#xD;
      mothers who presented moderate or high parenting stress (a total score on PSS of 41 or more)&#xD;
      and the 50% of attrition rate over time, an anticipated sample of 600 mothers will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers who demonstrate interest in the study were informed of the study goals, the structure&#xD;
      and arms of the research and the researchers' and participants' roles. Mothers who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study gave their informed consent. All ethical requirements for research&#xD;
      with humans were guaranteed. Mothers were screened for the presence of parenting stress. In&#xD;
      case of lower levels of parenting stress, mothers' participation in the study ended. In case&#xD;
      of presenting moderate or high levels of parenting stress (PSS ≥ 41), mothers were randomly&#xD;
      assigned (blocked randomization, with allocation concealment) to one of the conditions: the&#xD;
      intervention (Mindful Moment program) or the control condition (WLC group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher (clinical psychologist) will contact mothers in the intervention condition,&#xD;
      aiming to explain the program's structure and provide assistance during the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will last 16 weeks. The Mindful Moment program will last 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in both conditions will be invited via email to complete baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and follow-up (8-weeks after post-intervention) assessments. Assessments&#xD;
      will include self-report questionnaires to assess user's acceptability and satisfaction,&#xD;
      several indicators (e.g., parenting stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, infant's&#xD;
      temperament), and mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment response (e.g., mindful&#xD;
      parenting, self-compassion).&#xD;
