      Objective: To assess the efficacy of the &quot;connexion pancreatic duct to jejunum stented&#xD;
      (CONDUCTJE-ST)&quot; technique to prevent clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula&#xD;
      (CR-POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Background Data: CR-POPF remains the most determining cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality after PD. The incidence of CR-POPF (grades B and C, ISGPS) is around 20% and is a&#xD;
      potential source of severe secondary complications that are associated with a mortality of up&#xD;
      to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective pilot study included 50 consecutive patients who underwent PD with the&#xD;
      CONDUCTJE-ST technique, the steps of which are described, performed by the same surgical team&#xD;
      from January 2018 to February 2020. No patient received prophylactic or therapeutic&#xD;
      somatostatin or its analogues. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CR-POPF. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were postoperative mortality and morbidity, hospital course and during the first&#xD;
      year of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study we have evaluated a &quot;novel&quot; technique, modification of the preexisting&#xD;
      ones, for the reconstruction of the digestive continuity of the corporocaudal remnant in the&#xD;
      PD, termed &quot;connexion pancreatic duct to jejunum stented (CONDUCTJE-ST)&quot;, applicable to any&#xD;
      type of pancreatic remnant, regardless of its texture and the diameter of the main pancreatic&#xD;
      duct. The study was planned with the objective of achieving a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of CR-POPF, so that CONDUCTJE-ST could be considered as a surgical procedure of&#xD;
      choice in the management of the pancreatic remnant in PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2018 to February 2020, a PD was performed with the CONDUCTJE-ST technique in 50&#xD;
      consecutive patients by the same surgical team, whose main surgeon has make more than 250 PD,&#xD;
      in our Hepatobiliopancreatic Surgery and Liver Transplantation Unit. The study was carried&#xD;
      out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Community of Aragon (CEICA), Act No. 16/2018. Patient care and study conduct&#xD;
      complied with good clinical practices and written informed consent was obtained from each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of patients for surgery was decided collectively by the Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Committee for Tumors of the Liver, Bile ducts and Pancreas of our hospital. No patient&#xD;
      received neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received general anesthesia and multimodal pain therapy with an epidural catheter.&#xD;
      All patients underwent resection with curative intent, performing PD with antrectomy and&#xD;
      standard lymphadenectomy. Immediately after sectioning the pancreas at the level of the&#xD;
      isthmus-body, a tissue slice is biopsied from the section margin. In the reestablishment of&#xD;
      digestive continuity, we successively perform four reconstructions. The restoration of the&#xD;
      flow of pancreatic juice from the corporocaudal remnant towards the intestine was carried out&#xD;
      with the technique of &quot;connection of the pancreatic duct to the jejunum with stent&#xD;
      (CONDUCTJE-ST)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data were prospectively recorded. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities,&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of the disease and intraoperative parameters were analyzed. During&#xD;
      the intervention, the texture of the remaining pancreatic parenchyma was classified as soft&#xD;
      or hard and the diameter of the external orifice of the main pancreatic duct was measured&#xD;
      after transection; these data were distributed by disease pathology as confirmed by final&#xD;
      histological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcome and follow-up. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of&#xD;
      CR-POPF. No patient received prophylactic or therapeutic somatostatin or its analogues.&#xD;
      According to the 2016 updated of the ISGPS16, POPF has been defined as any volume of fluid&#xD;
      collected in the abdominal drainage on postoperative day 3 or from this day with an amylase&#xD;
      level 3 times higher than the normal value serum amylase. CR-POPF has been considered when&#xD;
      the criteria for grades B or C were met, while grade A has been replaced by the denomination&#xD;
      of biochemical leak (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume and appearance of the fluid from the abdominal drains was recorded daily. The&#xD;
      amylase concentration in the fluid of each of the drains was analyzed on the third and sixth&#xD;
      postoperative days, as well as before removing the drain and on any day in which there was a&#xD;
      substantial increase in volume or change in the appearance of the fluid. The drains were&#xD;
      removed when three requirements were met: amylase levels in the drainage fluid less than 8&#xD;
      twice the plasma level (normal 28-100 U / L), volume &lt;25 ml / day, and clear appearance of&#xD;
      the fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of the study were: 1) postoperative mortality, defined as that which&#xD;
      occurred within thirty days of the operation or during the same hospital admission; 2)&#xD;
      postoperative complications related to the surgical technique: delayed gastric emptying&#xD;
      (DGE), digestive and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, intra-abdominal abscesses, surgical wound&#xD;
      infection, biliary fistula and gastrointestinal fistula; 3) days of stay in the Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit (ICU) and hospital, reoperations, and readmissions. The DGE and postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding were defined according to the ISGPS29,30. The severity of complications was&#xD;
      classified using the Clavien-Dindo system31; a severe complication was defined as grade IIIa&#xD;
      or higher; 5) during the first year after PD: a) the incidence of exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency (EPI), evaluated by the presence of steatorrhea, need for pancreatic enzyme&#xD;
      supplements and fecal elastase determination; b) incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (NODM), assessed by blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c and need for insulin or oral&#xD;
      antidiabetics; c) overall survival and by pathologies and, in the case of malignant&#xD;
      processes, disease-free survival, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after PD.&#xD;
