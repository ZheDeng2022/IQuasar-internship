  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in an accessible manner represents an&#xD;
      unmet need for those with cardiovascular disease (CVD), given that patients with CVD&#xD;
      experience numerous barriers for in-person treatment engagement. The research plan for the&#xD;
      proposed pilot project will entail: (1) open study of the acceptability of the digital&#xD;
      intervention, followed by (2) recruitment and randomization of 90 individuals with a history&#xD;
      of acute CVD events and clinical levels of GAD symptoms to dCBT or a waitlist (Control)&#xD;
      condition, using a 1.5:1 allocation (dCBT:Control).&#xD;

      The treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in an accessible manner represents an&#xD;
      unmet need for those with cardiovascular disease (CVD), given that patients with CVD&#xD;
      experience numerous barriers for in-person treatment engagement. A recent large-scale&#xD;
      efficacy trial of digital cognitive behavior therapy (dCBT) for GAD demonstrated significant&#xD;
      benefit relative to waitlist control with a large effect size. The research plan for the&#xD;
      proposed pilot project will entail: (1) open study of the acceptability of the digital&#xD;
      intervention, followed by (2) recruitment and randomization of 90 individuals with a history&#xD;
      of acute CVD events and clinical levels of GAD symptoms to dCBT or a waitlist (Control)&#xD;
      condition, using a 1.5:1 allocation (dCBT:Control). Assessments will occur at Week 0&#xD;
      (baseline), Week 3, Week 6, and Week 10 (post-treatment).&#xD;
