  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fute (Flupentixol) combined with MARTAs (Multiple-Acting Receptor Targeted Antipsychotics)&#xD;
      drugs has its clinical efficacy toward positive symptoms and might reduce the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome-related factors in patients. This study is the first clinical trial to explore the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with flupentixol combined with MARTAs. However, due to research&#xD;
      limitations, the number of patients who participated in the clinical trial is small, and it&#xD;
      depends on subsequent larger-scale clinical trials for more in-depth verification.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of adjunctive Fute (Flupentixol) with MARTAs (Multiple-Acting Receptor Targeted&#xD;
      Antipsychotics) on the metabolic profiles of patients and clinical efficacy of treatment in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to be admitted to patients with schizophrenia who are over 20 years old and&#xD;
      are being treated with MARTAs antipsychotics due to poor treatment efficacy or significant&#xD;
      weight gain after use, poor blood sugar control, and other metabolic syndrome-related&#xD;
      problems, but Patients who do not meet the medication standards for diabetes or&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and are willing to accept additional use of Flupentixol after evaluation by&#xD;
      the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare whether the original MARTAs dose can be effectively reduced after additional use&#xD;
      of Flupentixol for at least 12 weeks, whether the symptoms of psychosis have improved, and&#xD;
      whether the various factors of metabolic syndrome have improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 30 subjects will be recruited to participate in this clinical trial.&#xD;
      This report is an interim report with the results of 15 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from schizophrenia who are over 20 years old and are using MARTAs&#xD;
      antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test product, dose and mode of administration, batch number&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fute F.C. Tablets (Flupentixol), the clinically recommended dosage should be adjusted&#xD;
      according to the individual conditions of the patients. Generally speaking, a low dose should&#xD;
      be administered at the beginning. Then the dosage is increased according to the treatment&#xD;
      response to achieve the appropriate curative effect as soon as possible. The maintenance dose&#xD;
      is usually administered as a single dose in the morning, and the maintenance dose is usually&#xD;
      5-20 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose is 3-15 mg/day, divided into 2-3 administrations, and can be increased to 40&#xD;
      mg/day if necessary.&#xD;

    <description>The clinical efficacy of schizophrenia, Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S), in patients taking MARTAs combined with Flupentixol for 12 weeks.&#xD;
The CGI provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including a knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function.&#xD;
CGI-Severity (CGI-S) which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.&#xD;
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days.</description>

    <description>The clinical efficacy of schizophrenia, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), in patients taking MARTAs combined with Flupentixol for 12 weeks.&#xD;
PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. It is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy. The scale is known as the &quot;gold standard&quot; that all assessments of psychotic behavioral disorders should follow.&#xD;
The name refers to the two types of symptoms in schizophrenia, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association: positive symptoms, which refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), and negative symptoms, which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. Some of these functions which may be lost include normal thoughts, actions, ability to tell fantasies from reality, and the ability to properly express.</description>
