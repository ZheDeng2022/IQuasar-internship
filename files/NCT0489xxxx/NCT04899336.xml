  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of 9-valent extraintestinal&#xD;
      pathogenic Escherichia coli vaccine (ExPEC9V) compared to placebo in the prevention of the&#xD;
      first invasive extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli disease (IED) event caused by&#xD;
      ExPEC9V O-serotypes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) disease is defined as an acute&#xD;
      illness consistent with systemic bacterial infection, which is microbiologically confirmed&#xD;
      either by the isolation and identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) from blood or any&#xD;
      other sterile body sites, or by the isolation and identification of E. coli from urine in a&#xD;
      participant with urosepsis and no other identifiable source of infection. ExPEC9V&#xD;
      (JNJ-78901563, primary compound number: VAC52416) is a 9-valent vaccine candidate in&#xD;
      development for the prevention of IED in adults 60 years of age and older. Although IED&#xD;
      affects all ages, adults aged greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 years have an increased risk&#xD;
      of developing IED, including bacteremia and sepsis, which can be community-acquired,&#xD;
      hospital-acquired or healthcare associated. As the mechanism of action of conjugate vaccines&#xD;
      in the prevention of invasive disease is not expected to be affected by antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms, that is, resistance mechanisms are not linked to O-polysaccharide structures, the&#xD;
      sponsor believes that IED caused by antimicrobial-resistant and susceptible O-serotypes will&#xD;
      be prevented by the ExPEC9V vaccine. This study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part&#xD;
      2) and incorporates an inferentially seamless group sequential design, where the enrollment&#xD;
      will be staggered. This study consists of a Screening Phase (Day 1), Vaccination Phase (Day&#xD;
      1) and Follow-up Phase (up to 3 years post-vaccination). The total study duration is up to 5&#xD;
      years and 11 months. Key safety assessments include serious adverse events (SAEs), physical&#xD;
      examination, and vital signs.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire with a recall period for all items of 1 week. The SF 36 version 2 includes 8 domains that measure physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health problems (RP), bodily pain, general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE) and mental health (MH). The 8 domains can be aggregated into 2 summary scales that reflect physical and mental health: a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). Responses to all items are rated on a 3-, 5- or 6-point Likert scale. The scores range from 0 (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100 (highest or best possible level of functioning).</description>

    <description>Frailty will be assessed at baseline based on Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score and will be calculated using participants self-reported information regarding health status (components of SF-36 and EQ-5D), and baseline health conditions collected through medical conditions of interest. The specific medical conditions of interest used for the calculation of the frailty index score will include: diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular disease (sequelae of stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer, long term disability or handicap, hearing problems, migraine, cataract, and glaucoma. Total Frailty Index, ranging from 0 (not frail or best possible score) to 43 (frail or worst possible score), will be calculated as accumulation of individual's deficits.</description>
