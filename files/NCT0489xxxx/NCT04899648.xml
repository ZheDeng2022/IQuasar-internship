      This is an effectiveness-implementation study to assess the effectiveness of a peer-led&#xD;
      multi-component lifestyle program that will aim to lower BP among pre-hypertensive&#xD;
      individuals in Nepal. The program will aim to encourage weight loss, improve diet (using a&#xD;
      DASH diet), lower sodium intake, encourage only moderate alcohol intake among drinkers, and&#xD;
      encourage more physical activity through peers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney&#xD;
      and other diseases. It is a major cause of premature death worldwide, with upwards of 1 in 4&#xD;
      men and 1 in 5 women - over a billion people - having the condition. The burden of&#xD;
      hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two-thirds&#xD;
      of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent&#xD;
      decades Pre-hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) of 120-139 mmHg or&#xD;
      diastolic BP of 80-89 mmHg, is a precursor to hypertension, and is associated with excess&#xD;
      morbidity and deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Hence, the reduction of BP to&#xD;
      optimal levels is a major public health priority. Although clinical trials have shown that&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy lowers BP among pre-hypertensives; it has been argued that pharmacotherapy is&#xD;
      not reasonable because the absolute risk in patients without other CVD risk factors is low&#xD;
      and pharmacotherapy is costly. Lifestyle modifications have proven to reduce BP, and are also&#xD;
      useful to prevent other chronic diseases. Major lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP&#xD;
      include weight loss; reduced sodium intake; regular aerobic physical activity; moderate&#xD;
      alcohol drinking; the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet - a diet rich in fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables, low-fat dairy products, potassium and calcium, and reduced dietary cholesterol,&#xD;
      saturated and total fats. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications may have even&#xD;
      better results. However, most of the studies have focused on one or two lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions and are tested in efficacy trials in a clinical setting. Therefore, there is a&#xD;
      major gap in the evidence for the effectiveness of a community-based multi-component&#xD;
      intervention on BP reduction. In addition, it is not clear how such an intervention would be&#xD;
      scaled up to the general population in low-and-middle-income countries, where the burden of&#xD;
      hypertension and CVD is the highest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this gap, the investigators propose to conduct an effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      study to assess the effectiveness of a peer-led multi-component lifestyle program that will&#xD;
      aim to lower BP among pre-hypertensive individuals in Nepal. The program will aim to&#xD;
      encourage weight loss, improve diet (using a DASH diet), lower sodium intake, encourage only&#xD;
      moderate alcohol intake among drinkers, and encourage more physical activity through peers.&#xD;
      Peer education can be as effective as using health professionals and is a cost-effective and&#xD;
      sustainable method for lifestyle modification. The peer-education approach is driven by&#xD;
      social learning theory, emphasizing credibility, role modeling, empowerment, and&#xD;
      reinforcement which contrasts with the delivery of lifestyle modification advice in the usual&#xD;
      clinical setting. While implementing the peer-led multi-component lifestyle intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect information on factors affecting the delivery of the program and&#xD;
      the potential for scaled-up implementation in a real-world situation. The feasibility and&#xD;
      scalability of such programs in a real-life setting have not been studied. Besides, there are&#xD;
      three key challenges to manage pre-hypertension and hypertension in low-and middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs). First, the pre-hypertensive population is considered non-diseased; hence&#xD;
      they are not in contact with the health system. Second, even though the efficacy of lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications has been proven, sustainable lifestyle modifications in the general population&#xD;
      are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of behavioral change. And third, the health&#xD;
      system in LMICs is already worn out due to the double burden of disease, and inadequate&#xD;
      financing and human resources. To address this massive challenge in an LMIC such as Nepal, a&#xD;
      cost-effective, community-based, sustainable, and scalable intervention is required. The&#xD;
      proposed study will establish evidence for a new model to lower BP in a community setting, by&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of the peer-led multi-component program and informing the&#xD;
      success of implementation and scalability. This model will provide a valuable resource for&#xD;
      making recommendations and dissemination plans to implement and sustain lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions for lowering BP at the community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the effectiveness of the peer-led online multi-component lifestyle program on&#xD;
           reducing BP among the school employees of Dhulikhel and Banepa, Nepal. The investigators&#xD;
           will compare the change in systolic BP at twelve months between the peer-led&#xD;
           multi-component program group and usual care group using a community-based cluster&#xD;
           randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the success of implementation and inform the scalability of the peer-led&#xD;
           multi-component lifestyle program. The investigators will evaluate (a) program adoption&#xD;
           by assessing changes in weight, diet, and physical activity behaviors among lifestyle&#xD;
           intervention participants; (b) fidelity to the program design by assessing activities of&#xD;
           peer-educators; and (c) acceptability of the program through (i) in-depth,&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews with lifestyle intervention program dropouts; and (ii) focus&#xD;
           group discussions with lifestyle intervention program participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the impact of Covid-19 in hypertension management in context to the mental&#xD;
           wellbeing of hypertensive patients. The investigators will measure the impact of&#xD;
           Covid-19 on the mental health of a participant by measuring their anxiety and depression&#xD;
           levels through a questionnaire scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of possible participants, the principal investigator and/or the research&#xD;
      assistants would make formal phone calls to the principals of the different educational&#xD;
      institutes to describe the research project. The principals of the educational institutes&#xD;
      are, then, sent information sheets and other informational materials regarding the project&#xD;
      via email. Then, after the approval of the principal, all the staff of the educational&#xD;
      institutions would be sent an information sheet and other information regarding the project.&#xD;
      After everyone is informed, a formal zoom or google meet appointment would be made with all&#xD;
      the staff of the educational institute. In this manner, the study participants would be&#xD;
      recruited and screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 500 participants are selected from various educational institutes, their baseline&#xD;
      information will be collected which would include aspects of their demography, physical&#xD;
      activity, behavioral history like smoking and alcohol consumption, diet recall, mental health&#xD;
      status and anthropometric measurements. This will all take place in the first 3 months of the&#xD;
      study. All of this information will be collected via an online survey. As for the&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, the investigators will have provided anthropometric instruments&#xD;
      like Digital Blood Pressure Machine, Digital Weighing Scale and Mechanical Measuring tape, to&#xD;
      each educational institute and also provided them with World Health Organization Guidelines&#xD;
      to use those instruments. Using the tools provided by the investigators, the study&#xD;
      participants will measure their anthropometric data themselves when they are in their&#xD;
      workplace. This information is then sent along with their other information while filling up&#xD;
      the online survey. After that, a computer-generated randomization process will be carried out&#xD;
      after which 250 participants will be selected for the intervention process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: The remaining 250 Participants in the control group would not get exercise and&#xD;
      nutritional classes. But they will all get the study and educational material regarding&#xD;
      hypertension prevention after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Classes: Participants (n=250) who are selected for the Behavioral Intervention&#xD;
      classes will be connected with the study team for 20 minutes video, 20 minutes of discussion&#xD;
      and 20 minutes of exercise every week. It would include 16 core sessions weekly during the&#xD;
      next four months of the program followed by 1 month maintenance sessions. Each core session&#xD;
      will last 1 hour every week. The audio and video of the sessions for some intervention groups&#xD;
      will be recorded. These Participants would also be reimbursed Nrs. 50 for the data package 16&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Leader: Among the selected participants from the Intervention group, 10% of the&#xD;
      participants would be appointed peer leaders. The peer leaders will go through health&#xD;
      education classes via online platforms using various videos and presentations. The peer&#xD;
      leaders will also be paired with the professional health educators from the study staff and&#xD;
      will be informed about aspects like Diabetes Prevention Program Curriculum along with dieting&#xD;
      and exercise classes. Professional health educators will train the peer educators and provide&#xD;
      online supervision as well. The health educators will also assess the classes taken by peer&#xD;
      leaders to the rest of the participants and provide necessary feedback and motivation.&#xD;
      Behavior intervention will be comprised of extensive education sessions, group counseling and&#xD;
      goal setting and monitoring exercises based on the diabetes prevention program developed by&#xD;
      India Works. Peer Leader will conduct 16 session classes for the remaining participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group virtually. Peer Leader will measure Blood Pressure, Height and weight&#xD;
      of the Participants once a month from the Intervention Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endline: This survey will be done for all the participants both in the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups. This would take 15-20 minutes. Some of the questions from the baseline&#xD;
      survey will be filled by the participants. (about daily activities, cigarettes and alcohol&#xD;
      intake) Height, weight, blood pressure will be accessed by themselves or their designated&#xD;
      peer leader. Questions about 24 hours diet, physical activities will be asked by the research&#xD;
      assistants through online platforms like zoom or viber.&#xD;
