  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An early feasibility study to evaluate the safety and performance of 1) the transcatheter&#xD;
      delivery and implantation of the Cardiac Implants (CI) annuloplasty ring and 2) the&#xD;
      adjustment of the ring approximately 90 days following implantation in patients suffering&#xD;
      from ≥ moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An early feasibility, multi-center, prospective, single-arm, non-randomized study to assess&#xD;
      the safety and performance of the CI Percutaneous Ring Annuloplasty System in patients&#xD;
      suffering from ≥ moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR). Additional outcomes&#xD;
      include short and long-term changes in echocardiographic, functional, and quality of life&#xD;
      parameters post-adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CI Ring Annuloplasty System is a percutaneous transcatheter repair device delivered by&#xD;
      right heart catheterization through the right internal jugular vein. The System is designed&#xD;
      to perform annuloplasty using a Ring Delivery System (RDS) to place a complete, flexible ring&#xD;
      over the tricuspid annulus on the atrial side of the valve. Fluoroscopy and transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography are used to guide and monitor the ring placement procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After implantation, the ring becomes embedded within the fibrous tissue of the tricuspid&#xD;
      annulus. Approximately 3 months following implantation, the ring is manually adjusted under&#xD;
      echocardiographic and fluoroscopic imaging using an Adjustment Tool (AT) until desired&#xD;
      reduction of the tricuspid annulus dimension is achieved. Following adjustment, the AT&#xD;
      releases a fastener, securing the ring once optimal annular reduction is achieved.&#xD;
