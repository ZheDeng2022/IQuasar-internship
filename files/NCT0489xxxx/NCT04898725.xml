  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed as a prospective partially randomized patient preference (PRPP)&#xD;
      trial and recruit psychiatric outpatients or inpatients. Participants who agree to receive&#xD;
      randomization will be randomly assigned into a supplementation or placebo group, after&#xD;
      stratification for pre-intervention vitamin D status (12-20 ng/mL or &lt;12 ng/mL) and&#xD;
      depression status (HDRS-17 ≥ 17 or &lt; 17). Participants who decline randomization but agree to&#xD;
      receive follow-up in the observational cohort choose their preferred method (either 4800 IU&#xD;
      vitamin D3 per day, or usual care without supplementation). Severity of depression, any&#xD;
      change of medication, and side effect will be assessed at baseline and at 2-week intervals&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, C-Reactive protein (CRP) and 12 cytokines,&#xD;
      anthropometrical measurements, dietary intake, physical activity and sun exposure will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Additionally, serum levels of 25(OH)D will be&#xD;
      assessed at 4 weeks to ensure its safety level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a partially randomized patient preference (PRPP) trial and recruit&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatients or inpatients. Inclusion criteria are young people aged 10 to 24,&#xD;
      fulfilling the DSM-V criteria of major depressive disorder (MDD) with scores of HDRS-17≥10,&#xD;
      psychotropic medication have been kept unchanged for a month and will remain unchanged during&#xD;
      intervention period, and serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D) levels lower than 20&#xD;
      ng/ml. Exclusion criteria are comorbid with organic mental disorders, alcohol or substance&#xD;
      use disorders, schizophrenia, delusion disorder, bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum&#xD;
      disorder, anorexia nervosa, and IQ less than 70; endocrine disorders including diabetes,&#xD;
      thyroid and parathyroid disorder; serious neurological disorders including epilepsy, severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative conditions; liver disease, kidney disease,&#xD;
      heart disease or other serious health conditions; use drug interfering with vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who agree to receive randomization will be randomly assigned into a&#xD;
      supplementation or placebo group, after stratification for pre-intervention vitamin D status&#xD;
      (12-20 ng/mL or &lt;12 ng/mL) and depression status (HDRS-17 ≥ 17 or &lt; 17). Supplementation arm&#xD;
      will receive oral dose 4800 IU vitamin D3 per day (three soft capsules of 800 IU vitamin D,&#xD;
      twice a day) and placebo arm will receive placebo every day (three soft capsules with&#xD;
      identical appearance, twice a day) for 8 weeks. Both groups continue to receive standard&#xD;
      psychiatric care by child psychiatrists. Randomization and allocation will be concealed from&#xD;
      researchers, participants and treating physicians. Participants who decline randomization but&#xD;
      agree to receive follow-up in the observational cohort choose their preferred method (either&#xD;
      4800 IU vitamin D3 per day, or usual care without supplementation). Severity of depression,&#xD;
      any change of medication, and side effect will be assessed at baseline and at 2-week&#xD;
      intervals for 8 weeks. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, CRP and 12 cytokines, anthropometrical&#xD;
      measurements, dietary intake, physical activity and sun exposure will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and post-intervention. Additionally, serum levels of 25(OH)D will be assessed at 4 weeks to&#xD;
      ensure its safety level.&#xD;
