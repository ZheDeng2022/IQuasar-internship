  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SpA is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory rheumatic disease that affects axial and&#xD;
      peripheral joints, internal organs, and other tissues. Sacroiliitis is a hallmark of axial&#xD;
      SpA. Sacroliliitis has a great effect on spine pain, function and cephalic progression of the&#xD;
      disease . The prevalence of SpA ranged from 9 to 30 per 10,000 persons in Caucasian&#xD;
      populations, Europe or the United States . The management of axial SpA is really challenging.&#xD;
      The traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were ineffective in&#xD;
      controlling the axial disease. Biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±)&#xD;
      inhibitor and anti-interleukin 17 have shown promising results in achieving remission or low&#xD;
      disease activity for axial SpA .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is established as the imaging method of choice for the early&#xD;
      diagnosis and follow-up of SpA patients. Although a positive imaging detection of the axial&#xD;
      skeleton is no longer obligatory based on the new Assessment of Spondyloarthritis&#xD;
      International Society (ASAS) classification criteria 2010, MRI imaging still plays a crucial&#xD;
      role, especially in the early diagnosis arm. MRI has a high sensitivity in detection of acute&#xD;
      inflammatory processes as well as the high-resolution visualization of anatomical&#xD;
      alterations. The lack of radiation exposure makes MRI ideal for monitoring response to&#xD;
      treatment .Bone marrow edema (BME) not only showed high sensitivity for detection of early&#xD;
      sacroilitis, but also its reduction was a worthy indicator for disease remission. Intra&#xD;
      Articular (IA) injections of SIJ with corticosteroids and anesthestics are often performed&#xD;
      for pain relief. Although this technique is relatively old, it was not used on a lrage scale&#xD;
      in axial SpA patients. Further, its effect on disease outcome measures were not well&#xD;
      elucidated. To the best of our knowledge there is no single study have evaluated effect of&#xD;
      steroid and local aneshestic injection on improvement of BME . Image guidance of the SIJ&#xD;
      injection is fundamanetal, due to the complex anatomy of the joint causing a low accuracy&#xD;
      when performed using blind technique .&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blinded, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Aim of the work&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of steroid and anestheisa injection on BME and disease outcome&#xD;
      measures in SIJs of axial SpA patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, single-center, randomized, blind clinical trial. It will be&#xD;
      performed on patients following in the rheumatology and rehabilitation department in Sohag&#xD;
      University Hospitals, Faculty of Medicine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N=60 fulfilling ASAS 2010 criteria for axial SpA, will be divided randomly into 2 groups.&#xD;
      Group 1 the active group will receive triamcinilone 40 mg injection (Kenacort) + 4 ml of .5 %&#xD;
      lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) under ultrasound guidance. Group 2 will receive similar&#xD;
      amount of saline injecteed subcutaneously. Only the patient will be blinded. Particpants will&#xD;
      be initially studied with no certain condition for medications wich will be kept unchanged&#xD;
      during the study. MRI will be done at base line and BME will be considered as an entry&#xD;
      criteria. SPArcc score will be berfoemed at baseline and in the follow-up at 24 weeks&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical out come measures including ASDAS BSADAI and BASMI will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks after SIJ injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pateint &gt;18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients fulfilling ASAS criteria for SpA with a diagnosis confirmed by a&#xD;
           rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients having BME of the SIJ on MRI .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to be followed-up regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient &lt; 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignancy, DM, Hepatitis and active infectious disorders&#xD;
