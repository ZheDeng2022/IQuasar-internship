      This study will test the efficacy of treadmill exercise combined with supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      during exercise and recovery for the treatment of persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
      Participants will be pseudo-randomized (stratified by age) to one of four conditions for 8&#xD;
      treatment sessions: 1) treadmill exercise plus supplemental oxygen, 2) treadmill exercise&#xD;
      plus air, 3) supplemental oxygen only, 4) air only. All participants will then cross-over and&#xD;
      receive 16 additional sessions of treadmill exercise plus supplemental oxygen.&#xD;

      This study will test the efficacy of a COVID-19 specific cardiopulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol for treatment of persistent post-acute COVID symptoms and to study the impact of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary improvement on cognition, mental health, and function. Participants (N=36)&#xD;
      with persistent post-acute COVID symptoms will undergo pre-treatment neurocognitive,&#xD;
      orthostatic tolerance, and exercise tolerance tests before being pseudo-randomized&#xD;
      (stratified by age and sex) to one of four conditions (all of which occur twice a week): 1) 8&#xD;
      sessions of treadmill exercise plus supplemental oxygen, 2) 8 sessions of treadmill exercise&#xD;
      plus air, 3) 8 sessions of supplemental oxygen only, and 4) 8 sessions of air only. The&#xD;
      pre-treatment testing will be repeated, after which all participants will receive 16&#xD;
      additional sessions of treadmill exercise plus supplemental oxygen, followed by&#xD;
      post-treatment testing. All participants will complete baseline measures of physical and&#xD;
      mental health, physical function, emotional wellbeing, and coping. A brief symptom measure&#xD;
      will be collected daily and physical function, mental health, and emotional wellbeing will be&#xD;
      assessed weekly.&#xD;
