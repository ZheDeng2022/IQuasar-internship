    <textblock>
      The currently recruiting randomised controlled trial &quot;Intensive Nutrition Therapy Compared to&#xD;
      Usual Care in Critically Ill Adults&quot; (INTENT, NCT03292237) is the first multi-centre trial to&#xD;
      compare an intensive, individualised nutrition intervention to standard care for the duration&#xD;
      of hospital admission in critically ill patients. INTENT-Muscle, is an observational&#xD;
      longitudinal study nested within INTENT. The aim of INTENT-Muscle is to compare longitudinal&#xD;
      changes in muscle health (assessed by bioimpedance and muscle ultrasound) in critically ill&#xD;
      patients randomised to each arm of INTENT.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Critically ill patients may experience debilitating loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      strength, leading to substantial functional impairments both during and long after&#xD;
      hospitalisation. Little is known about what therapies may attenuate deterioration of muscle&#xD;
      health (muscle mass and muscle quality) in this setting but nutrition is thought to be&#xD;
      important, based on the physiological response to critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently recruiting randomised controlled trial (RCT) &quot;Intensive Nutrition Therapy&#xD;
      Compared to Usual Care in Critically Ill Adults&quot; (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03292237)&#xD;
      is the first multi-centre trial to provide an individualised nutrition intervention for the&#xD;
      duration of hospital admission in critically ill patients. Combining the most promising and&#xD;
      novel bedside techniques for objectively measuring muscle health (bioimpedance technology and&#xD;
      ultrasound) with a whole hospital nutrition intervention has never been done before, and will&#xD;
      provide crucial data to understand the relationship between nutrition delivery and changes in&#xD;
      muscularity from ICU admission to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To explore changes in muscle health in response to an individualised nutrition&#xD;
      intervention and in association with clinical and functional outcomes, using clinically&#xD;
      applicable bedside techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms of INTENT to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare longitudinal changes in bioimpedance variables (fat-free mass, normally hydrated&#xD;
           lean tissue, extracellular/intracellular ratio, and variables from Cole modelling) to&#xD;
           hospital discharge (or day 28)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare longitudinal changes in ultrasound variables (mid-upper arm and quadriceps&#xD;
           muscle thickness, rectus femoris cross-sectional area, and rectus femoris echogenicity)&#xD;
           to hospital discharge (or day 28)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare clinical and functional outcomes in patients identified as having low&#xD;
           muscularity (assessed by ultrasound) at ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the relationship between bioimpedance and ultrasound variables with clinical&#xD;
           and functional outcomes at baseline and over the hospital admission (collected as part&#xD;
           of INTENT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In critically ill patients receiving individualised nutrition care for the&#xD;
      duration of hospital admission (censored at study day 28), declines in phase angle and muscle&#xD;
      health will be attenuated compared to patients receiving standard nutritional care.&#xD;

    <description>In INTENT (the parent study) participants will be randomised to the i) Standard Nutrition or ii) Intensive Nutrition arm. A brief description of each is below.&#xD;
In ICU:&#xD;
After enrolment, patients allocated to the standard nutrition therapy (control) group will commence or continue nutrition via an enteral tube to a target rate according to unit protocol including the use of promotility agents and the placement of nasojejunal feeding tubes if required.&#xD;
Parenteral Nutrition (PN) will only be used if the above methods have been attempted, or an absolute contraindication to enteral nutrition (EN) develops.&#xD;
After ICU:&#xD;
1. Nutrition management will be as per usual site management at that hospital.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Intensive Nutrition Arm</arm_group_label>
    <description>In ICU:&#xD;
Supplemental PN will be commenced within 2 hours of randomisation. The starting dose will be determined by the amount of energy received in the 24 hours prior to randomisation&#xD;
The need for the intervention will be based on the adequacy of nutrition provision and assessed daily until ICU discharge&#xD;
If there is an interruption of EN for greater than 2 hours the PN must be run at 20 kcal/kg calculated body weight until EN is recommenced. After the interruption, EN should be recommenced as per local protocol.&#xD;
After ICU:&#xD;
1. An intensive nutrition intervention will be provided on the ward.&#xD;
The goal of nutrition care across the hospital stay will be to ensure 80-100% of participant's estimated energy requirements are met.</description>
