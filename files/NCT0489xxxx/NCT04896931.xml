    <textblock>
      Permanent, prospective, multicenter registry including all kind of oncological therapy lines&#xD;
      and procedures, clinical outcome, translational research (biobanking) and QoL for all types&#xD;
      of biliary tract cancers. The registry does not define any medical intervention and does not&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy or safety of the treatment decision made by the investigator. Every&#xD;
      adverse event whether related to a treatment or not, will neither be documented in the&#xD;
      trial´s eCRF nor be reported to the leading investigators of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: • To establish a registry with a representative BTC-patient population in&#xD;
      German-speaking Europe (mainly DACH region) for current and future research. The study&#xD;
      registry is not based on a primary endpoint. The data collection includes (among basic&#xD;
      patient-/tumor-/treatment- characteristics) the survey of quality of life (EORTC-C30), a&#xD;
      so-called patient-reported outcome (PRO) and - if available - the collection of tissue&#xD;
      samples for translational accompanying projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To analyse potential risk factors associated with BTC-cancer addressing clinical&#xD;
                and biological predictors of treatment success and survival&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the course of disease and QoL throughout all applied therapy lines for&#xD;
                patients with BTC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure progression-free, disease-free and overall survival in different BTC&#xD;
                sub-groups, mortality and morbidity for perioperative and palliative therapy&#xD;
                procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of the therapy regimens and therapy sequences used across all treatment&#xD;
                lines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular data (Data- and Biobanking):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To establish a sample collection for future molecular/genetic biomarker&#xD;
                characterization to enable for e.g. assessment of the frequency of targetable&#xD;
                mutations and associated therapy decisions or progression analysis in baseline and&#xD;
                follow-up investigations&#xD;
