    <time_frame>Up to approximately 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. as assessed by BICR.</description>

Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.</description>
