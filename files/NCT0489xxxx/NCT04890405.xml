  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to seek a more precise and convenient treatment, we made a self-made precise&#xD;
      transplant capsule that is effective against diarrhea. Compared with standardized fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation transplantation on the treat of diarrhea-type irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome. To observe the similarities and differences of the effect between the two treatment&#xD;
      methods on the disease. and the changes in intestinal bacteria was also observed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to clarify the effectiveness of precision fecal bacteria transplantation, we have&#xD;
      independently developed precision transplantation capsules. Seventy patients with&#xD;
      diarrhea-type irritable bowel syndrome were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups. The&#xD;
      patients in the first group were treated with standard fecal bacteria transplantation once,&#xD;
      and the patients in other group were treated with precision transplantation capsules for 28&#xD;
      days. The clinical symptoms of the patients of the two groups were observed before and 2, 4,&#xD;
      8, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after the treatment, and stool samples were collected for intestinal&#xD;
      flora detection. The purpose is to observe and compare the efficacy of the two treatment&#xD;
      methods and their influence on the intestinal flora.&#xD;
