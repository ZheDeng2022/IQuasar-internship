  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of videogame-like digital therapy on&#xD;
      attentional functioning and symptoms in adolescents ages 13-17 diagnosed with ADHD&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, unblinded/non-controlled study to evaluate objective attention&#xD;
      functioning and ADHD symptoms and impairments in children between adolescents aged 13 to 17&#xD;
      years old, with a diagnosis of ADHD (combined or inattentive subtype), stably on or off ADHD&#xD;
      medication, after 4-weeks of AKL-T01 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 165 total participants from up to 10 sites will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening/baseline (Day 1), participants will undergo screening to evaluate&#xD;
      eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will continue onto baseline procedures in&#xD;
      the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase (Day 2-27) will involve using the digital therapy at home for each&#xD;
      participant. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored remotely during&#xD;
      this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An In-Clinic assessment will be completed on Day 28 to assess key outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA)-Attention Comparison Score (ACS) of sustained and selective attention. Measures at Day 1 and Exit/Post-Treatment Visit Day 28&#xD;
TOVA ACS is a comparison of a subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. ACS is calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
ACS = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + d' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80 where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. ACS tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than 0 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.</description>

    <description>Change in the Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-5 inattention sub-scale and total scale scores. Measures taken at Baseline Visit (Day 1) and Exit/Post-Treatment Visit (Day 28).&#xD;
ADHD Rating Scale-5 is a clinician-administered questionnaire completed by the child's parent. The scale consists of two symptom subscales: Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity. The Inattention subscale raw score is computed by summing the item scores for 9 items. The total score is obtained by adding the Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscale raw scores. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale; Never or Rarely (0), Sometimes (1), Often (2), Very Often (3) with total scores ranging from 0-54. A higher score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.</description>

    <description>The change will be determined in ADHD-Rating Scale 5 Home Version relationship with significant others, peer relationships, academic functioning, behavioral functioning, homework functioning and self-esteem domains.&#xD;
ADHD Rating Scale-5 is a clinician-administered questionnaire completed by the child's parent. The scale asses six domains of impairment that are common among children with ADHD with one question item per domain. The scale is administered twice, once after each set of symptom subscale items (Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale; No Problem (0), Minor Problem (1), Moderate Problem (2), Severe Problem (3). A higher score indicates more severe impairment due to ADHD symptoms and behaviors.</description>
