  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial comparing between two approaches of prescribing&#xD;
      repetition-numbers in resistance training (RT) sessions on psychological, physiological, and&#xD;
      performance outcomes. Sixty healthy and sedentary adults (age range: 18-45) will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either the &quot;predetermined&quot; or &quot;self-selected&quot; groups. The groups will differ in&#xD;
      the amount of choice they will be able to make concerning the resistance of each exercise and&#xD;
      the number of repetitions they complete (see detailed description). Both groups will complete&#xD;
      two sessions per week composed of body weight and resistance band exercises, lasting 45&#xD;
      minutes for eight weeks. The sessions will be delivered live by a certified instructor using&#xD;
      a videoconferencing platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare between the &quot;predetermined&quot; and the &quot;self-selected&quot; repetition prescription&#xD;
      approaches on psychological, physiological, and performance outcomes in a cohort of 60&#xD;
      healthy and sedentary adults (age range: 18-45) over an eight-week period of live,&#xD;
      videoconferencing RT sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the influence of live, videoconferencing group RT sessions on psychological,&#xD;
      physiological, and performance outcomes across groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing trainees with more choices in exercise sessions is an autonomy supportive process&#xD;
      which can lead to a more enjoyable experience, greater adherence to the training program and&#xD;
      preferable performance outcomes. We will compare between two approaches to prescribing&#xD;
      repetition-numbers in resistance training sessions- the &quot;predetermined&quot; and the&#xD;
      &quot;self-selected&quot;, based on the amount of choice trainees receive while training. Sixty healthy&#xD;
      and sedentary adults (age range: 18-45) will train bi-weekly for 45 minutes using resistance&#xD;
      bands in a live, videoconferencing group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last eight weeks and include bi-weekly, 45-minute online sessions&#xD;
      instructed by two alternating experienced instructors. Each session will include an&#xD;
      introduction and setup (5-minutes), warm-up (5-minutes), body-weight and resistance band&#xD;
      exercises (30-minutes) and cool down (5-minutes). We will upload the study protocol to an&#xD;
      external server for more details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will follow the exact same exercise program with one key difference: participants&#xD;
      in the &quot;predetermined&quot; group will be instructed to complete 10 repetitions per set and&#xD;
      exercise, while aiming to reach a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 7/10 by the 10th&#xD;
      repetition. This means that participants will need to select and adjust the resistance of&#xD;
      each exercise (e.g., band's resistance) to achieve this goal. Conversely, in the&#xD;
      &quot;self-selected&quot; group, participants will choose the initial resistance in view of their&#xD;
      preferences, and complete as many repetitions as they wish in order to reach the same target&#xD;
      RPE of 7/10. Note that while the initial resistance, and thus, the number of repetitions is&#xD;
      expected to differ between group, both are matched for perception of effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via social media (i.e., Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA).&#xD;
      Each candidate will be screened for initial eligibility. After screening participants will be&#xD;
      block-randomized to the &quot;predetermined&quot; of the &quot;self-selected&quot; groups, matched for age and&#xD;
      gender. Participants will be blind to their allocation (see concealment section). Prior to&#xD;
      visiting the exercise laboratory at Tel Aviv University for the testing session, participants&#xD;
      will receive written materials regarding the exercise sessions, testing procedures, and the&#xD;
      use of the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (0-10), and a video demonstrating the&#xD;
      implementation of RPE in practice. All participants that are part of a given group will be&#xD;
      required to complete the first testing session within a maximum of one week before the&#xD;
      program begins, and the follow up testing session within a maximum of one week after the&#xD;
      program ends. Practically, one group will begin and end all procedures (i.e., initial&#xD;
      testing, eight-weeks program, follow up testing) one week before the other group. The order&#xD;
      of which group will begin first will be randomly decided by a coin flip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial testing session will include the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fill out the Basic Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body composition analysis (see outcome measures section).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RPE terminology verification based on the videos and written materials delivered in&#xD;
           advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Performance tests (see outcome measures section).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Practice how to use the resistance band (see below) and set up terminology to be used&#xD;
           during the sessions (e.g. &quot;open loop&quot;, &quot;more tension&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      That same order will be kept on the final tests (excluding the informed consent), which will&#xD;
      also be conducted at the same place, at the same hour-window, and by the same experimenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one elastic band (NT loops, purchased from:&#xD;
      (https://www.ntloop.com/shop/) as they are affordable, accessible and allow exercising in a&#xD;
      controlled, safe manner. When practicing with an elastic band, changing grip width, or rubber&#xD;
      stiffness allows the trainee to achieve greater or lesser resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videoconferencing platform:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT sessions will be delivered using &quot;Zoom video communications&quot; (San-Jose, CA, USA) due to&#xD;
      its popularity and user-friendly interface. Additionally, a WhatsApp group chat (Facebook&#xD;
      Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) will be created for each group to deliver updates and reminders. A&#xD;
      technical assistant from the research team will be available during the live broadcast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size is based on our recruitment abilities and resources and based on our&#xD;
      previous experience with this type of intervention. A sample size of 30 participants per&#xD;
      group is considered large in exercise science research with both statistically and&#xD;
      practically significant effects often detected. We also expect for future meta-analyses to&#xD;
      take place and for this work to be included. Thus, even if this study is currently&#xD;
      under-powered for small effects, it may add valuable data to the field of exercise science.&#xD;
