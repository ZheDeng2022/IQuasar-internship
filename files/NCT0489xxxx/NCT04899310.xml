  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of mRNA-3705 in participants with isolated elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA)&#xD;
      due to methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MUT) deficiency. The main goal of the study is&#xD;
      to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of mRNA-3705.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study comprises 2 stages; a Dose Optimization Stage followed by an optional Dose&#xD;
      Expansion Stage. The study is designed to evaluate multiple doses and dosing intervals of&#xD;
      mRNA-3705.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both stages, after confirmation of eligibility, participants will enter an Observation&#xD;
      Period (48 to 72 hours pre-dose), which includes 24 hours inpatient hospital stay, followed&#xD;
      by a Treatment Period (up to 40 weeks). After completion of the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      participants will either transition into an Extension Study or enter a 2-year Follow-up&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a body weight of â‰¥11.0 kilograms (kg) at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a diagnosis of isolated MMA due to MUT deficiency confirmed by&#xD;
             molecular genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a serum/plasma vitamin B12 level equal to or above the lower limit of&#xD;
             normal (based on laboratory reference range) confirmed in the Screening Period. For&#xD;
             those participants found to have an elevated serum/plasma vitamin B12 level, the&#xD;
             participant may enter if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the cause of the&#xD;
             elevation is secondary to B12 supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant or his/her legally authorized representative is willing and able to&#xD;
             provide informed consent and/or assent as mandated by local regulations and willing&#xD;
             and able to comply with study-related assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential and sexually active males of&#xD;
             reproductive potential agree to use a highly-effective method of contraception during&#xD;
             the study and for 3 months after the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a diagnosis of isolated MMA cb1A, cb1B, or cb1D enzymatic subtypes or&#xD;
             methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency or combined MMA with homocystinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has previously received gene therapy for the treatment of MMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has any clinically significant medical condition or medical history that,&#xD;
             in the Investigator's opinion, could interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results or limit the participant's participation in the study.&#xD;
