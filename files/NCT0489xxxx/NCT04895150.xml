    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to evaluate upper extremity exercise capacity and muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The secondary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength, balance, physical activity level and quality of life in patients with primary&#xD;
      ciliary dyskinesia and compare all parameters with healthy controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic, heterogeneous disease caused by cilia absence&#xD;
      or dysfunction. Impaired function of motile cilia leads to impaired mucociliary clearance,&#xD;
      recurrent chest infections, and progressive destruction of the lung structure. Clinical&#xD;
      features include neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, chronic daily productive cough,&#xD;
      chronic nasal congestion, and chronic or recurrent otitis media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength, physical activity level and quality of life were affected in patients. The&#xD;
      number of studies on these subjects is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function and extremity muscle strength are determinants of exercise capacity in&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Decreased strength and endurance in the limb muscles&#xD;
      is associated with exercise intolerance. Patients have decreased upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength. There is no study in the literature evaluating upper extremity exercise capacity in&#xD;
      patients with PCD. Measuring the oxygen saturation of cardiorespiratory and peripheral&#xD;
      muscles is important for understanding the dynamics of oxygen delivery and consumption during&#xD;
      exercise. There are no studies in the literature evaluating muscle oxygenation in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to evaluate upper extremity exercise capacity and muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The secondary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength, balance, physical activity level and quality of life in patients with primary&#xD;
      ciliary dyskinesia and compare them with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was planned cross-sectional. Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia referred to&#xD;
      the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Gazi University Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Department by the physicians of the Department of Pediatric Pulmonary Diseases of Gazi&#xD;
      University Faculty of Medicine will be included in the study. At least 18 patients with&#xD;
      primary ciliary dyskinesia and at least 18 healthy controls of similar age and sex will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the study. The assessments will be completed in two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper extremity exercise capacity (6 minutes Pegboard and Ring Test), muscle oxygenation&#xD;
      (&quot;Moxy&quot; monitor), functional exercise capacity(6 minutes walk test), respiratory functions&#xD;
      (spirometer), respiratory muscle strength (mouth pressure measurement), respiratory muscle&#xD;
      endurance (incremental threshold loading test), peripheral muscle strength (dynamometer),&#xD;
      balance(&quot;Biodex Balance System®&quot; and Y balance test), physical activity level (multi-sensor&#xD;
      activity monitor) and quality of life (Quality of Life scale for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia&#xD;
      (QOL-PCD scale version 4.3) will be evaluated.&#xD;
