  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double masked, randomized, placebo controlled, single and multiple oral dose&#xD;
      study conducted in 3 parts. The safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending oral&#xD;
      doses of QA102 in healthy young and older adult subjects will be evaluated. The study will&#xD;
      also characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of QA102 in plasma and urine after single&#xD;
      and multiple oral doses of QA102. Besides, the metabolite profile of QA102 will also be&#xD;
      characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will comprise a single dose, sequential cohort design. Part 2 will comprise a multiple&#xD;
      dose, sequential cohort study. Part 3 will comprise a multiple dose, single cohort study in&#xD;
      older subjects.&#xD;
