  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 immune checkpoint signaling&#xD;
      pathway are already approved in the treatment of various tumor entities in relapsed or&#xD;
      metastatic stages. Different exploratory trials suggest that the combination of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is highly effective, especially in oligometastatic stages and if&#xD;
      all lesions are treated with ablative radiotherapy. In addition, the role of predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers is becoming increasingly important for future therapy algorithms. First data, also&#xD;
      from our group, indicate clearly that dynamic changes of immune cells and their activation&#xD;
      markers in the peripheral blood (immune matrix) can be used as predictive biomarkers. During&#xD;
      the planned STICI-02 trial predictive immune matrix derived from the STICI01 trial&#xD;
      (NCT03453892) will be validated in the groups of patient suffering from HNSCC (palliative),&#xD;
      NSCLC (separately palliative and adjuvant) and &quot;other solid tumors&quot; (including in particular&#xD;
      esophageal carcinomas, urothelial and renal carcinomas, small cell bronchial carcinomas and&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinomas of the skin [depending on the current drug approval]). Within the&#xD;
      framework of scientific accompanying projects, the predictive value of markers in tumor&#xD;
      tissue and of pattern radiomics analyses will be analyzed accompanying the immunophenotyping&#xD;
      in peripheral blood. The side effects&#xD;
