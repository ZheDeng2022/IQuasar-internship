  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of the study is to determine the change in immune responses in people&#xD;
      with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) after vaccination. PASC is a&#xD;
      disabling, heterogeneous condition in which people have persistent or emerging symptoms&#xD;
      months after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, (the virus that causes coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019, or COVID-19. Specifically, the purpose is to enroll participants suffering from&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe PASC prior to vaccination and to measure participants' immune and symptom&#xD;
      profiles both before and after vaccination. This study is primarily descriptive.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting an observational study within Connecticut of adults who have&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe PASC and who are planning to receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The&#xD;
      study seeks primarily to describe the heterogeneity in symptoms and immune profile among&#xD;
      people with PASC, and once participants have been vaccinated, to determine changes in&#xD;
      clinical and immune responses to vaccination and whether there is an association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broadly, the study will include 4 surveys to monitor participants' symptom profile and&#xD;
      experience with COVID-19 as well as 3 separate biospecimen collection appointments. The&#xD;
      surveys and study enrollment will be conducted through REDCap at Yale, a platform that is&#xD;
      designed to securely collect survey data from people in a user-friendly design setting. The&#xD;
      biospecimen collection will occur at 2 Yale New Haven Health blood draw sites. The&#xD;
      biospecimen collection will occur as follows: the first will occur as soon as a participant&#xD;
      is enrolled, the second will occur 6 weeks after the participant receives the first dose of a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine, and the third will occur 12 weeks after the participant receives the first&#xD;
      dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants will be asked to provide 45ccs of blood and a saliva&#xD;
      sample (up to 5 mL) for each biospecimen collection. Participants will be able to give a&#xD;
      blood sample within a 2-week window (e.g. the collection may be within 5-7 weeks after the&#xD;
      participant's first COVID-19 vaccine dose). The survey collection will occur as follows: the&#xD;
      first will occur as soon as the participant is enrolled, the second will occur 2 weeks after&#xD;
      the participant receives the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the third will occur 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the participant receives the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and the fourth will&#xD;
      occur 12 weeks after the participant receives the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Survey&#xD;
      links and reminders will be sent by the Yale research team through REDCap at Yale (via text&#xD;
      and/or email) and specimen collection scheduling will be coordinated between the Yale&#xD;
      research team and the Yale New Haven Health draw sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruitment efforts will be coordinated with YCCI, according to YCCI standards. The&#xD;
      investigators will also distribute a study flyer at local Long Covid health clinics and on&#xD;
      social media, including Twitter and Facebook. In addition to recruitment efforts at Yale, the&#xD;
      investigators' patient partners, Survivor Corps, will be publicizing the study by sharing the&#xD;
      study information and eligibility requirements on social media including Facebook and&#xD;
      Twitter. Survivor Corps's recruitment efforts will not be coordinated by the Yale research&#xD;
      team. There will be a study landing page where potential participants can find information&#xD;
      about the study and the study link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be provided a link for the study enrollment as well as an email&#xD;
      address (covidrecovery@yale.edu) to reach out for more information about the study. The study&#xD;
      enrollment process will take place on REDCap at Yale and by phone. Participants will complete&#xD;
      a brief screening questionnaire to determine study eligibility and to provide an email&#xD;
      address and/or phone number. Study coordinators will then reach out, by email to schedule a&#xD;
      phone consultation, or directly by phone, as is the participant's preference. During the&#xD;
      phone consultation, a study coordinator will read a script designed to inform the participant&#xD;
      of the study design and risks to ensure that the participant understands the study prior to&#xD;
      consent. The participant will also be asked if the participant has any questions for the&#xD;
      study coordinator. Once the phone consultation is complete, the study coordinator will email&#xD;
      the participant a link to the e-consent, which will be a REDCap form. Once the participant&#xD;
      consents to the study, which will require an e-signature, a study coordinator will sign a&#xD;
      REDCap form to acknowledge that the e-consent is complete. An email will automatically be&#xD;
      sent to the participant containing the (REDCap) link for the first survey and information as&#xD;
      to how to provide the first biospecimen sample. The research team will also contact the&#xD;
      participant within the next 2-3 days by phone to provide information regarding the timing and&#xD;
      location for biospecimen collection and to answer any questions the participant has.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood and saliva samples 3 times at any of the study's 2 Yale New&#xD;
      Haven Health blood draw sites. While all specimen collection will occur in Connecticut at&#xD;
      these sites, people who are not currently patients within the Yale New Haven Health system&#xD;
      will still be eligible to participate in the study, so long as the participant is willing and&#xD;
      able to travel to one of the blood draw sites 3 times. The Yale study consent will include&#xD;
      consenting to providing blood and saliva samples 3 times at a Yale New Haven Health site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will foster a community spirit with participants, producing a collaboration&#xD;
      based on relationships, not merely transactions. The Survivor Corps group has joined this&#xD;
      effort and will ensure that the study includes the participant perspective and abide by the&#xD;
      study's principles. Survivor Corps is an independent group of people who experienced&#xD;
      long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seek to generate knowledge about people with&#xD;
      prolonged recoveries. The Patient-Led Research Collaborative has also joined this effort to&#xD;
      provide a PASC participant perspective on the study's participant-facing communication and&#xD;
      surveys. Patient-Led Research is also an independent group of people who experienced&#xD;
      long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seek to generate knowledge about people with&#xD;
      prolonged recoveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize REDCap at Yale to screen for eligibility, conduct e-consent, and to&#xD;
      collect survey information. The data will reside within the secure platform and will be&#xD;
      transferred to Yale via a secure file transfer service. The data will then reside on secure&#xD;
      servers at Yale.&#xD;
