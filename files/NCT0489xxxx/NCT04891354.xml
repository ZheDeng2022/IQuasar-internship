  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PDNO in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
      In addition, the exposure of 1,2 propanediol (PD) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: single ascending dose (SAD), 7 cohorts, 30 minutes intravenous (iv) infusion of&#xD;
      placebo followed by 1 hour iv infusion of PDNO to assess safety, tolerability and PD exposure&#xD;
      in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: ascending doses of PDNO in 2 cohorts, 30 minutes iv infusion of placebo followed by&#xD;
      3 ascending doses of PDNO in cohort 1 and 3 ascending doses of PDNO in cohort 2. The first 2&#xD;
      doses in each cohort will be iv infused for 30 minutes whereas the last will be iv infused&#xD;
      for 3 hours to assess safety, tolerability and PD exposure in healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If indicated by emerging data and recommended by the internal safety review committee (iSRC),&#xD;
      2 additional dose groups/cohorts (4+4 subjects) may be added to Part I and 1 dose&#xD;
      group/cohort (4 subjects) may be added to Part II.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I In Part I of the study, 4 subjects per cohort will first receive a 30 minutes iv&#xD;
      infusion of placebo followed by a 1 hour iv infusion of PDNO in parallel with a continuous&#xD;
      infusion of a sodium bicarbonate carrier buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 7 sequential cohorts with the following tentative dose levels are planned: 0.3,&#xD;
      1.0, 3.0, 10, 30, 60 and 120 nmol/kg/min. Up to 2 additional dose levels can be explored,&#xD;
      tentatively 180 and 240 nmol/kg/min. Lower, intermediate doses (e.g. 90 nmol/kg/min) or&#xD;
      repeated doses may also be given, based on the safety and tolerability of the drug if&#xD;
      recommended by the iSRC. The maximum dose in the study will not exceed 240&#xD;
      nmol/kg/min.Subjects will come for 4 visits to the clinic. Screening (Visit 1) will take&#xD;
      place from Day -28 to Day -1 and will include the subjects' signing of the informed consent&#xD;
      and an eligibility check. At Visit 2, subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1 for&#xD;
      pre-dose assessments. The subjects will be carefully monitored by clinical staff during and&#xD;
      after infusion. Vital signs (including pulse oximetry) and ECG will be checked at regular&#xD;
      intervals. During the infusion, blood pressure will be continuously controlled via&#xD;
      intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cohorts, safety, tolerability and PD exposure will be assessed before, during and&#xD;
      after the PDNO iv infusion. FeNO monitoring will be also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II Part II of the study will explore ascending doses of PDNO in 2 cohorts. In each&#xD;
      cohort, 4 subjects will first receive a 30 minutes iv infusion of placebo followed by iv&#xD;
      infusions of PDNO in 3 ascending doses in parallel with a continuous infusion of a sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate carrier buffer. Each of the first 2 dose levels in each cohort will be iv infused&#xD;
      for 30 minutes whereas the highest dose level will be iv infused for 3 hours. To avoid any&#xD;
      potential rebound effect, there will be no stabilisation period between either dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels are: 1, 3 and 10 nmol/kg/min in cohort 1 and 30, 60 and 120&#xD;
      nmol/kg/min in cohort 2. The actual doses given in Part II will be based on emerging&#xD;
      knowledge of safety and tolerability of PDNO observed in Part I of the study. The maximum&#xD;
      dose in Part II will not exceed the highest dose given in Part I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One additional cohort with additional doses or dosing schemes to establish the target dose&#xD;
      for subsequent studies can be explored based on the safety and tolerability of the drug if&#xD;
      recommended by the iSRC.&#xD;

Between the end of placebo infusion and prior to the start of PDNO infusion, there will be a 20 minutes stabilisation period with infusion of sodium bicarbonate buffer only.&#xD;
In Part II, each subject will receive a 30 minutes iv infusion of placebo followed by 2 x 30 minutes infusion of PDNO at 2 ascending dose levels and one 3 hour infusion of PDNO at a third dose level.</intervention_model_description>
