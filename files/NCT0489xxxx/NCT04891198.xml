      An open, single-arm, multi-center Phase II clinical study of ENVAFOLIMAB single-agent&#xD;
      treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors,to compare the overall response rate of&#xD;
      TMB-high and TMB-Low,to determine the cut off value between TMB-high and TMB-Low of diagnosis&#xD;
      device.Then,observe the efficacy of ENVAFOLIMAB uesd comfirmed TMB-H Value&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The enrolled subjects will receive envafolimab treatment during the treatment phase, and the&#xD;
      dosage and usage is 400 mg envafolimab subcutaneously injected every four weeks, 28 days as a&#xD;
      treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment continued to reach the standard of stopping treatment. During this&#xD;
      period, the efficacy, safety and PK will be evaluated according to the visit process.In this&#xD;
      study, imaging examinations (CT or MRI) were used to evaluate the efficacy at baseline and&#xD;
      during the study period. The results of the examination were evaluated based on the efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST1.1) and irRECIST criteria.&#xD;

             within 4 weeks before the first study drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Suffered from other known malignant tumors within 2 years before enrollment (except&#xD;
             for treated skin basal cell carcinoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma and/or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ after radical resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Symptomatic brain metastasis or spinal cord compression; for patients with brain&#xD;
             metastases who have previously received treatment, if the clinical and imaging&#xD;
             evidence does not indicate disease progression within 4 weeks before the first study&#xD;
             drug treatment, and 2 weeks before the first administration There is no need to&#xD;
             receive corticosteroid treatment and can be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
