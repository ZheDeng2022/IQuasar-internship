    <description>Manufacturer: Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. This product is a sirolimus drug eluting balloon catheter for coronary artery therapy. It is a rapidly exchangeable PTCA balloon catheter (RX), effective length is 140cm, and compatible with 0.014 in. (0.36mm) guide wire. The balloon at the distal end of the catheter was coated with sirolimus, an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory drug.</description>
