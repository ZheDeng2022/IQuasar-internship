  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greatest challenge in our ageing society are cardiovascular diseases such as stroke,&#xD;
      heart attack, peripheral artery disease of the legs with non-healing wounds (ulcers), or&#xD;
      diabetes. How healthy ageing affects the smallest blood vessels (microcirculation) and is not&#xD;
      well understood. One reason for this is that no generally available medical instrument has&#xD;
      the resolution to study the microcirculation. The recently developed optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography angiography (OCTA), currently mainly used by eye doctors, is able to visualise the&#xD;
      microcirculation. We have developed an automated software (OCTAVA) to determine metrics to&#xD;
      characterise the microcirculation on the layers of density, diameter and tortuosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study we aim at providing reference values of these metrics in hands and feet&#xD;
      of healthy people according to age together with macrovascular function in arms and legs.&#xD;
