  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase 1b study designed to determine a tolerable dose of&#xD;
      CX-5461 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 28-day cycle in patients with&#xD;
      selected solid tumours and associated mutations for future Phase II trials. The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CX-5461, preliminary evidence of antitumor effect and the effect of CX-5461&#xD;
      on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will also be evaluated. The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the predictive value of mutational signatures and explore the significance of&#xD;
      dynamic changes in ctDNA levels and plasma DNA methylome profiling in this study's&#xD;
      exploratory cohort.&#xD;

      CX-5461 (Pidnarulex), a synthetically-derived small molecule that selectively kills&#xD;
      HR-deficient cancer cells through the binding and stabilization of G4 DNA structure. Early&#xD;
      phase 1 studies suggest CX-5461 has activity and warrants further investigation in&#xD;
      HR-deficient tumors. This study aims to determine the tolerable dose of CX-5461 for phase II&#xD;
      studies, amongst an expansion cohorts of BRCA1/2, PALB2 or HRD mutant tumors.&#xD;

Exploratory cohort: women with ovarian cancer and pathogenic/likely pathogenic BRCA1 and/or other HRD-associated mutation.&#xD;
An initial 16 eligible patients for the main cohort and 10 eligible patients for the exploratory cohort will be enrolled to receive CX-5461 at 250mg/m2, delivered as a 60-minute IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 28-day cycle. Upon completion of enrollment of all patients in the initial arms, if there are no safety concerns after review of the safety data, another two arms will open to enroll an additional 16 patients for the main cohort and 10 patients for the exploratory cohort to receive CX-5461 at 325mg/m2, delivered as a 60-minute IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 28-day cycle.</intervention_model_description>

             contraception (ie: condoms with spermicide, hormonal methods such as oral&#xD;
             contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices&#xD;
             (IUDs), non-hormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy,&#xD;
             complete abstinence) within 14 days prior to registration, and agree to continue using&#xD;
             such precautions while on treatment with CX-5461 (including dose interruptions) and&#xD;

             evidence of stable brain metastases are eligible provided that they are asymptomatic&#xD;
             and either do not require corticosteroids or have been treated with corticosteroids,&#xD;
             with clinical and radiological evidence of stabilization at least 10 days after&#xD;
             discontinuation of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, neurological, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal disease or psychiatric illness/social situations, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;

             hepatitis B or C). Note: Patients with a prior history of treated HBV infection who&#xD;
             are antigen-negative or patients with a prior history of treated HCV infection who are&#xD;
             HCV RNA-undetectable may be enrolled. Patients who are known to be serologically&#xD;
             positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can enroll if their CD4+ T-cell (CD4+)&#xD;
             counts ≥ 350 cells/uL.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. No concurrent systemic anti-cancer therapy, biological therapy or other novel agent is&#xD;
             to be permitted. Palliative radiotherapy may be allowed. If radiotherapy is required&#xD;
             due to disease progression, patient will be considered off study. If radiotherapy is&#xD;
             be used to treat non-target lesions and patients may benefit from continuing on study&#xD;
             treatment, CX-5461 may re-commence 14 days after completion of radiotherapy. Any&#xD;
             continuation on study treatment must be discussed with and approved by study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients may be potentially eligible where the current tissue diagnosis is confirmed&#xD;
             histologically from biopsy of a target lesion, and the patient has had no evidence of&#xD;
             active second malignancy which requires treatment or would confound interpretation of&#xD;
             safety, tolerability and efficacy of CX-5461. These cases must be discussed with the&#xD;
             medical monitor prior to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of known photosensitivity disorders (xeroderma pigmentosa, porphyria etc.).&#xD;
             Strict adherence to protocol-defined sun-protection measures is essential for the&#xD;

         13. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who have a positive COVID-19 test within 14 days of starting study treatment.&#xD;
             Patients that test positive can re-test after the 14-day exclusion and may be eligible&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Has had radiotherapy with a limited field for palliation within 1 week of the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than&#xD;
             30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation, which must be completed at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
