  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators tried to find a useful and safe way of training for the elderly&#xD;
      population which can help this population to improve their fitness factors as fast as&#xD;
      possible. investigators have tried to see if different intensity training has different&#xD;
      effects on muscle strength and functional mobility of elderly women in different time points&#xD;
      (4, 8, and 12 weeks). Investigators hypothesized that Higher intensity would be more&#xD;
      effective to improve muscle strength and functional mobility at different time points. The&#xD;
      participants were trained twice per week and each session contain 4 exercises ( leg press,&#xD;
      leg extension, leg curl, and seated calf raises) and the data have been collected at the&#xD;
      pre-test and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention.&#xD;
