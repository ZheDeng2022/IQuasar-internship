      Dry mouth of postoperative makes the patient feel thirst, and the pain of the lips is&#xD;
      cracked. It will also make the sputum thick and sticky, making it difficult for the patient&#xD;
      to cough by himself. Especially the elderly may have sputum accumulation and pneumonia. Dry&#xD;
      mouth can easily change the pH value in the mouth, destroy the environment in the mouth, and&#xD;
      increase the chance of oral mucosal lesions, ulcers and infections. The physical discomfort&#xD;
      can lead to psychological effects such as anxiety, irritability, and irritability. The&#xD;
      incidence of dry mouth was 88%, 6-8 hours after abdominal surgery. Although the incidence is&#xD;
      high, compared with other complications after surgery (such as: pain, bleeding, etc.), dry&#xD;
      mouth after surgery is less important, and is underestimated, unmeasured, unrecorded and&#xD;
      untreated. Initiating the motivation of this study, it is hoped that through research to&#xD;
      understand the relevant factors causing dry mouth after surgery, and using transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to improve the symptoms of dry mouth after surgery. The&#xD;
      first phase is to describe the relevant studies with the aim of understanding the relevant&#xD;
      factors that contribute to dry mouth after surgery. This study will understand and pay&#xD;
      attention to the post-operative dry mouth. It is hoped that through this study, the problem&#xD;
      of dry mouth after surgery will be improved, and the comfort of the recovery period after&#xD;
      surgery will be improved, so that patients can get better care and promote the quality of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      Introduction A postoperative thirst is one of the major complaints in the recovery room. The&#xD;
      purpose of this experimental study was to compare the efficiency of reducing postoperative&#xD;
      thirst by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Surgical patients under general anesthesia were recruited from a medical center. Each&#xD;
      patient was randomly assigned to the experimental group (TENS) or control group (routine&#xD;
      care). Experimental group had 53 patients and control group had 52 patients fitted in the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed data collection. The intensity of thirst was&#xD;
      measured pretreatment, immediately after treatment and 30 minutes after treatment. All data&#xD;
      were managed by SPSS for Windows (version 21.0). Descriptive and inferential statistics&#xD;
      (Chi-square test, t-test, generalized estimating equation regression analysis) were performed&#xD;
      to identify the relationships that were proposed.&#xD;
