  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, prospective, multi-center study aims to provide short- and long-&#xD;
      term treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety of secukinumab in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (with and without PsA) initiating treatment of&#xD;
      secukinumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be followed up for 52 weeks no matter they adhere to secukinumab or they&#xD;
      have shifted to other treatment plans. Data will be collected in conjunction with routine&#xD;
      care visits, most likely happen at week 0, 4, 12, 16, 24, 36, 52. No extra study visits,&#xD;
      examinations, laboratory tests or procedures will be mandated. If visits happen at other time&#xD;
      points (not within the window period), then they will be counted as unscheduled visits.&#xD;

    <description>The total BSA affected by plaque-type psoriasis will be estimated from the percentages of areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs.&#xD;
The following calculations will be done: each reported percentage will be multiplied by its respective body region corresponding factor (head = 0.1, trunk = 0.3, upper limbs = 0.2, lower limbs = 0.4). The resulting four percentages will be added up to estimate the total BSA affected by psoriasis.</description>

    <description>DLQI is a 10-item general dermatology disability index designed to assess HRQoL in adult patients with skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acne and viral warts. The measure is self-administered and includes domains of daily activities, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment and work/school.&#xD;
Each item has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is also a valid response and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of the 10 questions.&#xD;
Scores range from 0 to 30 and higher scores indicate greater HRQoL impairment. Additionally, each subscale of the DLQI may be analyzed separately.</description>
