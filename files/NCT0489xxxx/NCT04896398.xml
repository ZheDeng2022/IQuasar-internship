      50 patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in this prospective, randomized&#xD;
      and controlled study. Demographic information of the patients will be taken and recorded.&#xD;
      After the patients are numbered according to the order of application, they will be divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups as study and control groups according to randomization with the computer&#xD;
      program. A total of 5 sessions of ESWT (1000 shock, 1.6 bar, 5 Hz) will be applied to the&#xD;
      study group (1st group) for 2 weeks. Patients will be taught median nerve and tendon shifting&#xD;
      exercises and will be asked to do it regularly. Patients in the control group (Group 2) will&#xD;
      be asked to perform median nerve and tendon shifting exercises only for the wrist. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated before treatment, at 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. In the evaluation,&#xD;
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Inquiry Form, pain severity assessment with VAS (visual analog scale),&#xD;
      neuropathic pain intensity with LANSS scale and median nerve conduction velocity with EMG&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical picture that occurs with a group of symptoms and signs&#xD;
      as a result of compression and compression in the carpal tunnel where the median nerve passes&#xD;
      to the wrist. Another name is hand-wrist canal disease, the most common entrapment is&#xD;
      neuropathy. It is generally observed in individuals between the ages of 40-60, its prevalence&#xD;
      is 4-5%, and it is 3 times more common in women than men. Clinical signs 1.-2.-3. numbness,&#xD;
      tingling, abduction and positioning of the thumb, pain in the wrist and inner part of the&#xD;
      hand, autonomic symptoms (heat or discoloration, dry skin) worsening of symptoms due to&#xD;
      provocative factors (forcing the wrist to flex). Loss of strength and atrophy of the palm&#xD;
      muscles occur in the later stages. The diagnosis is made by clinical examination,&#xD;
      electrophysiological methods (EMG) and imaging methods (such as ultrasound, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging). Clinical examination consists of sensory motor examination and&#xD;
      provocative tests. Treatment is divided into conservative and surgical. Among the&#xD;
      conservative treatment methods, splinting, exercise (sliding movements of the median nerve&#xD;
      and wrist flexor tendons in the wrist), local corticosteroid injection (corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection into the carpal tunnel), ultrasound (warming the deep tissues with sound energy),&#xD;
      TENS (electrodes placed on the skin). pain relief by applying controlled low-voltage electric&#xD;
      current to the nervous system through the skin), paraffin bath (immersion of the hand in a&#xD;
      pool of heat-melted paraffin), ergonomic arrangements. ESWT is a widely used treatment method&#xD;
      in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in recent years. ESWT is called &quot;Extracorporeal&#xD;
      Shock Wave Therapy&quot;, in Turkish &quot;Shock Wave Therapy Applied Outside the Body&quot; or simply&#xD;
      &quot;Shock Wave Therapy&quot;. It is a treatment method based on the principle of focusing the shock&#xD;
      (pressure) waves created outside the body to the desired area of the body by means of a&#xD;
      steel-headed applicator. Shock waves are single pulsatile acoustic waves of high amplitude.&#xD;
      It reaches high pressure (100Mpa) and then negative pressure (5-10 Mpa) in a short time&#xD;
      expressed in nanoseconds (10 ns). This device was first applied in the destruction of urinary&#xD;
      stones in the 1980s. In the following years, it has been used in cases such as shoulder&#xD;
      calcific tendinitis, lateral epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, and fracture healing.&#xD;
      Currently indications for ESWT are non-union fractures, revision arthroplasties, lateral&#xD;
      epicondylitis, plantar fascitis, calcified tendinitis of the shoulder, avascular necrosis of&#xD;
      the femoral head, Achilles tendinitis, patellar tendinitis, myofascial pain syndrome,&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, peyronia disease, chronic diabetic heart disease. It covers a wide&#xD;
      range of disease groups such as ulcers, knee osteoarthritis, complex regional pain syndrome,&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome. Studies have shown that ESWT increases angiogenesis,&#xD;
      neovascularization, anti-inflammatory growth factor release, progenitor and stem cell&#xD;
      activation. Morphological changes were detected in cutaneous sensory nerve fibers with shock&#xD;
      wave application on the nerves. It has been observed that there is a relationship between&#xD;
      reduction of PGP 9.5 (protein gene product) and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) and&#xD;
      pain reduction following shock application in sensory nerve fibers in the epidermal region.&#xD;
      At the same time, integrin molecules are secreted for axonal growth with shock application&#xD;
      and this continues cumulatively with ESWT application. GAP 43 (growth associated&#xD;
      phosphoprotein) molecule, which is a marker related to axonal regeneration and which is&#xD;
      highly expressed especially during neuron development and axonal 3/10 elongation, has been&#xD;
      found to increase after ESWT application. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ESWT treatment applied to patients diagnosed with mild to moderate carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome by EMG.&#xD;
