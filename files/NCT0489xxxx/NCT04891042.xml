      The dates between February 2021 to December 2021 , primiparous (primigravida) and multiparous&#xD;
      (multigravida) patients who were hospitalized for delivery between 32 and 41 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation and who haven't received cesarean in their previous delivery will be included in&#xD;
      the study in Zeynep Kamil Training and Research Hospital Hynecology and Obstetrics Clinic.&#xD;
      These patients who will have indication for primary cesarean section will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups as latent and active phase according to cervical opening and effacement.During&#xD;
      cesarean section , tue uterine lower segment transverse incision will be continuously sutured&#xD;
      with 1.0 vicryl( with no interlocking). Also the visceral peritoneum of the vesicle-uterine&#xD;
      cavity will be sutured with 2.0 vicryl, This closure technique is to provide hemostasis in&#xD;
      the incision. Also additional single interrupted sutures will be recorded(on the each side&#xD;
      and /or in the middle of incision).Also If additional surgical interventions such as vessel&#xD;
      ligation, uterine artery compression sutures ( such as B-Lynch) will be performed during the&#xD;
      surgery, the will be recorded.In this study, If the patients with gestational age below 32,&#xD;
      confirmed placenta previa or invasion anomaly and a history of previous cesarean section will&#xD;
      not be included.All patient's age, gravid , parity, height, weight, gestational week, smoking&#xD;
      history, chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstetric history such as&#xD;
      oligo-polihidroamnios, abortus imminent,etc previous abdominal surgeries, drug use, use of&#xD;
      dinoprost(process) for cervical effacement, cervical Foley catheter use, use of oxytocin,&#xD;
      duration of labor, presence of early membrane rupture, time interval from the beginning of&#xD;
      rupture membrane, presentation, indication for cesarean section, cervikal dilatation and&#xD;
      effacement just before the cesarean section, duration of the operation, use of additional&#xD;
      uterotonics during the surgery, additional sutures for hemostasis, presence of atony,&#xD;
      additional surgical interventions( uterine artery and hypogastric artery ligation, uterine&#xD;
      compression sutures), birth weight, preoperative and post hemogram, hematocrit, white blood&#xD;
      cell count, platelet count, blood transfusion if it was given, discharge time, and&#xD;
      endometriosis will be recorded. Patients will be called for control examination in the third(&#xD;
      3rd) month after operation. And patients will be asked about clinical findings such as&#xD;
      prolonged menstrual bleeding, midsiklus bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain. At the same time&#xD;
      the presence of isthmuses, the depth and the shape of the istmosel pocket and the myometrial&#xD;
      thickness will be measured and recorded with transvaginal ultrasound. Thus, the importance of&#xD;
      isthmocele formation on patients who had caeserean section either on latent phase or active&#xD;
      phase of labor will be investigated . In addition , other risk factors leading to isthmocele&#xD;
      formation will be investigated.&#xD;
