  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients after kidney transplantation who develop donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are at high&#xD;
      risk for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) levels&#xD;
      have been shown to be increased in patients with active or chronic active ABMR. This study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate if repeated analysis of dd-cfDNA in patients with DSA and kidney allograft&#xD;
      biopsy which is triggered by increased levels of dd-cfDNA can lead to early diagnosis of&#xD;
      active or chronic active ABMR among these patients.&#xD;
