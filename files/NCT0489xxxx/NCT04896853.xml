  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that the systemic delivery of Wharton's Jelly (WJ)-Umbilical&#xD;
      Cord (UC) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC), WJ-MSCs exerts an anti-inflammatory action and&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic effect in the lung of COVID-19 patients. The nature of these cells to&#xD;
      immunomodulate both tissue resident and bloodborne immune cells towards a more&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic profile, results in a reduction of tissue-based&#xD;
      inflammation within the lung and triggering of repair responses. This clinically culminates&#xD;
      in a beneficial action on patients with respiratory complications associated with coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by reverse-transcription&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in any specimen prior to inclusion.&#xD;

             invasive mechanical ventilation nor ECMO&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception or acceptable birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
        inhibition of ovulation 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  oral&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intravaginal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  transdermal, progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  oral&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  injectable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  implantable 2; intrauterine device (IUD) 2, intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
             (IUS) 2, bilateral tubal occlusion 2, vasectomised partner 2,3, sexual abstinence 4&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the Investigational&#xD;
                  Medicinal Products (IMP), which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception&#xD;
                  method&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have&#xD;
                  low user dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that&#xD;
                  partner is the sole sexual partner of the trial participant and that the&#xD;
                  vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 4&#xD;
                  In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly&#xD;
                  effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse&#xD;
                  during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The&#xD;
                  reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  subject.&#xD;
