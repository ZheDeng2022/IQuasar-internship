  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Duration of External Neck Stabilisation (DENS) study is a randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing early removal of a hard collar with treatment in a hard collar for 12 weeks in&#xD;
      older or frail adults with odontoid (dens) fractures. The primary outcome measure is QoL&#xD;
      assessed using the EQ-5D-5L at 12 weeks following injury. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      determine whether management without a collar improves outcome, compared to management with a&#xD;
      collar. Cost efficiency will be assessed over the observed 12 months using standard NICE&#xD;
      reference case methodology.&#xD;

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L Score - (EuroQol five dimensional descriptive system)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Outcome is Quality of Life assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire at 12 weeks post injury. EQ-5D-5L - Is the EuroQol 5D-5L a descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 2, 6 and 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months post injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a 10-item questionnaire that measures a patient's neck pain related disability. Each question is measured on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 5, and an overall score out of 50 is calculated by adding each item score together. This score is then multiplied by two to give a percentage score. A higher NDI score means the greater a patient's perceived disability due to neck pain.</description>

    <measure>Loss of muscle bulk in upper limbs - assessed using a combination of grip strength and muscle bio-impedance</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of muscle bulk in upper limbs will be assessed using grip strength and muscle bio-impedance.&#xD;
In consenting participants, hand grip strength will be measured using a dynamometer. Participants will be seated, their elbow by their side and flexed to right angles, and a neutral wrist position. The mean of three trials of grip strength will be reported for each hand.&#xD;
Bioelectric impedance (Bio-impedance) analysis measurements will be made at the right wrist and ankle, with the subject supine. Muscle mass is calculated according to Janseen et al.&#xD;
skeletal muscle mass (kg) =[height2/Bioimepdance x 0.401) +(gender x 3.825) +(age x -0.071)] +5.102&#xD;
where height is in centimetres, Bio-impedance in ohms, gender male =1 and female=0, and age is in years. The skeletal muscle index in kg/m2 is obtained by dividing the muscle mass by squared height.</description>

    <measure>Health Economics Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 12 month within trial analysis will be undertaken based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reference case recommendations to maximise UK policy relevance. This will include: Adoption of an National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) decision perspective; cost-utility approach for primary analysis (results presented in terms of incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) derived from EQ-5D-5L data with an area under the curve approach, omitting baseline); discount rate of 3.5% for both costs and QALYs (where applicable); and use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), to generate cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Choice of primary analysis cost per QALY threshold and EQ-5D-5L scoring algorithm will be selected to match NICE preferences. NHS &amp; PSS resource use will be extracted from medical records with some top-up self-report surveying. These will be combined with standard UK price weights to generate costs.</description>
