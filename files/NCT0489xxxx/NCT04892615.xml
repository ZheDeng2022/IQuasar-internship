  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open, single-center, controlled prospective studies were designed to obtain&#xD;
      reliable level I evidence in evidence-based medicine.Based on the premise of at least a&#xD;
      6-fold reduction in pancreatic fistula, as observed by Kawai et al after early&#xD;
      drainage.Considering the overall incidence of pancreatic fistula after standard&#xD;
      pancreatectomy at our center (approximately 20%), we would expect this complication to occur&#xD;
      in approximately 3.4% of cases in Group A.α was set as 0.05 and β was set as 0.2 (efficacy&#xD;
      was 80%), indicating that the total number of study subjects was at least 114 patients (at&#xD;
      least 57 patients in the experimental group and 57 patients in the control group).&#xD;
