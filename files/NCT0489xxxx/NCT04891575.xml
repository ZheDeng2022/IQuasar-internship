  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural populations in the U.S. are disproportionately burdened by cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification interventions are needed that support long-term&#xD;
      engagement in risk-reducing health behaviors. This trial will study the effects of a&#xD;
      family-focused, lifestyle intervention that is culturally tailored for use with rural&#xD;
      Hispanic and non-Hispanic adults. If successful, this community-based intervention has&#xD;
      significant potential for broad dissemination to reduce cardiovascular disease and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes health disparities in rural U.S. communities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Heart of the Family study is a randomized controlled trial conducted to examine if a&#xD;
      virtual lifestyle modification intervention is more effective in reducing risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when it is delivered to family dyads or to&#xD;
      individuals and to compare intervention effects in Hispanic and non-Hispanic rural-dwelling&#xD;
      adults at-risk for T2D or CVD. The Heart of the Family study will enroll 360 participants -&#xD;
      180 Hispanics and 180 non-Hispanics - from rural communities who have two or more risk&#xD;
      factors for T2D or CVD. Participants will be randomized to participate as an individual or&#xD;
      with a family member who may or may not be at risk for T2D or CVD or may or may not have&#xD;
      diagnosed T2D or CVD for a total of 540 participants. The interventions for both groups will&#xD;
      be provided by community health workers using a virtual platform. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      eight educational sessions about healthy lifestyle behaviors and support to address personal&#xD;
      and environmental barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. After the eight sessions, the&#xD;
      community health workers will follow up with participants once a month by phone over the next&#xD;
      12 months. Primary outcomes include short-term and long-term impact of the family-focused&#xD;
      active intervention compared to the individual-focused control condition on type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and CVD biological risk factors (for example, blood pressure and weight) and behavioral risk&#xD;
      factors (for example, physical activity and tobacco use). Outcomes are measured at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post-intervention, and at the end of the 12 month period of the study for both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
