    <textblock>
      PKU explore France is an exploratory study to evaluate the acceptability of PKU explore, a&#xD;
      food for special medical purposes, for use in the dietary management of phenylketonuria in&#xD;
      infants from 6 months to 3 years of age, assessing participant adherence, GI tolerance, phe&#xD;
      levels, growth and product palatability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study product, PKU explore, is a concentrated, spoonable, protein substitute food for&#xD;
      special medical purposes, used in the dietary management of PKU. The recommended amount will&#xD;
      be determined by a dietitian or clinician and the product used is unflavoured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PKU explore France is an exploratory study to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance,&#xD;
      palatability, and participant adherence over a four-week period in patients with PKU that&#xD;
      follow an appropriate restricted therapeutic diet. This will be followed by a maximum&#xD;
      24-month follow-up period monitoring growth as per routine standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 participants will be recruited at a single centre in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 28 consecutive days, up to 10 participants, aged 6 months to 3 years inclusive, take&#xD;
      their usual restricted therapeutic diet, either replacing their usual second-stage,&#xD;
      concentrated protein substitute with PKU explore or commencing PKU explore and gradually&#xD;
      reducing their Phe-free formula for infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their parent/guardian complete a daily questionnaire on adherence and tolerance, and a final&#xD;
      questionnaire on usage and acceptability.&#xD;
