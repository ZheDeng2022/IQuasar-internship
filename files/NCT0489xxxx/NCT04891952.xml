  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of cancer patients each year receive chemotherapy causing adverse side effects that&#xD;
      lower quality of life without prolonging it. Reliable identification of ineffective therapies&#xD;
      can eliminate needless human suffering while increasing overall probability of positive&#xD;
      response to treatment. Chemotherapy resistance profiling entails testing whether a patient&#xD;
      exhibits strong resistance to a therapy prior to its final selection by the oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Onco4D® chemotherapy selection assay has recently emerged as means to measure the&#xD;
      response of intact tumor biopsies to applied therapeutics by using Doppler detection of&#xD;
      infrared light scattered from intracellular motions inside living tissue (known as Motility&#xD;
      Contrast Tomography or MCT). Several studies have shown this phenotypic profiling technique&#xD;
      to offer high accuracy predicting response and resistance to chemotherapy[1-5].&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS The scope of this study is to measure the impact of Onco4D® therapy guidance on&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes among cancer patients for whom the test is ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Difference in pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy among recipients of Onco4D® guided therapy as compared to baseline unguided pCR&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: Difference in distribution of chemotherapy regimens among recipients of&#xD;
      Onco4D® guided therapy as compared to baseline unguided regimens, adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      response, 2 and 5 year event free survival (EFS), pre- and post-chemotherapy cancer staging&#xD;
      scores (TNM, ACJJ, RCB, etc..), radiologic chemotherapy response, additional exploratory&#xD;
      endpoints as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Non-randomized multi-center prospective outcomes registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION: Cancer patients of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for&#xD;
      this registry. All patients treated at participating sites and meeting the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be offered the opportunity to participate in the registry. Potential participants will&#xD;
      be presented with the purpose of the study and the potential risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation. Participants will be considered registered to the study upon receipt of a&#xD;
      signed informed consent statement. Registration information will be maintained by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator. All participants will be assigned a unique study ID.&#xD;
