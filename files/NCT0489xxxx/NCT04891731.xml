      Leuprorelin, a LHRH agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion and is&#xD;
      commonly used for the treatment of hormone-responsive prostate cancer, premenopausal HR+&#xD;
      breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It is currently available in 1M, 3M, 6M&#xD;
      for subcutaneous administration. Initially administration would stimulate an increase in LH&#xD;
      and FSH, causing a transient increase of E2 in 2-4 weeks. Continuous administration results&#xD;
      in a subsequent decrease in E2 levels, as a result of decreased levels of luteinizing LH and&#xD;
      FSH. After stopping injection, ovarian function could gradually recover. Adverse events&#xD;
      related to leuprorelin include flushing, mood swings and urogenital symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer mainly includes 1M and 3M GnRHa.&#xD;
      Leuprorelin 11.25mg dosage form is currently the only 3M GnRHa in China that has gotten&#xD;
      breast cancer indications. The use of 3M GnRHa could improve patients' compliance and reduce&#xD;
      injection discomfort. However, previous studies about GnRHa alone or in combination with TAM&#xD;
      or AIs usually used 1M GnRHa. There have been few studies reporting the suppression effects&#xD;
      of E2 levels and clinical outcome with leuprorelin 3M in combination with TAM or AIs.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some differences in the age of onset of breast cancer, histopathological types, and&#xD;
      treatment methods between Asians and non-Asians. Incidence peaks at age 40-50 in Asian women,&#xD;
      with more than half of premenopausal patients, but 65-70 years in US women, most of which are&#xD;
      postmenopausal[1]. Besides, compared with Americans, Asian women younger than 50 have a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of luminal A breast cancer and less basal-like subtype. Therefore, the&#xD;
      application of OFS has always been the focus for the treatment of premenopausal women with&#xD;
      HR+ breast cancer in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OFS therapy includes oophorectomy, ovarian radiation, and the use of GnRHa. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that the use of GnRHa in premenopausal women can achieve similar efficacy to&#xD;
      oophorectomy and ovarian radiation therapy. As GnRHa has the advantages of non-invasiveness&#xD;
      and reversibility, it has gradually replaced oophorectomy and ovarian radiation, and has&#xD;
      become the main method of OFS in premenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer. Meanwhile, GnRHa&#xD;
      in combination with TAM or AIs is increasingly used for premenopausal HR+ breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Previous studies have revealed that GnRHa alone or in combination with TAM or AIs&#xD;
      has shown effective estrogen suppression and certain survival benefits for most patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer. In addition, the 5-year follow-up results of the TEXT / SOFT study in 2014&#xD;
      showed that compared with OFS + TAM, OFS + AI treatment significantly improved DFS, prolonged&#xD;
      cancer-free survival time and distant recurrence-free metastasis[8, 9]. The 9-year follow-up&#xD;
      results of the TEXT / SOFT study in 2019 indicated that OFS + AI versus OFS + TAM or TAM&#xD;
      single drugs, years of distant recurrence risk in patients with high risk of recurrence have&#xD;
      an absolute benefit rate of 10-15 %, Intermediate risk is 4-5%, low-risk benefit is not&#xD;
      obvious. In 2019, the ABCCG reviewed ESO-ESMO and St. Gallen's treatment recommendations for&#xD;
      HR+/ Her-2 negative breast cancer in premenopausal women, discussed controversial issues and&#xD;
      pointed out that patients with low recurrence risk can be treated with TAM alone. For&#xD;
      patients with high risk of recurrence, chemotherapy + OFS + AI should be given. It indicates&#xD;
      that not all premenopausal HR+ patients with early breast cancer need auxiliary OFS, and more&#xD;
      clinical trials on OFSin premenopausal HR + patients are necessary and worthwhile.&#xD;

      of E2 levels and clinical outcome with leuprorelin 3M in combination with TAM or AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further investigate the suppression effects of E2 levels of 3M GnRHa, we conducted a&#xD;
      single-arm, prospective clinical observational study evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy with leuprorelin 3M in combination with TAM or AIs in premenopausal HR+&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
