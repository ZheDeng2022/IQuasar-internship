  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if blue light therapy can improve the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, and&#xD;
      provide parameters for ultimately designing commercial treatment devices, an investigational&#xD;
      stationary phototherapy unit was designed and built.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of blue light phototherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in human participants. The specific aim is to see if&#xD;
      phototherapy treatment applied to the hands will reduce the symptoms that RP participants&#xD;
      experience. This will be measured through the use of a visual analog scale (VAS) of both pain&#xD;
      and numbness. This study will also help to infer whether blue light phototherapy causes&#xD;
      vasodilation through infrared thermal imaging of the hands and continuous measurement of skin&#xD;
      temperature with a surface thermistor. Together, the visual analog scale (VAS) and infrared&#xD;
      thermal imaging contribute to the objective of deducing whether blue light phototherapy can&#xD;
      lead to reduced RP symptoms due to vasodilation of blood vessels.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their pain upon cold room exposure between treatments using a 10 centimeter visual analog scale (VAS). Outcome is reported as the mean change in VAS per arm in units of millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Numbness</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their numbness upon cold room exposure between treatments using a 10 centimeter visual analog scale (VAS). Outcome is reported as the mean change in VAS per arm in units of millimeters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature of at least one finger will be measured and logged using a thermometer at multiple points during study visit. Outcome is reported in units of degrees Celsius.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Thermal Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The thermal imaging camera takes still images of the hand before and immediately after treatment. It provides a heat map (color contour) that may be probed afterwards for temperature at designated points. These points are distributed over the fingers, hand and palms. A technician manually reads the temperature in degrees Celsius and enters the values into an Excel spreadsheet designating subject, ID and date; location of measurement; and other temperature readings. These include ambient (room temperature), and outside temperature. The finger and room temperatures, in Celsius, are electronically recorded on an Omega data logger. This is interrogated later to retrieve data. Another continuous reading is obtained of the temperature inside the hand compartment (separate from internal thermoregulation measurements) to track equipment functionality.</description>
