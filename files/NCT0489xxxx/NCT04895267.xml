  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to present a proof-of-concept that a 30 minutes single-session of low-field&#xD;
      thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) on the dorsal thorax can be employed to increase&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) participants significantly.&#xD;
      The investigators (Saul M. Dominguez-Nicolas and Elias Manjarrez) hypothesized that the&#xD;
      variables associated with LF-ThMS, as hyperthermia, frequency, and magnetic flux density in&#xD;
      the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these participants. The&#xD;
      investigators designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on COVID-19&#xD;
      participants who underwent two sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS), and other&#xD;
      COVID-19 participants who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause low SpO2 and&#xD;
      respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Hence the increase of SpO2 levels could be crucial&#xD;
      for the quality of life and recovery of these patients. In this clinical trial, the&#xD;
      investigators (Saul M. Dominguez-Nicolas and Elias Manjarrez) propose that an electromagnetic&#xD;
      device termed low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) system could be employed for&#xD;
      30 minutes to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 participants. This device non-invasively&#xD;
      delivers a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (mT) (i.e.,&#xD;
      105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. In line with preliminary studies, the scientific&#xD;
      literature, and other devices currently used in musculoskeletal magnetic therapy, these&#xD;
      frequencies and magnetic flux densities are safe for the participants. The investigators&#xD;
      designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on COVID-19 participants who&#xD;
      underwent two sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and other participants who&#xD;
      underwent only the real LF-ThMS. The study design includes a 30 minutes single-session of&#xD;
      LF-ThMS to avoid confounding factors related to the spontaneous recovery by natural immunity,&#xD;
      common in many COVID-19 patients several days after the contagion. Here the LF-ThMS protocol&#xD;
      is not intended to demonstrate its use as therapy but is instead designed to examine the&#xD;
      following physiological hypothesis. The hypothesis that there is a statistically significant&#xD;
      correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature associated with the real&#xD;
      LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in COVID-19 participants. In this context, the present clinical trial&#xD;
      is relevant because it could motivate future randomized clinical trials to examine whether&#xD;
      the LF-ThMS could be helpful as a potential therapy.&#xD;
