  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of pemetrexed and pembrolizumab in treating patients&#xD;
      with salivary gland cancer that has come back (recurrent) and/or has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as pemetrexed, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, in combination with the chemotherapy drug,&#xD;
      pemetrexed, has an effect on advanced salivary gland cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic salivary gland cancer (R/M SGC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse&#xD;
      events of the combination of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic salivary gland cancer (R/M SGC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic salivary gland cancer (R/M SGC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the frequency of MTAP loss by immunohistochemistry in R/M SGC and whether&#xD;
      it correlates with enhanced response to pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the degree of PDL1 expression using formalin-fixed tumor samples, and&#xD;
      determine the extent of PDL1 expression correlates with response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate expression of thymidylate synthase by immunohistochemistry in R/M SGC and&#xD;
      whether it correlates with enhanced response to pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and correlation with&#xD;
      response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and pemetrexed disodium IV&#xD;
      over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 35&#xD;
      cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cycles of&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who had stable disease, partial response, or complete&#xD;
      response after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, may continue pembrolizumab for an&#xD;
      additional 17 cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
