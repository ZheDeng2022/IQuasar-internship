    <textblock>
      Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is increasingly identified as an important cause of&#xD;
      cardiac morbidity and mortality, especially of SCD, in a younger population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are no epidemiological data available, the investigators' experience is that&#xD;
      in the North Indian region, ACM is rare outside our regions. ACM is also an understudied&#xD;
      cardiac disorder in the South-Asian region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethnic nonmigratory population inhabits the two regions, and consanguineous marriages are&#xD;
      common. Based on these observations, the investigators firmly believe that there may be a&#xD;
      founder gene in our populations responsible for the increased incidence of ACM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project includes a thorough phenotypic analysis ((ECG, Holter, and echocardiography) in&#xD;
      the ACM patients and their first-degree relatives; cardiac MRI and high resolution&#xD;
      endocardial bipolar and unipolar voltage mapping (using HD grid catheter) in the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient provided blood for the extraction of DNA will first undergo target panel&#xD;
      sequencing for 20 known classic right-dominant ACM and left-dominant ACM. If this is negative&#xD;
      for known pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but identified novel variants of&#xD;
      uncertain significance (VUS), then co-segregation analysis in family members will be&#xD;
      performed. This technique can provide helpful information to reclassify VUSs. If both these&#xD;
      are negative, then whole-exome 'trio' analysis will be performed, whch includes the proband&#xD;
      and two family members, to triangulate from all 20,000 genes to a list of candidates for&#xD;
      further interrogation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to provide comprehensive answers to the research question by combining&#xD;
      the genetic analysis with phenotypic evaluation.&#xD;

      Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by&#xD;
      structural and functional abnormalities in the right ventricle (and left ventricle, in 50%)&#xD;
      resulting in ventricular arrhythmias.1 It is an important cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD)&#xD;
      in young adults, accounting for 11% of all cases.2 The hallmark lesion of ACM is replacement&#xD;
      of the ventricular myocardium by fibrofatty tissue. 3ARVC is most often familial, with&#xD;
      autosomal dominant inheritance, autosomal recessive inheritance being uncommon. However, in&#xD;
      relatively isolated populations, autosomal recessive forms are recognized and often have more&#xD;
      severe phenotype. In fact, the first two genes discovered for ARVC were Naxos and Carvajal&#xD;
      syndromes, in isolated populations of Naxos Island and Equadorian populations respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genes involved in the pathogenesis of ACM are most often desmosomal genes like&#xD;
      plakoglobin (JUP), desmoplakin (DSP), plakophilin-2 (PKP2), desmoglein-2 (DSG2),&#xD;
      desmocollin-2 (DSC2). PKP2 mutations are the most common. However, there are disease-causing&#xD;
      genes that cause &quot;classic&quot; right ventricular ACM that do not encode for desmosomal proteins.4&#xD;
      The term &quot;ALVC&quot; has been proposed to recognize ACM of LV origin as distinct from right&#xD;
      ventricular ACM in which there is predominantly LV arrhythmia and structural abnormalities.4&#xD;
      The most common clinical presentation consists of ventricular arrhythmias and related&#xD;
      symptoms/events, which include palpitations, syncopal episodes (mostly occurring during&#xD;
      physical exercise), and cardiac arrest. The diagnosis of biventricular or predominant left AC&#xD;
      may be missed at the onset of symptoms in some patients who present years later with heart&#xD;
      failure, with or without ventricular arrhythmias, and are incorrectly diagnosed as having&#xD;
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.5 The diagnosis of ACM is based on the 2010 Task Force&#xD;
      Criteria (TFC), which include repolarization abnormalities, depolarization abnormalities,&#xD;
      arrhythmias, tissue characterization, structural abnormalities, and family history. However,&#xD;
      there is no agreed gold-standard, and limitations of the Task Force Criteria are: a) the&#xD;
      sentinel event can be SCD, with very subtle morphological abnormalities, which may not be&#xD;
      identified at post-mortem examination b) Electrical abnormalities can precede the structural&#xD;
      abnormalities, which can be easily missed. This has a huge impact on family members, as they&#xD;
      do not undergo appropriate clinical or genetic testing - missing an opportunity to intervene&#xD;
      and save lives c) Disease expression in the pediatric population is uncommon d) the long list&#xD;
      of criteria and modalities in the TFC make diagnosing ACM complex and time-consuming.&#xD;
      Identifying novel gene mutations in ACM may help in further understanding the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      the disease and may help in finding a new pharmacological target for such patients.&#xD;
