  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the impact of Physical therapy in adult patients receiving&#xD;
      intensive induction chemotherapy for the treatment of acute leukemia during prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization. The study cohort included 150 patients. Primary objective is to compare the&#xD;
      effect of a standardized rehabilitation program on physical deconditioning. This study has&#xD;
      several secondary objectives of comparing and analyzing the status of sarcopenia, muscle&#xD;
      strength, physical performance and the psychic dimension of this intervention. The 6 minutes&#xD;
      walking test, Handgrip strength, impedance measurement, computed tomography, Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance were used as measures of physical function. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of&#xD;
      Life-Questionnaire-30 (EORTC-QLQ-30) were used as measures of depression and anxiety and&#xD;
      quality of life of cancer patients. To investigate the impact of physical therapy, patients&#xD;
      were assigned to the physical therapy group (experimental group) or the control group.These&#xD;
      results will thus make it possible to promote access to physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      care, from diagnosis and during hospitalization, and to standardize practices.&#xD;
