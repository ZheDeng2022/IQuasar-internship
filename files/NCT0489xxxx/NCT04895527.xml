      One of the main risk factors for the development of postoperative pulmonary complications&#xD;
      (PPC) in postsurgical patients is the persistence of atelectasis during this period.&#xD;
      Therefore, it would be of great clinical interest to establish a causal relationship between&#xD;
      postoperative atelectasis and the development of PPC, as well as having a relatively precise,&#xD;
      simple and non-invasive method to rapidly diagnose these atelectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational study will be carried out including all patients undergoing&#xD;
      scheduled laparoscopic surgery, excluding pregnant women or women in the period of lactation,&#xD;
      patients with moderate - severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation during the 15 days prior to surgery or with a history of&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery. Demographic variables (age, sex, weight, BMI), preoperative data&#xD;
      (presence of allergies, cardiovascular risk factors, personal cardiopulmonary history,&#xD;
      presence of toxic habits, baseline peripheral oxygen saturation, ASA classification, ARISCAT&#xD;
      and frailty markers will be collected - Fried phenotype, scale clinical frailty and FRAIL&#xD;
      scale -) and intraoperative (duration of the procedure, recruitment maneuvers). At 30&#xD;
      postoperative days the history will be reviewed clinic of the patients and the postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be collected. Main objective: to demonstrate the veracity of the air-test&#xD;
      in the prevention of pulmonary or other systemic complications in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the incidence of positive results in the air-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the correlation between the performance of recruitment maneuvers and a&#xD;
           negative score in the air-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the correlation between the degree of frailty of the patients and a positive&#xD;
           score in the air-test.&#xD;

      The persistence of postsurgical atelectasis is potentially associated with complications such&#xD;
      as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. This promotes other systemic&#xD;
      complications such as myocardial ischemia or healing defects, negatively affecting morbidity,&#xD;
      healthcare costs, and postoperative survival. Pre and intraoperative hemoglobin saturation&#xD;
      levels are an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. The airtest,&#xD;
      based on the measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with ambient air in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period, is a useful tool in the prevention of moderate-severe pulmonary&#xD;
      postsurgical complications.&#xD;

      At 30 postoperative days the history will be reviewed clinic of the patients and the&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be collected. Main objective: to demonstrate the veracity of&#xD;
