  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the effects of CD-19 directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T&#xD;
      cell therapy for the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies that have come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or have not responded to treatment (refractory). CD-19 CAR-T cells use some of a&#xD;
      patient's own immune cells, called T cells, to kill cancer. T cells fight infections and, in&#xD;
      some cases, can also kill cancer cells. Some T cells are removed from the blood, and then&#xD;
      laboratory, researchers will put a new gene into the T cells. This gene allows the T cells to&#xD;
      recognize and possibly treat cancer. The new modified T cells are called the IC19/1563&#xD;
      treatment. IC19/1563 may help treat patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of in-house, point of care manufactured IC19/1563&#xD;
      in patient with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the feasibility of in-house, point of care manufactured IC19/1563 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate safety, including all grades of neurotoxicity (ICANS) and cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome as determined by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy&#xD;
      (ASTCT) criteria, by monitoring adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, and&#xD;
      other safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the incidence of Grade 3 or higher of neurotoxicity and cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome by grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity (ICANS) or CRS per the ASTCT criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess efficacy of a single dose of IC19/1563 cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Overall response rate (ORR); IVb. Duration of response (DOR); IVc. Progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS); IVd. Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative bone marrow disease in patients&#xD;
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), based on one month&#xD;
      post evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the in vivo cellular kinetics profile (levels, persistence, trafficking) of&#xD;
      CAR19 transgene and CD3+CAR+ cells into blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the changes in cytokine levels over time. III. Assess hospital resource&#xD;
      utilization and health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IC19/1563.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days -5, -4, -3 and IC19/1563 IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 60, every 3 months up&#xD;
      to year 3, every 6 months from years 3-5, and then annually for up to 15 years.&#xD;
