      To evaluate the safety of 2 dose vaccination schedule of orally administered CoV2-OGEN1 In&#xD;
      healthy subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at 1 site in NZ. Patients who sign an Informed Consent and meet&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria will be administered oral doses of 50mcg, 100mcg and 200mcg&#xD;
      CoV2-OGEN1 on Day 1 and Day 15 during Cohort 1-3 respectively . Follow up visit in all the 3&#xD;
      cohorts will be performed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,&#xD;
      and 12 months. One sentinel subject will be dosed at the start of each cohort and will be&#xD;
      monitored for 24 hours post administration before the remainder of the cohort can be&#xD;
      recruited. Each cohort will include one sentinel subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be done after assessing all adverse events and their relatedness in&#xD;
      atleast 9 participants out of 15 receiving Cov2-OGEN1 who have completed their week 6 FU&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case three (3) or more participants receiving CoV2-OGEN1 withdraw before Visit 6 (Week 4)&#xD;
      follow up visit, the dose escalation safety assessment will be made by assessing all Adverse&#xD;
      Events and their relatedness status in all participants receiving CoV2-OGEN1 of the current&#xD;
      Cohort.&#xD;
