      In PECSII or modified PECSI block, local anesthetic (LA) is injected between pectoralis major&#xD;
      muscle (PMm) and pectoralis minor muscle (Pmm) to block lateral and medial pectoral nerves&#xD;
      and between pectoralis minor muscle (Pmm) and serratus anterior muscle in the anterior&#xD;
      axillary line to block the intercostal nerves II-VI (Blanco et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) local anesthetic (LA) is injected above the serratus&#xD;
      muscle (between latissmus dorsi muscle and serratus muscle) or below the serratus muscle&#xD;
      (between serratus muscle and 4th rib) in the mid-axillary line to block the intercostal&#xD;
      nerves II-VI and spares the pectoral nerves (Blanco et al., 2013).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One hour before induction of anesthesia 4ml blood sample will be taken from all patient to&#xD;
      measure serum cortisol and serum endorphin level 2ml for each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced for all patients in both groups using the same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced with propfol (2-3 mg/kg), IV rocuroniom (.5 - .8 mg/kg) to&#xD;
      facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane (1-2 mac)&#xD;
      in 100% oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be intubated and mechanically ventilated using volume controlled positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation with a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg and an inspiratory to expiratory ratio&#xD;
      of 1:2 targeting end tidal carbon dioxide tension around 35mmhg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic monitoring for all patients include under pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      5 lead electrocardiogram and end tidal carbon dioxide monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A patients, an ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve block will be performed&#xD;
      after induction of general anesthesia. Under sterile conditions, US-guided PECSII block will&#xD;
      be on the same side of surgery with the patient lying in the supine position with the&#xD;
      ipsilateral arm abducted and externally rotated, and the elbow flexed 90°. The 6-13 MHz&#xD;
      linear probe will be put transversely in the ipsilateral clavipectoral triangle - between the&#xD;
      clavicle medially and above and the shoulder joint laterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of the Pectoralis major muscle, Pectoralis minor muscle and the plane in&#xD;
      between, the probe will be tilted caudally to identify the pulsating pectoral branch of the&#xD;
      thoracoacromial artery, if not identified, the probe will be moved 1-2 cm caudally and&#xD;
      medially. In a caudal tilt, the artery will be easily identified in a biconvex space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin at the point of entry was infiltrated using lidocaine 1%; then, the needle&#xD;
      (disposable spinal needle, K-3 point type LUER-Lock HUB 22G) will be advanced in an in-plane&#xD;
      technique targeting the space in which the artery is located. Two mL of saline 0.9% will be&#xD;
      injected to confirm the location, produce hydro-dissection, and improve needle visualization.&#xD;
      Afterward, 10 mL of bupivacaine, 0.25%, will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the probe will be moved laterally and caudally towards the anterior axillary fold,&#xD;
      parallel to the deltopectoral groove, until the serratus muscle appears underneath the&#xD;
      Pectoralis minor muscle attached to the underlying ribs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3rd, fourth ribs and the pleura will be then identified. After infiltration of the skin&#xD;
      with lidocaine 1%, the needle will be advanced in-plane targeting the plane between the&#xD;
      pectoralis minor muscle and serratus. Two mL of saline 0.9% will be injected; then, 10 mL of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: In SAPB Group, a US-guided serratus block will be done with the patient in the&#xD;
      lateral position, with the side of the surgical side up and the upper limb hanging over the&#xD;
      patient's head. The ribs will be then counted, and when the 4th rib will be identified, the&#xD;
      high-frequency probe will be put over it, in the mid-axillary line in a sagittal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ribs, pleura, and overlying serratus muscle will be identified, and the needle will be&#xD;
      advanced cephalad in-plane until the tip touched the 4th rib. Afterward, 2 mL saline 0.9%&#xD;
      will be injected; then, 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected in the plane between the&#xD;
      serratus and the 4th rib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, the muscle relaxant will be reversed using neostigmine (0.04&#xD;
      mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg). After fully awake extubation, all patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hour post-operative 4ml blood sample will be taken from all patients to measure serum&#xD;
      cortisol and serum endorphin level 2ml for each.&#xD;
