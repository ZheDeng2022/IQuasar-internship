  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of BIIB059 compared with&#xD;
      placebo in participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who are receiving&#xD;
      background lupus standard of care (SOC) therapy in reducing disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are to demonstrate early onset of efficacy of BIIB059&#xD;
      compared with placebo in participants with active SLE, who are receiving background lupus SOC&#xD;
      therapy in reducing disease activity; to demonstrate organ-specific efficacy of BIIB059&#xD;
      compared with placebo in participants with active SLE, who are receiving background lupus SOC&#xD;
      therapy in reducing joint disease activity; to demonstrate effect of BIIB059 compared with&#xD;
      placebo in reducing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use; to demonstrate organ-specific efficacy of&#xD;
      BIIB059 compared with placebo in participants with active SLE, who are receiving background&#xD;
      lupus SOC therapy in reducing skin disease activity; to demonstrate efficacy of BIIB059&#xD;
      compared with placebo in participants with active SLE, who are receiving background lupus SOC&#xD;
      therapy in reducing occurrence of flare up to Week 52; to evaluate additional efficacy of&#xD;
      BIIB059 compared with placebo in reducing disease activity with additional disease activity&#xD;
      measures; to evaluate the effect of BIIB059 compared with placebo in reducing OCS use; to&#xD;
      assess the difference between BIIB059 and placebo on participant-reported health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms, and impacts of SLE; to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of BIIB059 in participants with active SLE; and to evaluate immunogenicity of&#xD;
      BIIB059 in participants with active SLE.&#xD;

Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary (PCS) score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary (MCS) score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worst to 100=best). Increases from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a participant-administered HRQoL questionnaire that evaluates participant's fatigue in the 5 broad categories: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns. The level of fatigue is measured by questions assessed on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The responses for each item are added to obtain a total score which ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue.</description>

Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. Each score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is an AE that started or worsened in severity after the first dose of study treatment through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment or end of study (EOS) date, whichever comes earlier. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death (a life-threatening event), in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect, or is a medically important event.</description>
