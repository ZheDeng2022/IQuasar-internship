  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 vaccinations significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from&#xD;
      COVID-19. Since December 2020, the UK has rolled out vaccinations according to the Joint&#xD;
      Committee for Vaccinations and Immunity (JCVI) priority groups. However, despite data&#xD;
      indicating that more than 90% of the UK population intends to get vaccinated, there are&#xD;
      geographical and ethnic variations in vaccination acceptance. As younger cohorts with lower&#xD;
      risk from COVID-19 become eligible for vaccination, it is expected that uptake rates may also&#xD;
      be lower than they have been in previous cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was recently announced that a national NHS text message service will be introduced to&#xD;
      invite individuals eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine to book a vaccination appointment. Many&#xD;
      GP practices and CCGs have already implemented text messages to invite eligible residents and&#xD;
      patients for the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recent research has shown that the message content of text messages inviting members&#xD;
      of the public to other preventative health opportunities (e.g. personalised messages and&#xD;
      GP-endorsements in cancer screening) can impact uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-arm randomised controlled trial will be conducted across the Central London (CL)&#xD;
      Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) which to-date has seen the lowest rates of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination uptake in the country. The study aims to investigate the most effective text&#xD;
      message strategy to inform local, regional and national practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention text message content to be tested is informed by behavioural science theory&#xD;
      is personalised to include the recipient's name and GP practice name. All patients in the&#xD;
      Central London CCG who are unvaccinated, aged 18-49, who have not declined the vaccine will&#xD;
      be included as their cohort becomes eligible for vaccination according to the JCVI&#xD;
      guidelines. The trial will compare the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination by trial arm at 3&#xD;
      and 8 weeks after the intervention is deployed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 vaccine is an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.&#xD;
      Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is a major public health priority. People's&#xD;
      willingness to receive the COVID- 19 vaccine in the UK has been at record highs - 9 in 10&#xD;
      people said they would receive it when the NHS notifies them that it is their turn. However,&#xD;
      evidence suggests that willingness to get vaccinated is lower amongst younger age groups and&#xD;
      BAME populations. Additionally, high willingness to be vaccinated may not translate into high&#xD;
      uptake, particularly as the vaccine rollout extends to younger, less vulnerable cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine may be influenced by many factors, including personal beliefs&#xD;
      such as perceived low personal risk from COVID-19, perceived social and cultural norms or a&#xD;
      concerns around vaccine safety or efficacy. Additionally, process barriers, such as the&#xD;
      effort required to attend an appointment may reduce vaccine uptake. With more than 95% of UK&#xD;
      households having a mobile phone, text messages can be an effective way to improve uptake of&#xD;
      healthcare services and medicine adherence. In particular, recent research has shown that&#xD;
      reminder text messages about flu vaccination appointments can improve uptake by up to 10%,&#xD;
      and that some messages may be more effective for specific groups. However, more research is&#xD;
      needed to maximise the effectiveness of messages to increase uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      specifically and to explore how the effectiveness of messaging differs across different age&#xD;
      and ethnicity groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will determine which message strategy increases COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      vaccination rates in the cohort aged between 18 and 49 years old as they become eligible for&#xD;
      the vaccine according to JCVI categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, each cohort that newly becomes eligible to be vaccinated will be randomised&#xD;
      to one of the five trial text message strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial arms will include the current practice text message invitation which will act as&#xD;
      the control and four intervention trial arms. The intervention text message strategies and&#xD;
      message content have been based on behavioural science theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care team will deploy the text messages according to the trial arm allocation. The&#xD;
      vaccination status will be recorded in the patients electronic health record (EHR) as per&#xD;
      usual practice. Researchers will have access to the pseudonymised datasets through a secure&#xD;
      data platform which only holds pseudonomised data (see data Study Procedure section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will measure and compare the vaccination uptake across trial arms.&#xD;
