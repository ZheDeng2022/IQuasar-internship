      This study seeks to identify whether the addition of liposomal bupivacaine to regular&#xD;
      bupivacaine and saline administered via surgical transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block will&#xD;
      reduce the cumulative opioid dose in the first 48 hours after cesarean. 60 women scheduled&#xD;
      for cesarean at Unity-Point Health Meriter Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin will be enrolled&#xD;
      and can be expect to be on study for up to 6 weeks post-partum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether liposomal bupivacaine administered via&#xD;
      surgical TAP block at the time of Cesarean delivery will reduce the total dose of opioids&#xD;
      received. The hypothesis is that liposomal bupivacaine will reduce the total dose of opioids&#xD;
      received in the immediate 48 hours post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include participant self-reported pain scores, participant-reported&#xD;
      incidence of side effects, and development of objective complications such as dysrhythmias.&#xD;
      Other outcomes collected will include length of stay, time to first rescue analgesic&#xD;
      medication, total dose of opioids at 12, 24, 36, 72 hours and during the hospital stay, use&#xD;
      of supplemental oxygen during hospitalization, breastfeeding rates, both exclusive and in&#xD;
      combination with formula use, amount of opioid prescribed at discharge and whether refills&#xD;
      were requested or administered, rates of chronic pain at six weeks postpartum, and six week&#xD;
      Edinburgh Depression Screen scores. Neonatal outcomes such as fetal weight, five-minute Apgar&#xD;
      scores and development of adverse outcomes such as neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      admission will also be collected because NICU admission can impact maternal opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether liposomal bupivacaine administered via surgical TAP block at the&#xD;
           time of cesarean delivery will reduce the total dose of opioids received in the first 48&#xD;
           hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that liposomal bupivacaine administered via surgical TAP&#xD;
           block at the time of cesarean delivery will reduce the total dose of opioids received in&#xD;
           the first 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developmental Sub Aim: If liposomal bupivacaine administered via surgical TAP block does&#xD;
           reduce the total dose of opioids received, to determine the degree of the reduction in&#xD;
           order to allow for an adequately powered randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether liposomal bupivacaine administered via surgical TAP block at the&#xD;
           time of cesarean delivery will reduce patient-reported pain scores and opioid-related&#xD;
           side effects, including respiratory compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that liposomal bupivacaine administered via surgical TAP&#xD;
           block at the time of cesarean will reduce patient-reported pain scores and opioid&#xD;
           related side effects.&#xD;
