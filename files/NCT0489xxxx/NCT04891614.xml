      A Prospective, Single-Arm, Open-Label Pilot Trial, to Assess Safety and Effectiveness of&#xD;
      Process-Instructed Self neuro-Modulation (&quot;Prism&quot;), as an Adjunct to Standard of Care, in&#xD;
      Subjects with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prism is a software device intended for neurofeedback (NF) training (i.e. operant condition&#xD;
      based on EEG signals, also known as EEG-biofeedback), to be used in combination with a&#xD;
      standard computer and supported EEG hardware. For purposes of this training, information for&#xD;
      feedback is derived and processed from several EEG channels. Prism provides visual and/or&#xD;
      auditory signals that correspond to the patient's computed EEG signal, which serves as a&#xD;
      surrogate indicator of achieving a state of reduced amygdala activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a Prospective, Single-Arm, Open-Label Pilot Trial, to Assess Safety and&#xD;
      Effectiveness of Process-Instructed Self neuro-Modulation (&quot;Prism&quot;), as an Adjunct to&#xD;
      Standard of Care, in Subjects with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include subjects diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) from 1 year to 20 years after index trauma. The total expected enrollment is up to 100&#xD;
      subjects in one or more sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness of fifteen (15)&#xD;
      EEG-NF training sessions using the Prism software in reducing PTSD-related symptoms.&#xD;
