  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial investigates how well duvelisib exposure before CAR-T cell&#xD;
      manufacturing works to enhance immune profiles of T cells in patients with diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Duvelisib, an oral phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, may favorably change a&#xD;
      patient's T cells to make them more efficient and have a longer duration for manufacturing of&#xD;
      CAR-T cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the increase in CD27+/CD28+ T cells, after 2-week exposure duvelisib prior to&#xD;
      collection of mononuclear cells for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART cell)&#xD;
      manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate patient compliance with duvelisib. II. To evaluate the time required for&#xD;
      manufacturing CAR-T using mononuclear cells from duvelisib-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the frequencies of CD27/28 double positive T cells and CD4/8 double negative&#xD;
      T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate overall response rates following CART therapy. V. To describe the rates of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) transfer due to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and/or&#xD;
      neurotoxicity or CRS or neurotoxicity that requires treatment with tocilizumab and/or&#xD;
      corticosteroids after CAR-T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe the safety and tolerability profile of duvelisib throughout the entire study&#xD;
      (during duvelisib priming for 2 weeks and after CAR-T infusion for 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 2 weeks prior to collection of&#xD;
      CAR-T cells in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      receive tisagenlecleucel via infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up 100 days after CAR-T infusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &gt; 300/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of all previous therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or investigational therapy) for the treatment of their DLBCL &gt;= 2 weeks&#xD;
             before the start of duvelisib. There is no limit on how many previous lines of&#xD;
             treatment a patient may have received&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of duvelisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to starting therapy. WOCBP and men must agree to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from&#xD;
             enrollment into this study until at least 12 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion&#xD;
             and until CAR-T cells are no longer present by quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (qPCR) on two consecutive tests (qPCR tests will be available upon request). A woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone&#xD;
             a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding&#xD;
             24 consecutive months. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             highly effective contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 3 months after completion of duvelisib administration. WOCBP must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of leukapheresis, lymphodepletion (if&#xD;
             performed) and tisagenlecleucel infusion (if lymphodepletion not performed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the usual practice and lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient). Periodic abstinence (i.e, calendar, ovulation, post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawals are not acceptable forms of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without a&#xD;
             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
             before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the&#xD;
             study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception, or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system&#xD;
             (IUS) or other forms of contraception that comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%). In&#xD;
             case of oral contraception, the woman should be stable on the same pill for a minimum&#xD;
             of 3 months prior to enrollment on the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse from enrollment into this&#xD;
             study until at least 12 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion and until CAR-T cells&#xD;
             are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests (qPCR tests will be available&#xD;
             upon request). A condom is required of all sexually active male patients to prevent&#xD;
             them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal&#xD;
             fluid to their partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be either postmenopausal, free from menses &gt;= 2 years (yrs),&#xD;
             surgically sterilized, willing to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy or agree to abstain from heterosexual activity starting with&#xD;
             screening and for 5 months after last treatment in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova or any other organs while taking&#xD;
             protocol therapy and for at least 12 months after stopping treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability of the patient to comply with scheduled visits, drug&#xD;
             administration plan, protocol specified laboratory tests, other study procedures and&#xD;
             study restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware of&#xD;
             the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed on the procedures to be&#xD;
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternative, potential risks and&#xD;
             discomforts, potential benefits and other pertinent aspects of study participation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because duvelisib is agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with duvelisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
