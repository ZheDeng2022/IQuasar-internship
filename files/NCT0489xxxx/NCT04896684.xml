    <textblock>
      In the general population, the percentage of people with at least one digestive disease is&#xD;
      16.7%. Among these digestive diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (IBS) and patients who should benefit from digestive examinations as part of a&#xD;
      screening oriented either by the patient's family history or following the performance of an&#xD;
      immunological screening test ( FIT) in the stool will be studied. The aim of this project is&#xD;
      to build a biological collection with associated clinical data for research projects.&#xD;

      In the general population, the percentage of people with at least one digestive disease is&#xD;
      16.7%. Among these digestive diseases, two of them namely inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xD;
      and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) will be more particularly studied. This interest is based&#xD;
      on the increasing frequency of these two pathologies, their chronicities but above all the&#xD;
      limited physiopathological data available. In addition, it seems interesting to study a third&#xD;
      population, namely patients who should benefit from digestive examinations as part of a&#xD;
      screening oriented either by the patient's family history or following the performance of an&#xD;
      immunological screening test ( FIT) in the stool. The study of this population is part of an&#xD;
      improvement in knowledge on the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study these populations, blood, serum, plasma and tissues from colonous biopsies or&#xD;
      surgical samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will make it possible to study, among other things, the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      chronic diseases of the small intestine and the colon (IBD, IBS, screening) in order to&#xD;
      improve their management through the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.&#xD;
