  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia is a common pregnancy disorder defined as high blood pressure and protein in&#xD;
      the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It affects the function of the placenta and can cause&#xD;
      severe complications, e.g, stroke, multiple organ damage and seizures for the mother, and&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction or stillbirth for the baby. Pre-eclampsia can also cause long term&#xD;
      health problems for mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no test that can predict whether someone will develop pre-eclampsia, so&#xD;
      nothing is done to intervene before the problems begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from their previous work suggest that the investigators may have found something that&#xD;
      can be measured in a blood sample that can predict which women might develop pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
      It is a protein known as Vascular Adhesion Protein-1 (VAP-1), and our evidence points at it&#xD;
      being involved in the embryo attaching to the womb and also in helping the development of the&#xD;
      placenta by helping to get the right cells to where they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test blood samples from 451 pregnant women who come to the Leicester&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary for routine bloods and their first pregnancy dating scan. The investigators&#xD;
      will then follow the outcomes of the pregnancy to see if VAP-1 in the blood of women who&#xD;
      develop pre-eclampsia (or other pregnancy complications) is different from the ones who do&#xD;
      not develop pregnancy complications. The ability to predict women at higher risk of pregnancy&#xD;
      complications would ensure the application of timely interventions and appropriate management&#xD;
      of the conditions that may help to prevent complications both during pregnancy and later&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last approximately 30 weeks and the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      give one extra tube of blood whilst having their routine bloods taken and to also consent to&#xD;
      follow up of medical records until the end of the pregnancy.&#xD;
