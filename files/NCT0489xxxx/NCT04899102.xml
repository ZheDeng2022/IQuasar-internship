    <textblock>
      NAFLD is a growing threat to public health. Currently, there is a significant need for highly&#xD;
      effective treatments for NAFLD. Non-obese NAFLD (BMI&lt;30kg/m2) is an increasingly recognized&#xD;
      condition, sometimes described as &quot;lean NAFLD&quot;. Intermittent Fasting (IF) may be uniquely&#xD;
      beneficial in non-obese NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to identify non-pharmacologic,&#xD;
      lifestyle-based methods of NAFLD treatment within non-obese adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which encompasses a spectrum from simple steatosis&#xD;
      and steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis and cirrhosis, is the leading cause of liver disease&#xD;
      in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD&#xD;
      and NASH, and standard low-calorie diets are often minimally effective, difficult to adhere&#xD;
      to and to maintain. Thus, continued investigation of strategies to treat NAFLD and NASH is&#xD;
      greatly needed. Non-obese NAFLD (BMI&lt;30kg/m2) is an increasingly recognized condition,&#xD;
      sometimes described as &quot;lean NAFLD&quot;. It is estimated that 10-20% of American and Europeans&#xD;
      without obesity have this condition. There is a pressing need for the study of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions independent of weight loss to treat this important subset of NAFLD patients.&#xD;
      This protocol aims to investigate the utility of time restricted, intermittent fasting (TRF)&#xD;
      as a potential method. Adults with non-obese NAFLD are at risk of progression to end-stage&#xD;
      liver disease and development of cardiometabolic disease. Intermittent Fasting (IF) may be&#xD;
      uniquely beneficial in non-obese NAFLD. IF is characterized by periods of dietary restriction&#xD;
      leading to metabolic production and use of ketones from adipocytes rather than&#xD;
      hepatically-derived glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to learn if time-restricted, intermittent fasting can help reduce&#xD;
      the amount of fat in the liver in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;
      Ideally, this study will yield more information about time-restricted, intermittent fasting&#xD;
      as a potential lifestyle-based treatment for adults with NAFLD and a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      between 23-30 kg/m^2.&#xD;
