  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gait disturbance is one of the most common complaints from patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). It is well-established that people with PD have motor learning&#xD;
      impairments. To enhance motor learning, several methods have been recommended, such as sleep,&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, and aerobic exercise. To date, only 2 studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effects of acute aerobic exercise on motor learning in people with PD. It is&#xD;
      yet unclear whether adding aerobic exercise after multiple motor training sessions can&#xD;
      enhance motor learning in people with PD. Additionally, most prior evidences utilized&#xD;
      moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise to facilitate motor learning, it is yet unclear&#xD;
      whether other types of exercise (e.g., resistance training) could induce similar beneficial&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, this proposed project is specifically designed to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of adding aerobic or resistance exercise after motor training. To take a step further, this&#xD;
      project will also determine the patient characteristics who may benefit from the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) To examine whether adding specific exercise after training can facilitate&#xD;
      learning on patients with Parkinson's disease. (2) To determine the characteristics of&#xD;
      participants who may benefit from these types of intervention approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 76 participants with idiopathic PD diagnosed by neurologists will be&#xD;
      recruited. All eligible participants will be randomized into one of the 4 groups: aerobic&#xD;
      group (AEX), resistance group (REX), conventional PT group (CPT), and control group (CON).&#xD;
      All participants will receive 12 sessions of gait training. All outcome measures will be&#xD;
      assessed before the intervention (pre-test), after the 6th intervention session (mid-test),&#xD;
      after all 12 intervention sessions (post-test), and 1-month after the intervention (follow-up&#xD;
      test). All assessments will be performed by an independent research assistant who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the group allocation of the participants. The primary outcome will be gait&#xD;
      performance, and the secondary outcomes will include measurements of cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      functions. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to examine the&#xD;
      changes of corticomotor excitability associated with the interventions.&#xD;

      Background: Gait disturbance is one of the most common complaints from patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). It is well-established that due to the dysfunction of the&#xD;
      corticostriatal circuits, people with PD have motor learning impairments and may consequently&#xD;
      influence the effects of rehabilitation. To enhance motor learning, several methods have been&#xD;
      recommended, such as sleep, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, and aerobic exercise.&#xD;
      To date, only 2 studies have investigated the effects of acute aerobic exercise on motor&#xD;
      learning in people with PD. These 2 studies were cross-sectional studies that only provided a&#xD;
      single bout of aerobic exercise and followed the effects on motor learning for 7 days. It is&#xD;
      yet unclear whether adding aerobic exercise after goal-based motor skill training for&#xD;
      multiple training sessions, like a regular clinical treatment regimen, can boost up the speed&#xD;
      of motor skill acquisition and enhance retention and transfer performances for people with&#xD;
      PD. Additionally, most prior evidences utilized moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise&#xD;
      to facilitate motor learning, it is yet unclear whether other types of exercise (e.g.,&#xD;
      resistance training) could induce similar beneficial effects. To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      no study is specifically designed to compare the addictive effect of aerobic or resistance&#xD;
      exercise on motor skill learning in people with PD. Therefore, this proposed project is&#xD;
      specifically designed to answer the above questions. To take a step further, this project&#xD;
      will also determine the patient characteristics who may benefit from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) To examine whether adding aerobic or resistance exercise after walking skill&#xD;
      training can facilitate learning of the walking task on patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      (2) To determine the characteristics of participants who may benefit from these types of&#xD;
      intervention approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to investigate investigate the effects of adding aerobic or&#xD;
      resistance exercise after gait training in people with PD. The second aim is to further&#xD;
      determine the characteristics of participants who benefit from the proposed training&#xD;
      program..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 76 participants with idiopathic PD diagnosed by neurologists will be&#xD;
      recruited. All eligible participants will be randomized into one of the 4 groups: aerobic&#xD;
      group (AEX), resistance group (REX), conventional PT group (CPT), and control group (CON).&#xD;
      All participants will receive one-on-one intervention sessions with a trained physical&#xD;
      therapist. Each intervention sessions will last 60 minutes, which will include 30 minutes of&#xD;
      treadmill training and an additional therapy based on group allocation. The participants will&#xD;
      come to the lab for 12 training sessions spread across 4 to 6 weeks. All outcome measures&#xD;
      will be assessed before the intervention (pre-test), after the 6th intervention session&#xD;
      (mid-test), after all 12 intervention sessions (post-test), and 1-month after the&#xD;
      intervention (follow-up test). All assessments will be performed by an independent research&#xD;
      assistant who will be blinded to the group allocation of the participants. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be gait performance, and the secondary outcomes will include Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment test, Stroop Color-Word test, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Fatigue&#xD;
      Severity Scale, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire-39, New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, finger&#xD;
      sequence task, Timed Up and Go test, 5 times sit to stand test. Transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation will be used to examine the changes of corticomotor excitability associated with&#xD;
      the interventions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA will be used to evaluate general cognitive function of the participants. It evaluates several cognitive functions including attention, set-shifting, short-term memory, verbal fluency, calculation, orientation, digit span, conceptual thinking, and visuospatial processing skills. The total score of MoCA is 30 with a higher score indicating better cognitive function. The MoCA has good to excellent psychometric properties. MoCA will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Stroop Color-Word test</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color-Word test will be used to evaluate the changes in executive functions in people with PD. The executive functions involved in the Stroop Color-Word test are selective attention, inhibition, and set-shifting. The Stroop Color-Word test comprises the congruent and incongruent testing conditions. The congruent condition is when the color ink of a word is coherent with the written color name, and the incongruent condition is when the color ink differs from the written color name (e.g., the word 'red' written in blue ink). The participants are instructed to read out the ink color of the word, but not the color word name, as accurately and as fast as possible within 45 seconds. The Stroop Color-Word test will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a well-established and widely used rating tool for the evaluation of disease severity of PD. This study will only evaluate Part 3 of the scale - the motor disturbances of the patients. The total score ranges from 0 to 132 for Part 3 of the UPDRS with a lower score indicates less PD symptoms and a higher score suggests more severe in PD disease. Internal consistency and validity has been established to be excellent for UPDRS. UPDRS will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change in fatigue severity questionnaire (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS will be used to determine how fatigue interferes an individual's daily living and social participation. It contains 9 items, and each item is scored on a 7-point scale with a score 1 indicates strongly disagree and score 7 indicates strongly agree. The total score ranges from 9 to 63, with a higher score indicate greater fatigue severity. FSS will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale will be used to examine an individual's confidence level of not falling when performing activities of daily living. The ABC Scale contains 16 different activities performed indoors and outdoors. The participants will be asked to rate their confidence level (range from 0% to 100% of confidence) of not falling for each item. An average score of the 16 items (range from 0% to 100%) will be calculated to determine the participant's confidence level of not falling when performing the activities of daily living. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the ABC scale in patients with PD were excellent. The ABC scale will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-report questionnaire containing 39 items assessing the impact of PD on quality of life. The PDQ-39 covers 8 dimensions: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The participants are required to answer the questions based on their experiences in the preceding month prior to the interview. The scoring system for each item ranges from 0 (never have difficulty) to 4 (always have difficulty) with lower scores suggesting better quality of life. PDQ-39 will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The NFOG-Q will be used to evaluate the freezing frequency and severity of the patients with PD. It composes of 3 parts; in the first part, a video clip will be shown to the participants with PD and help to classify whether an individual is a freezer or non-freezer. The second and third part of the questionnaire is designed for freezers only. Partâ¡assesses the severity of FoG according to the frequency and duration of the freezing episodes, while Partâ¢evaluates the impact of freezing on daily activities, such as walking. The reliability and internal consistency of the NFOG-Q have been well-established for patients with PD. NFOG-Q will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will initially sit on a comfortable chair with hips and knees flexed at 90Â°. Upon a 'GO' signal, the participants will stand up from the chair, walk for 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The participants will be instructed to complete the task at their preferred/ comfortable speed. Good to excellent test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability have been established in people with PD. TUG will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Five Times Sit-to-Stand (FTSTS) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Four time points: pre-test (before intervention, 0 week), mid-test (after 6th intervention sessions, up to 2 weeks), post-test (after all intervention sessions, up to 4 weeks), follow-up test (one month after intervention, up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FTSTS test will be evaluated to represent the strength and endurance of the lower limbs. The participants will be sat on a standardized chair, and they will be required to stand up and then sit down for 5 times as fast as possible. The amount of time the participants need to complete the task will be recorded, and a lesser amount of times would indicate better strength of the lower extremities. FTSTS will be assessed at pretest, mid-test, post-test, and follow-up test, and the trend of changes among these time points will be determined.</description>
