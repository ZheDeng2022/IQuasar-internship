  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether IMPRINT in combination with pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      a safe treatment for people with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).The highest dose of&#xD;
      IMPRINT that causes few or mild side effects when given in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be found. Once the highest safe dose of IMPRINT is found, it will be tested in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in future participants to see whether the combination may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for MPM.&#xD;

    <description>The first primary objective of this study is to determine the MTD of IMPRINT among the three candidate doses: 400cGy x5 fractions, 500cGy x5 fractions and 600cGy x5 fractions. These dose levels will be evaluated using a modified Continuous Reassessment Method (CRM) starting with the lowest dose level 400cGy x5 fractions. Determined by the first 12 participants enrolled to the study.</description>

    <description>The starting radiation dose will consist of 400cGy x5 fractions. Doses will be escalated by 100cGy per fraction (i.e. 400cGy, 500cGy, 600cGy) for a total of 3 dose levels. The MTD will be evaluated using a modified Continuous Reassessment Method. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as any treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity with a CTCAE v5 Grade ≥3 or grade ≥2 pneumonitis that requires use of steroids occurring after the start of IMPRINT through the first 3 months after the last fraction.</description>
