  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a case-controlled observational study, involving children with Developmental&#xD;
      Coordination Disorder (DCD) and typically developing children with an age from 8 up to 12&#xD;
      years old. The study aims to investigate interlimb coordination of the lower limbs and&#xD;
      sensorimotor synchronization ability in children with DCD compared to age-matched typically&#xD;
      developing children during gait and fundamental lower limb coordination task to 2 metronomes&#xD;
      with different temporal structures. The study consists of a maximum of 4 sessions (2&#xD;
      descriptive sessions, 2 experimental sessions), each lasting around 60 minutes. Depending on&#xD;
      the preferences of the child and parents, the sessions can be combined in 2 sessions of 2&#xD;
      hours. During the first descriptive session, the participant will perform the m-ABC2 test to&#xD;
      assess gross and fine motor function. The MBEMA-s will be used to examine rhythm perception&#xD;
      ability. During the second descriptive session, children will perform the Kids BESTest to&#xD;
      examine postural control, and two cognitive tests (digit span, go-no/go test) to assess&#xD;
      executive functioning. During the third visit (experimental session), interlimb coordination&#xD;
      and synchronization will be investigated during three tasks with different dynamic balance&#xD;
      demands (seated, walking and running) in three conditions: in silence, to beats in&#xD;
      isochronous metronome (discrete structure), to beats in non-isochronous metronomes&#xD;
      (sinusoidal structure). In the last experimental session, the tempi of the auditory&#xD;
      metronomes will be set at higher and lower tempi than the preferred comfortable tempo of the&#xD;
      child.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase coordination index (PCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>PCI is a measurement of consistency and accuracy in generating a series of anti-phase left - right stepping phases. Detailed information is described in Plotnik et al. (2007). Shortly, phase represent the relative timing of contralateral heel strikes, determining the phase, and normalize the step time with respect to the stride time (Plotnik, Giladi, &amp; Hausdorff, 2007). Ideal interlimb coordination for each step is 180°. The consistency of the phase generation is represented by the Coefficient of variation of the series of the relative timing of the stepping of one leg with respect to the gait cycle.A lower PCI%, closer to zero, indicates a better antiphase interlimb coordination pattern.</description>

    <description>The m-ABC (second edition) is a test to assess gross (static and dynamic balance, aiming and catching) and fine motor functions (manual dexterity) in children aged between 3 and 16 years. The m-ABC-second edition is a norm referenced test. The raw score of each task will be converted to standard scores (mean standard score of 10, standard deviation of 3) and percentiles. A lower score indicates a lower motor functioning. A total test score percentile below percentile 16 is at risk for problems with motor functions.</description>

    <time_frame>week 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Go-no/Go task paradigm was developed to assess behavioral inhibition in children with limited working memory demands. Two versions of the Go-no/go test will be performed, namely an auditory and a visual.For both the auditory and visual task, a maximum score of 60 correct responses can be obtained. A lower score (minimum 0 correct) indicates a worse performance.</description>
