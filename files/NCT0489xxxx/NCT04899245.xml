  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a worldwide&#xD;
      pandemic that has resulted in large-scale quarantines in cities, states, and countries&#xD;
      throughout the world. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that is most commonly spread via&#xD;
      contact with infective respiratory droplets and aerosols produced by coughing, sneezing,&#xD;
      talking, and singing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with medical complexity (CMC), i.e., children with multiple severe chronic&#xD;
      conditions, high resource use, severe functional limitations, and substantial&#xD;
      family-identified service needs, are a medically vulnerable population for the development of&#xD;
      severe COVID-19. Deciding to send CMC to school poses a major dilemma to families wanting to&#xD;
      minimize severe COVID-19 risk. School personnel also face risks when CMC attend school.&#xD;
      Despite these challenges, achieving in-person school attendance is critical for CMC. Compared&#xD;
      to non-CMC, academic and social development for most CMC hinges on being at school. Severe&#xD;
      intellectual and developmental disability impairs one's ability to engage with online&#xD;
      platforms. Health-promoting services delivered at school, e.g., physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      speech therapy, are likely less effective when delivered virtually. Parents of CMC, already&#xD;
      disproportionately unemployed due to their child's care needs, experience added employment&#xD;
      strain when their child is out of school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to increase the safe return to school for CMC by 1) evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility of school-based COVID-19 testing strategies and 2) identifying parent and staff&#xD;
      perceptions of testing and school attendance. A related study (ReSET Aim 1a, NCT04895085)&#xD;
      will evaluate the same factors in home-based testing strategies in CMC exclusively.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen System</intervention_name>
    <description>BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen System (Abbott) is a point-of-care, lateral flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in direct anterior nasal (nares) swabs. Internal controls are built into the testing system and results are available in 15 minutes.&#xD;
The use of the BinaxNOW system is authorized under the Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization. The test is allowed for over-the-counter, non-prescription use with or without symptoms. The test may be used with children two years and older with the help of sample collection by an adult, and the test may be self-administered by anyone aged 15 years or more.</description>
