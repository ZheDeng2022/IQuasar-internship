  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterised by&#xD;
      destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts leading to liver inflammation and fibrosis, and&#xD;
      ultimately liver cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. More than 50% of patients with PBC&#xD;
      suffer from chronic fatigue, and approximately 20% suffer from severe fatigue with negative&#xD;
      impact on their quality of life. Although fatigue is a large problem in patients with PBC, no&#xD;
      effective treatments are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Danish intervention study have shown that high dose oral thiamine (Vitamin B1) were&#xD;
      effective in treating chronic fatigue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this&#xD;
      study, only few and minor adverse events to thiamine treatment were observed. Although the&#xD;
      precise mechanism of work remains unknown, the investigators see no reason that this cannot&#xD;
      be transferred topatients with PBC. Hence, the investigators aim to conduct a study&#xD;
      investigating the use of oral thiamine in chronic fatigued patients with PBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover&#xD;
      trial including 36 patients with PBC and with a higher fatigue level than in the general&#xD;
      population for more than six months. The patients will be randomised into one of two 3x4&#xD;
      weeks setups; 1) thiamine for four weeks followed by four weeks washout and finally four&#xD;
      weeks of placebo or 2) placebo for four weeks followed by four weeks washout and finally four&#xD;
      weeks of thiamine. The primary endpoint is to investigate the fatigue-level before and after&#xD;
      treatment with thiamine and placebo using every patient as their own control. Fatigue-level&#xD;
      will be measured using international validated questionnaires. The doses of thiamine are&#xD;
      calculated based on the patient gender and weight. All patients will be included in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic at the Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology at Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
