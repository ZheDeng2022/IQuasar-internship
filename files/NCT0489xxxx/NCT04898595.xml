    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators are going to test whether a standardize approach to&#xD;
      discontinuation of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) using a set of criteria&#xD;
      improves outcomes. These criteria are based on the best available evidence. In a systematic&#xD;
      review, aside from urine output, there was no one factor that predicted successful weaning of&#xD;
      RRT in patients with AKI. Urine output prior to discontinuation of RRT was the most commonly&#xD;
      described and robust predictor. The pooled analysis found a sensitivity of 66.2% and&#xD;
      specificity of 73.6% for urine output to predict successful RRT discontinuation. Patients&#xD;
      with AKI on CRRT recruited during the first half of the study will be controls (usual process&#xD;
      of care). After accrual, patients recruited for the second half will receive the intervention&#xD;
      where discontinuation of CRRT will be guided by a set of criteria based on the patient's&#xD;
      hemodynamic status and other factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To the investigator's knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of a standardized approach&#xD;
      to de-escalation of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) in patients with AKI.&#xD;
      Exposure to more frequent and higher intensity RRT has been associated with delayed renal&#xD;
      recovery. There is scant evidence in the literature on benefit or harm associated with a&#xD;
      standardized approach to de-escalation of CRRT on the outcomes of successful weaning of CRRT,&#xD;
      impact on CRRT duration, renal recovery, safety and adverse events. Thus, this generates a&#xD;
      clinical equipoise. Therefore, this study should help guide nephrologists and intensivists on&#xD;
      the appropriate management of CRRT in patients with AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective quasi-experimental (before-after) study of patients with acute kidney&#xD;
      injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. It will be&#xD;
      based on Good Clinical Practice Standards and performed under IRB supervision. This will be a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study design due to the nature of the intervention and the processes of&#xD;
      care leading to making a clinical decision. Patients with AKI on CRRT will be prospectively&#xD;
      recruited. Patients recruited during the first half of the study will be in the control arm&#xD;
      where usual process of care will not be altered. After accrual, patients recruited for the&#xD;
      second half will receive the intervention where discontinuation of CRRT will be guided by a&#xD;
      set of criteria based on the patient's hemodynamic status and other factors. A decision tree&#xD;
      form would be filled by one of the team members each day. This will increase adherence to the&#xD;
      protocol and allow us to track reasons for not discontinuing CRRT when it is suggested to do&#xD;
      so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached within 24-36 hours of starting CRRT. Patients will be eligible&#xD;
      for trial entry after the decision is made to pursue CRRT. Patients with provided informed&#xD;
      consent will be accrued in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the intervention arm will lead to earlier discontinuation of CRRT.&#xD;
      This may translate to less treatment-associated adverse events, namely intradialytic&#xD;
      hypotension, and potentially improve the chance of renal recovery. Investigators will collect&#xD;
      data on persistent kidney dysfunction at 30 days after AKI as defined by persistent need for&#xD;
      RRT or doubling of baseline creatinine.&#xD;
