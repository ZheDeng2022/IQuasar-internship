  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radical&#xD;
      chemoradiation(CRT).Recent advances in radiation techniques and supportive measures resulted&#xD;
      in improvemnent of locoregional control and quality of life.However distant failure is still&#xD;
      the main challenging reason of poor survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of systemic therapy to concurrent CRT is widely used and accepted as an option to&#xD;
      reduce these failures ,however selection of chemotherapy regimen and timing in relation to&#xD;
      CRT is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doublet and triplet chemotherapy regimens using cisplatin and 5FU are throughly investigated&#xD;
      in this setting.Inspite of significant improvement in disease free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival they were poorly tolerated.Hence,minority of patients in the daily practice could&#xD;
      tolerate those studied regimens as propsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, in multicenter randomized trial, Zhang and his group investigated gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin as induction chemotherapy (ICT) added to CRT.It showed improvement in recurrence&#xD;
      free survival and overall survival.More importantly 96.7% of the experimental arm completed&#xD;
      the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was further confirmed by an updated network of meta analysis by Bongiovanni et al.Again&#xD;
      the question of &quot;when&quot; is still valid.Our proposal is to compare tolerable regimen in&#xD;
      induction versus adjuvant settings.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the cancers which shows significant geographic&#xD;
      prevalence variation. Worldwide, there were 130,000 new cases in 2018.As a non-endemic&#xD;
      region, only 35 new cases were diagnosed in Kuwait in the same year. Nevertheless, it&#xD;
      accounts for 1.3% of cancer related mortality in Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical radiotherapy (RT) is the mainstay treatment of NPC for decades. A high cure rate can&#xD;
      be achieved for patients with early-stage. The breakthrough in the management of NPC came&#xD;
      with the intergroup study 009 which showed significant improved progression free survival&#xD;
      with adding chemotherapy (CTH) to the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As compared to RT alone, concurrent chemoradiation (CRT), showed significant improvement in&#xD;
      10-year overall survival and progression free survival in meta-analysis of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (MAC-NPC) collaborative group. Addition of systemic therapy to concurrent CRT was&#xD;
      the proposed solution to treatment failures; whether in the induction (ICT) or adjuvant (ACT)&#xD;
      settings. However, ICT or ACT in NPC remains controversial; largely due to inconsistent&#xD;
      results of several prospective randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned MAC-NPC group reviewed six clinical trials in which CRT followed by ACT&#xD;
      was compared with RT alone (administrated without concurrent or adjuvant chemotherapy).&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS) was significantly improved compared with RT alone (10-year overall&#xD;
      survival 57% versus 43.1%, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.56-0.76), as well as 10-year progression-free&#xD;
      survival; PFS (53.2% versus 38.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this was not consistent in endemic areas with high prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV); which is known causative for NPC. Chen et al reported in a Chinese phase III trial 508&#xD;
      patients with advanced NPC randomized to ACT (cisplatin plus fluorouracil) vs observation&#xD;
      following CRT with weekly cisplatin. There was no improvement in the five-year failure-free&#xD;
      rate with ACT compared with CRT alone (five-year rate 75% versus 71%, HR 0.88, 95% CI&#xD;
      0.64-1.22) Later, from the same endemic region, Sun Yat-sen university conducted a multi&#xD;
      center phase III clinical trial in which 480 patients, stage III to IVB, node-positive NPC&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to ICT followed by CRT versus CRT alone. This study showed improvement&#xD;
      of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant RFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reason for reluctancy to adopt ICT or ACT in the management of advanced NPC, is the&#xD;
      morbidity of current chemotherapy regimens. The high toxicity profile with some of these&#xD;
      regimens was the real obstacle toward the use of them. In previous studies, the back bone for&#xD;
      adjuvant or induction chemotherapy in NPC has been platinum and 5-fluoruracil, with or&#xD;
      without a taxane. This regimen was poorly tolerated, with only 40-60 % of patients could&#xD;
      complete their preplanned course of treatment in many trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, in multicenter randomized trial, Zhang and his group compared gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin as ICT plus CRT with CRT alone. The 3-year RFS was 85.3% in the induction group and&#xD;
      76.5% in the standard-therapy group (HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.77; P=0.001). Overall&#xD;
      survival at 3 years was 94.6% and 90.3%, respectively (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.77). What&#xD;
      is more important is that 96.7% of the experimental arm completed 3 cycles of ICT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On behalf of the Nasopharyngeal Cancer Portal Group of Investigators, Bossi colleagues from&#xD;
      Europe, Kuwait, Jordan, Turkey and USA, assessed the impact of treatment intensity within a&#xD;
      large retrospective multicenter cohort, nasopharyngeal cancer in non-endemic areas. Our group&#xD;
      shared in this pooled analysis and the data showed a higher rate of death and recurrence with&#xD;
      non-intensive treatment, (defined as no &quot;added&quot; systemic treatment to CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing Phase 3 Trials exploring ICT or ACT in NPC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple phase 3 trials ongoing to refine the ICT or ACT approach. Sun Yat-sen&#xD;
      University is conducting a study comparing TPF with PF as ICT regimen in stage IVa-b NPC&#xD;
      (NCT02940925). They also explore the effect of triple combination of ICT, CRT and ACT in high&#xD;
      risk NPC (NCT02621970). Another comparison between induction TPF vs adjuvant PF is recruiting&#xD;
      (NCT03306121). Fudan University also from China exploring maintenance gemcitabine after&#xD;
      radical treatment in N3 disease (NCT03403829). Jiangxi Provincial Cancer Hospital testing&#xD;
      adding neoadjuvant and adjuvant PD-1 inhibitor to ICT-CRT (NCT04557020) Another promising&#xD;
      strategy to control the distant failures in locally advanced NPC, is to employ immunotherapy&#xD;
      in the primary treatment. There are many ongoing trials exploring this strategy, mainly in&#xD;
      China. However, the validity in endemic vs non-endemic regions should be taken with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study In our proposal we are trying to compare the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      ICT followed by CRT with CRT followed ACT in locally advanced NPC&#xD;
