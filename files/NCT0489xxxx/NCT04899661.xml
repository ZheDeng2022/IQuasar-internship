  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Molidustat in Japanese men and women who have renal anemia, a condition in which the kidneys&#xD;
      do not make enough of a hormone that helps the body make new red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous clinical trials with a small number of participants, several important adverse&#xD;
      events were observed. The researchers in this study want to know how many patients also have&#xD;
      these adverse events under the real world, and if the number of the red blood cells will be&#xD;
      increased after the treatment of Molidustat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect the participants' health information from their medical records&#xD;
      and their regular check-ups for up to 2 years. The data from this study will be submitted to&#xD;
      the health authority in Japan in accordance with the local regulation.&#xD;
