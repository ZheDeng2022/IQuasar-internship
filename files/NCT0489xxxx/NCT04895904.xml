      Acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ANVUGIB) is a common critical disease in&#xD;
      gastroenterology. Due to the development of modern medical technology, the incidence rate of&#xD;
      ANVUGIB has been decreasing in recent years, but its mortality within 30 days is still 11%.&#xD;
      Endoscopic hemostasis and drug therapy are the first choice for the treatment of ANVUGIB.&#xD;
      After endoscopic hemostasis, it is very important to treat peptic ulcer bleeding with strong&#xD;
      acid suppression therapy to maintain gastric pH above 6.0. This study is to study the effect&#xD;
      of endoscopic and drug treatment of ANVUGIB.&#xD;

      Acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ANVUGIB) is a common critical disease in&#xD;
      gastroenterology. It refers to the bleeding caused by the non varicose diseases above the&#xD;
      ligament of flexor, including the bleeding of pancreaticobiliary tract and the bleeding&#xD;
      caused by the diseases near the anastomotic stoma after gastrojejunostomy. Due to the&#xD;
      development of modern medical technology, the incidence rate of ANVUGIB has been decreasing&#xD;
      in recent years. A US study shows that the incidence rate of ANVUGIB dropped from 78/10 to&#xD;
      61/10 10000 [1] from 2001 to 2009. However, the mortality within 30 days of ANVUGIB is still&#xD;
      as high as 11% [2]. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of bleeding in ANVUGIB.&#xD;
      The annual incidence rate is 19.4-57/10 million, and the rate of rebleeding within 7 days is&#xD;
      13.9%, and the mortality rate is 30 in 30 days. A study in China shows that compared with the&#xD;
      1990s, the detection rate of high-risk ulcer has increased, but the overall mortality has not&#xD;
      decreased significantly [4]. Endoscopic hemostasis is the first choice for the treatment of&#xD;
      peptic ulcer. The latest guidelines of our country recommend that patients with upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding with stable hemodynamics should try their best to have emergency&#xD;
      gastroscopy within 24 hours after bleeding, and emergency endoscopic hemostasis is feasible&#xD;
      for bleeding lesions [5]. After endoscopic hemostasis, it is very important to give strong&#xD;
      acid suppression therapy to maintain gastric pH above 6.0 in the treatment of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      bleeding [6-9]. This study is to analyze the effect of endoscopic and drug treatment of&#xD;
      ANVUGIB.&#xD;

    <description>Clinically, the following symptoms or laboratory examination results suggest rebleeding within 30 days after successful endoscopic hemostasis：(1) The frequency of hematemesis or melena increased, the vomit was bright red or dark red bloody stool, or accompanied by active bowel sounds;&#xD;
(2) After rapid infusion and blood transfusion, the symptoms of peripheral circulation failure did not improve significantly, or although temporarily improved and then deteriorated, the central venous pressure still fluctuated, slightly stable and then decreased;&#xD;
(3) Red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit continued to decrease, reticulocyte count continued to increase;&#xD;
(4) In the case of sufficient fluid replacement and urine volume, blood urea nitrogen continued or increased again.</description>
