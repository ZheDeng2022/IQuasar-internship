  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) repair is a high-risk surgical procedure accompanied by&#xD;
      intense endocrine and metabolic responses to surgical stress, with subsequent activation of&#xD;
      the inflammatory cascade, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and bone marrow&#xD;
      activation. There is a proven correlation of surgical stress, which patients undergoing open&#xD;
      AAA repair are subjected to, with patient outcome, morbidity/mortality, intensive care unit&#xD;
      stay and overall length of stay. Modern general anesthetic techniques have been revised and&#xD;
      rely on perioperative multimodal anesthetic and analgesic strategies for improved overall&#xD;
      patient outcome. Based on this context of a multimodal anesthetic technique and having taken&#xD;
      into consideration the international &quot;opioid-crisis&quot; epidemic, an Opioid Free&#xD;
      Anesthesia-Analgesia (OFA-A) strategy started to emerge. It is based on the administration of&#xD;
      a variety of anesthetic/analgesic agents with different mechanisms of action, including&#xD;
      immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our basic hypothesis is that the implementation of a perioperative multimodal OFA-A strategy,&#xD;
      involving the administration of pregabalin, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, dexketoprofen, paracetamol and magnesium sulphate, will lead to attenuation of&#xD;
      surgical stress response compared to a conventional Opioid-Based Anesthesia-Analgesia (OBA-A)&#xD;
      strategy. Furthermore, the anticipated attenuation of the inflammatory response, is pressumed&#xD;
      to be associated with equal or improved analgesia, compared to a perioperative OBA-A&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair surgery is a high-risk operation, often performed&#xD;
      on high-risk patients. Despite advancements made in diagnosis, management, surgical&#xD;
      techniques and treatment of these patients, morbidity and mortality remain high. Mortality&#xD;
      after open AAA repair remains higher than the average mortality of the matched population for&#xD;
      age and sex. Debate is ongoing as to whether open AAA repair or endovascular aneurysm repair&#xD;
      (EVAR) is better in terms of overall long-term survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding open AAA repair, the very nature of the surgery itself, with surgical trauma,&#xD;
      aortic cross clamping and its resulting ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cellular&#xD;
      interactions of blood with the biomaterial surface of the graft, causes intense and varied&#xD;
      metabolic, endocrine and immunological responses. These surgical stress-related responses are&#xD;
      evident as marked increases in inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      IL-10, stimulation of the sympathetic system, and stimulation of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, caused by release of CRH and AVP. High levels of IL-6,&#xD;
      peaking at 4-48h after clamp removal, have been associated with serious postoperative&#xD;
      complications and its levels reflect the intensity of surgical trauma following AAA repair.&#xD;
      Other inflammation markers such as CRP and leukocytes have also been shown to increase&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the surgical technique has been extensively studied as to the role it plays on the&#xD;
      control of the surgical stress response, patient outcome, morbidity and overall mortality,&#xD;
      fewer studies have been conducted to study the effect of the anesthetic management on these&#xD;
      factors. While most of them have been focusing on the comparison of general anesthetic vs&#xD;
      regional techniques, only few compare different general anesthetic techniques on patient&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern general anesthetic techniques have been revised and rely on a multimodal anesthetic&#xD;
      and analgesic perioperative regimen for improved patient outcome. A multimodal regimen&#xD;
      requires the administration of at least 2 factors with different mechanisms of action. At&#xD;
      least one factor causes inhibition of central sensitization and at least another one inhibits&#xD;
      the peripheral sensitization of the nervous system, as a response to painful surgical&#xD;
      stimuli, mitigating adverse neuroplasticity. One such example, is an Opioid-Free&#xD;
      Anesthetic-Analgesic (OFA-A) strategy, which implements a variety of pharmacological agents,&#xD;
      including some with demonstrated immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects. Apart from&#xD;
      sparing any opioid-related adverse effects, an OFA-A multimodal strategy targets optimal&#xD;
      analgesia with a multitude of factors in the lowest possible dose, aiming for additive or&#xD;
      synergistic effects. An additional advantage of using an OFA-A technique is the prevention of&#xD;
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that implementation of a multimodal OFA-A strategy, leads to a decreased&#xD;
      sympathetic and inflammatory response, compared to conventional opioid-based anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques. A decreased inflammatory and stress response as expressed by reduced levels of&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-a, CRP, cortisol, arginine vasopressin (AVP), white blood cells count&#xD;
      and hemodynamic stability is expected to decrease peripheral and central sensitization,&#xD;
      contributing to better postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
