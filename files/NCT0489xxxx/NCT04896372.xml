      This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based-intervention combined with treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) compared to TAU only in improving psychological conditions in a sample of adolescents&#xD;
      with obesity (body mass index, BMI &gt; 97th centile for age and sex). Fifty consecutive&#xD;
      adolescents (12-17 years) of both genders with obesity will be recruited among the patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in a clinical center for obesity rehabilitation and randomly allocated into two&#xD;
      experimental conditions: ACT + TAU vs TAU only. Both groups will attend a three-week&#xD;
      in-hospital multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for weight loss. The ACT + TAU condition&#xD;
      comprises a psychological intervention based on ACT combined with a standard psychological&#xD;
      assessment and support to the hospitalization. The TAU comprises the standard psychological&#xD;
      assessment and support to the hospitalization. At pre- to post-psychological intervention&#xD;
      participants will complete the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the&#xD;
      Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Difficulties in&#xD;
      Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Repeated-measures ANOVAs (2x2) will be conducted. The study will assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a brief ACT-based intervention for adolescents with obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in childhood and adolescence is becoming a major public health concern. In this&#xD;
      respect, recent estimates pointed out that globally 124 million children and adolescents,&#xD;
      aged between 5 and 19 years, were obese. In Europe, the prevalence of overweight and obese&#xD;
      children and adolescents aged between 5 to 19 years is reported around 19%, with a higher&#xD;
      prevalence in southern European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity in children and adolescents is associated with a higher risk of developing several&#xD;
      physical and psychological problems that have an impact on their emotional development [3].&#xD;
      Research has reported associations between childhood and adolescent obesity and some form of&#xD;
      psychopathology, as depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&#xD;
      Besides, children and adolescents with obesity are more likely to suffer from psychosocial&#xD;
      disadvantages as discrimination, social isolation, and bullying because of their weight.&#xD;
      Moreover, obesity in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor body image, low&#xD;
      self-esteem, and low quality of life and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evidence suggests that obesity is a complex disease that may dramatically impair&#xD;
      psychological health, representing a risk factor for children and adolescents' future&#xD;
      development. This aspect calls for a better understanding of the associated risk factors and&#xD;
      requires a multidisciplinary approach - entailing medical, nutritional, physical, and&#xD;
      psychological components - aimed to address not only weight loss but also improving&#xD;
      psychological conditions and treating obesity-related comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of dysfunctional eating habits is one of the main factors linked to body&#xD;
      weight, and it can be considered a barrier to weight loss [14,15]. Evidence from the&#xD;
      literature suggests that unhealthy and dysfunctional eating habits could be related to a&#xD;
      failure in emotional regulation strategies, that lead individuals to eat in response to&#xD;
      difficult emotions, as in case of emotional eating defined as the tendency to eat in response&#xD;
      of negative feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional regulation is defined as the ability to manage emotions, which means to recognize,&#xD;
      understand, accept and modulate flexible responses to emotions. High emotion regulation&#xD;
      allows individuals to act accordingly with personal goals, even in the presence of difficult&#xD;
      emotions, while controlling for impulsive behaviors. On the contrary, when emotional&#xD;
      regulation is lacking, emotional eating is undertaken to regulate difficult feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since emotional eating was related to higher consumption of sweet and fatty food, as an&#xD;
      attempt to regulate negative feelings, it was found to be positively associated with weight&#xD;
      gain and obesity, both in adult and in younger populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A theoretical model for explaining disordered eating suggests that momentary stimuli such as&#xD;
      the availability of tasty food in the environment, in combination with a modern sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle, accompanied by difficult emotions, can lead people to move toward behaviors&#xD;
      perceived to increase or maintain a hedonic state of pleasure, as eating tasty food&#xD;
      immediately. The model also suggests that values clarity and behavioral commitment [to&#xD;
      connect healthy eating habits to important life values], awareness [of their automatic&#xD;
      thoughts], and distress tolerance [negative internal states] are specific self-regulation&#xD;
      skills that can help individuals to deal with difficult emotions and control for their&#xD;
      behaviors. Such skills are the main focus of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave CBTs raised in the last twenty years.&#xD;
      ACT aims to promote psychological flexibility, defined as the ability to live in the &quot;here&#xD;
      and now&quot; current moment consciously while implementing behaviors to live in line with one's&#xD;
      own values. This can be seen in opposition to experiential avoidance (or psychological&#xD;
      inflexibility) which is the attempt to avoid un-pleasant internal states, such as thoughts,&#xD;
      feelings, and bodily sensations. The promotion of psychological flexibility is based on three&#xD;
      pillars: openness, awareness, and engagement. Openness refers to the willingness to develop&#xD;
      an open and acceptable attitude toward one's personal internal states such as thoughts,&#xD;
      emotions, and bodily sensations; Awareness refers to the ability to act intentionally with&#xD;
      awareness about personal thought and sensations, without automatically reacting; Engagement&#xD;
      refers to engage oneself in committed behaviors related to personal values, that is chosen&#xD;
      life directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ACT-based protocols have been successfully applied to adolescents targeting a broad&#xD;
      range of conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic pain, ADHD, and at-risk adolescents. In&#xD;
      a pilot study conducted by Hayes, Boyd, and Sewell, thirty adolescents referred to a&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatient service were randomly assigned to two conditions: in one, they&#xD;
      received an ACT intervention; in the other, participants received a standard intervention for&#xD;
      depression. The results showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms in patients&#xD;
      undergoing the ACT intervention. In a study conducted by Kemani and colleagues, an ACT-based&#xD;
      intervention was applied to adolescents with chronic pain and their family members. Results&#xD;
      showed improved acceptance of chronic pain and psychological flexibility in adolescents, as&#xD;
      well as decreased depressive symptoms in their parents. ACT has also been applied to&#xD;
      adolescents with a post-traumatic stress disorder [30], proving a reduction of symptoms after&#xD;
      a 10-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are not many studies in the literature concerning the application of an&#xD;
      ACT protocol for adolescents with overweight/obesity problems. However, evidence suggests&#xD;
      that psychological flexibility is an important key factor of psychological health since it&#xD;
      allows people to engage in meaningful challenges, in accordance with person's self-concept&#xD;
      and important life domains. To the best of our knowledge only one pilot study published in&#xD;
      2019, evaluating the effectiveness of an ACT-based psychological intervention applied in&#xD;
      combination with a 16-week lifestyle behavioral modification program in a sample of obese&#xD;
      adolescents, was found. This study showed that the intervention was effective in promoting a&#xD;
      reduction in BMI and an overall improvement in physical activity and psychological status of&#xD;
      obese adolescents. Furthermore, the intervention was positively evaluated by both the&#xD;
      adolescents and their parents who participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these premises, the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief&#xD;
      ACT-based- psychological intervention, compared to TAU in improving psychological conditions&#xD;
      in a sample of adolescents with obesity attending a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program&#xD;
      for weight loss.&#xD;

    <description>The Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWB) will be administered to assess psychological well-being. It is a self-report measure that explores six dimensions: self-acceptance, positive relationships with others, autonomy, environmental control, personal growth, and life purpose. The questionnaire consists of 18 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;completely agree&quot;). scre range from 18 to 72. Higher scores indicate higher well-being. The Italian version, assessed for Italian adolescents, is reported to have good psychometric properties (test-retest correlation coefficients: Self-acceptance: r = .82; Positive relationships: r = .81; Autonomy: r = .21; Environmental control: r = .31; Life purpose: r = .81; Personal growth: r = .78.).</description>

This is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 36 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;almost never&quot;)] to5 (&quot;almost al-ways&quot;). Scores range from 1 to 180. Higher scores indicate greater difficultis in emotional regulation. The Italian version [43], widely used in samples of adolescents is reported to have good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha values ranged from .77 to .89. The Cronbach's Alpha of the total score was .92).</description>

    <description>The Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) will be administered to assess emotional eating. The DEBQ is a self-report questionnaire used to detect eating behaviors. The Emotional Eating subscale consists of 13 items, rated on a 5-step Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;almost always&quot;). Scores range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate higher emotional eating. The Italian version showed good psychometric properties (Cronbach's Alpha = .97). The DEBQ was chosen as a measure of emotional eating in our sample, since no other validated instruments are available, except for the DEBQ version for parents , unfortunately unsuitable for parents of our sample of hospitalized adolescents</description>

    <description>The proposed intervention was designed by the authors of the study. It was developed following the main ACT-based manuals, with adjustments according to the users and the context of the study implementation.&#xD;
Specifically, we developed a practical and interactive intervention, which comprises practical activities such as roleplay and writing activities and imaginative activities supported by metaphors. The sessions are based on the use of age-appropriate language to convey the most complex therapeutic processes easily. According to Strosahl and colleagues' model, sessions will respectively target the components of openness, awareness, and engagement.</description>
