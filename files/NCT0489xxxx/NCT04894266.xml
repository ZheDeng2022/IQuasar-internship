      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effect on clinical course of&#xD;
      oral apabetalone in hospitalized subjects with Covid-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of apabetalone on biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α and C-reactive protein [CRP]) To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      apabetalone on key virus-related biomarkers including ACE2, serine protease inhibitor Clade A&#xD;
      Member 8 (SERPINA8), angiotension (Ang) II and Ang (1-7) and others within the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) To evaluate the effect of apabetalone on clinical laboratory&#xD;
      parameters including white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, D-Dimer, ferritin and&#xD;
      clotting time in hospitalized subjects with Covid-19 infection To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      apabetalone cardiac and renal biomarkers including N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (NT-proBNP), troponin and Cystatin C To evaluate changes in viral levels measured via&#xD;
      oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs To evaluate the effect of apabetalone on rate of&#xD;
      admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation/ECMO, and death To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      apabetalone in hospitalized subjects with Covid-19 Infection&#xD;
