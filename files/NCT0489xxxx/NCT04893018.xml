  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and effects of NT-I7 in treating Kaposi sarcoma in&#xD;
      patients with or without HIV. NT-I7 works by using a patient's immune system to fight cancer.&#xD;
      It is made in a laboratory and is used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural&#xD;
      defenses against cancer. NT-I7 may work better in treating Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive efineptakin alfa intramuscularly (IM) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 7 and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 15 months.&#xD;

             Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Oncology&#xD;
             Committee staging and response definitions for KS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No upper or lower limit on the number of prior therapies or stage of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients must have been on effective anti-retroviral (ART) therapy for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to enrollment, with persistent KS affecting quality of life due&#xD;
             to either T1 disease or T0 disease with inadequate disease regression on ART alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients must have undetectable HIV viral loads =&lt; 40 copies/mL measured&#xD;
             using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved commercial assay with lower limit&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with visceral involvement must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Meet other eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have any/all associated tumor associated symptoms =&lt; grade 2 by Common&#xD;
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Require no immediate intervention (e.g. mild oozing of oral KS not an exclusion&#xD;
                  criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide newly obtained core, punch, or excisional biopsy of a tumor&#xD;
             lesion obtained up to 28 days prior to treatment initiation. An archival tumor sample&#xD;
             obtained within 1 year of screening is allowed if pre treatment biopsy is deemed&#xD;
             unsafe or technically not feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent document.&#xD;
             Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of NT-I7 in&#xD;
             patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible&#xD;
             for future pediatric trials&#xD;
&#xD;

             Cockcroft-Gault. At the discretion of the treating physician, a 24-hour urine&#xD;
             creatinine clearance could be obtained and utilized as the gold standard if creatinine&#xD;
             clearance by Cockcroft-Gault is &lt; 30 and prevents patient enrollment on the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must be on suppressive&#xD;
             antiviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have an undetectable&#xD;
             HCV viral load due to prior treatment or natural resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours before receiving the first dose of the study agent. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of NT-I7 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because NT-I7 may have an adverse effect on pregnancy and poses risk to the human&#xD;
             fetus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and for 90 days after completion of NT-I7 administration&#xD;
&#xD;

             than ART for HIV within 2 weeks before the initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from immune related adverse events due to prior&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of&#xD;
             hypothyroidism managed by supplemental levothyroxine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received treatment with any other investigational agent within 4&#xD;

             (including, but not limited to, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,&#xD;
             methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents) within 2&#xD;
             weeks before initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids, and mineralocorticoids (e.g.,&#xD;
                  fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical&#xD;
                  insufficiency is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history or risk of autoimmune disease, including, but not limited&#xD;

             sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis. Note: the&#xD;
             following will NOT be exclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g., positive&#xD;
                  antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer or lupus anticoagulant) without associated&#xD;
                  symptoms&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of NT-I7 on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with NT-I7,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with NT-I7&#xD;
&#xD;
