    <textblock>
      This study is designed is to answer questions related to safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      Adult Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH) in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) survivors. First, we aim to&#xD;
      establish whether brief reductions in inhaled oxygen concentration can be safely tolerated in&#xD;
      TBI survivors. Second, we aim to establish whether there are any effects of AIH on memory,&#xD;
      cognition, and motor control. Participants will be monitored closely for any adverse events&#xD;
      during these experiments. Data will be analyzed to determine if there is an improvement in&#xD;
      key outcomes at any dose level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH) is safe to&#xD;
      administer to medically stable chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. There is&#xD;
      evidence indicating that AIH promotes central nervous system (CNS) neuroplasticity. AIH&#xD;
      stimulates oxygen-sensitive serotonergic neurons in the brainstem's raphe nucleus leading to&#xD;
      serotonin release into different regions of the CNS. This release leads to activation of&#xD;
      serotonin receptors on or near cortical neurons and increased synthesis of multiple trophic&#xD;
      factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and&#xD;
      erythropoietin. These actions also influence the functioning of neurotransmitters such as&#xD;
      GABA. Greater expression of growth factors in the brain facilitates neuroplasticity by&#xD;
      increasing synaptic strength, cortical neuron and interneuron excitability, and intra- and&#xD;
      inter-brain region connectivity. Of note is that hypoxia induced neuroplasticity only occurs&#xD;
      with acute intermittent exposure but is not evoked by continuous hypoxia of the same&#xD;
      duration. Is AIH safe to administer to TBI patients? The preponderance of prior animal and&#xD;
      human evidence suggests that daily episodes of mild AIH do not negatively impact important&#xD;
      safety parameters such as resting blood pressure, arterial pressure, heart rate, heart rate&#xD;
      variability, cardiac output, or cognitive function. To date, AIH protocols that induce&#xD;
      beneficial neuroplasticity without triggering pathological sequelaehave been restricted to&#xD;
      brief episodes of modest hypoxia with a low cycle number, such as 15 x 90-second episodes of&#xD;
      10% inspired oxygen. Recent studies in humans with chronic spinal cord injury and stroke&#xD;
      demonstrates that these modest AIH episodes repeated for five consecutive days can be safely&#xD;
      tolerated without pathological consequences. Another recent study showed that even a 4-week&#xD;
      protocol of moderate daily AIH (cycling 9%/21% oxygen every 1.5 minutes, 15 cycles per day,&#xD;
      for 4 weeks) does not elicit adverse medical consequences or cognitive impairment. Thus, the&#xD;
      cumulative evidence suggests that repetitive AIH may be safely used to study whether it can&#xD;
      enhance neurobehavioral functioning in TBI patients without deleterious effects. In this&#xD;
      study, we will administer mild AIH to 16 patients on four different days spread over two&#xD;
      weeks, starting with normal oxygen concentration (target SpO2 of 98%) and then progressively&#xD;
      reducing the oxygen concentrations over the next three sessions (to 93%, 87%, &amp; 82%). Our&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine whether it is safe to administer mild AIH to chronic TBI&#xD;
      patients with persistent functional impairments, but who are clinically stable. As a&#xD;
      secondary objective in this study, we will assess whether mild AIH administration had any&#xD;
      post-session or cumulative effects post-studyon memory and cognition, cortical activation&#xD;
      using paired-pulse inhibition, or whether pre-study brain architecture or functional&#xD;
      connectivity as detected by structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging predicts response to AIH. If there are no adverse effects of mild AIH in this study,&#xD;
      clinical trials using mild AIH alone or in conjunction with neurobehavioral therapies could&#xD;
      evaluate whether AIH facilitates improved functional performance after TBI.&#xD;
