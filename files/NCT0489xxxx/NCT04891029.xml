  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage high-grade cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, has few, if any, symptoms. When&#xD;
      symptoms appear, they are vague and mimic other diseases and therefore the diagnosis is&#xD;
      missed or delayed. The McGill research group had showed in the DOvEE trial (NCT02296307),&#xD;
      that fast-track assessment with transvaginal ultrasound scans (TVUS) and serial CA125 of&#xD;
      women with vague symptoms associated with ovarian and endometrial cancer did diagnose these&#xD;
      cancers earlier in the disease trajectory, with low-volume resectable disease, but only after&#xD;
      the cancer had already become Stage III. So the only way to detect these cancers in Stage I&#xD;
      is to screen asymptomatic women. Unfortunately, none of the currently available tests,&#xD;
      including TVUS and CA-125 have been shown to be useful for screening for ovarian or&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOvEEgene is a genomic uterine pap test developed by a McGill team to screen and detect these&#xD;
      cancers while they are confined to the gynecologic organs and curable by surgery. The test&#xD;
      identifies pathogenic somatic mutations (necessary early steps in the development of these&#xD;
      cancers), in uterine pap smears. Currently DOvEEgene is the only test that can discriminate&#xD;
      ovarian and endometrial cancers in peri- and postmenopausal women from benign gynecologic&#xD;
      disease common in that age group. It is able to do so by incorporating a deep&#xD;
      machine-learning derived classifier that can discriminate the mutational signature of these&#xD;
      cancers from benign disease with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 100% in a&#xD;
      population with high background mutational burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All previous testing was performed in a population of women already following standard of&#xD;
      care treatment for malignant or benign gynecological disease. The DOvEEgene test is now ready&#xD;
      to be tested as a phase III diagnostic test in the general population to see if these results&#xD;
      are just as promising in the community at large.&#xD;
