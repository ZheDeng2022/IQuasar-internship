    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic conditioning(RIC) is the phenomenon whereby brief cycles of ischemia and&#xD;
      reperfusion, applied to a distant organ, provide protection to the target organ. Dynamic&#xD;
      cerebral autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral blood flow, has been&#xD;
      proved to be critical for the occurrence,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular&#xD;
      disease. In this study, we hypothesis that RIC provides neuro-protection by means of&#xD;
      improving dCA.&#xD;

    <description>RIC was induced by 4 cycles of extremities ischemia (5-minute blood-pressure cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg, followed by 5-minute cuff deflation).All subjects will take 14 RIC intervention, blood collection and 10 dCA measurements.</description>

    <description>The RIC consisted of 4 cycles of extremities ischemia (5-minute blood pressure cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg, followed by 5-minute cuff deflation). The tourniquets were applied to one side upper arm. This intervention was undertaken twice a day for 7 days.</description>

    <description>Nurses will collect intravenous blood 3ml four times (at baseline and the first, seventh and eighth day of the study).The blood samples will be stored for laboratory test.The blood samples only use for the trial.</description>

    <description>Serial measurements of dCA were performed at 10 days, baseline, 1st, 2ed, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 21th and 35th of the study.The continuous ABP was measured non-invasively using a servo-controlled plethysmograph (Finometer Pro, the Netherlands) at the middle finger. Two 2 MHz transcranial Doppler probe was used to measure continuous cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) simultaneously in the bilateral middle cerebral arteries at a depth of 45-60 mm Endtidal CO2 was monitored using a capnograph (MultiDop X2, DWL, Sipplingen, Germany). The probes were placed over temporal windows and fixed with a customized head frame. CBFV and continuous arterial blood pressure were recorded simultaneously from each subject in the supine position for 10 minutes. All data were recorded for further assessment and analysis.</description>
