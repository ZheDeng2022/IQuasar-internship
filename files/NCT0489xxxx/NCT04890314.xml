      This study will use a population-based cohort design to study men with newly diagnosed low-&#xD;
      and intermediate-risk prostate cancer at high-volume centers in Southern California (SCa) and&#xD;
      New York State (NYS). Complications of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes, such as general health, urinary, sexual, and bowel function, cancer&#xD;
      anxiety, and treatment regret will be compared and tracked over the course of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed, solid organ tumor and the second most&#xD;
      common cause of cancer death in U.S. men. Technological advances have enabled new treatment&#xD;
      options, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and partial gland ablation (PGA).&#xD;
      Although heavily marketed as more convenient with fewer side effects, there is an absence of&#xD;
      high-level, comparative effective research (CER) to discern relative outcomes to traditional&#xD;
      therapies such as active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP) and intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that PGA will be associated with less reduction of urinary and&#xD;
      sexual function compared to before treatment than both RP and IMRT. SBRT is hypothesized to&#xD;
      be associated with less reduction of urinary and sexual function before treatment compared to&#xD;
      RP and IMRT. SBRT is hypothesized to be associated with less reduction in bowel function&#xD;
      compared to IMRT. PGA hypothesized to be associated with better overall quality of life at 12&#xD;
      months compared to AS. Investigators hypothesize PGA and SBRT will be associated with fewer&#xD;
      adverse events compared to RP and IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, population-based cohort study of men with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed low and intermediate risk prostate cancer in Southern California (SCa) and New York&#xD;
      State (NYS) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) regions to bridge the evidence&#xD;
      gap concerning adverse events and patient reported outcomes. This study will inform multiple&#xD;
      stakeholders, who contributed to the study design. Stakeholders include prostate cancer&#xD;
      survivors, payers, medical device manufacturers, professional organizations, community and&#xD;
      academic prostate cancer experts and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Adverse Events following Treatment by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.&#xD;
Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each adverse event based on the general guideline:&#xD;
Grade 1 - Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 - Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.&#xD;
Grade 3 - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living. Grade 4 - Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 - Death related to adverse event.</description>

    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) is a 26-item questionnaire, dichotomized by severity, assessing four domains: urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal function. Each domain is scored 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction.</description>

    <description>The Male Sexual Health Questionnaire - Ejaculatory Function and Related Distress (MSHQ-EjD) is a 4-item questionnaire measuring severity of ejaculatory dysfunction. Degrees of bother, ejaculatory force, ejaculatory volume, and frequency of ejaculation are measured on a scale of 0-5, with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction.</description>

    <description>The Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) is an 18-item questionnaire measuring treatment anxiety. It includes 11 items regarding prostate cancer anxiety, scored 0-33; 3 items regarding PSA testing and anxiety, scored 0-9; and 4 items regarding fear of recurrence, scored 0-12. Scores are combined, with a score of 27 or greater indicating significant anxiety.</description>
