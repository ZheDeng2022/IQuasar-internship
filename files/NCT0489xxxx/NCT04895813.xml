    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is an endoscopic procedure for diagnosing colon diseases. Patients should be&#xD;
      prepared 2-5 days in advance for this procedure and intestinal cleansing should be provided.&#xD;
      This is a difficult process and does not admit mistakes. The adequacy of the patient's&#xD;
      pre-preparation for this process increases the chances of success. For preliminary&#xD;
      preparation, it is recommended to train the patient and reinforce the trainings by phone.&#xD;
      Education given to the patient; It contributes positively to patient outcomes, the workload&#xD;
      of healthcare personnel in the institution, and costs. Therefore, this study has been&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is an endoscopic procedure for the diagnosis of colon diseases. For this&#xD;
      procedure, patients should be prepared 2-5 days in advance and intestinal cleansing should be&#xD;
      provided. Because the adequacy of bowel cleansing provides more accurate results than&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Pre-colonoscopy preparation process for the patient; It is very tiring and&#xD;
      challenging for reasons such as dieting, taking too much fluid and needing to defecate&#xD;
      constantly. After this difficult preparation period, the failure to obtain sufficient imaging&#xD;
      from the colonoscopy necessitates going back to the beginning. But patient; If he is informed&#xD;
      about the importance of this preparation, how it should be done, medication and fluid intake,&#xD;
      diet, and if he is guided, the chances of success in colonoscopy will increase. For this&#xD;
      reason, nursing education to be given to the patients before colonoscopy and the guidance of&#xD;
      the nurse will reduce the possibility of experiencing these negativities.For this reason,&#xD;
      this study was planned as a randomized control in order to obtain results with high evidence&#xD;
      value. Both a printed education booklet and a digital booklet will be used and guidance will&#xD;
      be provided by phone. As a result of this study; Before the colonoscopy procedure, a material&#xD;
      to be used in patient education will be prepared and a printed and digital educational&#xD;
      booklet will be provided to Necmettin Erbakan University. With the completion of the&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedure in one go: the drugs to be used will not be prescribed repeatedly, no&#xD;
      extra medication will be used, the patient will not be given multiple colonoscopy&#xD;
      appointments and the procedure will not be repeated. In this way, the workload of physicians&#xD;
      and nurses will not increase and the comfort of the patient will not be adversely affected.&#xD;
      All of these will provide cost effective results and positive patient outcomes. Publication&#xD;
      of the article will contribute to the literature.For this purpose, power analysis was&#xD;
      performed, sample size was determined, and a randomization list was created for the&#xD;
      participants. It has been planned in accordance with CONSORT. There will be 40 people in the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. The effect size of the study; 0.83, margin of error; 0.05 &amp;&#xD;
      power; It is 95%.&#xD;
