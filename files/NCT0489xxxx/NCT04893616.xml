  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Cameroon Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the birth dose vaccine for oral polio&#xD;
      vaccine (OPV-0) and tuberculosis vaccine (BCG), are recommended with a third birth dose&#xD;
      vaccine for hepatitis B (HepB-BD) being considered for introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Cameroon introduced the HepB antigen as part of the Pentavalent vaccine into the&#xD;
      immunization program in 2005, infants are currently unprotected until the first Penta shot at&#xD;
      six weeks. Introduction of HepB-BD is a key priority for the Cameroon government through the&#xD;
      National Cancer Strategy document as well as the Hepatitis Prevention and Treatment&#xD;
      Guidelines. However, the timeliness of administration of Hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours&#xD;
      of birth is critical to ensure the highest efficacy and prevent transmission of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While coverage rates for BCG and OPV 0 are relatively high (91% and 78% respectively), these&#xD;
      vaccines are often administered weeks or months after birth , not within the 24-hour&#xD;
      timeframe recommended for Hepatitis B birth dose. Therefore, there are concerns from the&#xD;
      Cameroon National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and other stakeholders on the&#xD;
      feasibility of achieving high timely coverage of HepB-BD. The timeliness of administration of&#xD;
      the birth dose vaccines within facilities relies on many system components including&#xD;
      integrated processes between maternity and immunization units and healthcare worker awareness&#xD;
      of birth dose administration guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of immunizing newborns with BCG&#xD;
      and OPV0 (and eventually HepB-BD) within 24 hours of birth by integrating routine&#xD;
      immunization into maternity and immediate newborn care in 15 facilities in Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the specific objectives of this pilot study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integrate birth dose immunizations into maternity and immediate newborn care services&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the change in proportion of newborn receiving birth doses BCG and OPV0 within 24&#xD;
           hours compared to baseline data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure the change in average age of babies receiving birth doses of BCG and OPV0&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the operational feasibility and acceptability of interventions and describe any&#xD;
           factors (barriers and enablers) that may influence further implementation of birth dose&#xD;
           strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility assessment is to provide quantitative findings of an intervention&#xD;
      integrating immunizations into maternity and newborn care across 15 health facilities in&#xD;
      Cameroon. Overall, in 20 weeks an intervention phase will be followed by a final assessment.&#xD;
      The approach will utilize quantitative data from healthcare worker surveys, the birth&#xD;
      registry and immunization registry, and maternity unit reporting forms. The study findings&#xD;
      will be used to inform strategy on HepB-BD introduction in Cameroon as well as interventions&#xD;
      to strengthen service delivery structures for newborns.&#xD;
