      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S (0.3&#xD;
      milliliter [mL] versus 0.5 mL) and to demonstrate non-inferiority (NI) of Ad26.COV2.S (0.3 mL&#xD;
      versus 0.5 mL), 28 days after vaccination.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs) for 7 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 (7 days after vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) AEs. Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily for 7 days post vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Systemic AEs for 7 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 (7 days after vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with solicited systemic AEs will be reported. Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer and also instructed to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis for 7 days after vaccination. Solicited systemic AEs are fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Unsolicited AEs for 28 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 (28 days after vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with unsolicited AEs will be reported. Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned in the participant diary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with AEs Leading to Study Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with AEs leading to study discontinuation will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product; is medically important.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with AESIs will be reported. AESIs are significant AEs that are judged to be of special interest because of clinical importance, known or suspected class effects, or based on nonclinical signals. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), a syndrome characterized by a combination of both a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia, is considered to be an AESI in this study. A suspected TTS case is defined as: Thrombotic events: suspected deep vessel venous or arterial thrombotic events; Thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count below 150,000/micro liter.</description>

    <measure>S Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (S-ELISA) Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) 28 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 (28 days after vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Non-inferiority (NI) will be assessed in terms of humoral immune response expressed by the GMCs of S-ELISA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus(-2) (SARS-CoV-2) S Protein Binding Antibody Concentrations as Measured by S-ELISA</measure>
