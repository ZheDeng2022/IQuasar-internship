  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits of a personalized treatment approach,&#xD;
      compared to a non-personalized treatment approach, for smoking cessation. In other words,&#xD;
      this study will help us know if recommending a specific medication to individual smokers will&#xD;
      make it easier to quit smoking than simply offering an option of medications. The specific&#xD;
      recommendation for a medication will be based on a test that measures how quickly a smoker&#xD;
      breaks down, or metabolizes, nicotine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promising new evidence suggests that applying a precision pharmacotherapy approach based on&#xD;
      the nicotine metabolite ration (NMR), a commercially available, genetically-informed marker&#xD;
      of nicotine metabolism rate can significantly improve cessation outcomes. Evidence from&#xD;
      multiple independent studies, including a recent randomized clinical trial (RCT),&#xD;
      demonstrates that matching slow metabolizers of nicotine with the nicotine patch and fast&#xD;
      metabolizers of nicotine with varenicline can maximize treatment response and minimize side&#xD;
      effects. While encouraging, a critical gap in knowledge is how to best translate a precision&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy approach into a hospital-based smoking cessation intervention and improve&#xD;
      cessation rates for underserved smokers. Preliminary data suggest that personalized treatment&#xD;
      recommendations may increase smoking cessation medication uptake and effectiveness. Thus, the&#xD;
      scientific premise of this application is that integrating a precision pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      approach into a hospital-based smoking cessation program will increase medication uptake and&#xD;
      effectiveness, with particular relevance for smokers from underserved communities.&#xD;
