    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive observational study (first results cross-sectional study, second&#xD;
      results longitudinal study). The participants of the study will be exposed to a dialogue with&#xD;
      the robot EBO. The user and the therapist's acceptability of the robot, the robot-user&#xD;
      interaction during the conversation and the conversation parameters will be assessed.&#xD;

      the robot EBO. The user and the therapist's acceptability of the robot will be measure. Also&#xD;
      the robot-user interaction during the conversation and the conversation parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed. The assessements will be done at week 0 and at week 3. During weeks 1 and 2 the&#xD;
      robot will be present in the therapeutic activities of the center.&#xD;

    <description>User acceptability of the robot measured with the Technology Acceptance Model. This scale has good validity and reliability, with a Cronbach's alpha value above 0.8 (Alenazy, Mugahed Al-Rahmi, &amp; Khan, 2019). It assesses the following dimensions relating to the technology product:&#xD;
Perceived ease of use: the extent to which users believe that using a particular system would improve their performance.&#xD;
Perceived usefulness: the extent to which the individual believes that using the system will be effortless&#xD;
Attitude towards use&#xD;
Relevance&#xD;
A higher scores indicates a higher acceptability.</description>

    <description>User acceptability of the robot measured with a questionnaire designed by the authors of the study. The questionnaire has 10 items that evaluate the acceptability of the robot by the user. This 10 questions have 3 choice answer with the options being yes, no, I don not know. There is one open question to collect qualitative data a¡regarding the dialogue and the acceptability.</description>

    <description>EBO is a robotic platform consisting of the following: A screen display capable of generating emotions (sadness, joy, neutral, anger, disgust and surprise), RGB camera, basic navigation system.&#xD;
EBO must be controlled by a teleoperator through a user-friendly and simple interface. Communication should be as immediate as possible, as well as predefined. In any case, the dialogue flow can be modified if necessary. The interface, at the same time, allows the possibility of sending emotions and small movements to the robot, to accompany the dialogue with certain elements of emotionality.&#xD;
The experiment replicates the Wizard of Oz technique. In this technique, the human tele-operator controls the robot without the person noticing it as he is in another room. For this purpose, a user interface will be displayed on the teleoperator's terminal and the commands will be reproduced by the EBO robot</description>
