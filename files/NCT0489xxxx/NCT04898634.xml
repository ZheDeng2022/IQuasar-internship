      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of&#xD;
      JNJ-78278343 in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and the safety at the RP2Ds in Part 2 (Dose&#xD;
      Expansion).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JNJ-78278343 is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig)G1-based bispecific antibody designed to&#xD;
      direct T lymphocytes (T cells) to human kallikrein 2 (hK2or KLK2) positive target tumor&#xD;
      cells. One arm of JNJ-78278343 binds to the cluster of differentiation (CD)3 receptor complex&#xD;
      present on T cells and the other arm binds to KLK2 present on target tumor cells leading to&#xD;
      the activation of the T cells and T-cell-mediated lysis of the KLK2 bearing tumor cells.&#xD;
      JNJ-78278343 is being developed for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (mCRPC). KLK2 expression is highly restricted in normal tissues and highly enriched in&#xD;
      prostate adenocarcinoma and its expression is mostly maintained throughout disease&#xD;
      progression, making KLK2 an attractive target for therapy. This study will be conducted in 2&#xD;
      phases: a Screening Phase (up to 30 days), a Treatment Phase (start of study drug&#xD;
      administration) with an end of treatment (EOT) visit (up to 30 plus 14 days after last dose&#xD;
      of study drug or prior to the start of a new anticancer therapy), whichever comes first). The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is up to 1 year and 10 months. Safety assessment will include&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), serious adverse events (SAEs),&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical safety laboratory assessments,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and neurologic examination.&#xD;
