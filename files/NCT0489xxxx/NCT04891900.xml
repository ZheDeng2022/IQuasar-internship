    <description>In this study, all subjects were treated with TQB2450 (PD-L1 inhibitor) plus anlotinib combined with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, once every 3 weeks, six cycles of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Subsequently, TQB2450 (PD-L1 inhibitor) combined with anlotinib was maintained until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up or death, or other circumstances that the researcher judged should stop treatment, whichever occurred first.</description>
