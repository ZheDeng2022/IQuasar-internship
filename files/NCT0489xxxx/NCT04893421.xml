      The proposed trial is a non-randomized, multi-center, sequential arm registry evaluating&#xD;
      clinical, and health economic outcomes following treatment with the Magnetic Occult Lesion&#xD;
      Localization Instrument (MOLLI), an approved instrument for Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS)&#xD;
      in patients with non-palpable lesions. All patients who have an area of concern in the breast&#xD;
      and are identified by their physician as good candidates for BCS are eligible to participate.&#xD;
      Patients will eventually be enrolled across 3 surgical sites (Sunnybrook Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre - primary site, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and North York General Hospital) over&#xD;
      a 2 year period. Patient and system-related outcome measures will first be collected using&#xD;
      the centre-specific standard of care (Wire-Guided Localization or Radioactive Seed&#xD;
      Localization for BCS) to establish a baseline. Subsequently, centers will transition to the&#xD;
      MOLLI system, recording corresponding outcomes to be used for temporal comparison. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this study is to evaluate clinical and health economic outcomes with&#xD;
      MOLLI compared to standard-of-care approaches.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contemporary breast cancer management, more than 70% of breast cancer patients are&#xD;
      eligible for - and select - breast-conserving therapy (BCS). However, issues with cosmesis,&#xD;
      patient experience, and treatment workflow efficiency during the therapeutic process have&#xD;
      considerable room for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCS consists of a surgical procedure whereby the suspicious tumor and a rim of surrounding&#xD;
      normal tissue are removed. Up to one-third of all diagnosed breast cancers are&#xD;
      non-palpable,and require some form of pre-operative localization to guide precise surgical&#xD;
      excision. Currently, options for localization of non-palpable lesions are suboptimal in terms&#xD;
      of patient experience, healthcare system resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common approaches is radioactive seed localization (RSL). RSL consists of&#xD;
      insertion of a small radioactive seed under ultrasound guidance to mark the center and/or&#xD;
      borders of the tumor. During the procedure the surgeon uses a hand-held probe to detect the&#xD;
      seed and guide surgical excision of the lesion intra-operatively. While RSL is effective the&#xD;
      use of a radioactive source is and poses many challenges for patients and staff. Another&#xD;
      common approach is wired-guided localization (WGL). WGL involves implantation of a hooked&#xD;
      wire to mark the center or outer edges of the lesion. Due to modest cost and relative ease of&#xD;
      use, WGL use is widespread, however disadvantages include significant patient discomfort,&#xD;
      possible migration of the implanted wire, and potential difficulties in localizing axillary&#xD;
      lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT ARE THE INVESTIGATORS DOING?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative team of surgeons and scientists are examining an alternative approach to&#xD;
      BCS called magnetic occult lesion localization and imaging (MOLLI). Analogous to RSL, this&#xD;
      procedure involves implantation of a small passive magnetic seed - under ultrasound or&#xD;
      mammographic imaging guidance - directly into or surrounding the tumor; during the procedure&#xD;
      the surgeon uses a novel hand-held probe to intra-operatively detect the position of this&#xD;
      seed and remove the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY IS THE STUDY BEING CONDUCTED?&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOLLI offers many of the same benefits as RSL but without any radiation. MOLLI also has the&#xD;
      potential to be more effective and accurate than other localization methods. MOLLI has&#xD;
      recently been evaluated as part of a phase I clinical trial and was demonstrated to be a safe&#xD;
      and effective localization technology. The goal for the current trial is to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      and health economic outcomes with MOLLI compared to standard-of-care approaches to help&#xD;
      improve access to a wireless, low-cost, but effective breast lesion localization technology&#xD;
      for breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, researchers will 1) evaluate identify barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      related to MOLLI based on feedback from clinical staff, 2) demonstrate cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      MOLLI and 3) gather information on the participants' experience with the MOLLI seed. At each&#xD;
      site, the first 25 participants will be treated with the standard of care for BCS (RSL or&#xD;
      WGL), and the second 25 participants will be treated with MOLLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      No side effects are expected from the study treatments. Possible risks associated with using&#xD;
      MOLLI include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small risk of bleeding A remote risk of allergic reaction to nickel contained in the MOLLI&#xD;
      seeds&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE STUDY?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted by a study team member up to and including 16 weeks (6.5&#xD;
      months) after the procedure to take part in a short telephone questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
