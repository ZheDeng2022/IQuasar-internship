    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a motor learning-based postural and&#xD;
      reaching control intervention delivered with the robotic Trunk-Support-Trainer (TruST)&#xD;
      compared to the same motor learning-based intervention delivered with Static Trunk Support&#xD;
      Equipment in children with cerebral palsy (CP) classified as III and IV with the Gross Motor&#xD;
      Function Classification System (GMFCS).&#xD;

      This study is a prospective Clinical Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in a group of 82 children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy. The experimental and control groups will receive effective&#xD;
      postural-reaching training based on motor learning and control principles. In both groups,&#xD;
      participants will engage in play and functional activities that elicit arm movement and&#xD;
      challenge trunk postural control, and the motor tasks and activities will be progressed. The&#xD;
      main difference is that the experimental group will be trained with TruST in order to add&#xD;
      postural task-progression via assistive force fields; which will be tailored to the child's&#xD;
      sitting control balance status across training sessions. However, in the control group,&#xD;
      postural task-progression will be addressed by lowering the level of rigid trunk support&#xD;
      segment by segment across training sessions. The trunk subregion where the support is placed&#xD;
      will depend on the child's trunk control ability.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinically validated test in CP that measures proactive postural control during maximal reaching distance. It takes into account motor planning and unidirectional control of the trunk in the sagittal/frontal planes during the reach in sitting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postural Star-Sitting Test (PSST) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This postural assessment will be performed prior to and after training sessions to monitor sitting control progression in both TruST- and control-intervention groups. In sitting, the child performs eight star-shaped maximal trunk displacements while displacing a large ball with the head. The investigators have several motivations that rationalize this customized measurement: 1) it is age-appropriate, 2) it is goal-oriented, 3) it directly measures sitting based on trunk control improvements, 4) it is sensitive to capture symmetrical and asymmetrical increases in the sitting workspace area (cm2), and 5) it offers data with a straightforward functional interpretation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Box and Blocks Test (BBT) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The B&amp;B is a validated test in CP to examine manual dexterity. The child moves the maximum number of blocks (2.5cm2), one at a time, between compartments of a partitioned box within. Video-coding of reaching performance (arm displacement and grasping) during the B&amp;B will be analyzed with Datavyu. A manual will be created to define the reaching variables and to standardize video-coding procedures. Grasping will be defined as the time window from the moment the hand contacts the block to the time this is lifted from the surface. Arm displacement will be defined as the time to transport the block (from end of grasping to its release). Reaching performance will be the summation of grasping and arm displacement. Two coders will be used to determine inter-rater reliability between video-coders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gross Motor Function Measure-Item Set (GMFM-IS) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GMFM-IS determines the gross motor function of children. It is an abbreviated and validated version of the GMFM-66, which provides information on the level of difficulty of each item to define motor goals to attain. It uses an algorithm with three critical decision items to determine which one of the four items sets is most appropriate for a child's level of functioning. Similarly to the GMFM-66, the GMFM-IS scores gross motor function across five dimensions (A: lying and rolling, B: sitting, C: crawling, D: standing and E: walking, running &amp; jumping).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM will be used to investigate perceived parent- and child-based goals and preferences that are specific to motor impediments in seated posture and upper extremities abilities that restrict participation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participation and Environment Measure - Children and Youth (PEM-CY) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEM-CY measure participation-home, school and community-including environmental factors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Seated Postural &amp; Reaching Control (SP&amp;R-co) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SP&amp;R-co has been validated in children with CP, and it mainly targets children with moderate-to-severe CP within a play-oriented framework. The test framework is built upon principles of postural control and falls under the definition of &quot;body function and body structure&quot; category of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: children and youth version. The SP&amp;R-co has been constructed following a segment-by-segment approach, as the one found in the SATCo, to assess quantitatively postural sitting control across static, active, proactive via bimanual and unimanual reaches, and reactive dimensions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postural and Reaching Kinematics after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kinematics data collections will follow the postural framework validated in the Seated Postural &amp; Reaching Control (SP&amp;R-co) test to capture the potential motor improvements in the postural and reaching control capabilities of children.&#xD;
The investigators will measure:&#xD;
Static Seated Task: Postural orientation and balance during sitting for 10s. Active Seated Task: The simultaneous control steady trunk position during head rotations when the child follows an object 90degrees to the right and left.&#xD;
Proactive Seated Task: Optimal postural sitting control via anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments (APAs and CPAs, respectively) when children execute direction-specific reaches straight and 45degrees right and left.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SATCo is a clinical tool validated in children with CP. With the SATCo, the evaluator offers support at 7 different trunk segments (shoulders, axillae, inferior angle of scapulae, on lower ribs, below lower ribs, and pelvis). It measures segmental trunk control across 3 dimensions: static-during 5s-proactive-visually following an object-and reactive postural responses to external nudges. The scores are from 0 (no head control) to 7 (full trunk control) and identify the trunk segment where the child loses trunk balance control-when one, or more, postural dimension is absent.</description>
