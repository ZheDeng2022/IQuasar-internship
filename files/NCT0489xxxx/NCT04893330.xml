  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutricia wants to launch a real-life study, to see how the presence of prebiotics and&#xD;
      probiotics in the boosted protein hydrolyzate can improve symptoms in the first weeks of use,&#xD;
      and supplement the efficacy and safety data of the drug. formula, collected during clinical&#xD;
      trials, with real life use. The target population will be children with a definite or&#xD;
      suspected diagnosis of APLV, who have never taken a hypoallergenic formula, for whom the&#xD;
      doctor decides to prescribe the Pepsicate Syneo formula, regardless of the clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of the allergy. These children will be included before the age of 8 months and&#xD;
      will be seen again 4 weeks after the prescription. The data from this real-life study will&#xD;
      also better characterize the profile of infants taking Pepsicate Syneo. Finally, the&#xD;
      perception of the formula by the parents will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutricia has developed an infant formula intended for children, APLV, from the class of&#xD;
      foodstuffs intended for special medical purposes (DADFMS), called Pepticate Syneo. This&#xD;
      hypoallergenic formula is based on high hydrolyzate of whey protein. It also contains:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IcFOS and scGOS prebiotic fibers. These oligosaccharides are well tolerated and promote&#xD;
           the induction of a favorable gut microbiota and an improvement in faecal characteristics&#xD;
           [Arslanoglu 2008, Moro 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The probiotic strain Bifidobaterium Breve M-16V. B. breve is the most common species of&#xD;
           bifidobacteria in human milk [Martin 2009]. The B. breve M16-V strain, isolated from the&#xD;
           stool of a healthy infant, is approved in food by health authorities and conforms to the&#xD;
           recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics [2000]. It helps promote the&#xD;
           implantation of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of young children&#xD;
           [Akiyama 1994, Taniuchi 2005, van der Aa 2010]. Preclinical data suggest that it reduces&#xD;
           the allergic immune response [Hougee 2010, Inoue 2009]. In clinical studies, it helps&#xD;
           reduce atopic dermatitis in children with APLV [Hattori 2003, Taniuchi 2005]. In&#xD;
           addition, the prebiotic / probiotic combination (also called symbiotic) shows a&#xD;
           synergistic effect in mice in reducing allergic manifestations [Schouten 2009]. Used in&#xD;
           children born by cesarean section, it helps restore intestinal colonization by&#xD;
           bifidobacteria, to a level similar to that of infants born vaginally and breastfed [Chua&#xD;
           2017].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In babies with a suspicion of non-IgE-mediated APLV, this symbiotic mixture (IcFOS, scGOS and&#xD;
      B. Breve) allowed a modification of the fecal microbiota in 8 weeks, thus approaching the&#xD;
      microbiota of breastfed infants of the same age, with an increase in Bifidobacteria and a&#xD;
      decrease in Eubacterium rectale / Clostridium coccoides [Fox 2019].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the available scientific data suggest an excellent tolerance of the Pepticate Syneo&#xD;
      formula, and therapeutic efficacy on the manifestations of APLV, whether or not it is&#xD;
      mediated by IgE, while ensuring the nutritional needs of children's growth.&#xD;
