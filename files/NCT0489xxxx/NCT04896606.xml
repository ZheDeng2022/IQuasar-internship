  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a global pandemic secondary to a novel&#xD;
      coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2. The reported case-fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2 in the United&#xD;
      States is 1.8% with a current death toll of &gt;300,000 and climbing.4 There is no accepted&#xD;
      standard of care or FDA approved therapies for treatment of COVID-19. Virus specific&#xD;
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have become an important part of the treatment landscape for&#xD;
      viral reactivation post hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation. Donor derived CTLs&#xD;
      have been shown to be safe and effective against a variety of viruses including CMV, EBV, BK&#xD;
      and adenovirus. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 specific CTLs generated from a previously&#xD;
      infected family donor will be safe and effective for treatment of COVID-19 in family members&#xD;
      with mild to moderate disease.&#xD;
