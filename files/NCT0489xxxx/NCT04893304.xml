    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized comparative split study will be conducted at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic, Dermatology department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University and will include 20&#xD;
      patients with acanthosis nigricans in otherwise healthy individuals which will be recruited&#xD;
      and assessed for eligibility for inclusion according to the above criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed written consent will be taken from every patient prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history taking including onset, course, duration of the disease and occupation&#xD;
           (sun-exposed or not), predisposing factors, history of keloid tendency, associated&#xD;
           diseases and previous treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of skin type, BMI, degree of AN, HbA1C, site of lesions in all patients and&#xD;
           degree of improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography: will evaluate the clinical response to treatment for each patient Photos&#xD;
           will be taken before starting the study, before every session, and two weeks after the&#xD;
           last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanin index (MI) will be measured using reflectance spectrophotometer in order to&#xD;
           assess the degree of hyperpigmentation before starting the study and two weeks after the&#xD;
           last session. Research Template 8 Final Version: April 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acanthosis Nigricans Area and Severity Index (ANASI) score (Zaki et al., 2018) will be&#xD;
           done for all patients before starting the study and two weeks after the last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction score will be assessed before starting the study and two weeks&#xD;
           after the last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient evaluation (clinical percentage of improvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      One side of the affected area will be randomly assigned to fractional CO2 laser every four&#xD;
      weeks for three months. The other side will be assigned to Q-switched Nd:YAG laser every four&#xD;
      weeks for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using closed envelopes containing cards with fractional CO2 Rt and fractional CO2 Lt and the&#xD;
      patient will draw one of them blindly. The assessment will be done by blinded investigator.&#xD;
      Post-operative: Patients will be instructed to avoid sun exposure for one week after the&#xD;
      session and regular use of sun block in between sessions.&#xD;
