      Observational study assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentations and&#xD;
      admission to hospital in children and young adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare utilisation and delivery for&#xD;
      children and young adults. This is despite them experiencing minimal morbidity and almost no&#xD;
      mortality as a direct result of the pandemic. The immediate impact of the first lockdown in&#xD;
      April 2020 has been well documented. A number of studies show a marked reduction in&#xD;
      presentations of children and young adults to the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is now, are these trends continuing and are they particularly impacting on&#xD;
      specific groups and on specific presentations? With these data, services can be modified to&#xD;
      minimise any potential for deleterious effects. It may also be possible to target groups who&#xD;
      are not utilising health services as we would expect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use fully anonymised routine data on presentations and admission of 0 to 24 years&#xD;
      olds to University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Data will be graphed to show&#xD;
      trends in activity before and after the start of the pandemic. An interrupted time series&#xD;
      regression analysis will be used to assess the significance of any changes in trends.&#xD;
