  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      there is no such article found who specifies the effects of sensory integration therapies&#xD;
      like vestibular stimulation technique or developmental milestone while controlling the gender&#xD;
      of children with cerebral palsy. So, there is a need to do more research work on this in&#xD;
      future to find out best treatment approach for children with cerebral palsy of their&#xD;
      respective gender. That is why this study will focus on the results of vestibular stimulation&#xD;
      and neurodevelopmental technique while controlling the Gender distribution of both&#xD;
      intervention groups to find out the effects of these interventions that wither, they have&#xD;
      some influence on the participants or not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bobath concept of neurodevelopment in children with cerebral palsy, is a problem-solving&#xD;
      approach to the assessment and treatment of individuals with disturbances of tone, movement,&#xD;
      and function due to a lesion of CNS, the goal of treatment is to optimize function by&#xD;
      improving postural control and selective movement through facilitation. But also, no study&#xD;
      found which specifically focuses the improvements on boys and girl's ratio or their&#xD;
      gender-based improvements of tone or developmental milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different swings such as Infant Swing, frog swing, platform swing will be included as mode of&#xD;
      Vestibular stimulation treatment. On the other side, Stimulation of vestibular system&#xD;
      improved child's postural control and motor function in many studies.&#xD;

    <description>Infant Neurological International Battery ( INFANIB) is the developmental screening tool used for the assessment of neuromotor development in neonates and infants aged 1-18 months. The score of each item is mentioned in the score sheet itself based upon age and calculating total score will determine the neuromotor state of infants.</description>

    <measure>GMFM-88</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a Standardized Observational Instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in children with Cerebral Palsy. The GMFM-88 item scores can be summed to calculate raw and percent scores for each of the five GMFM dimensions of interest, selected goal areas and a total GMFM-88 score.</description>

After that, in 5th and 6th weeks, all participants will be given Infant Swing for 30 minutes and frog swing for 30 minutes for two weeks. Next 7th and 8th weeks, Infant Swing (30 minutes) and prone on frog swing feet touching the floor (30 minutes), trice a day will be applied. In 9th week, Infant swing and normal playground swing for 30,30 minutes will be given to all participants, trice a day. In Last week of intervention i.e., 10th week, all participants will be given Infant Swing for 30 minutes and standing on platform swing (30 minutes) trice a day.</description>
