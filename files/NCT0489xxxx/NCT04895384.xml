  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop a novel perioperative noninvasive delivery of oxygen (DO2) and&#xD;
      hemodynamic index in the prediction of postoperative outcomes including post-operative acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (POAKI), perioperative neurological cognitive disorders (PONCD) and&#xD;
      post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study also aims to study the effect of DO2 and hemodynamic parameters (measured&#xD;
      noninvasively) on the development of PONCD, POAF and POAKI in cardiac surgical patients. We&#xD;
      aim to develop a novel DO2 index and hemodynamic index predictive of PONCD, POAF and POAKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim would be to develop real-time machine learning aided algorithms in the&#xD;
      analysis of noninvasive continuous hemodynamic and DO2 data, to predict and guide&#xD;
      perioperative treatment of POCND, POAF and POAKI in the perioperative setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute kidney injury, AF and neurocognitive disorders (POAKI, POAF and PONCD)&#xD;
      are common complications post cardiac surgery. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders occur&#xD;
      in up to 73% of cardiac surgical patients, while our previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      incidence of POAF and POAKI to be 14.7% and 29.9% respectively. These perioperative&#xD;
      complications have been shown to be associated with adverse short and long term outcomes.&#xD;
      Apart from increased hospital length of stay and mortality, their adverse effects also extend&#xD;
      far beyond the acute perioperative period of insult. Postoperative AKI has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with progression to long term renal dysfunction. Postoperative atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      was initially thought to be a benign phenomenon, however, it has been shown to be associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of long term stroke and mortality (Hazards Ratio 1.26 and 1.2&#xD;
      respectively). Postoperative delirium has is also associated with accelerated cognitive&#xD;
      decline in Alzheimer's patients, long term cognitive decline, dementia and functional decline&#xD;
      after discharge to the community. These phenomena remain ever pertinent in the setting of&#xD;
      high risk and aging surgical patients, and thus need to be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for hemodynamic optimisation and goal directed therapy remains central to current&#xD;
      care standards in anesthesia. This highlights the need for the quantification and improvement&#xD;
      of cardiac output and more recently, the emerging focus on perioperative oxygen delivery&#xD;
      (DO2) in improving clinical outcomes. Oxygen delivery can be calculated based on the oxygen&#xD;
      flux equation: DO2 = CO x (Hb x SaO2 x 1.36); this concept of optimizing systemic oxygen&#xD;
      delivery rather than hemodynamic parameters alone has been increasingly studied in recent&#xD;
      times. Emerging studies involving patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have&#xD;
      demonstrated the optimization of DO2, nadir DO2 and duration below optimum DO2 to be the most&#xD;
      specific factors of postoperative AKI . The importance of optimizing DO2 in improving&#xD;
      clinical outcomes is also evidenced in the critical care period, where Raimundo et al&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that patents with a mean DO2 Index of 325ml/min/m2 were at significant&#xD;
      risk of developing AKI which progressed to chronic renal failure, as opposed to patients who&#xD;
      maintained a mean DO2 Index of &gt;405ml/min/m2 . The utility of optimizing DO2 in the avoidance&#xD;
      of postoperative delirium and atrial fibrillation however remain unknown, with previous&#xD;
      studies being retrospective, small in sample size with conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring has been used extensively in the development of&#xD;
      perioperative goal directed therapy protocols and hemodynamic optimization. Parameters such&#xD;
      as MAP, CI and SVV are commonplace in the operative and ICU settings, and are used to titrate&#xD;
      fluid, vasopressor and inotrope use. However, a delicate balance between pressure (CI, MAP)&#xD;
      and flow (SVRI) exists in systemic organ perfusion, which may be translated into clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as POAF, POAKI and PONCD. Separate studies have demonstrated variations in&#xD;
      vascular resistance to be associated with increased risk of postoperative delirium and AKI,&#xD;
      despite the maintenance of high MAP levels. These studies indicate the possible inadequacy of&#xD;
      MAP as the sole marker of systemic organ perfusion, and the need for further hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters to be studied. Our study would be the first to investigate the interplay between&#xD;
      these SVV, SVRI, CI and MAP using non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, this monitoring of continuous hemodynamics required invasive lines, while the&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of DO2 was previously impossible. The use of invasive lines has been&#xD;
      associated with multiple complications including infection, thrombosis and vascular&#xD;
      aneurysms, while continuous DO2 monitoring would involve continuous point of care testing of&#xD;
      hemoglobin which is impractical. Therefore, the risk benefit ratio of placing invasive lines&#xD;
      remains controversial particularly in the routine well patient who however remains at risk of&#xD;
      perioperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of new technology has allowed for the real-time noninvasive continuous individual&#xD;
      measurement of hemodynamics and oxygen delivery. We propose the integration of 2 new devices&#xD;
      so as to provide the continuous noninvasive monitoring of hemodynamic data and real-time&#xD;
      noninvasive hemoglobin and oxygen saturation - the combination of which would enable us to&#xD;
      calculate real time systemic oxygen delivery. Continuous noninvasive hemodynamic data (the&#xD;
      Edwards Clearsight) is based on oscillonometry and the Penaz technique which has been&#xD;
      historically established and used in clinical practice. Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation monitoring (the Masimo SET) has been validated, and is based on established&#xD;
      principles of spectrophotometry, oximetry and the beer lambert's law . With technological&#xD;
      improvements over the years, these noninvasive devices have been individually evaluated&#xD;
      against clinical gold standards in multiple studies and found to be clinically applicable in&#xD;
      predicting perioperative hemoglobin and hemodynamic trends . Therefore, we propose the novel&#xD;
      integrated use of these two devices in deriving a real-time noninvasive DO2 and hemodynamic&#xD;
      index predictive of postoperative atrial fibrillation, AKI and cognitive dysfunction in&#xD;
      cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated use of a noninvasive DO2 and hemodynamic index has yet to be studied in the&#xD;
      context of POAF, POAKI and PONCD. Data obtained through our study may facilitate the&#xD;
      development of new integrative technology, paving the way for the development of single index&#xD;
      which can predict organ specific perfusion. This rich source of continuous noninvasive data&#xD;
      will be used in the development of algorithms and mathematical models in machine learning.&#xD;
      This would allow for the provision of precise goal directed therapy to moderate or high-risk&#xD;
      surgical patients, especially beneficial to the geriatric setting. The potential reductions&#xD;
      in POAF, PONCD and POAKI achieved through the clinical application of our study findings&#xD;
      confer significant perioperative benefits which extend into the community health setting due&#xD;
      to the long-term sequelae of these diseases.&#xD;
