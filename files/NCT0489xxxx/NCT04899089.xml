  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults (60+ years of age) who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment and insomnia&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to cognitive training or trivia training and will complete measures&#xD;
      of anxiety, sleep, cognition (objective, self-efficacy), and arousal at baseline, and&#xD;
      post-intervention. For cognitive training, participants will be provided with login&#xD;
      information to access the computerized training, and will complete 8 weeks (45 mins 3x/week)&#xD;
      of cognitive training. For trivia training, participants will receive weekly emails that&#xD;
      contain trivia assignments that they will complete for 8 weeks (45 mins 3x/week). We will&#xD;
      evaluate short-term (i.e., post-training) effects of the two training conditions on&#xD;
      subjective anxiety, sleep, arousal, and subjective and objective cognition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory that asks respondents to rate how true 20 self-descriptive statements (e.g., I feel calm) are on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all, 4 = very much so). Typically, respondents are asked to rate statements according to how they generally feel (trait-anxiety scale) and how they feel in the current moment (state-anxiety scale). Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater maladjustment.</description>
