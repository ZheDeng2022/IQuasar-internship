    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Androgens can&#xD;
      stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy can fight prostate cancer by&#xD;
      androgen deprivation. It is not yet known if neoadjuvant radiation therapy is a more&#xD;
      effective therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Two-stage randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy and hormone therapy followed by radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk&#xD;
      locally advanced prostate cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Success rate of salvage radiation therapy (SRT) measured as pathologic complete response&#xD;
      (pCR) or pathologic near complete response (minimal residual disease, MRD) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. PSA decline rate after neoadjuvant treatment, rate of undetectable PSA after RP, rate of&#xD;
      positive surgical margin, and rate of pathologic down-staging (≤ ypT2N0) II. Biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival rate (from date of randomization). III. Metastasis free survival.&#xD;
      IV. Prostate Cancer Death. V. Overall Survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive neoadjuvant hormone and radiation therapy, and then radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy, and then radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intervention, participants are followed up periodically for up to 20 years.&#xD;
