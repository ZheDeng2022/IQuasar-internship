  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic have brought negative social and psychological&#xD;
      consequences on people and limited patients' access to hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, &quot;telemedicine&quot; and, specifically, &quot;tele-nutrition&quot; (in nutritional field)&#xD;
      allows remotely monitor and support food allergic patients subjected to restricted diets&#xD;
      using information and communication technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focus attention on patients with diagnosis of Systemic Nickel Allergic&#xD;
      Syndrome (SNAS) undergoing low-nickel diet to evaluate nutritional and psychological states&#xD;
      through tele-nutrition tools during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are: (a) to investigate dietary-nutritional status and, (b) to assess&#xD;
      quality of life and adherence to dietary therapy before and after 30-day personalized diet&#xD;
      therapy through tele-nutrition tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject enrolled in the study goes allergological work-up to assess diagnosis of SNAS&#xD;
      and following procedures: (a) face-to-face visit (nutritional visit and quality of life&#xD;
      evaluation) concluding with prescription of one of five personalized and balanced dietary&#xD;
      plans different for calory intake, (b) video call visit for dietary evaluation and assessment&#xD;
      of adherence to diet after 15 days, and (c) video call visit for dietary and quality of life&#xD;
      evaluation and assessment of adherence to diet therapy after 30 days (end of study).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no previous studies focused on the tele-nutrition for the evaluation of&#xD;
      dietary-nutritional status of patients suffered from Systemic Nickel Allergic Syndrome&#xD;
      (SNAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are (a) to investigate dietary-nutritional status (primary outcome)&#xD;
      and, (b) to assess quality of life (QoL) and adherence to dietary therapy (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes) of SNAS patients before and after personalized diet therapy through tele-nutrition&#xD;
      tools at time of COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators perform a prospective, single-center, observational study enrolling SNAS&#xD;
      patients in order to evaluate dietary-nutritional status and QoL, before and after 30-day&#xD;
      personalized diet therapy, and adherence to low Ni diet, through tele-nutrition tools, during&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed at the Allergology Unit and Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition Unit of&#xD;
      Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients give their signed informed consent to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators enroll patients with (a) history of SNAS (coexistence of typical cutaneous&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal symptoms); (b) positive Nickel (Ni)-patch test; (c) clinical improvement&#xD;
      of at least 70% from baseline after 4 weeks of low-Ni diet; (d) positivity of a double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled oral Ni challenge (DBPCO). Exclusion criteria include (a) age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
      and &gt;65 years; (b) other organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as peptic ulcer,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, gastrointestinal infections, and small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth; (c) diabetes mellitus; (d) hepatic, renal or cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction; (e) thyroid disease or tumour; (f) concomitant treatment with steroids and/or&#xD;
      antihistamines in the previous 4 weeks; (g) pregnancy and lactation; (h) smoking, abuse of&#xD;
      alcohol, coffee, tea, and cola intake, and (i) inability to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients go pre-diet face-to-face visit (time 0, T0), complete 30-day personalized diet and,&#xD;
      then, go follow-up remote visit through video call (time 2, T2). A further video call is&#xD;
      performed 15 days after the start of the diet therapy treatment (time 1, T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses the commercially available online platform Microsoft Teams, which is included&#xD;
      in the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS's Microsoft Office 365 package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables The investigators select two primary outcome measurements (dietary assessment and&#xD;
      anthropometric data) to evaluate dietary-nutritional status of SNAS patients. Moreover, the&#xD;
      investigators adopt Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36v2) questionnaire as tool to&#xD;
      evaluate QoL (secondary outcome). Finally, adherence to diet therapy (secondary outcome) is&#xD;
      investigated through video call at T1 and T2.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 face-to-face visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary assessment: nutritional history and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of anthropometric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL evaluation. Each patient answers SF-36v2 (Italian version) questionnaire. At the end&#xD;
           of visit, each patient receives one of 5 dietary plans, different only for energy intake&#xD;
           (1400-1600-1800-2000-2100 Kcal/day). The choice depended on the personalized energy&#xD;
           needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All dietary plans include foods with low-Ni content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 video call visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary assessment: collection of anthropometric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of adherence to dietary therapy through question &quot;How many days a week did&#xD;
           the participant adhere to the prescribed dietary treatment? - Two possible mutually&#xD;
           exclusive answers: 1) &lt;5 days a week, 2) ≥ 5 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2 video call visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary evaluation: collection of anthropometric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of adherence to the dietary treatment.&#xD;
