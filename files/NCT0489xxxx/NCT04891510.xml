  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in efficacy of fat grafting technique, as measured by 3D volumetric scanning at the surgical site</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>3D volumetric scanning assesses the fat graft retention defined as the ratio of fat remaining at the surgical site at 90 day follow-up to that at pre-operative baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient satisfaction of fat grafting technique, as measured by the BREAST-Q questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BREAST-Q questionnaire is used for measuring pre- and postoperative psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being, satisfaction with breasts, experience of care, and satisfaction with outcome. Scores range on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of palpable masses from the fat grafting technique, as measured by a physical exam.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical exam will provide the number of palpable masses at the surgical site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of lesions of probable fat necrosis from the fat grafting technique, as measured by a physical exam</measure>
    <time_frame>90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical exam will provide the number of lesions of probable fat necrosis at the surgical site</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of infection from the fat grafting technique, as measured by a physical exam</measure>
    <time_frame>90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical exam will show if there is infection present at the surgical site. This is a binary &quot;yes/no&quot; item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence seroma from the fat grafting technique, as measured by a physical exam</measure>
    <time_frame>90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical exam will show if there is seroma present at the surgical site. This is a binary &quot;yes/no&quot; item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of wound healing from the fat grafting technique, as measured by a physical exam</measure>
    <time_frame>90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical exam will show if wound healing is normal or delayed at the surgical site. This is a binary &quot;normal/delayed&quot; item.</description>

    <intervention_name>REVOLVE Advanced Adipose System</intervention_name>
    <description>The REVOLVE system is an all-in-one fat processing device that harvests, filters, actively washes, and removes strands from lipoaspirate and allows for reinjection without any additional manipulation (REVOLVE 2020).</description>
