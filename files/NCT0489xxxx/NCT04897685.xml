      This multi-centre research investigates the effects of nature-based treatment group on&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with depression. In total, 147 persons participated in the study in&#xD;
      various locations in Finland. All participants received treatment as usual (TAU). They were&#xD;
      randomised into nature-based group + TAU (n = 70) or TAU-only (n = 77). The participants in&#xD;
      the nature-based group + TAU were offered 12 sessions once a week in addition to standard&#xD;
      care. The measurement points included pre-treatment measurement at the baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment measurement at the end of the intervention, which was 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      pre-treatment measurement. The follow-up measurement was 3 months after the post-treatment&#xD;
      measurement. The effects of the intervention were assessed with a clinical measure of&#xD;
      depression (BDI-I) and with indicators of psychological distress (CORE-10), subjective&#xD;
      well-being (SWEMWBS), work/study ability (WAI) and nature experiences (ROS, KOLU). The&#xD;
      participants in the treatment group (nature-based group +TAU) were compared to the&#xD;
      participants in the control group who received TAU-only.&#xD;

      This research investigates the outcomes of nature-based treatment groups in the treatment of&#xD;
      adults with depression. In total, 147 participants were involved. Of them, 70 were randomized&#xD;
      into DMT group and 77 into the control group. All participants received treatment as usual&#xD;
      during the research. The inclusion criteria of the study were: a diagnoses of depression (ICD&#xD;
      -diagnostic system), BDI-I score 10 or above (cut off score for mild depression), treatment&#xD;
      contact in a health care service and 18-65 years of age. The exclusion criteria were: 1)&#xD;
      active suicidal ideation, 2) psychotic symptoms, and 3) substance misuse that is on a&#xD;
      critical level (Audit questionnaire scores above 10). Also, participants who had pain-related&#xD;
      problems that restricted daily life or were pregnant were not admitted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature-based treatment group was facilitated by a health care professional and included 12 x&#xD;
      90 mins sessions within 12 weeks. Depressive symptoms (BDI-I), psychological distress&#xD;
      (CORE-10), subjective well-being (SWEMWBS), ability to work/study (WAI), and nature&#xD;
      experiences (ROS, KOLU) were assessed at three measurement points: pre-measurement at the&#xD;
      baseline, post-measurement 12 weeks after the pre-treatment measurement, and a follow-up&#xD;
      measurement three months after the post-treatment measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research includes a larger number of participants (N = 147) than have been involved in&#xD;
      previous studies utilising randomised controlled trials in nature-based interventions. The&#xD;
      research generates further information about the effectiveness of nature-based therapy groups&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation of depression as it was conducted in five cities across Finland. This&#xD;
      type of multi-centre research can provide a realistic picture of the typical practice of a&#xD;
      range of health care professionals working with participants in various geographic locations.&#xD;
