  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine how the language used when discussing preferences&#xD;
      about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) affects decisions regarding this (code status)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most Americans express a preference for dying at home naturally and surrounded by loved ones.&#xD;
      However, many also believe that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is more effective than it&#xD;
      is, and want to have CPR even when the chances for a good outcome is poor. Among other&#xD;
      reasons, the alternative term (Do Not Resuscitate, or DNR) has been shown in the literature&#xD;
      to be associated by patients with passive, sub-optimal, and low quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to determine patient preference for the &quot;no CPR&quot; term on patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital using alternate phrasing. Within 24 hours of admission to the&#xD;
      Medical Teaching Service, patients over the age of 65 who are able to consent and who are not&#xD;
      critically ill/unstable will be consented. After checking brief background questions (such as&#xD;
      if they ever had discussions like these before), they will be randomized into two groups and&#xD;
      asked code status using one of the two phrases. This question will determine the patient's&#xD;
      &quot;code status;&quot; asking for this is a routine part of hospitalized care that is required by law&#xD;
      (the exact terminology is left to the care team). After determining the patient's code&#xD;
      status, they will be asked how satisfied they were with the decision; the investigator will&#xD;
      be asked if they agree with the decision separately. Demographic and clinical information&#xD;
      will be collected. Six months later, the patient will be contacted again; at this time, they&#xD;
      will be asked about recent life and health changes. Finally, they will be asked their code&#xD;
      status one more time. This will conclude the participant's involvement in the study&#xD;

    <description>Determine patient satisfaction of, and provider agreement with, code discussion. The former will be measured using a modified Satisfaction with Decision Scale, a six-item Likert scale indicating agreement or not with the statements provided. The latter will be determined by asking the physician if they agree (yes/no/unsure)</description>

    <time_frame>At approximately 6 months, patients will receive a follow-up phone call to determine this</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether the decision made for code status is durable between the two groups. Patients will again be asked their code status as in outcome 1 during a follow-up phone call (after information about new medical experiences/diagnoses and other code status discussions in the last six months is collected)</description>

    <time_frame>Additional information collected &quot;initially&quot; will be at time of consent/randomization into the study arm; additional information collected at &quot;follow-up&quot; will be at approximately six months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the possibility of other factors modifying the above outcomes, this study will collect additional information. Initially, we will ask about history of prior code status discussion; general demographic information (e.g., income, religion, etc); medical history (including diagnoses, medications, and substance use). At follow-up, we will ask about recent hospitalizations, new medical problems/medications, life stressors (using the Holmes-Rahe Index), and further discussions about code status</description>
