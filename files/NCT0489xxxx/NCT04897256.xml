  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this intervention is to explore the effectiveness of a Turning Boot Camp&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention to improve quality of turning in participants with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease (PD). A unique exercise program has been developed - Turning Boot Camp - that&#xD;
      involves practicing turning while dual-tasking with a body-support harness with 5 stations;&#xD;
      Flexibility, Anticipatory Weight Shifting, Tai Chi, Boxing, and Agility. The 60 participants&#xD;
      with PD, and a history of falls in the previous 12 months, will be randomized into a 6-week,&#xD;
      3x/week, one-on-one Turning Boot Camp group or No-Intervention Control group. This pilot&#xD;
      intervention study will determine the number of subjects needed for a future clinical trial&#xD;
      and will determine the sensitivity to change with rehabilitation our daily life turning&#xD;
      quality measures (mean and variability of number of steps to turn, turn amplitude, turn&#xD;
      velocity). Investigators predict that the Turning Boot Camp rehabilitation intervention will&#xD;
      improve turning in daily life enough to justify a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>Based on the exercise motor learning principles, participants spend 10-15 minutes at each Exercise Station that focus on particular constraints of turning ability. The stations will focus on important underlying aspects of turning, such as weight-shifting, increasing axial rotation during functional turning tasks. Each station will be progressed across levels to make more challenging.</description>
