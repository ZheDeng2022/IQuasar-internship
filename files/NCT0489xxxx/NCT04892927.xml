      GMG ArcData will create a mobile-based application to improve communications and data&#xD;
      exchange among patients and navigators involved in new pancreas surgery oncology episodes of&#xD;
      care. Functionality will align with care processes using smartphone and the EHR patient&#xD;
      portal. GMG will apply user-centered design theory and behavioral psychology approaches to&#xD;
      co-design, develop, and test usability of features that optimize patient navigators-patient&#xD;
      encounters on scheduling issues, nutrition guidance, pain management, wellbeing assessments,&#xD;
      and activity tracking. Evaluation endpoints will reflect how the application improves the&#xD;
      efficiency of workflows and lessens cognitive burden. Study will assess how patients and&#xD;
      navigators perceive the tool's ability to provide more control and easier access to&#xD;
      information about surgical care. The key project innovations are based on Fast Healthcare&#xD;
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based engineering standards that enable interoperability&#xD;
      among digital health platforms, apply 'recommender' functions based on similar patients'&#xD;
      experiences, and exploit microeducation tools to enhance patient understanding about their&#xD;
      surgical care. The research team has partnered with MedStar Health and Georgetown University&#xD;
      Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center to co-design the software and access patients for&#xD;
      usability testing. Successful implementation will lead to exploring a joint venture for&#xD;
      scaling to other care episodes, expanded functionality, and co-creating business models for&#xD;
      commercialization.&#xD;

      The objective of this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is to determine the&#xD;
      scientific or technical feasibility of R&amp;D efforts. The requirements that will be addressed&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing the cognitive or time burden (or both) of navigation-related tasks performed by&#xD;
           either patient navigators (PNs) or patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Integrating seamlessly into the workflow of PNs and existing health information&#xD;
           technology (IT) architecture; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transmitting information securely across a variety of IT systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's proposed approach for developing software to support pancreatic cancer patient&#xD;
      navigation across the care continuum will be addressed through research addressing these&#xD;
      three Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Engineering concepts that embrace interoperability through leveraging open messaging&#xD;
           standards and improve usability by adopting human-centered design principles at project&#xD;
           inception. With respect to interoperability, the key facet of this work's innovation&#xD;
           will be using interoperability standards (e.g., FHIR) to interface with an electronic&#xD;
           health record (EHR) at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Doing so will&#xD;
           facilitate scalability and flexibility in functionality that enhances the user&#xD;
           experience for integrated functions (patient care information delivery, patient&#xD;
           assessment, pain assessment, nutrition and activity). The study will apply user-centered&#xD;
           design features that will allow us to assess patient engagement, efficiency of&#xD;
           information flow, and navigator satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research, design, and potential implementation of open source solutions for recommender&#xD;
           systems. Smart recommendations, nudges, and automation enable users, both patients and&#xD;
           PNs, to receive certain actionable options for an interaction based on experiences from&#xD;
           other patients and navigators with similar preferences or share similar characteristics.&#xD;
           The adoption of this approach will address cognitive overload, diminish presentation of&#xD;
           unnecessary or inapplicable content, and create enhanced user experiences and more&#xD;
           efficient and effective decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research, design, and potential implementation of enhanced content delivery using&#xD;
           asynchronous microeducation features. The most common approach to patient education is&#xD;
           to create flat files or pdfs that are shared with patients for instruction. The study&#xD;
           plans to demonstrate the value of instructional design in the software application to&#xD;
           enhance patient engagement and understanding. Video features of the patient experience&#xD;
           can be enhanced with videography, 360 immersive videos (for instance to show the patient&#xD;
           the inside of the operating and recovery rooms). Through these delivery platforms&#xD;
           content can be evaluated with AB testing to assess patient's responsiveness (for&#xD;
           example, wound care, graphic representation of the anatomical surgical approach, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Phase I is primarily focused on the technical feasibility and commercial merit of the&#xD;
      tool, the research team seeks to concurrently develop an evaluation design that can robustly&#xD;
      assess the impact of the tool along key dimensions that the tool is designed to address:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing the information processing burden required of patients to navigate the health&#xD;
           care system and care plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bridging inefficiencies in the multi-step and multi-stakeholder processes inherent in&#xD;
           complex care management and coordination&#xD;
