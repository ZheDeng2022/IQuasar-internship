  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, single&#xD;
      ascending and multiple oral dose study in healthy participants. The study consists of two&#xD;
      parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) study with 4 planned cohorts of 8 participants&#xD;
           each including a food effect cohort with 10 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B is a multiple dose (MD) study with 1 planned cohort of 9 participantsEligible&#xD;
           participants will be randomized to receive either a single dose or a dose q24h x 3 day&#xD;
           of either INE963 or placebo depending on which part of the study the participant will be&#xD;
           randomized to. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be assessed over a period&#xD;
           of 16 days for single dose and 18 days for multiple dose for each participant.&#xD;

             participants to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of the&#xD;
             investigational drug via seminal fluid to their partner for 5 half-lives or 14 days&#xD;
             after last dose, whichever is longer. In addition, male participants should not donate&#xD;

             participants should also use an effective method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant. Women are considered post-menopausal or not of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an&#xD;
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or&#xD;
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or total&#xD;
             hysterectomy at least six weeks before screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
             only when the reproductive status of the women has been confirmed by follow-up hormone&#xD;
             level assessment if she is considered not of child-bearing potential. Refer to Section&#xD;

             first dose in this study, or within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or until the expected&#xD;
             PD effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by&#xD;
             local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Participants who do not have suitable veins for multiple venipuncture cannulation as&#xD;
             assessed by the investigator of delegate at screening&#xD;

&#xD;
         30. Intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 14 days prior to initial dosing. No&#xD;
