  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midfoot arthritis is a common condition leading to disabling chronic foot pain that affects&#xD;
      activities of daily living. The causes can be primary osteoarthritis (OA), inflammatory or&#xD;
      post-traumatic. We are looking at OA of the lesser (second and/or third) tarsometatarasal&#xD;
      joints (TMTJ). Orthotics, customised shoes or steroid injections are options to treat this&#xD;
      condition nonoperatively. If these measures fail, arthrodesis of the arthritic joints&#xD;
      represents the standard procedure to surgical treatment. Generally, the results of this&#xD;
      procedure are at a satisfactory level for the patients, nevertheless, there is a relevant&#xD;
      amount of patients with residual pain, lack of a normal foot appearance, and the need for&#xD;
      unplanned surgery or use of orthotics postoperatively. Furthermore, patients undergoing an&#xD;
      arthrodesis of the lesser TMTJ usually have to stay in hospital for 4-7 days.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients are only allowed to partially weightbear for at least 6 weeks and&#xD;
      need a cast for six weeks as well. During that time thrombosis prophylaxis is administered&#xD;
      for about 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional distal minimal-invasive metatarsal osteotomy (DMMO) is an accepted technique&#xD;
      for metatarsal osteotomies. Recently, Schneider et al. presented results of a modification of&#xD;
      the conventional DMMO, the reverse DMMO to treat OA of the lesser TMTJ, thus representing an&#xD;
      alternative treatment to arthrodesis. The procedure has many benefits. It allows outpatient&#xD;
      care, an immobilisation in a cast is not necessary. Instead, patients have to wear a flat&#xD;
      postoperative shoe for 2-3 weeks and are allowed to fully weightbear from day one after&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, thrombosis prophylaxis is not necessary unless there are specific risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while the arthrodesis directly addresses the arthritic joints, the R-DMMO alters the&#xD;
      ground reaction force of the metatarsal head leading to less stress at the level of the TMTJ,&#xD;
      but the arthritic joint itself is not approached. Still, the results presented by Schneider&#xD;
      et al. are promising. Since there was no group to compare the treatment with, the small&#xD;
      sample size, and a retrospective design, we would like to prospectively compare these two&#xD;
      surgical procedures directly in order to find out whether or not the R-DMMO can be&#xD;
      recommended as a standard procedure for OA of the lesser TMTJ at a much more convenient level&#xD;
      for patients regarding the whole perioperative protocol. No vulnerable population is&#xD;
      included. The scientific value is remarkable since this would be the first study to examine&#xD;
      this matter and we are able to provide a high level of evidence due to the&#xD;
      prospective-randomised and comparative design of the study. All legal requirements will be&#xD;
      fulfilled and the ethical standards are guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures have been described and the technique of the DMMO itself is not new, but its&#xD;
      modification (R-DMMO) represents a new approach for this condition. Both procedures are&#xD;
      reliable and safe, which is why the risk category of the study is A according to ClinO, Art.&#xD;
      61.&#xD;
