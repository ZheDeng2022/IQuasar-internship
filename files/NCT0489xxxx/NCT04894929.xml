  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      14.44% of the Spanish population is over 70 years old and Aging as a normal process is&#xD;
      characterized by gradual modifications in the physiological functions of the different&#xD;
      systems, so that as age progresses, deterioration can lead to imbalances and alterations in&#xD;
      health that cause diseases or traumatic processes. Within these processes, vestibular loss&#xD;
      occurs normally in the face of healthy aging and, encompassed within this progressive&#xD;
      dysfunction, various symptoms such as dizziness, imbalances, facial and limb weakness,&#xD;
      confusion or headache may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional status is the best indicator of the overall health status of the elderly person.&#xD;
      Identifying these indicators as soon as possible is the best way to prevent functional&#xD;
      decline and promote active aging and life expectancy free of disability. For this reason,&#xD;
      there are strategies that are currently a priority in health systems. The special COVID&#xD;
      circumstances eliminate the possibility of group work and invite the realization at home or&#xD;
      individually of workshops or collective exercises In the field of physiotherapy, vestibular&#xD;
      exercises have shown efficacy for improving balance and reducing the risk of falls in&#xD;
      cognitively intact people without vestibular impairment, being a specific approach to&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation for the reduction of dizziness and imbalances , as it facilitates&#xD;
      the compensation of the Central Nervous System. physiotherapy intervention has been shown in&#xD;
      various studies to be effective in improving balance and reducing the risk of falls in older&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also considering that the control of body balance in the elderly depends not only on the&#xD;
      vestibular system, but also on the correlations between all the other systems, it seems&#xD;
      interesting to add exercises with multiple components, since it would add effects of&#xD;
      improvement in functional independence of people greater for daily activities and control of&#xD;
      body balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic physical exercise is an effective non-pharmacological strategy to improve the&#xD;
      functional condition of the elderly and although it is known that there are various exercise&#xD;
      modalities that improve physical function and quality of life, The Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines emphasize the importance of multicomponent / multimodal exercise for this&#xD;
      population group&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, and given the information in both directions, we consider that it is necessary to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy in the evidence of both actions (multicomponent exercise and&#xD;
      vestibular exercises) to improve functional capacity and thus prevent falls, conducting a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of both interventions. Given the&#xD;
      special circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, an online or virtual follow-up is&#xD;
      necessary to achieve the exercises, building a resource website and helping virtual access&#xD;
      and monitoring to carry out the personalized exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this set of interventions can be carried out by making an initial diagnosis of&#xD;
      pre-frailty or frailty using instruments and simple validated tests. This is indicated or&#xD;
      recommended in the guidelines from national and international societies. In this sense, we&#xD;
      can avail ourselves of a comprehensive assessment of the VALINTAN tool (computerized&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of the elderly and used in primary care), whose axis is function,&#xD;
      focuses on predefined diagnoses associated with effective documented interventions or with&#xD;
      the fragility or functional loss. Currently the tool is open and freely accessible&#xD;
