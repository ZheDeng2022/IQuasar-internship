      This is a prospective, single arm, open, single centre clinical investigation designed to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and safety of the IscAlert™ device in patients scheduled for limb&#xD;
      (arm/leg) surgery with tourniquet. IscAlert is measuring carbon dioxide in muscular and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue. IscAlert is inserted into normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue in&#xD;
      ischemic (operated limb with a tourniquet) and non-ischemic limb (non-operated limb).After&#xD;
      the tourniquet is inflated, ischemia develops in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. This&#xD;
      will result in an increase in carbon dioxide, which will be detected by the sensor on the&#xD;
      operated extremity, while the sensor on the non-operated will show normal values. After&#xD;
      releasing the tourniquet cuff, the muscle will be reperfused and the carbon dioxide level is&#xD;
      expected to decrease into normal levels. 50 number of patients will be enrolled to undergo&#xD;
      the procedures. The IscAlert will be removed from the patient before the patient is&#xD;
      discharged from the operating room, but in 25 of the patients, IscAlert™ will be inserted for&#xD;
      72 hours in the operated extremity after the end of surgery. After this, the sensors are&#xD;
      removed.250 Devices is planned to be used in this clinical study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, open, single centre clinical investigation designed to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and safety of the IscAlert™ device in patients scheduled for limb&#xD;
      (arm/leg) surgery with tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 number of patients will be enrolled to undergo the procedures detailed in this clinical&#xD;
      investigational plan using 250 devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IscAlert is 0.8 mm in diameter and in vitro testing, shows stable and accurate measurements&#xD;
      of tissue carbon dioxide . More than 100 animal experiments have been done with the sensor.&#xD;
      The experiments have shown that the sensor detects ischemia (Increased carbon&#xD;
      dioxide-measurements) in real time in the following organs and tissues: Brain, heart, liver,&#xD;
      kidneys, pancreas, intestines, musculature and subcutaneous tissue. Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity are close to 100%. The sensors are inserted into tissue by a split needle&#xD;
      technique. The split needle is the size of a 3-gauge peripheral venous catheter. In animal&#xD;
      studies, no complications have been detected when using the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IscAlert catheters are connected to an electronics unit that is fixed to the skin with an&#xD;
      adhesive plaster outside the sterile area. The electrical signals are redirected to a&#xD;
      personal computer approved for clinical use which continuously records tissue pressures of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IscAlert is inserted into normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue proximal on the limb to be&#xD;
      operated. The insertion is distal to the blood cuff, and far away from the surgery field. The&#xD;
      insertion is done under sterile conditions in accordance with standard sterility criteria at&#xD;
      the hospital. No pain during insertion will occur because of insertion is performed after&#xD;
      anesthesia induction. Also, the insertion can be compared to an intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An identical IscAlert catheter is also inserted in the opposite extremity that is not to be&#xD;
      operated and serves as a reference value. After the tourniquet is inflated, ischemia develops&#xD;
      in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. This will result in an increase in carbon dioxide,&#xD;
      which will be detected by the sensor on the operated extremity, while the sensor on the&#xD;
      non-operated will show normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After releasing the tourniquet cuff, the muscle will be reperfused and the carbon dioxide&#xD;
      level is expected to decrease into normal levels within 15 - 45 minutes. In 25 patients, the&#xD;
      biosensors will be removed from the patient before the patient is discharged from the&#xD;
      operating room, but in 25 of the patients, IscAlert will be inserted for 72 hours in the&#xD;
      operated extremity after the end of surgery to identify drifting of the sensors. After this,&#xD;
      the sensors are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the ability of the IscAlert device to measure carbon&#xD;
      dioxide levels in ischemic and non-ischemic limb musculature and subcutaneous tissue in&#xD;
      patients who experience orthopedic surgery with limb tourniquet and to assess the&#xD;
      safety/efficacy using device IscAlert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The IscAlert device will be able to detect the presence of ischemia in muscle and&#xD;
           subcutaneous tissue, whereby carbon dioxide levels, measured by IscAlert, will be higher&#xD;
           in ischemic musculature than non-ischemic musculature in patients undergoing orthopedic&#xD;
           limb surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No clinically significant bleeding or infection will occur using IscAlert in this&#xD;
           clinical study.&#xD;
