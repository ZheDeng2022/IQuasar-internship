  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of the study is to find out the effectiveness of nerve mobilization in patients&#xD;
      with cervical radiculopathy. It is a single blinded randomized controlled trial using&#xD;
      non-probability convenient sampling. Data is collected from University Physical therapy and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic, University of Lahore, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis: There is a significant role of nerve mobilizations in decreasing pain&#xD;
      and disability among patients with cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: There is no significant role of nerve mobilizations in decreasing pain and&#xD;
      disability among patients with cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      It will be a prospectively registered, parallel designed, randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      concealed allocation, conducted in University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Clinic,&#xD;
      Lahore, Pakistan. Patients who met the eligibility criteria will be informed about the aim of&#xD;
      the study. All eligible participants who will agree to participate in the study signed the&#xD;
      consent form. Eligibility of the participants will be determined by the two members of the&#xD;
      research team before the randomization. After baseline assessment, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) into two groups (Group A and Group B). Randomization will&#xD;
      be done by one of the research team members using fish bowl method. Randomization assignments&#xD;
      will be kept in opaque, sealed envelopes and unsealed by the researchers after baseline&#xD;
      testing. Outcome assessor will be masked to group allocation and patients will be instructed&#xD;
      not to talk about the content of their exercise program during the post intervention visit&#xD;
      and could contact their therapists in case of any problems during trial participation. Help&#xD;
      of female physiotherapist will be taken for the female patients. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated as 76 participants (38 per group), allowing statistical power of 80%, an alpha&#xD;
      level of 5% and attrition rate of 20% having mean difference of 1.1 and SD of 1.48 and 1.63.&#xD;

    <measure>Upper extremity functional index (assessing change in ability to do activities with upper limb at baseline and at 4th week of treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a patient reported outcome measure used to assess the functional impairment in individuals with upper limb dysfunction. Total score is 80. Greater the score, better the condition of patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric pain rating scale (to assess change in pain at between baseline and at 4th week of treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Used for scoring pain level of individual. it is scored 0 to ten.Zero being the lowest pain level, 10 being worst pain level.The patient is asked to make three pain ratings, corresponding to the pain experienced over the past 24 hours.&#xD;
The average of the 3 ratings was used to represent the patient's level of pain over the previous 24 hours.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index scale (to assess the change in disability due to neck pain at baseline and at 4th week of treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used for accessing how the neck pain is affecting the ability to manage everyday life activities.The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Points of total 10 questions are summed to a total score.Greater score indicates greater disability.</description>
