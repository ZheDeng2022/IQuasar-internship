  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to analyze the psychophysiological effects of a preventative, 4-week resilience&#xD;
      training with mobile heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BfB) in a workplace setting and&#xD;
      the influence of the lecture format (digital vs. live) on the training success.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a three-arm, non-randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of a&#xD;
      preventative, 4-week resilience training with mobile HRV-BfB on work-related stress in&#xD;
      white-collar employees. Participants were asked to exercise autonomously three times per day&#xD;
      for five minutes with the mobile HRV-BfB device. They additionally attended three lectures at&#xD;
      the beginning of the first, third, and forth week. The aim of the lectures was to mediate a&#xD;
      theoretical knowledge and to prepare the participants for the autonomous training. To examine&#xD;
      the potential influence of the lecture format, one group attended live lectures (blended&#xD;
      learning condition) and one group received access to online lectures (e-learning condition).&#xD;
      Results of study's outcome measures were compared with a waitlist control group. Outcome&#xD;
      measures were assessed at baseline (T0), after the 4-week intervention (T1), and at 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up (T2).&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive stress symptoms were assessed with the adapted German long version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) at T0 and T2. Four questions were answered on an ordinal scale, transformed to values ranging between 0=minimum value and 100=maximum value (higher values indicate more severe stress symptoms) and averaged to obtain a scale score (0-100).</description>
