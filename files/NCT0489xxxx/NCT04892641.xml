  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and food effect of epetraborole tablets administered to healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects for up to 28 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 56 healthy male and female adult subjects will be enrolled into one of 7 Dose Cohorts&#xD;
      (Dose Cohorts 1 to 7; n = 8 per cohort). Cohort 7 (n = 8) is a Food Effect Cohort and&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose of epetraborole or placebo in a Fasted state (Period 1)&#xD;
      followed by a second dose of the same Investigational Product (IP) in a Fed state (Period 2)&#xD;
      after a washout period of at least 7 days (+3 days). The dose of IP to be administered in&#xD;
      Cohort 7 will be determined based on the Safety Monitoring Group recommendation following&#xD;
      evaluation of safety and available PK data (at least 14 days) in Cohort 1 through Cohort 6.&#xD;
      Up to 16 additional subjects may be included for the purposes of cohort expansion or to&#xD;
      explore a dose intermediate to previously evaluated doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in each Dose Cohort (n=8) will be randomized 3:1 to receive epetraborole (n=6) or&#xD;
      matching placebo (n=2) and will receive oral doses of epetraborole or placebo.&#xD;
      Investigational product will be administered with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of&#xD;
      non-carbonated water to each subject following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, except&#xD;
      for Period 2 (Fed) of Cohort 7. Subjects will be required to fast for a minimum of 2 hours&#xD;
      following administration of IP.&#xD;

             oophorectomy) or using an acceptable, highly effective contraceptive method from&#xD;
             Screening until study completion, including the F/U period. Acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception include the use of condoms and the use of an effective contraceptive for&#xD;
             the female partner that includes: OCPs, long-acting implantable hormones, injectable&#xD;
             hormones, a vaginal ring or an IUD. Subjects with same-sex partners are eligible when&#xD;
