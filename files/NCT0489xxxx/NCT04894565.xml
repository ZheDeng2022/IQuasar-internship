  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot, single-arm non-randomized clinical trial was conducted between the period September&#xD;
      2018 and June 2019 on a convenient sample of BC women. Primary study outcomes were pain,&#xD;
      disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), handgrip strength, and quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL). The secondary outcome was to assess the feasibility of this pilot study. All outcomes&#xD;
      were recorded at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day&#xD;
      90) under standardized conditions. The interventions were delivered by the physiotherapist&#xD;
      early within 24 hours post-operatively, T1, and T2. In addition, home-based exercise was&#xD;
      provided with written instructions during hospitalization with rehearsal sessions to ensure&#xD;
      the patient's understanding and compliance&#xD;

    <measure>Shoulder/Arm Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurements of the study outcomes took place at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day 90).</time_frame>
    <description>Pain in the shoulder/arm was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) with a scoring system of 0-10 (0 = no pain; 1-3; mild pain, 4-6; moderate pain, 7-10 severe pain)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurements of the study outcomes took place at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day 90).</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder mobility (flexion [0-180°], abduction [0-180°]) was measured by using a digital inclinometer under standardized conditions. Patients were maintained in a seated position for all movements to minimize compensatory movements of the trunk.</description>

    <measure>Disabilities in daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurements of the study outcomes took place at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day 90).</time_frame>
    <description>by using Quick DASH scale (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) questionnaire. The Quick DASH consists of 11 items that allow for cumulative and multiple assessments of a patient over time, and each item has 5 response options. According to the Quick DASH scale scoring system, the scale scores are calculated and ranging from 0 (no functional disability) to 100 (most severe disability)</description>

    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurements of the study outcomes took place at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day 90).</time_frame>
    <description>measured while the patient stabilized in a seated position with the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion and squeezes three times the dynamometer with each hand.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurements of the study outcomes took place at three time- intervals (T0=day 1 post-operation), (T1=day 30), and (T1=day 90).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' QoL was assessed by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale. FACT-G (version-4) is a validated, self-reported multi-dimensional, 27-items questionnaire measuring QoL for breast cancer patients with 1 4-points Likert scale (0-108). The FACT-G comprises of 4-subscales: Physical Well-being (PWB: 7-items; score range 0 to 28), Social Well-being (SWB: 7-items; score range 0 to 28), Emotional Well-being (EWB: 6-items; score range 0 to 24), Functional Well-being (FWB: 7-items; score range 0 to 28)</description>
