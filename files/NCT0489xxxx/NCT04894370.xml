    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapies&#xD;
      (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) and spartalizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy) in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic squamous cell anal carcinoma&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In SCCA (squamous cell carcinoma of anus) about 15% of patients are diagnosed in metastatic&#xD;
      stage, and around 25-40% of patients will experience disease progression after curative&#xD;
      intent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for localized disease. In patients with non-resectable local&#xD;
      recurrences or with distant metastases, the systemic chemotherapy is the standard approach.&#xD;
      Recently, taxane-based combination chemotherapy regimens have demonstrated high efficacy or&#xD;
      better tolerance than non-taxane based regimens, and became standards based in prospective&#xD;
      trials. First, the modified DCF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) showed a high&#xD;
      efficacy in Epitopes-HPV02 trial conducted by investigators including 66 patients and became&#xD;
      the first validated chemotherapy regimen in advanced SCCA. Then, the pooled analysis of 115&#xD;
      patients confirmed the mDCF regimen as the standard treatment in all fit patients with&#xD;
      advanced SCCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of different chemotherapy regimens and an anti-PD1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell&#xD;
      Death-1/Programmed cell Death-Ligand1) were feasible with improved survival in first-line&#xD;
      advanced small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancers. In anal carcinoma, Epitopes-HPV02 trial&#xD;
      showed that mDCF regimen was feasible with 53% of grade 3-4 adverse-event, with no grade 4&#xD;
      non-hematological toxicity and no febrile neutropenia. And also considering its property to&#xD;
      enhance the anti-tumor immune response, mDCF was recommended as an interesting candidate to&#xD;
      be evaluated as a backbone chemotherapy for immunotherapy combinations in SCCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In anal carcinoma, investigators are currently conducting a randomized prospective trial&#xD;
      promoted by GERCOR (cooperator group) evaluating the association of mDCF and an anti-PD-L1 in&#xD;
      metastatic setting. All patients (100) were already enrolled, and no particular safety alert&#xD;
      signal was observed at the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among different factors that confers a primary resistance to immunotherapy, the lack of&#xD;
      antigenic proteins capable to induce immune response, and the downregulation of major&#xD;
      histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1) are probably the most important. In fact, the&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has demonstrated the correlation between tumor&#xD;
      mutation burden (TMB) and response to CKI (checkpoint Inhibitor). Hence, most of &quot;hot&quot; tumors&#xD;
      with high TMB could be treated with CKI alone, while &quot;cold&quot; tumors probably need combination&#xD;
      strategies. Besides, primary or secondary resistances to CKI caused by downregulation of&#xD;
      MHC-1 are well described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation causes random point mutations and double-stranded breaks in the DNA and modulates&#xD;
      the peptide repertoire, increasing tumour-related antigens and TMB to enhance anti-tumour&#xD;
      immunity. Radiotherapy has also demonstrated to enhances MHC class I expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators decided to associate radiotherapy, PD-1 (Programmed cell Death-1) inhibitor and&#xD;
      mDCF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy regimen to improve the efficacy&#xD;
      with higher rate of long-lasting progression-free survivors and complete remissions. In&#xD;
      addition, the associated extensive ancillary biomarker studies in tissues and peripheral&#xD;
      blood will provide a unique opportunity to find out the potential synergic effect mechanism&#xD;
      between mDCF, CKI and radiotherapy, as well as to improve our knowledge about underlying&#xD;
      resistances.&#xD;
