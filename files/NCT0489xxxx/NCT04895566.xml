      This is an open-label Phase 0 trial that will enroll up to 10 participants with purulent&#xD;
      pyoderma (chronic ulcerative pyoderma) by injecting 200 mg of the monoclonal antibody (Mab)&#xD;
      sB24M into the areas affected by pyoderma.&#xD;

      Monoclonal antibody (Mab) sB24 negatively regulates immune-inflammatory processes through&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study is a first-in-man since previously no Clinical Studies on the local application&#xD;
      (injections) of monoclonal antibodies in pyoderma gangrenosum have been conducted.&#xD;
