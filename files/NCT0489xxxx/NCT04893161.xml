      Preamble:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belimumab is an inhibitor of B cell activating factor (BAFF) that has been developed as an&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2019, belimumab was approved for marketing in China. The belimumab treatment has been&#xD;
      proved to reduce the level of autoantibodies and control disease activity in the patients&#xD;
      with SLE. The response rate of SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) is approximately 50% in the&#xD;
      BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 phase III clinical trials. The goal of this study is to establish a&#xD;
      predictive model (including immune marker, inflammatory biomarker and clinical factor) to&#xD;
      early estimate the response of belimumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: in the patients with SLE, an early predictive model of the response of&#xD;
      belimumab treatment will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In subjects with SLE receiving belimumab treatment, to assess the effect of belimumab on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical improvement; The serological variables improvemen. The inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      improvemen. The quality of life. The dosage of prednisone. The kinetics of B cell phenotype.&#xD;
      The function of non-switched memory B cells. The association between the immune, inflammatory&#xD;
      and clinical markers and the response of belimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of BAFF inhibition on the survival and selection of SLE non-switched memory B&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovering of immune checkpoint in non-switched memory B cells from the view of BCR&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center cohort study to estimate a predictive model of the&#xD;
      response of belimumab. All patients with SLE receive belimumab 10mg/kg intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over 1 hour on days 0, 14, and 28, and every 28 days through week 48. All patients are&#xD;
      evaluated at week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The immune markers, inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers, clinical markers and safety data are assessed following belimumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men or women with SLE who have active (according to SLEDAI-2K) and refractory SLE&#xD;
      manifestations. SLE manifestations are deﬁned as refractory in case of drug intolerance,&#xD;
      unresponsiveness, or disease relapse in patients treated with corticosteroids, antimalarials,&#xD;
      and/or immunosuppressants. Patients with renal disease were considered as refractory when&#xD;
      they had a persistence of 24 hours proteinuria &gt; 1 g after at least 1 year from the start of&#xD;
      the initial therapy or when they experienced a renal ﬂare (24 hours proteinuria &gt; 1 g in case&#xD;
      of previous complete response or doubling 24 hours proteinuria in other cases) during the&#xD;
      subsequent therapy.&#xD;
