      This is an open, multicenter, extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CM310 for&#xD;
      long-term treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis The primary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      long-term safety of CM310 administered in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of CM310 in patients&#xD;
      with AD, in the context of re-treatment, and to monitor efficacy parameters associated with&#xD;
      long-term treatment.&#xD;
