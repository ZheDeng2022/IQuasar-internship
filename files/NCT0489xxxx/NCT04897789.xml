      Early Head Start (EHS) Family and Child Experiences Survey - 2018 (Baby FACES 2018) will&#xD;
      answer new questions about EHS programs, staff, and families that can guide program technical&#xD;
      assistance, management, and policy. It will provide information about EHS programs in the&#xD;
      context of the adoption of the new Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework. Baby FACES&#xD;
      2018 will consist of two nationally representative cross-sectional samples of programs,&#xD;
      centers, classrooms, home visitors, and children and families. It will include surveys of&#xD;
      program directors, center directors, teachers, home visitors, and parents; conduct&#xD;
      observations of classrooms and home visits, and ask staff and parents to report on children's&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of the Baby FACES studies is to provide knowledge about Early Head&#xD;
      Start children and families, and the EHS programs and staff who serve them. The ongoing&#xD;
      series of Baby FACES data collections is aimed at maintaining up-to-date core information on&#xD;
      EHS over time while also focusing on different areas of interest. The Baby FACES studies&#xD;
      began with Baby FACES 2009, a longitudinal descriptive study that followed two cohorts of&#xD;
      children and families through participation in the program and focused on program services&#xD;
      and participation, and child and family wellbeing and outcomes over time. Baby FACES 2018&#xD;
      (and a future round in 2022) have been redesigned to provide cross-sectional descriptive&#xD;
      information and a point in time picture of EHS. The present study will focus on understanding&#xD;
      the processes in EHS core services (classrooms and home visits) that support infant and&#xD;
      toddler development; namely, nurturing and responsive relationships between children and&#xD;
      caregivers. With this new focus, Baby FACES 2018 will take a more in depth look at classrooms&#xD;
      while a future study, Baby FACES 2022, will take a more in depth look at home visiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Baby FACES team will carry out a descriptive study that includes a nationally&#xD;
      representative sample of EHS programs, centers, classrooms, teachers, home visitors, and&#xD;
      children and families (including pregnant women) and answers new questions about how EHS&#xD;
      programs function. The study is guided by a comprehensive conceptual framework that&#xD;
      illustrates how EHS program processes and activities are expected to lead to high quality&#xD;
      service delivery and enhanced family and infant/toddler outcomes for the program overall. The&#xD;
      overarching research question for Baby FACES 2018 is: How do EHS services support&#xD;
      infant/toddler growth and development in the context of nurturing, responsive relationships?&#xD;
      The study will address this question through the collection of rich information using&#xD;
      interviews, self-administered questionnaires, classroom observations, and administrative data&#xD;
      sources. This approach will allow the Administration for Children and Families to capture&#xD;
      important information about EHS services, families, and children across all service options&#xD;
      (e.g., center-based, home-based, or those providing both service options), as well as in&#xD;
      depth information about how EHS classrooms and teacher-child relationships support&#xD;
      infant/toddler development.&#xD;
