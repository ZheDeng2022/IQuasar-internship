  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial progenitor cells that reside in renal vasculature may be stimulated to initiate&#xD;
      differentiation programs during episodes of injury. It is hypothesized that endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells resident in the kidney can transition to a post-injury phenotype that&#xD;
      promotes endothelial repair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction is central to the pathophysiology of vascular ischemia, bacterial&#xD;
      sepsis, toxin-induced thrombotic microangiopathy, and antibody-mediated kidney transplant&#xD;
      rejection and often manifest with renal failure. With each of these diagnoses circulating&#xD;
      components of the complement cascade bind to endothelial cells and induce disease progression&#xD;
      through anaphylactic cellular messaging, monocyte homing, and direct cell membrane&#xD;
      disruption. In response to injury during embryologic development avascular metanephric&#xD;
      blastema initiate endothelial differentiation. Although circulating hematopoietic progenitor&#xD;
      cells have shown therapeutic promise they incorporate into renal vasculature at very low&#xD;
      density.&#xD;
