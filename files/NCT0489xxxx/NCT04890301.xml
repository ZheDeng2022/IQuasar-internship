  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nodules are small in size and easy to move with breathing. CT guided puncture is&#xD;
      highly dependent on the personal experience of physicians, that is, the accuracy, efficiency&#xD;
      and incidence of complications of puncture vary greatly among physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puncture template (PT) assisted CT guided needle biopsy of pulmonary nodules has good&#xD;
      clinical feasibility, which is expected to make up for the deficiency of simple CT guided&#xD;
      needle biopsy, and make the needle biopsy of pulmonary nodules more accurate and&#xD;
      standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to carry out a randomized controlled study to further evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of PT assisted CT guided needle biopsy of pulmonary nodules, and provide&#xD;
      higher quality data reference for its clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups: PT assisted CT guided or simple CT guided&#xD;
      lung biopsy. The operation related information, complications and postoperative pathological&#xD;
      results of the two groups were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: puncture accuracy Secondary end point: success rate of first needle&#xD;
      puncture; complication rate (such as pneumothorax, bleeding, etc.); operation time; CT scan&#xD;
      times; pathologic findings.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Single or multiple pulmonary nodules (solid, partially solid, pure ground glass), with&#xD;
             the maximum diameter of 5mm to 20mm and need for pathological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No drugs affecting blood coagulation and (or) platelet aggregation were used; if used,&#xD;
             the drugs had been stopped for enough time according to the drug elution period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS &gt; 60, no serious or uncontrollable underlying diseases, the patients can tolerate&#xD;
             lung puncture according to clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is an appropriate puncture path.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor lung function (such as FEV1 &lt; 40% in the first second and / or DLCO &lt; 50%) and /&#xD;
             or isolated pulmonary bullae on the puncture path.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The nodule is close to small airway and blood vessels, or has pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
             and superior vena cava compression, so the risk of puncture bleeding and hemoptysis is&#xD;
             expected to be high.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor compliance, unable to complete the cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
