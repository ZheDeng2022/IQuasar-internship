  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating Ryzodeg®,a medication prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.The study is being carried out to investigate the effect of Ryzodeg® on the change&#xD;
      of glycated haemoglobin levels and other diabetes indicators. Participants participation will&#xD;
      not affect their medical care. In this retrospective study, the study doctor will collect&#xD;
      data from the participants patient files available at the study site. Participants will need&#xD;
      to sign the informed consent form during a single visit. Participants files will be reviewed&#xD;
      and data relevant to the study will be extracted, within 26 weeks before and after Ryzodeg®&#xD;
      treatment initiation (total of 52 weeks). Chart review for all patients is expected to take&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
