      Point-of-care testing can provide an additional layer of protection to reduce transmission of&#xD;
      COVID-19 safely and effectively in the population, and if such tests can be&#xD;
      self-administered, barriers to access may be reduced. The investigators will conduct a study&#xD;
      among those self-identifying as asymptomatic for COVID-19 to evaluate the reliability and&#xD;
      feasibility of self-administration of a point-of-care nasal swab test, determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care nasal swab test relative to reverse&#xD;
      transciptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and gather quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data on the acceptability and self efficacy of self-administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the age distribution of COVID-19 has demonstrated that young adults are&#xD;
      susceptible to infection. As of mid-December, about 19% of cases have occurred in the 20-29&#xD;
      year age group, and about 3% of those hospitalized were 20-29 years of age. In BC, in week&#xD;
      50, the incidence was highest in adults 20-29 years (127 cases per 100,000 population), which&#xD;
      is four times higher than what was observed in week 38 (30 cases per 100,000 population).&#xD;
      These statistics highlight the need to disrupt transmission in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congregate living settings have been established as high-risk environments for community&#xD;
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, there is a need to ensure the workforce feels safe in&#xD;
      returning back to work across post-secondary institutions. While the COVID-19 vaccine rollout&#xD;
      has commenced in BC, according to experts in the field, the pandemic is likely to persist for&#xD;
      some time. For people living in congregate housing and for post-secondary institutions to&#xD;
      open safely, COVID-19 mitigation strategies are as important as ever. There is no current&#xD;
      public health strategy used for systematic COVID-19 screening for those living in congregate&#xD;
      housing. Individuals are expected to monitor themselves daily for symptoms and use &quot;multiple&#xD;
      layers of protection&quot; which include physical distancing, mask wearing and hand washing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this strategy is not very effective because these measures are relatively&#xD;
      insensitive and thus unlikely to identify all individuals with SARS-CoV2, especially those&#xD;
      who are minimally symptomatic or believe they are asymptomatic. Indeed, public health experts&#xD;
      have poignantly stated that transmission of the virus through asymptomatic individuals is the&#xD;
      &quot;Achilles' Heel of Current Strategies to Control COVID-19&quot; (1). This is because, unlike&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-1, the cause of the original SARS epidemic in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 sheds at high&#xD;
      concentrations from the nasal cavity even in asymptomatic individuals, who may harbour the&#xD;
      virus but have yet to demonstrate any symptoms during the prodromal phase of the disease (2).&#xD;
      Even with masking and social distancing, such individuals could be at a high risk of&#xD;
      spreading the virus in congregate housing and in enclosed spaces (e.g. classrooms). One&#xD;
      approach to reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission amongst those living in congregate&#xD;
      housing and working in enclosed spaces with large numbers of people (e.g. classrooms) is to&#xD;
      &quot;screen&quot; for those who are likely to harbour the virus (even though they may have no or&#xD;
      minimal symptoms). However, the current diagnostic approach, which uses real-time reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of viral RNA from&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs, cannot be easily deployed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RT-PCR test is expensive (&gt;$100/test), time-consuming (with turnaround times of 1-2 days)&#xD;
      and requires trained healthcare personnel to administer the test. A potential solution to&#xD;
      this conundrum is to use a &quot;point-of-care&quot; test, which can be deployed at either work or a&#xD;
      congregate housing site and whose results will be available within one hour of testing.&#xD;
      However, for these assays or platforms to be viable, they will need to be used as &quot;screening&quot;&#xD;
      rather than &quot;diagnostic&quot; tests (see below for more detailed discussion on this topic), and be&#xD;
      relatively simple to use (so ideally they can be self-administered) and inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the difference between diagnostic and screening tests?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify occurrence at the individual level&#xD;
      and is performed when there is a reason to suspect that an individual may be infected, such&#xD;
      as having symptoms or suspected recent exposure, or to determine resolution of infection.&#xD;
      Examples of diagnostic testing include testing symptomatic individuals who present to their&#xD;
      healthcare provider, testing individuals through contact tracing efforts, testing individuals&#xD;
      who indicate that they were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of&#xD;
      COVID-19, and testing individuals present at an event where an attendee was later confirmed&#xD;
      to have COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) FAQs on Testing for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 also address diagnostic testing for SARSCoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests for SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, are intended to identify occurrence at the&#xD;
      individual level even if there is no reason to suspect infection-e.g., there is no known&#xD;
      exposure. This includes, but is not limited to, screening of asymptomatic individuals without&#xD;
      known exposure with the intent of making decisions based on the test results. Screening tests&#xD;
      are intended to identify infected individuals without, or prior to development of, symptoms&#xD;
      who may be contagious so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. Examples&#xD;
      of screening include testing plans developed by a workplace to test its employees, and&#xD;
      testing plans developed by a school to test its students, faculty, and staff. In both&#xD;
      examples, the intent is to use the screening testing results to determine who may continue to&#xD;
      participate in activities and the protective measures that must be taken, including&#xD;
      self-isolation. FDA's FAQs on Testing for SARSCoV- 2 also address screening testing for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a screening COVID-19 test is one that is specific for SARS-CoV-2 but has a lower&#xD;
      sensitivity (i.e., ability to detect the virus) than that of a diagnostic test (the gold&#xD;
      standard). Thus, even those who have a negative screening test should be considered&#xD;
      potentially infectious and must adhere to social distancing, masking rules and all other&#xD;
      public health orders/guidelines. Those who are tested positive on the screening test must be&#xD;
      assumed to have COVID-19 until proven otherwise by a confirmatory RT-PCR test. This approach&#xD;
      of using &quot;point-of-care&quot; screening tests was recently advocated by The New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a feasibility pilot from February 9-April 23, 2021 at&#xD;
      Orchard Commons, University of British Columbia. The investigators tested BD Veritor nasal&#xD;
      swab rapid antigen test since it was already approved by Health Canada and supported by the&#xD;
      Vancouver Coastal Health Medical Health Officer. The investigators examined the feasibility&#xD;
      of participants to self-collect nasal swabs and considered the ability to complete the rapid&#xD;
      antigen test. The BD Veritor system entails much accuracy of putting the mucosal cells into&#xD;
      the small dropper. This system also has an analytic reader. The investigators believe this&#xD;
      system will be useful when it can be administered by a trained person because of the dropper&#xD;
      and the need for an analytic reader. Based on a small survey (n=184), the team concluded that&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal swabs are acceptable (99% of participants rated nasal swabbing as acceptable/very&#xD;
      acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid antigen tests need to take no longer than 15 minutes. In order to move to self&#xD;
      administration, the team believes there should be no analytic reader and that the participant&#xD;
      should be able to tell with a visual examination if the rapid antigen test was positive (much&#xD;
      like a pregnancy test). The Roche SD biosensor test was chosen for this study since it is a&#xD;
      low complexity test that can likely be used by many of the general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Goal: The primary goal of this study is to determine and test the feasibility,&#xD;
      reliability, and sensitivity/specificity of COVID-19 self-administered screening amongst&#xD;
      those who are asymptomatic and living and/or working at UBC. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      whether rapid antigen testing can identify virus transmission chains early through the&#xD;
      identification of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and direct students and staff with&#xD;
      positive test results to follow appropriate public health precautions - all of which are&#xD;
      proven to minimize viral spread.&#xD;
