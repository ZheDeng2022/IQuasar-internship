  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to identify the effects of different depths of sedation and choices&#xD;
      of sedative drugs on perioperative neurocognitive disorders in the elderly patients receiving&#xD;
      hip surgery under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PND is a complication of the central nervous system after anesthesia and surgery which is&#xD;
      considered to be a common complication in elderly patients. Age is an independent risk factor&#xD;
      for the occurrence of PND. Prolonged hospitalization, incapacity and long duration of PND&#xD;
      aggravate the economic burden of individuals, families and society. The pathogenesis of PND&#xD;
      is still unclear. Recent studies suggest that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is damaged by&#xD;
      surgery or anesthesia, which causes the activation of inflammatory factors such as TNF α and&#xD;
      NF - κ B, and then leads to the decline of hippocampus cognitive function. In recent years,&#xD;
      it has been found that dexmedetomidine can reduce the brain injury during&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion and reduce the occurrence of PND. BDNF is a neurotrophin, which plays an&#xD;
      important role in the growth, differentiation, synaptic plasticity, survival and repair of&#xD;
      neurons. Studies have shown that the decrease of BDNF concentration is related to PND, which&#xD;
      can be used as an index to evaluate brain injury and predict PND. S100 β protein is a&#xD;
      specific low molecular calcium binding protein of nervous system which can be increased early&#xD;
      after brain injury, so it can be used to reflect the severity and prognosis of brain injury&#xD;
      and predict PND.In this randomized controlled trial, investigators will compare the incidence&#xD;
      of PND in hip surgery with four intraoperative sedation regimens. After spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
      the following sedation regimen will be used: (1) Intravenous infusion of propofol to make&#xD;
      patients receive lighter sedation(modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation&#xD;
      score[MOAA/S],0-2) (2) Intravenous infusion of propofol to make patients receive heavier&#xD;
      sedation(MOAA/S,3-5) (3)After a bolus of dexmedetomidine, intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine to make patients receive lighter sedation(MOAA/S,0-2) (4) After a bolus of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine to make patients receive heavier&#xD;
      sedation(MOAA/S,3-5). 3ml venous blood samples were collected before anesthesia (T0), 1 h&#xD;
      after operation (T1), 1 day after operation (T2) and 7 days after operation (T3). Plasma&#xD;
      samples were collected after centrifugation and the concentrations of BDNF and S100 β were&#xD;
      determined by ELISA. After 7days of surgery, PND is screened by CAM with a trained research&#xD;
      assistant everyday, and CAM positive patients are judged by a qualified psychiatrist to meet&#xD;
      DSM-V criteria until the patient is discharged. For patients with PND, the delirium rating&#xD;
      scale (DRS) was used to assess the degree of delirium.&#xD;
