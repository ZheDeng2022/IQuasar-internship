  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sore throat or acute tonsillopharyngitis, often referred to as angina catarrhalis in Central&#xD;
      and Eastern Europe, affects mainly children, adolescents and young adults and represents one&#xD;
      of the most common reasons to consult a family physician. While most patients complaining of&#xD;
      sore throats have an infection, it has been estimated that fewer than 20% present with a&#xD;
      clear indication for antibiotic therapy, i.e., are positive for hemolytic streptococcus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) is a highly prevalent, seasonal infective disorder&#xD;
      characterized by an inflammation of the pharynx and the palatine tonsils, which occurs in all&#xD;
      age groups and accounts for about 5% of all visits in pediatric care. Common symptoms of ATP&#xD;
      include sore throat, dysphagia, red pharynx, enlarged tonsils sometimes covered with exudate,&#xD;
      fever with sudden onset, malaise, gastrointestinal complaints, halitosis, rhinorrhea and&#xD;
      cough. Children with non-streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis are often over-treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific literature currently available shows that the extract of Pelargonium sidoides&#xD;
      may be effective in the treatment of disorders affecting the respiratory tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that zinc is beneficial for the common cold in healthy children and adults&#xD;
      living in high-income countries and it may inhibit replication of the virus. In addition,&#xD;
      zinc (lozenges or syrup) reduces the average duration of the common cold in healthy people&#xD;
      assuming zinc within 24 hours of onset of symptoms Propolis has been widely investigated for&#xD;
      its antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties and is administered as an&#xD;
      add-on therapy during watchful waiting for better control of symptoms in non-streptococcal&#xD;
      pharyngitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned considerations, have suggested Pediatrica Srl to develop a food&#xD;
      supplement specific for pediatric age for the well-being of the airways (PediaFlù®). This&#xD;
      product is actually on the market as adjuvant in seasonal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical investigation is planned to verify and confirm these encouraging results&#xD;
      in a setting of standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PediaFlù®&#xD;
      (dietary supplement) along with standard of care in children with acute tonsillopharyngitis /&#xD;
      rhinopharyngitis versus standard of care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the tested dietary supplement&#xD;
      administered along with standard care vs standard care alone in children affected by acute&#xD;
      tonsillopharyngitis (ATP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are the assessment of the use of rescue medicine&#xD;
      (Ibuprofen or high dose of Paracetamol) and the evaluation of the overall improvement&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
