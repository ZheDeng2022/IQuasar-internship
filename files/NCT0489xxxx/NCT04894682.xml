  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the inoculation-related symptoms and long-term&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with lung cancer or pulmonary nodules in a&#xD;
      real-world setting. The investigators aim to provide high-quality evidence for the COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines in cancer/pre-cancer patients, and to address their concern about the safety profile&#xD;
      of the newly developed vaccines.&#xD;

      This study will enroll lung cancer/pulmonary nodule patients or healthy people who had&#xD;
      undergone standard vaccination procedures against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This observatory study&#xD;
      will apply an electronic questionnaire to collect general information and post-vaccination&#xD;
      symptoms or adverse events of vaccinated pulmonary nodules/lung cancer patients and healthy&#xD;
      control. The researchers will further analyze whether the vaccine will promote the&#xD;
      progression of primary tumors/pulmonary nodules through long-term follow-up. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to assess the adverse events and long-term impact of COVID-19 vaccines in&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer or pulmonary nodules in a real-world setting, to provide&#xD;
      high-quality evidence for the COVID-19 vaccines in cancer/pre-cancer patients, and to address&#xD;
      their concern about the safety profile of the newly developed vaccines.&#xD;
