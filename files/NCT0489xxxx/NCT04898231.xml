  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In March 2020, children exposed to the virus that causes the COVID-19 illness, SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      presented with fever and significant inflammation about a month after exposure to the virus.&#xD;
      Some children were sick enough to require care in the intensive care unit for what came to be&#xD;
      known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome-Children (MIS-C).The clinical presentation shared&#xD;
      many features with Kawasaki disease (KD), a self-limited inflammation that can cause&#xD;
      ballooning of the arteries of the heart. Thus, physicians reached for many of the therapies&#xD;
      used to treat children with KD. Despite the surge of COVID-19 cases and children continuing&#xD;
      to present with MIS-C, there are no data that guide the choice of therapy. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators have designed a study to determine which combination of therapies is most&#xD;
      effective in helping children with MIS-C recover quickly.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, randomized, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness study of&#xD;
      children with MIS-C. The current standard of care is that all MIS-C patients are initially&#xD;
      treated with IVIG and receive additional therapy if they are severely ill or do not improve&#xD;
      clinically. This study design will randomize subjects who have received IVIG but clinically&#xD;
      warrant further anti-inflammatory therapy to one of three treatment arms (infliximab,&#xD;
      steroids or anakinra) and allow for re-randomization to one of the two remaining arms if&#xD;
      clinically warranted.&#xD;
