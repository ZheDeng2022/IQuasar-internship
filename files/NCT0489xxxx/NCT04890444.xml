  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic studies have revealed a tremendous increase in the prevalence of adrenal&#xD;
      associated disease and related mortality worldwide. In order to meet all the therapeutic&#xD;
      challenges in adrenal disease in China, CASE was founded in 2020. The objective of CASE is to&#xD;
      launch an adrenal disease management model based on the Internet health information platform&#xD;
      which allows the application and evaluation of adrenal disease treatment strategies at&#xD;
      multiple centers. The proprietary electronic medical database will help the dynamic big-data&#xD;
      analysis in epidemiology of adrenal disease, diagnosis, and treatment.&#xD;

      In order to meet all the challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of adrenal diseases in&#xD;
      China, CASE was founded in 2020. With advanced medical equipment and Internet of Things (IoT)&#xD;
      technology, CASE is committed to creating an online and offline integrated solution for&#xD;
      adrenal disease, and for the entire spectrum of adrenal disease, to achieve a more convenient&#xD;
      and precise model of care for patients, aiming to establish a platform with diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of adrenal disease and their long-term follow-up. It allows the application and&#xD;
      evaluation of treatment strategies at these centers.&#xD;
