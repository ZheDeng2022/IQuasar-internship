      Around ten teams will be recruted among the clubs in the Province of Liege. They will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups (blind): an intervention group and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each month, both groups will be asked to fill in a form with the potential injuries they&#xD;
      experienced during the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the teams included in the intervention group will be asked to follow a warm-up prevention&#xD;
      program (about 15 minutes) at least twice a week, at the beginning of the training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the season, one experimenter will go to the different clubs in order to&#xD;
      present the program, to explain the exercises and to correct the players while doint the&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the season, the same experimenter will go to the clubs at regular intervals to make&#xD;
      sure that the players are well doing the program and to assess the compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Control group :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the control group is to estimate the prevalence of shoulder injuries in a&#xD;
      group without any prevention implementation. The players of this group will jus have to&#xD;
      answer the monthly questionnaire about the potential injuries they experienced during the&#xD;
      previous month.&#xD;
