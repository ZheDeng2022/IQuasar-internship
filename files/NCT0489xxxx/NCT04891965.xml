      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study in which up to&#xD;
      approximately 36 subjects with a recent C. difficile infection (CDI) who have completed a&#xD;
      standard of care course of CDI antibiotics and have achieved clinical cure based on signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, will be randomized to 7 or 28 daily doses of ART24 or placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 6 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study in which up to&#xD;
      approximately 36 subjects with a recent CDI (primary [meaning the first occurrence they have&#xD;
      had] or recurrent infection) who have completed a standard of care course of CDI antibiotics&#xD;
      (vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or metronidazole administered for 10 to 21 days) and have achieved&#xD;
      clinical cure based on signs and symptoms, will be randomized to 7 or 28 daily doses of ART24&#xD;
      or placebo. Subjects will be followed for 6 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive study drug in the following 2 sequential cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: ART24 or placebo once daily for 7 days (8 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: ART24 or placebo once daily for 28 days (28 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 3 [active]:1 [placebo]. Subjects&#xD;
      who are randomized to active treatment in both cohorts will receive ART24 (5×10^9&#xD;
      colony-forming units [CFU]) daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of Cohort B will only occur once the Data Review Committee (DRC) has evaluated&#xD;
      blinded safety data (through Week 2) from Cohort A and recommends that the study proceed to&#xD;
      the next cohort.&#xD;
