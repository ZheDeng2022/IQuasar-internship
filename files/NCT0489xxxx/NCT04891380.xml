      In a out of hospital emergency medicine study the investigators will measure hemodynamic&#xD;
      effects of implemented treatments for patients with cardiac arrest, hypotension, and&#xD;
      intensive care transports. The investigators will use both non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      measuring technology to measure this. Ballistocardiographic biosensors are introduced&#xD;
      together with more advanced non-invasive and invasive measurements such as invasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure with cardiac output calculation and saturation cerebral tissue oxygenation&#xD;
      (SctO2). During treatment of cardiac arrest patients the investigators will use a new LUCAS 2&#xD;
      Active Decompression device (LUCAS 2 AD2) and measure different hemodynamic variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-hospital monitoring of vital signs has documented to increase survival. Especially&#xD;
      advanced multi-monitoring units have shown to have this impact but they are demanding in use.&#xD;
      Low blood pressure/blood flow are frequent in emergency medicine cases and diagnosed by&#xD;
      combining clinical evaluation (breathing, circulation, neurology) with biosensor measures of&#xD;
      vital signs. Examples of biosensors are ECG, Ballistocardiographic (BCG), End Tidal CO2&#xD;
      (EtCO2), pulse oximetry (SpO2), saturation cerebral tissue oximetry (SctO2), transthoracic&#xD;
      impedance (TTI), and invasive arterial pressure measurements such as pulse contour analysis&#xD;
      for cardiac output measures. The gold standard for blood flow measurement is cardiac output&#xD;
      [Cardiac Output (CO), volume of blood pumped by the heart pr. minute as the product of stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) and heart rate]. Cardiac output may be measured by invasive (thermodilution, Fick&#xD;
      method) or noninvasively techniques [oesophageal Doppler, transoesophageal echocardiography,&#xD;
      lithium dilatation cardiac output, pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO, Pulse Cardiac Output&#xD;
      system, FloTrac ™), partial CO2 rebreathing, thoracic electrical bioimpedance. Pulse contour&#xD;
      analysis is based on that the area under the systolic part of the arterial pressure waveform&#xD;
      is proportional to the stroke volume (SV). This may limit the optimal goal for monitoring&#xD;
      adequately several emergency medicine cases. There is, therefore, a need to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate biosensor devices in these situations. BCG biosensors have been introduced and have&#xD;
      documented to be useful in monitoring noninvasively vital signs but they have not been used&#xD;
      in acute emergency medicine. It has been documented a correlation (r2=0.85) between BCG&#xD;
      biosensor and cardiac output measured by Doppler echocardiogram. The biosensor record very&#xD;
      subtle rhythmic movements on the patient skin (abdomen and/or neck) and shows a graph which&#xD;
      is presented based on filters and custom-made algorithms as continuous hemodynamic variables&#xD;
      (heart- and respiration-rates, heart rate variability, and relative stroke volume). BCG&#xD;
      piezoelectric biosensors (BGPS) are easy to put on the patient, non-invasive, light (grams),&#xD;
      small (2 x 2 cm), and costs are low. They support live streaming with automatic downloads of&#xD;
      data. For most other measuring devices this must be done manually post event. With limited&#xD;
      time of education and training all personnel prehospitally can deploy the biosensor over the&#xD;
      carotid or abdominal aorta. Based on pilots and a validation study comparing two BCG&#xD;
      biosensors (accelerometer and piezoelectric) with measures performed by present clinical&#xD;
      practise the piezoelectric biosensor is best for use in situations where measures must be&#xD;
      instant. In the same validation study, the investigators documented that pulse contour&#xD;
      analysis with the latest software upgrade of FloTrac™ system worked well compared with&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography (manuscript in progress, ClinTrialGov). Studies have validated the&#xD;
      efficacy of FloTrac ™ with pulmonary artery catheter and found different results. A review&#xD;
      article concluded that FloTrac ™ has the possibility to increase patient safety in relation&#xD;
      to perioperative hemodynamic monitoring. A comparison of simultaneous Stroke Volume (SV) and&#xD;
      Cardiac Output measurements by echocardiography and FloTrac ™ were done in ten mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated intensive care patients and showed a correlation between them (SV, y = 0.9545x +&#xD;
      3.3, R2 = 0.98 and for CO, y = 0.9104x + 7.7074, R² = 0.97). Therefore, it is indicated to&#xD;
      use this biosensor for out of hospital cases. Although pulse contour analysis is an invasive&#xD;
      method, the investigators have experience with invasive arterial access in the doctor car&#xD;
      that respond to emergency cases in Oslo since invasive monitoring is the standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pre-hospital observational study performed by the doctor manned car (119-unit) in Oslo&#xD;
      and Akershus, the investigators will compare and document (correlations, sensitivities,&#xD;
      specificities) biosensor measures to current gold standard measures during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR), hypotension, and intensive care transports. This challenges the current&#xD;
      practice because most pre-hospital units responding to emergency medicine cases do not have&#xD;
      alternatives to advanced measures. Therefore, the patient is not monitored well enough in&#xD;
      addition to that they seldom receive instant guidance according to the effect of treatment.&#xD;
      The investigators approach is novel and innovative since it has never been done but the&#xD;
      investigators study group have recent experience with performing similar advanced clinical&#xD;
      monitoring studies prehospitally. There is a potential that more pre-hospital units will&#xD;
      deliver better monitoring and care to more patients with these non- and invasive approaches.&#xD;
      Ultimately, better healthcare will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data captured for the cardiac arrest patients will be compared with data from&#xD;
      NCT02479152.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the current project is successful, the investigators plan to implement this technology in&#xD;
      a larger scale and may then be able to study potentially improved survival and morbidity&#xD;
      rates with sufficient statistical power in future studies.&#xD;
