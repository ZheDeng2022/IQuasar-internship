    <textblock>
      This study collects information to provide a model for how to rapidly adapt and scale-up&#xD;
      multilevel interventions through clinic-health plan partnerships to reduce the burden of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) on the United states population. This study may improve colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Adapt, pilot, then test the implementation and scale-up of targeted direct mail and&#xD;
      patient navigation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an implementation-effectiveness trial of direct mail outreach and patient navigation&#xD;
      intervention to improve rates of CRC screening. Eligible patients will be mailed a fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical test (FIT). The mailed FIT and patient navigation interventions are a part of&#xD;
      standard care and are carried out by the Medicaid health plan or clinic. Outcomes are tracked&#xD;
      using reports from direct mail vendors, claims data from participating Medicaid health plans,&#xD;
      clinic data from the electronic health record, chart review, and data from a REDCap database.&#xD;
      The hypotheses will be tested using a two-arm cluster randomized trial design. Participating&#xD;
      clinics will be randomized into two groups: Intervention and Usual Care. Medicaid health&#xD;
      plans/ Coordinated care organizations (CCO) and clinic leadership participate in interviews&#xD;
      and complete surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness outcome of this study is CRC screening rates in eligible Medicaid&#xD;
      patients in intervention and control clinics at 6 months. Data will be collected at 6 time&#xD;
      points: baseline, 6-months, 12-months, 18-months, 24-months, and 36-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation outcomes and adaptations will be evaluated through interviews with clinic&#xD;
      staff, patients, and CCO partners. Clinic staff in various roles related to the program&#xD;
      (e.g., outreach workers, patient navigators, quality improvement leads) complete surveys and&#xD;
      participate in interviews and observations at baseline, 6-9 months (post-implementation) and&#xD;
      at approximately 9 months later, to assess clinic/health system level factors that may&#xD;
      influence outcomes. Patients participate in interviews to explore patient experiences with&#xD;
      the program. Regional and Organizational partners: CCO leaders, endoscopy providers (e.g.,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal specialists, general surgeons, primary care clinicians), and community&#xD;
      organizations also participate in interviews.&#xD;
