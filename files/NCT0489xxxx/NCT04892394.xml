      This study compared the effect of the detailed video visual information and basic verbal&#xD;
      information on patients' anxiety levels (using anxiety scales) before endodontic treatment&#xD;
      and stress levels (using electrodermal activity method) during endodontic treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients (n=120) aged between 18-65 with single-rooted teeth with the single canal that&#xD;
      diagnosed with asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis and/or pre-prosthetic root canal treatment&#xD;
      were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups after completing&#xD;
      anxiety scales and socio-demographic/dental habits form. Before the treatment, visual video&#xD;
      information was given to the video group patients, while the control group patients were&#xD;
      routinely informed verbally. The stress levels during the endodontic treatment process were&#xD;
      recorded by placing a electrodermal activity measurement device on the wrists of the&#xD;
      patients. Anxiety scales and feedback-satisfaction forms were administered to all patients&#xD;
      after the treatment process.&#xD;

    <description>Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) was used to assess anxiety levels. The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) consisted of 5 questions ranging from 5 (no anxiety) to 25 (highest anxiety level). Every patient was asked to mark his or her perceived dental anxiety level on the line.</description>

    <description>State Anxiety Scale (STAI-S) was used to assess anxiety levels. The STAI scales consisted of two scales, each with 20 questions, with a total score between 20 and 80. Every patient was asked to mark his or her perceived dental anxiety level on the line.</description>

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was a scale consisting of a horizontal straight line 0-100 mm long with words describing the two extremes of the condition to be measured at both ends (i.e. zero - no anxiety, maximum - most severe anxiety). Every patient was asked to mark his or her perceived dental anxiety level on the line.</description>

    <time_frame>During endodontic treatment process</time_frame>
    <description>At the beginning of the endodontic treatment, the GSR device was attached to the patient's preferred wrist, and the measuring tapes of the device were placed on the patient's proximal phalanges of the index and middle finger. One-visit endodontic treatment was divided into 7 steps (anesthesia, cavity preparation, rubber dam placement, determination of root canal length, root canal shaping, root canal filling, coronal restoration and finishing) and recorded. All data transmitted to the computer via a wireless connection by a software program were recorded at the end of the treatment.</description>

    <description>The first aim of this study is to compare the effect of detailed video information or basic verbal information on the anxiety levels of patients by using anxiety scales before treatment. The second aim is to evaluate the effect of pretreatment video or verbal information on the stress level occurring in patients during the endodontic treatment steps by using electrodermal activity. The third aim is to investigate the relationship between patients' pretreatment anxiety levels and socio-demographic characteristics which are thought to play a role in anxiety's etiology.</description>
