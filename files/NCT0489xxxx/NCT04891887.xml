    <textblock>
      This is a 2-step study; 1st step was a cross sectional study carried out on 163 consecutive&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients employee attending outpatient clinics of the&#xD;
      National Research Center (NRC), Egypt. A face-to-face interview was carried out to collect&#xD;
      data about demographic data and medical history. Cognitive function assessment was carried&#xD;
      out using Adenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE III) test and the Trail Making Test&#xD;
      (TMT) which consists of two parts (A and B). Quality of life and depression were also&#xD;
      assessed using Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS)&#xD;
      questionnaires respectively. The second step was an interventional study for health education&#xD;
      and life style modification. The main outcome measures were Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG),&#xD;
      HbA1c, total blood cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, oxidant&#xD;
      and antioxidant (Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase&#xD;
      (GR)) which were assessed at baseline and reassessed after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study was carried out during the period from February 2016 to June 2019 on two&#xD;
      steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. First step (baseline assessment): It was a cross sectional study carried out on 163 Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending outpatient clinics at NRC. Patients were 65 males&#xD;
      and 98 females; aged from 40 to 65 years. All patients were literate and were able to&#xD;
      complete the tests of cognitive function. The exclusion criteria were T2DM patients with&#xD;
      history of head trauma, stroke, transient ischemic attack, brain tumor, epilepsy, psychiatric&#xD;
      disease, cardiac or liver failure and visual or hearing disabilities. Approval of NRC ethical&#xD;
      committee was obtained with registration number 15131. Participants signed a written informed&#xD;
      consent before being included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 A face to face interview was carried out with all participants to collect data about&#xD;
      demographics, medical history and cognitive function. Data included age, gender, level of&#xD;
      education, and tobacco smoking. Detailed medical history of diabetes was taken from patients&#xD;
      including age of diagnosis of diabetes, frequency of hypoglycemic attacks, type of treatment&#xD;
      (insulin or oral hypoglycemic drug), history of hypertension, dyslipidemia or other diseases&#xD;
      and medications taken. Any complaint suggestive for presence of sensory peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      such as tingling, burning pain or numbness in hands and feet was recorded. All studied&#xD;
      participants were subjected to thorough clinical examination, systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and anthropometric assessment (weight and height measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Assessment of cognitive function with its domains was carried out using Adenbrooke's&#xD;
      Cognitive Examination III (ACE III) test which assesses five cognitive domains: attention,&#xD;
      memory, verbal fluency, language and visuospatial abilities. It is the most reliable and&#xD;
      validated Arabic form cognitive scale and freely available to be applied. Objective mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) was considered if ACE III score is less than 88. The Trail Making&#xD;
      Test (TMT) was also used. TMT is one of the most widely used instruments in&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment as an indicator of speed of cognitive processing and executive&#xD;
      functioning. It assesses attention, concentration, psychomotor speed, cognitive shifting and&#xD;
      complex sequencing function by measuring the time required to connect a series of&#xD;
      sequentially numbered and lettered circles. The test consists of two parts (A and B). The&#xD;
      direct score of each part is represented by the time of completion of the tasks. Shorter time&#xD;
      indicates better cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was used, it is one of the most widely used&#xD;
      scales that objectively rate depression severity. The scale includes 17 items, each one is&#xD;
      scored on a 3 or 5 points scale, with the final score indicative of the severity of the&#xD;
      patient's depression. The classification of depression level was carried out depending on the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health &amp; Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom (UK) (0-7 = Normal,&#xD;
      8-13 = Mild depression, 14-18 = Moderate depression, 19-22 = Severe depression and ≥ 23 =&#xD;
      Very severe depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Assessment of health related quality of life (HRQOL) was carried out using Short Form-36&#xD;
      (SF-36) questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 36 items comprising eight domains of health&#xD;
      status which are physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general&#xD;
      health perception GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and mental&#xD;
      health (MH). Scoring of each domain is from 0 to 100, with a score of '100' as the best&#xD;
      rating of health. The Arabic version of the questionnaire was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Assessment of T2DM patients' life style. Patients were given a designed questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess their life style regarding nutritional habits, physical, social and mental activities&#xD;
      and the opinion about the best way to motivate them for changing their lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Baseline Laboratory analysis. Five ml blood sample was withdrawn under complete aseptic&#xD;
      technique from each participant, after fasting for at least 10 hours at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study. It was divided into dry plain and lavender ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)&#xD;
      vacutainer tubes. Level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total blood cholesterol were&#xD;
      assessed using Olympus-au-400 chemistry auto-analyzer. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations&#xD;
      in serum was determined using ELISA kit based on the competitive binding enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      technique. Erythrocytes were examined for the enzymatic antioxidant activity of catalase,&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 For miRNAs expression analysis: Blood was drawn into special RNA preservation tubes;&#xD;
      inverted 8-10 times, and then stored frozen at -80°C for further RNA extraction. RNA&#xD;
      isolation and estimation of RNA quality was employed prior to initiating the characterization&#xD;
      of miRNA expression. Only 1-10 nano grams of purified total RNA or equivalent was enough to&#xD;
      reliably quantify the miRNAs of interest. The concentrations of miRNAs selected in this study&#xD;
      was determined by the single target TaqMan miRNA quantitative Real Time (qRT) Polymerase&#xD;
      Chain Reaction (PCR) assay (Applied Biosystems) in the plasma samples according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. A two-step protocol were applied which requires only reverse&#xD;
      transcription with a miRNA-specific primer, followed by real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. The&#xD;
      TaqMan MicroRNA Assays is a target-specific stem-loop structure reverse-transcription primer.&#xD;
      The stem-loop accomplishes two goals: 1) specificity for only the mature miRNA target, and 2)&#xD;
      formation of a Reverse Transcriptase (RT) primer/mature miRNA-chimera, extending the 5' end&#xD;
      of the miRNA. RT reactions containing RNA samples, looped- primers, 1 X buffer, reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase, and RNase inhibitor will be incubated for 30 min each, at 16°C and at 42°C.&#xD;
      The resulting longer RT amplicon presents a template amenable to standard real-time PCR,&#xD;
      using TaqMan assays. Then Real-time PCR was performed on Quant Studio 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR&#xD;
      Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second step (interventional trial): This step was an interventional study for health&#xD;
      education and life style modification. It was carried out to Implementing the life style&#xD;
      modification program on T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Designing two health educational booklets After identifying the T2DM participants' needs,&#xD;
      the research team designed two health education booklets. The first booklet titled &quot;Diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and how to control its complications&quot;. The booklet includes information about T2DM&#xD;
      disease and, how it affects different body systems leading to Diabetes Mellitus (DM)&#xD;
      complications. It includes also information on normal and abnormal level of fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). It demonstrates how to control and prevent DM&#xD;
      complications, stressing on healthy nutrition and carbohydrate counting, physical activities,&#xD;
      strict adherence to medical regimen and avoiding stress. The second booklet titled &quot;Mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and how to prevent&quot; it includes information about definition of&#xD;
      cognitive function, MCI and Alzheimer and its relation with T2DM and risk factors for&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and how to control and improve cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Patient education program implementation: Only 144 participants accepted the invitation&#xD;
      to attend the health education (HE) sessions. The actual number who attended were only 121.&#xD;
      The reasons for non-participation include: lack of interest and they refused commitment to&#xD;
      the life style program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1 Face to face and group discussion HE sessions to encourage life style modification: All&#xD;
      the studied patients were invited to attend the HE sessions. Seven sessions were held at NRC&#xD;
      over a period of nearly 2 months explaining the two designed booklets. HE lectures were&#xD;
      presented by the public health team and a diabetic expert who shared in the group discussion&#xD;
      to explain and answer the questions related to management of T2DM. HE program was provided&#xD;
      for controlling DM, information about foods important to brain health and different&#xD;
      intellectual games to improve their cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2 Dissemination of Educational Materials The prepared booklets were distributed to all&#xD;
      attendants. Participants were informed about the importance of these two booklets in&#xD;
      improving their scientific information on T2DM and MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3 Reassessment of laboratory analysis. Three ml of blood sample was withdrawn under&#xD;
      complete aseptic technique from each participant, after fasting for at least 10 hours at the&#xD;
      time of health education. It aimed to assess FBG, HbA1c and total blood cholesterol just&#xD;
      before the intervention and were reassessed three months during the intervention to be an&#xD;
      incentive for the patients as a monitoring the progress they attained due to life style&#xD;
      modification. Each participant was asked to receive his laboratory results personally from&#xD;
      the research team. This allowed to discuss the interpretation of his results and thus&#xD;
      re-encourage or give him any needed advice to maintain his adherence to the lifestyle&#xD;
      modification program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.4 Clinical follow-up and management were carried out by specialist in endocrinology and&#xD;
      neurology depending on laboratory results and patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.5 Individualized Medical Nutrition program: Each participant was asked to complete a&#xD;
      3-day food diary. These were discussed with each participant individually through a&#xD;
      face-to-face interview in order to advise and convince them to change their dietary habits .&#xD;
      Every patient was taught how he can regulate his diet depending on the result of laboratory&#xD;
      analysis and carbohydrate count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.6 Individualized biweekly follow-up scheme was also distributed as a guide for the&#xD;
      targeted healthy behaviors needed to be changed which allowed self-monitoring of their&#xD;
      achieved progress. Over a period of 6 months, the participants were followed up through&#xD;
      mobile phone, using designed sheet, to assess patients' compliance and adherence to the life&#xD;
      style modification program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.7 WhatsApp phone application group: The participants were welcomed to contact the&#xD;
      research team whenever they had any inquiry concerning life style or treatment modifications.&#xD;
      Through this group, 12 audio messages were recorded and distributed. These messages&#xD;
      summarized the content of the booklet, to be an easily accessible way for the patients to&#xD;
      help them follow the health education. Tips for healthy habits as well as exercises for&#xD;
      mental activities were also uploaded to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.8 Final reassessment of clinical status and laboratory profile. Six months after&#xD;
      recruitment, a face-to-face interview was carried out with the 98 participants who continued&#xD;
      till the end of the study. They fulfilled a final sheet to assess their compliance to the&#xD;
      program. ACE III test and TMT with its two parts A and B tests were reassessed with clinical,&#xD;
      weight and blood pressure reassessment to evaluate the impact of the lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program on cognitive function. Quality of life and depression were reassessed using SF-36 and&#xD;
      HRDS questionnaires respectively. Laboratory analysis for the level of HbA1c, lipid profile,&#xD;
      oxidant and antioxidant were reassessed after the intervention.&#xD;
