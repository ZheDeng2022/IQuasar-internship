  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants were randomised to receive benzalkonium chloride-containing latanoprost&#xD;
      (Xalatan) or preservative-free bimatoprost (Lumigan). Through this study, the investigators&#xD;
      would like to analyze the impact of different antiglaucoma medications on ocular surface&#xD;
      disease in glaucoma patients.&#xD;

      The purpose of our study is to assess the effect of antiglaucoma medication on ocular surface&#xD;
      disease in glaucoma patients before and after treatment with different antiglaucoma&#xD;
      medication. All included patients are newly diagnosed with glaucoma and received no previous&#xD;
      antiglaucoma treatment. Medical records will be collected prospectively from Sep. 15th 2019&#xD;
      to Aug. 31st 2022. The symptoms and signs of ocular surface disease in each individual will&#xD;
      be assessed with questionnaire and clinical exams, including the basal Schirmer's test,&#xD;
      non-invasive tear film breakup time, meibography, and in vivo confocal microscopy before and&#xD;
      at 1, 3, 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
