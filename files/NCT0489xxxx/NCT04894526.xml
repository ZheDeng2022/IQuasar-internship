  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests that meal timing affects metabolic health. For example,&#xD;
      intermittent fasting (IF) may have positive effects on plasma glucose and lipid levels,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure. However, IF protocols often result in significant&#xD;
      weight loss. Therefore, it is not clear to what extent these beneficial metabolic effects are&#xD;
      due to IF or to weight loss. Although the effect of IF independent of weight loss has been&#xD;
      studied, daily energy intake in those studies did not differ between the days. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to examine the effect of alternating energy intake - i.e. standardised&#xD;
      day-to-day fluctuations in energy intake - on metabolic health independent of weight loss.&#xD;
