  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is 2-cohort study. Screening period will be within 28 days before the dose. In the&#xD;
      treatment period, participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single 100 mg oral capsule dose of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib and at 58 minutes postdose of acalabrutinib will receive a single microtracer&#xD;
      (&lt;10 μg; &lt;=1 μCi) [14C]ACP-196 as a 5 mL IV push over 2 minutes; and participants in Cohort 2&#xD;
      will receive a single 100 mL oral solution of acalabrutinib (1 mg/mL oral solution containing&#xD;
      a microtracer dose (&lt;10 μg; &lt;=1 μCi) of [14C]ACP-196). Cohort 1 participants will be confined&#xD;
      continuously from Check-in until Day 5 and Cohort 2 participants will be confined&#xD;
      continuously from Check-in until Day 8.&#xD;
