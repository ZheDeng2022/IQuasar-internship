  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-related problems in newborn babies have been reported with a rate of 4-30%. It is&#xD;
      estimated that the higher rates of these problems in hospitalized children under the age of&#xD;
      two are related to the variety of drugs used and the differences in the age, weight and&#xD;
      diagnosis of the patients. In this context, with the clinical parameters and demographic data&#xD;
      obtained in the first 24 hours of the patients hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit, machine learning algorithms are used to predict the risks that may arise from possible&#xD;
      drug-related problems (prescribing and administration errors, side effects and drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions) that may occur during hospitalization. The algorithm, which will be created by&#xD;
      modeling with a high number of big data pool, is planned to be transformed into a clinical&#xD;
      decision support system software that can be used easily in clinical practice with online and&#xD;
      mobile applications. By processing the data of the patients to be included in the model, it&#xD;
      is aimed to prevent and manage drug-related problems before they occur, as well as to provide&#xD;
      cost-effective medşcation treatment to patients hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit, together with a reduction in the risk of drug-related mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
