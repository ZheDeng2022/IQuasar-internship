  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of the PREDICT-HFpEF study is to identify and unravel predictors for the&#xD;
      development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in a cohort at&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular risk. Patients that were initially included in another prospective&#xD;
      cohort study (LIFE-Heart study) and did not show evident heart failure at that timepoint,&#xD;
      will be followed-up approximately 7-years after their initial inclusion in the LIFE-Heart&#xD;
      study. Patients will be screened for the development of HFpEF and characterized with thorough&#xD;
      clinical as well as laboratory assessment. Patients will be classified according to the&#xD;
      presence of absence of heart failure and predictors for the development will be identified by&#xD;
      using measurements taken at their initial inclusion in the LIFE-Heart study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with severe morbidtiy&#xD;
      and mortality. Yet, little is known about factors leading to the development of HFpEF&#xD;
      investigated in a longitudinal fashion. The PREDICT-HFpEF study aims to adress this open&#xD;
      question. Patients that were initially included in a large cohort study (LIFE-Heart study)&#xD;
      approximately 7-years ago, that underwent thorough clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic&#xD;
      assessment, and did not show evidence of heart failure at the present time point will be&#xD;
      included in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for the development of HFpEF or other forms of heart failure (e.g.&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) and will again undergo thorough clinical,&#xD;
      laboratory and echocardiographic assessment. Initially measured biomarkers (including&#xD;
      clinical data, lab-charts, ECG recordings and echocardiography) will be used to predict the&#xD;
      development of HFpEF in this cohort at cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
