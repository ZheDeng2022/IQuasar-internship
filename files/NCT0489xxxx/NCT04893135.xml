      The rapid normalization of hyperglycemia can cause a neuropathy called Diabetes&#xD;

      The rapid normalization of hyperglycemia can cause a neuropathy called Diabetes&#xD;
      Treatment-Induced Neuropathy (NITD). This phenomenon induces the presence of hyper&#xD;
      vascularization and inflammation in contact with the nerve ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another register in patients living with diabetes, it has been observed the development of&#xD;
      a rare and devastating complication for the joints called the so-called neuroarthropathy of&#xD;
      Charcot (CN). The pathophysiology of CN is not completely known but there is an activation of&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and bone remodeling, disruption of the osteoblast and osteoclast&#xD;
      system, activation of the RANKL system (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand)&#xD;
      and its antagonist osteoprogesterin (OPG). Inflammation and peripheral hypervascularization&#xD;
      therefore seem to be a common link between the two pathologies mentioned (NITD and CN). We&#xD;
      have confirmation that the rapid correction of chronic hyperglycemia can trigger (not&#xD;
      systematically) NITD, but what about the influence of this rapid correction on the appearance&#xD;
      of CN. Furthermore, physical activity (PA) and exercise have long been recognized as the&#xD;
      cornerstones of the prevention and management of chronic diseases, due to their beneficial&#xD;
      effects on the clinical parameters of various diseases. The practice of PA has a preventive&#xD;
      and therapeutic effect against osteoporosis (a disease in which the level of RANKL is&#xD;
      particularly high), so there is in theory a preventive effect of the practice of physical&#xD;
      activity on the development of CN.&#xD;
