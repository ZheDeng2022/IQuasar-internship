  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of an internet-based&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (SONO) to improve the sleep of Portuguese cancer&#xD;
      survivors with insomnia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia disorder comprises a complaint of poor sleep, associated with significant daytime&#xD;
      disturbance, occurring at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months. Insomnia is&#xD;
      prevalent among cancer survivors and tends to be unremitting. Untread insomnia has been&#xD;
      associated with increased cancer-related fatigue and impaired quality of life. Perceived&#xD;
      cognitive impairments and psychological distress are decisive for seeking a sleep&#xD;
      consultation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the gold-standard treatment for insomnia, but&#xD;
      its costs are relatively high and there is a limited number of trained therapists. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      intervention program, SONO, for Portuguese cancer survivors with insomnia. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the waitlist control group. The SONO&#xD;
      program intervention includes weekly sessions and it encompasses an educational component, a&#xD;
      behavioral component, and a cognitive component. Professional feedback and guidance will be&#xD;
      provided by a certified therapist. All eligible participants will complete a battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires from baseline to postintervention, as well as follow-ups.&#xD;
