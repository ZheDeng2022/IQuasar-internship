  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is aimed to improve adherence to the lung cancer screening (LCS) guidelines&#xD;
      and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coverage criteria to conduct shared&#xD;
      decision-making (SDM) and provide smoking cessation services in rural primary care practices.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot intervention will engage no more than 300 patients using a pragmatic, stepped wedge&#xD;
      design guided by an enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM framework. The primary goal of this intervention is&#xD;
      to improve LCS practice by offering a formal SDM process and smoking cessation support&#xD;
      aligned with the CMS coverage criteria. The investigators will conduct a type II&#xD;
      effectiveness implementation hybrid trial using a stepped wedge design to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness (co-primary outcomes of LCS and decision quality) and implementation at four&#xD;
      rural clinics. Space precludes discussion of pragmatic design features, but this study was&#xD;
      designed to be pragmatic using the PRECIS-2 criteria and it scores highly on almost all&#xD;
      PRECIS-2 dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each clinic will recruit the minimum of 9 patients eligible to LCS (based on CMS guidelines)&#xD;
      every 2 months for the total of 8 months. The first period of 2 months is for baseline data,&#xD;
      the second period of 2 months is for step 1 of the stepped wedge design, the third period of&#xD;
      2 months is for step 2 and finally the last 4th period of 2 months is for step 3 of the&#xD;
      stepped wedge design. Each participating patient will receive 2 surveys (one immediately&#xD;
      after the doctor's visit and a second one a month later). The intervention will be in the&#xD;
      form of patient decision aid (information flyer) the participant receives during a healthcare&#xD;
      provider visit.&#xD;

Were you given a decision aid during your last clinic visit/call? Was the clinic provider or staff able to go over the decision aid together with you during your last clinic visit/call? Were you recommended for a low-dose CAT scan by your provider during your last clinic visit/call?</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge about lung cancer will be measured by 5 survey questions previously used by Lau et al in their peer reviewed manuscript published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine titled Evaluation of a Personalized, Web-Based Decision Aid for Lung Cancer Screening (2015 Dec;49(6):e125-9. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.027). The level of knowledge will be assessed based on correct answers to the following survey questions:&#xD;
Factors that increase chances of developing lung cancer include;&#xD;
Possible benefits of lung cancer screening are;&#xD;
Possible harms of lung cancer screening include;&#xD;
Please indicate whether each of the following individuals would be eligible for screening based on their age. They all meet the smoking status and pack-year criteria;&#xD;
What percentage of lumps found on your lungs by the CT screening is NOT going to be cancer?&#xD;
More correct answers indicate higher level of knowledge.</description>
