  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous nephropathy (MN) - the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults - is an&#xD;
      immune-mediated disease that results from the deposition of immunoglobulins and complement&#xD;
      components onto the sub-epithelial layer of the glomerular capillary wall. The availability&#xD;
      for clinical use of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD20,&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to test the effects of specific CD20-targeted intervention aimed to&#xD;
      prevent B-cell dependent mechanisms resulting in the production of nephritogenic&#xD;
      autoantibodies. Rituximab-induced B-cell depletion reduced proteinuria in eight patients with&#xD;
      MN while avoiding the adverse effects of steroids and other immunosuppressants. Subsequent&#xD;
      studies confirmed that rituximab is remarkably safer than non-specific immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents, including cyclosporine, and achieves remission in approximately two-thirds of&#xD;
      patients with MN-associated nephrotic syndrome. After rituximab-induced remission, however,&#xD;
      NS may relapse in approximately one third of patients. Thus, novel therapeutic options are&#xD;
      needed for a substantial proportion of patients with MN who may fail rituximab therapy.&#xD;
      Conceivably, in patients with MN refractory to CD20-targeted therapy, the production of&#xD;
      nephritogenic autoantibodies is sustained by mechanisms that do not depend on autoreactive&#xD;
      CD20+ B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it was shown that CD19-negative bone marrow plasma cells, which express CD38, are&#xD;
      enriched in chronically inflamed tissue and secrete autoantibodies. Treatment of patients&#xD;
      with MN with CD38-targeting antibodies may represent a new therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOR202 is a fully human recombinant monoclonal antibody against CD38 that has demonstrated&#xD;
      in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy in experimental models of multiple myeloma. Antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis are the principal&#xD;
      mechanisms of action for MOR202-induced lysis of myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that CD38-targeted therapy with MOR202 may abrogate&#xD;
      autoantibody-dependent mechanisms in patients with plasma-cell mediated forms of MN who&#xD;
      failed previous treatment with rituximab and second-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies such as ofatumumab. With this background, MOR202 therapy may have an indication&#xD;
      for patients with MN and NS resistant to CD20 targeted therapy.&#xD;
