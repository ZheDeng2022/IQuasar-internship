  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of factors, including the lockdown that was&#xD;
      imposed to limit the spread of infection, the fear of being contaminated during hospital&#xD;
      consultations and the difficulty in accessing general practitioners may have led to delays in&#xD;
      the referral of patients to facilities specialized in the management of diabetic ulcers.&#xD;
      Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and during the first lockdown, we observed a&#xD;
      clear decrease in hospitalizations and consultations for diabetic ulcers. Patients who had&#xD;
      regular follow-up for the management of their diabetic ulcers cancelled their scheduled&#xD;
      appointments for fear of being contaminated in the hospital. It is feared that the current&#xD;
      epidemic context has favored the delay of referral of patients with diabetic ulcers to&#xD;
      specialized facilities, with consequences on the prognosis of these patients and the risk of&#xD;
      lower limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, this project aims to evaluate the impact of confinement on emergency&#xD;
      hospitalizations for foot wounds and the effects on the risk of amputation during the&#xD;
      lockdown and the three months following the end of the lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the lockdown led to a decrease in hospitalizations for foot wounds,&#xD;
      resulting in a delay in the management of these patients, and potentially leading to an&#xD;
      increase in the number of amputations in the three months following the end of the lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, we will also study the impact of confinement on deferrable hospitalizations&#xD;
      (glycemic imbalance, assessment of diabetic complications...) or theoretically non-deferrable&#xD;
      (diabetic comas, ketoacidosis, diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
      stroke...) of diabetes mellitus. This will allow us to evaluate whether our findings relative&#xD;
      to diabetic ulcers could be extended to other complications of diabetes.&#xD;
