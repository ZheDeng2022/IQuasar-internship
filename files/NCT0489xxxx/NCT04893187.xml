  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      single oral administration of 5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg of SSS17 compared with placebo,&#xD;
      and evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      multiple oral administration of 15 mg and 20 mg of SSS17 compared with placebo. In addition,&#xD;
      the study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of SSS17.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy volunteers from a single academic medical center in China. All&#xD;
      participants will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent prior to undergoing study-related procedures.The study will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Subjects will be allocated 2:8 to receive placebo or SSS17（it was only 2:2 in 5mg&#xD;
      dose group）,which will be administered by oral route with single dose. At each dose,&#xD;
      tolerability, safety, PK and PD characteristics will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Subjects will be allocated 2:8 to receive placebo or SSS17, which will be&#xD;
      administered by oral route with multiple dose. At each cohort，tolerability, safety, PK and PD&#xD;
      characteristics will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: The subjects will receive two cycles of treatment, one is given on an empty stomach,&#xD;
      the other is given after a high-fat meal, with an interval of 15 days.&#xD;
