    <textblock>
      This a single-centre, one-arm, open-label pilot study. Eligible patients with mild&#xD;
      proteinuric flares of lupus nephritis Class III/IV±V are received sirolimus without changing&#xD;
      previous immunosuppressive medication during 12-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the efficacy of sirolimus for mild proteinuric flares in patients with&#xD;
           Class III/IV±V lupus nephritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of sirolimus treatment for mild proteinuric flares&#xD;
           in patients with Class III/IV±V lupus nephritis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lupus nephritis is a common and serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
      It often requires aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Although majority of patients with&#xD;
      severe lupus nephritis achieve a complete or partial remission after 6-month induction&#xD;
      treatment, renal flares can still occur during maintenance therapy. Whether patients with&#xD;
      mild proteinuric flares should receive intensive immunosuppressive therapy is unclear. In&#xD;
      pathogenesis of SLE, T-cell dysfunction is attributed to the activation of the mammalian&#xD;
      target of rapamycin (mTOR). Previous prospective and retrospective studies in SLE or lupus&#xD;
      nephritis showed the effect of mTOR blockade on systemic disease activity index or severe&#xD;
      lupus nephritis as initial or maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects with biopsy-proven Class III/IV±V lupus nephritis(ISN/RPS 2003) are&#xD;
      received oral sirolimus without change previous immunosuppressive therapy. We follow up the&#xD;
      included patients at Week 2, Week 4, Week6, Week 8 and Week 12 regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will actively detect and inquire about the occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs)/ severe adverse events (SAEs) at every visit/ contact during the study. The clinical&#xD;
      trials insurance is prepaid by sponsor to cover the design risks of the protocol and&#xD;
      liability/ compensation to the research subject for bodily injury or death resulting from&#xD;
      their participation in the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) assesses disease activity by scoring 24 weighted disease activity descriptors of SLE as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;absent&quot; in preceding 10 days. A patient's total score is the sum of all marked SLE-related descriptors; a total score ranges between 0 and 105, with a higher score representing a more significant degree of disease activity.&#xD;
