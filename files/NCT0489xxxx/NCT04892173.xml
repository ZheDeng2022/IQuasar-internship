      This is a global, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, Investigator's choice Phase 3 (Pivotal&#xD;
      Stage) study to investigate the efficacy/performance and safety of NBTXR3/RT±cetuximab versus&#xD;
      RT±cetuximab in treatment-naïve, platinum-ineligible, elderly participants with LA-HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a screening assessment over a period of ≤28 days to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. At least 1 or 2 measurable target lesion(s) per RECIST 1.1 that is/are amenable&#xD;
      for intratumoral/intranodal injection must be present as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have a single invaded lymph node to be eligible for intranodal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be treated by the Investigator's choice of RT alone or RT in&#xD;
      combination with cetuximab. Following the Investigator's choice, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio on Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: NBTXR3, as an intratumoral/intranodal injection, activated by investigator's&#xD;
           choice of RT alone or RT in combination with cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Investigator's choice of RT alone or RT in combination with cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (Arm A and Arm B) will start RT treatment on Day 16, after contouring of&#xD;
      lesions and dosimetry calculations are complete, and will receive 70 Gy in 35 fractions over&#xD;
      a 7 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EOT visit will be performed 4 weeks after the completion of RT. Follow-up visits will&#xD;
      start at 12 weeks post-RT completion, and will continue every 12 weeks for 2 years, and then&#xD;
      every 24 weeks thereafter until death; the participant is determined to be lost to follow up;&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent; or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Patients who have&#xD;
      received further anti-cancer therapy and/or have had disease progression/recurrence will be&#xD;
      followed only for survival information&#xD;
