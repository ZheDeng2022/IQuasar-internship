  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus that appears to have first&#xD;
      emerged in China in November 2019 causing cases of atypical pneumonia. Since then, the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption to healthcare systems with significant&#xD;
      socioeconomic impacts. As of 22 December 2020, the virus had spread to all corners of the&#xD;
      globe, involving 218 countries/regions with over 78.00 million confirmed cases reported and&#xD;
      more than 1.71 million associated deaths. As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZeneca&#xD;
      is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains the&#xD;
      virus's receptor binding domain, which enables the virus to bind to receptors on human cells.&#xD;
      By targeting this region of the virus's spike protein, antibodies can block the virus's&#xD;
      attachment to human cells, and, therefore, are expected to block infection. AZD7442, a&#xD;
      combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for administration&#xD;
      to treat or prevent COVID-19. There are currently one ongoing Phase I study and two ongoing&#xD;
      Phase III studies with AZD7442, in addition to this treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of approximately 40 Japanese participants is planned.&#xD;
