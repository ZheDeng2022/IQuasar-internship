    <textblock>
      To investigate the Effect of Kabat motor control re-education therapy on facial nerve Electro&#xD;
      physiological responses and facial muscles function in bell's palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: facial nerve recovery in children could be improved through facilitation of nerve&#xD;
      regeneration which can be enhanced through Kabat motor control re-education therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty children with bell's palsy will participate in this study. The patients will randomly&#xD;
      be divided into two equal groups; the control group received the conventional selected&#xD;
      program, and the study group received the same exercise training program in addition to Kabat&#xD;
      motor control re-education therapy. The program of treatment will be three times per week for&#xD;
      six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation methods: Facial nerve distal latency, amplitude, and percentage of&#xD;
      degenerations via the Neuropack S1 MEB9004 EMG device, the Facial Disability Index, and&#xD;
      Sunnybrook facial grading system (SBFGS) all the assessment methods before the program and&#xD;
      after finishing the program&#xD;

    <description>it is a clinical grading system of facial function in facial palsy. It consists of 13 items-3 resting, 5 voluntary movement and 5 synkinesis items-answered on categorical answering scales. A SB composite score (range 0-100) and resting symmetry (range 0-20), voluntary movement (range 20-100) and synkinesis subscores (0-15) can be calculated.</description>
