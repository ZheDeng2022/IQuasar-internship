  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate in this pilot study whether standardized prone positioning compared to&#xD;
      usual positioning improves moderate to severe BPD rates as assessed at 36 weeks post&#xD;
      conceptional age in very low birth weight preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to enroll and randomize infants born at less than 1500 grams at birth, who remain on&#xD;
      positive pressure support for at least 7 days after birth AND/OR on any other respiratory&#xD;
      device such as nasal cannula with flow rates greater than 2LPM receiving supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      of greater than 21% for at least 7 days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose families consent to participation will be assigned via block randomization to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. usual care in which positioning and duration in each position is random per usual&#xD;
           nursing routine OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Receive standardized scheduled daily prone positioning starting on day of life 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of normal developmental care, most infants are evaluated and have care rendered&#xD;
      (touch-time), if stable, and repositioned at set three-hour intervals to permit uninterrupted&#xD;
      sleep and/or rest. The hands-off interval will be maintained throughout the study interval.&#xD;
      Infants randomized to the standardized scheduled daily prone positioning will be placed in&#xD;
      prone body position for a total of 6 hours daily, that is prone position for 3 hours,&#xD;
      followed by supine positioning for 3 hrs, then placed in prone position for another 3-hour&#xD;
      interval. Both infants randomized to standardized prone positioning and usual positioning&#xD;
      will have a bedside card card identifying that the infant is a study participant and will&#xD;
      serve as a way to document the number of times any infant enrolled in the study is placed in&#xD;
      prone positioning even if not randomized to standardized prone positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized daily positioning will occur for randomized patients until 36 weeks or discharge&#xD;
      whichever is first. The primary outcome of moderate or severe BPD will be assigned by blinded&#xD;
      study personnel based on respiratory support parameters on the day the infant is 36 weeks&#xD;
      postconceptional age.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  infants born at less than 1500 grams at birth, who remain on positive pressure support&#xD;
             for at least 7 days after birth AND/OR on any other respiratory device such as nasal&#xD;
             cannula with flow rates greater than 2LPM receiving supplemental oxygen of greater&#xD;
             than 21% for at least 7 days after birth. Positive pressure for the purposes of this&#xD;
             study is defined a nasal cannula delivering a flow of 2 LPM or higher, continuous&#xD;
             positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or&#xD;
             non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIPPV/NIMV), as well infants who are intubated or&#xD;
             have a tracheostomy for oxygenation and ventilation related to their lung disease,&#xD;
             irrespective of the mode of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  infants who were previously on room air without a respiratory device who were&#xD;
             intubated for the purposes of surgery and were not receiving respiratory support as&#xD;
             defined above prior, those intubated for other airway issues such as tracheal&#xD;
             stenosis, broncheo- or tracheomalacia, etc and not for the management of BPD.&#xD;
             Additional patients to be excluded include those with suspected or proven genetic or&#xD;
             other major congenital anomalies that may impact cardiac and lung function including&#xD;
             cardiac and lung anomalies, as well as those at the time of enrollment who require&#xD;
             surgeries that will impact their ability to be placed in prone positioning (eg&#xD;
             gastroschisis, omphalocele, etc).&#xD;
