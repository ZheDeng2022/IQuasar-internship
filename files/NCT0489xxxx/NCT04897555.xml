      The purpose of this research is to study the ongoing effectiveness of a light therapy device&#xD;
      for human hair growth. This device, called the iRestore Eyebrow Device, is a type of cold, or&#xD;
      non-heat producing light therapy system that will emit light on the hair growth cells within&#xD;
      and around the hair follicle. When these cells do not function properly, one may experience&#xD;
      common problems such as baldness and thinning or brittle hair. The application of a special&#xD;
      category of low-level light to be studied in the project may cause an increase in essential&#xD;
      nutrients to the damaged hair follicles and skin cells, leading to a reduction in hair loss&#xD;
      and in some cases, possibly leading to re-growth.&#xD;

      This study on LLLT aims to define the safety and physiologic effects that occur when the&#xD;
      human hair follicle and surrounding tissue structures are exposed to this type of radiation.&#xD;
      Thus far, all reports on the efficacy of laser light and LED light in this area, have been,&#xD;
      in large part, unsupported by multi-center, randomized, double blind, controlled studies. To&#xD;
      properly identify the effects in human subjects, exposure to LLLT is not sufficient. The&#xD;
      analysis of the non-radiated and radiated tissues is required to elucidate the tissue&#xD;
      response and efficacy of the laser therapy. The theory that is widely accepted is that the&#xD;
      mitochondria are the powerhouse of the stem cells that cause hair growth. The LLLT &quot;turns on&quot;&#xD;
      the nutrient pump process that energizes the mitochondria, which leads to an increase in ATP&#xD;
      and subsequent reversal of hair follicles from the dormant stage of growth called telogen, to&#xD;
      the active growth stage called anagen.&#xD;
