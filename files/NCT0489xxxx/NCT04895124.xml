  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 2012 and 2014, a cohort of 90 COPD subjects of disease severity grades GOLD I-IV as&#xD;
      well as 60 healthy control subjects (30 smokers and 30 non-smokers) have been examined&#xD;
      regarding different clinical and blood/ sputum derived biomarkers at the investigators'&#xD;
      research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of this cohort, 116 subjects were re-invited for the first follow-up study Ribolution II&#xD;
      (NTC02522026) after 3 years (+/- 6 months) and data on the clinical course and treatment&#xD;
      changes was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This second follow-up study will re-examine all available subjects regarding disease course&#xD;
      and treatment changes after 3 years (+/-6 months) for the investigation of ncRNA/&#xD;
      transcriptome biomarkers for their potential to indicate disease progression. In addition,&#xD;
      biobanking of respective biosamples for potential future COPD biomarker research will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participation in the study &quot;11-03 Ribolution&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females will be considered for inclusion if they are: not pregnant, as confirmed by&#xD;
             pregnancy test (see flow chart), and not nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, clinical chemistry,&#xD;
             hematology, urinalysis, vital signs, lung function or ECG at screening visit, which,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study or may influence the results of the study, or the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Past or present disease developed after the participation in &quot;11-03 Ribolution&quot; or&#xD;
             &quot;15-01 Ribolution II&quot;, which might interfere with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in another clinical trial 30 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Risk of non-compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and&#xD;
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of an acute infection four weeks prior to the study procedures, including -&#xD;
             but not limited to - moderate or severe exacerbation (requiring oral corticosteroid,&#xD;
             antibiotics or hospitalization). All courses of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics&#xD;
             must be completed at least four weeks prior to all study procedures (with the&#xD;
             exception of the informed consent). In case of significant acute infections or&#xD;
             moderate or severe exacerbation, the study participation can be split in two separate&#xD;
             visits (1. Informed consent visit, 2. Study procedures visit, when subject is fully&#xD;
             resolved, at least four weeks after the end of infection/ exacerbation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If performed according to SOP FHI-1-18, positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test on Day&#xD;
             1. Subjects may be re-screened when confirmatory nucleic acid amplification test was&#xD;
             negative or when officially ordered quarantine has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Being a vulnerable subject (dependent, in detention or without mental capacity).&#xD;
