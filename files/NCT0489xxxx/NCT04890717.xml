      Autism (ASD) is one of the frequent neurodevelopmental disorders that children would occur.&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that individuals with Autism are more common to experience&#xD;
      significant gastrointestinal problems than other individuals. Symptoms include constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhea, abdominal pain and gastric reflux. A recent study with 50 children with ASD, 50&#xD;
      children with other developmental disabilities and 50 healthy control children, it found that&#xD;
      70% of ASD children had presented with GI symptoms, compared with 42% of developmental&#xD;
      disabilities children and 28% of developing children, it is believed that ASD children will&#xD;
      have a distinctive microbial pattern in the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is another neurodevelopmental and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral disorder. A study found that ADHD individuals experience significantly higher&#xD;
      rate of stomach pain and bowel problems than other control individuals. It is suggested that&#xD;
      the microbiota in the stool of ADHD children might be different. Genetic study also found&#xD;
      that if a child has a sibling with ADHD, the risk of developing ADHD is three to four times&#xD;
      higher than that of children with siblings without ADHD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was first developed by Kanner in 1943. In Hong Kong, a study&#xD;
      showed that as many as 49 out of 10,000 children were diagnosed in Autism. ASD is one of the&#xD;
      frequent neurodevelopmental disorders that children would occur. Many studies have shown that&#xD;
      individuals with Autism are more common to experience significant gastrointestinal problems&#xD;
      than other individuals. Symptoms include constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and gastric&#xD;
      reflux. In a study with 160 children with ASD, 59% had GI symptoms, including diarrhoea,&#xD;
      unformed stool, constipation, bloating and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). A study compared&#xD;
      51 ASD children, and 40 healthy control children found that 63% of ASD children had moderate&#xD;
      or severe diarrhoea and constipation symptoms. In contrast, only 2% of control children had&#xD;
      such experience. Similarly, a study of 150 children, with 50 children with ASD, 50 children&#xD;
      with other developmental disabilities and 50 healthy control children, it found that 70% of&#xD;
      ASD children had presented with GI symptoms, compared with 42% of developmental disabilities&#xD;
      children and 28% of developing children. Other study stated that such untreated GI symptoms&#xD;
      might worsen the behavioural issue of ASD children. As there is a strong relationship between&#xD;
      ASD children and GI symptoms, it is believed that ASD children will have a distinctive&#xD;
      microbial pattern in the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is another neurodevelopmental and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral disorder. In Hong Kong, there were 8.9% of ADHD children among Primary one&#xD;
      Chinese schoolboys. A large study (N=6483) found that ADHD individuals experience a&#xD;
      significantly higher rate of stomach pain and bowel problems than other control individuals.&#xD;
      McKeown did another study also reported that ADHD children were more likely to experience&#xD;
      constipation and stool incontinence than normal healthy children. In one study that compared&#xD;
      the Gastrointestinal Severity Index scoring between children with ADHD and healthy subjects,&#xD;
      children with ADHD had significantly higher mean and scored higher in constipation, diarrhoea&#xD;
      and flatulence variables. As the findings of ADHD individuals and gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      are closely associated, the microbiota in the stool might be different from normal children&#xD;
      without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence implicated gut microbiota play a role in autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (ASD). A huge community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract impacts the&#xD;
      development and function of the immune, metabolic, and nervous systems via the gut-brain&#xD;
      axis. Majority of studies shown the diversity of gut microbiota changed in children with ASD&#xD;
      compared with that of typically developing (TD) children, suggesting that the overall&#xD;
      microbiota composition altered in ASD. Differences were observed between ASD and TD when&#xD;
      comparing the abundance of bacteria in phyla and species level. Potential faecal bacteria&#xD;
      biomarkers in the stool of children with ASD will be a useful non-invasive tool for early&#xD;
      detection that will benefit more children with suspected conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiota was involved in many aspects of behaviour was confirmed in animal studies and&#xD;
      human trial but it remains unclear whether gut microbiota recover in children with ASD after&#xD;
      the intervention. Genetic research has revealed that if a child has a sibling with ADHD, the&#xD;
      risk of developing ADHD is three to four times higher than that of children with siblings&#xD;
      without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, previous studies showed that maternal unhealthy diet, tobacco use, and the harmful&#xD;
      use of alcohol during pregnancy induce a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts&#xD;
      offspring social behavior and has a fundamental role in the etiopathogenesis of ASD and ADHD.&#xD;
      In some cases, children who have experienced stress, emotional abuse and violence are more&#xD;
      prone to ADHD behaviour.&#xD;
