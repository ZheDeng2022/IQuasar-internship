  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activity&#xD;
      associated with making decisions about drinking alcohol in everyday situations, some of which&#xD;
      may involve important activities happening the next day. The secondary aims are to determine&#xD;
      whether severity of alcohol-related problems is related to brain activity and alcohol choices&#xD;
      and to examine how different areas of the brain interact in connected networks.&#xD;

      The overall objective of this study is to examine brain activity associated with making&#xD;
      decisions about drinking alcohol in everyday situations, some of which may involve important&#xD;
      activities happening the next day. The secondary aims are to determine whether severity of&#xD;
      alcohol-related problems is related to brain activity and alcohol choices and to examine how&#xD;
      different areas of the brain interact in connected networks. The study involves two testing&#xD;
      sessions -- a baseline interview conducted virtually or in-person, and a MRI scanning session&#xD;
      at University of Kansas Medical Center. Participants (N=80, 50% female, age 21-55) are&#xD;
      community adults who report drinking alcohol in excess of NIAAA-recommended weekly drinking&#xD;
      limits (i.e., heavy drinkers who consume 14/7+ drinks per week for men/women). Participants&#xD;
      will complete hypothetical alcohol purchase tasks during the MRI scan with two conditions&#xD;
      being examined. A control condition involves a typical drinking situation with no explicit&#xD;
      responsibilities. An experimental condition involves a hypothetical situation with important&#xD;
      personally-relevant responsibilities the next day (e.g., a presentation at work, an exam, or&#xD;
      caregiving responsibilities).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will report how many standard drinks they would consume at varying prices using a hypothetical Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) procedure. The APT is a validated self-report measure of alcohol consumption (in standard drink units) at escalating prices (18 price intervals, ranging from $0 to $80/drink). Responses on APT are analyzed to generate observed and derived indices of alcohol demand, including: intensity (consumption at free price); breakpoint (maximum price for spent for a single drink); Omax (maximum expenditure on alcohol); and Elasticity (proportionate slope of the alcohol demand curve)</description>

    <description>During the fMRI scan, participants will complete alcohol purchase task paradigm for hypothetical alcohol rewards under two conditions. In the next-day responsibility condition, we will present a vignette describing a drinking scenario in which participants have a significant activity the next day (e.g., a work, family, or academic obligation the next morning) and participants are asked to imagine they are deciding how much they want to drink in this situation. The control condition will use a vignette describing a typical drinking scenario with no explicit responsibilities the next day</description>
