  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MARS is an artificial intelligence-powered system that aims at detecting common fetal&#xD;
      anomalies during real-time obstetrics ultrasound. The current study comprises 2 stages: (1)&#xD;
      The stage of model creation which will include retrospective collection of images from fetal&#xD;
      anatomy scans with known diagnoses to train these model and test their diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
      (2) The stage of model validation through prospective application of this model to collected&#xD;
      videos with known normal and abnormal diagnoses&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine second trimester anomaly scan has become a routine part of antenatal care. Early&#xD;
      detection of fetal anomalies permits patient counselling, consideration of termination if&#xD;
      detected anomalies are considerable, and arrangement of delivery and immediate neonatal care&#xD;
      if indicated. Furthermore, with the expanding role of fetal interventions, early detection of&#xD;
      fetal anomalies may expand management options, some of which may lead superior outcomes&#xD;
      compared to postnatal interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, fetal anatomy scan necessitates a particular level of training and expertise, either&#xD;
      by sonographers or obstetricians. Unfortunately, availability of experienced personals may be&#xD;
      globally limited. Furthermore, first trimester anatomy scan has been evolving rapidly as&#xD;
      ultrasound machine continues to develop and clinical research yields more information on&#xD;
      first trimester normal standards and abnormal ranges. Accordingly, first trimester scan is&#xD;
      anticipated to be a part of routine care in the near future. Although this tool should&#xD;
      provide substantial benefits to obstetric patients, this would require more providers with&#xD;
      specific training, which is unlikely to be readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence has been incorporated in the medical field for more than 20 years.&#xD;
      With the advancement of deep learning algorithms, deep learning has yielded exceptional&#xD;
      accuracy in image recognition. In the last decade, deep learning exhibits high quality&#xD;
      performance that may exceed human performance at times. One of the earliest and most&#xD;
      prevalent applications of deep learning in medicine are radiology-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators will create a series of deep learning models that&#xD;
      appraise and identify common fetal anomalies in a series of frames including recorded videos&#xD;
      or real time ultrasound. Deep learning algorithms will be fed by labelled images of known&#xD;
      normal and abnormal findings representing common fetal anomalies for both training and&#xD;
      validation. These images will be collected retrospectively through medical records of&#xD;
      contributing centers. Their diagnostic performance will be tested on retrospectively&#xD;
      collected videos including normal and abnormal findings. In the second stage of the study,&#xD;
      These models will be applied to prospectively collected videos of fetal anatomy scan for&#xD;
      further validation.&#xD;
