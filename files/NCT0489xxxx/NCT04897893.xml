  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to scientific literature, oils containing omega-3 fatty acids may decrease certain&#xD;
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, blood level of triglycerides&#xD;
      (TGs) and cholesterol. The omega-3 index (amount of EPA + DHA in the blood) is a recognized&#xD;
      biomarker for assessing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Its optimal value is 8%&#xD;
      compared to the Canadian population average of only 4.5%. The scientific literature contains&#xD;
      several good studies on omega-3 fatty acids, however, it is difficult to compare&#xD;
      dose-response relationships between studies since formulations are not similar and markers of&#xD;
      exposure to treatment are not standardized. The AA/EPA ratio, combined with the omega-3&#xD;
      index, is a good way to monitor the increase in omega-3 levels in the blood, but especially&#xD;
      to determine the inflammatory status of a patient. Indeed, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a&#xD;
      fatty acid with inflammation-resolving properties, while arachidonic acid (AA) is a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory agent. A high AA/EPA ratio therefore indicates a high inflammatory status&#xD;
      while a low ratio indicates a better balance between active inflammation and its resolution.&#xD;
      Moreover, it was published in 2018 that a AA/EPA ratio of around 3 was directly associated&#xD;
      with a 25% reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigator wants to determine the minimum MAG-EPA dose needed to achieve an AA/EPA ratio&#xD;
      equivalent to 4g of EPA in the form of ethyl ester (EE-EPA). It is reasonable to estimate&#xD;
      that 2g of MAG-EPA should be sufficient to produce an average AA/EPA ratio around 3.1.&#xD;

      This pilot study aims to determine the average value of the ratio of arachidonic to&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acids (AA/EPA) in a population aged 50 and over without any particular&#xD;
      medical condition when supplemented with 2g per day of MAG-EPA for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Main objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To recruit a population of 30 subjects aged 50 and over without any particular medical&#xD;
           condition in order to administer 2.0g of MAG-EPA per day for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By measuring the omega-3 index level of all subjects before starting the study and&#xD;
           thereafter every 6 weeks over a total period of 12 weeks, the investigator will analyse&#xD;
           the individual levels of arachidonic acids and eicosapentaenoic acids to establish the&#xD;
           AA/EPA ratio at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The initial AA/EPA ratio will be compared to that obtained after 12 weeks of MAG-EPA&#xD;
           supplementation. The results of the present study will be compared to those obtained by&#xD;
           daily supplementation with 4.0g of EE-EPA over a similar period of time (taken from the&#xD;
           scientific literature) to determine whether MAG-EPA meets the statistical criteria for&#xD;
           non- inferiority in terms of response to the AA/EPA ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze markers of inflammation such as CRP and PSA (in men only) as well as COX-2&#xD;
           activity before starting the study and thereafter every 6 weeks for a total period of 12&#xD;
           weeks in order to identify the best clinical markers of response to MAG-EPA in the&#xD;
           context of the treatment of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze the lipid profile, before starting the study and thereafter every 6 weeks over a&#xD;
           total period of 12 weeks in order to better characterize the effects of MAG-EPA&#xD;
           supplementation on this clinical parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the proportion of participants who achieve an omega-3 index of at least 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterize the effects of MAG-EPA supplementation on the proportion of senescent white&#xD;
           blood cells, on the omega-6/omega-3 ratio as well as on the subject's blood trans fat&#xD;
           content.&#xD;

    <description>The individual content of all fatty acids present in humans will be analysed for each subject on red blood cells obtained by blood sampling after 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid monoglycerides (MAG-EPA). With the individual fatty acid contents obtained for each timepoint, it will be possible to calculate an omega-3 index (% of omega-3, EPA + DHA, on total fatty acids), the total omega-6/omega-3 ratio and finally, the ratio of arachidonic acids to eicosapentaenoic acids (AA/EPA).</description>

The duration of treatment should not be prolonged in the event of missed doses, that is, treatment should end on the 84th day as planned. A deviation of ± 3 days is acceptable, which means that treatment can be stopped from day 81 to day 87 of subject's participation.</description>
