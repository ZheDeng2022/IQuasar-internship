      Previous studies have highlighted the need to offer targeted effective interventions to&#xD;
      strengthen the wellbeing of all family members in families with children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Interventions for this target group requires development&#xD;
      and research. A new family intervention, Dialogical Family Guidance (DFG) was tested in this&#xD;
      study. All families received DFG intervention ( 6 meetings ).&#xD;

      Previous studies have highlighted the need to offer targeted effective interventions to&#xD;
      strengthen the wellbeing of all family members in families with children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Interventions for this target group requires development&#xD;
      and research. A new family intervention, Dialogical Family Guidance (DFG) was tested in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty families of children with NDD were randomized into two intervention groups.&#xD;
      Intervention group I were delivered DFG immediately, and Intervention group II were delivered&#xD;
      DFG after three months. Family functionality, health and support (FAFHES), SDQ and the&#xD;
      5-15-questionnaire and DFG parent questionnaires were used to collect data at baseline, after&#xD;
      three and six months. Fifty families were invited to the study. Thirty-four families&#xD;
      completed the study. A comparison were made between Intervention group I and II.&#xD;

    <measure>The Family Function, Health and Social Support - scale (FAFHES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline measure before DFG family intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>The FAFHES questionnaire contains three sections; family functionality (19 items), family health (23 items), and family support provided by professionals (21 items). All the items are measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1-6 (I disagree totally, I disagree, I disagree somewhat, I agree somewhat, I agree, I agree totally). Family functionality, family health and family support were seen as poor if the median was 1.00-2.7, moderate if it was 2.8-4.5, and good if it was 4.6-6.0.45. Parent questionnaire. 1=I totally disagree.....6=I absolutely agree. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>The Dialogical Family Guidance (DFG) - questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after baseline measure, when intervention is finished.</time_frame>
    <description>The DFG-questionnaire was developed for this study to obtain information and parents' experiences about the DFG family intervention. The questionnaire include 14 items. Questions about the content and recommendation of DFG sessions were for example: &quot;Did you get practical tips for daily life?&quot; (1= yes absolutely….5=not at all) and &quot;Would you recommend DFG to other parents?&quot; (1=yes absolutely….4=no). The following semi-structured open-ended question was included in the DFG-questionnaire: Could you describe your experiences, comments or/and ideas about how to improve DFG? Parents filled the questionnaire after completing the DFG process (six meetings). Most questions were opinions about DFG, but when questions about &quot;Did you get help from DFG?&quot; 1=very much.... 5=not at all</description>

    <description>SDQ measures the changes in child's behavior. 25 items with 3-point likert scale; Not true (0)- Somewhat true (1) - Certainly true (2). Parent questionnaire. Higher scores mean worse outcome considering the child with neurodevelopmental disorder.Highest scores 50 - lowest 0. Total score16-40 = high risk for abnormalities.</description>
