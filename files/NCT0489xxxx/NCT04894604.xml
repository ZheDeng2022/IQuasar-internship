    <textblock>
      The ASOLO-SCI investigation is a Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and performance of the Avance® Solo NPWT System in treating low to moderate&#xD;
      exuding surgically closed incisions for up to 14 days when used in accordance with the&#xD;
      Instructions for Use (IfU).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ASOLO-SCI investigation is designed as a prospective, open, non-comparative, PMCF study&#xD;
      to investigate the safety and performance of the Avance® Solo NPWT System in treating low to&#xD;
      moderate exuding surgically closed incisions for up to 14 days when used in accordance with&#xD;
      the IfU in up to 34 patients (n=34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASOLO-SCI investigation is a multicentre study that is expected to take place in&#xD;
      approximately three European centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment shall be stopped earlier (i.e. prior to 14 days), in the event study&#xD;
      Subjects withdraw their consent, or shall the Principal Investigator and clinical team deem&#xD;
      the Avance® Solo NPWT System to be no longer adequate for the study Subject's wound.&#xD;
      Following termination of Subject participation for whichever reason in the study, the patient&#xD;
      shall be followed in accordance with the local standard of care in wound management and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary endpoint, the Principal Investigator and clinical team will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      surgical incision remains closed, from baseline to study end at Day 14.&#xD;
