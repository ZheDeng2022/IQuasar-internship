    <textblock>
      Improving the health literacy of adolescents and increasing the success of transitions to&#xD;
      adulthood from foster care are two defined Healthy People 2030 public health priorities.&#xD;
      Skills to promote health literacy and independent living are often lacking in adolescents in&#xD;
      foster care and young adults who have aged out of care. Frequent placement changes, no&#xD;
      permanent home, lack of trust in adults and systems of care prevent the development of a&#xD;
      strong support system for transitioning to adulthood from foster care, which can result in&#xD;
      lack of access to personal health information, complicated identity documents, and&#xD;
      disconnected child welfare, health care and community resources. These factors limit the&#xD;
      ability to transition to adulthood successfully, drive disparities in health outcomes, and&#xD;
      may explain lack of educational attainment and career development for young adults formerly&#xD;
      in care. Successful transitions to independent living are unattainable unless barriers are&#xD;
      addressed with a multidisciplinary, community-based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rees-Jones Center for Foster Care Excellence at Children's Health and the Krissi Holman&#xD;
      Family Resource Library at Children's Health recognized the unique needs of adolescents in&#xD;
      foster care and young adults formerly in care (AYAFC) as they transition to independent&#xD;
      living. We developed a partnership with community agencies (Empowering Youth Taskforce) that&#xD;
      support these youth in the areas of child welfare (TX Department of Family and Protective&#xD;
      Services), education (UNT PuSH Program), career development and housing support (TRAC at City&#xD;
      Square, Zoie's Place), legal support (SMU Dedman Law School), and others, to increase AYAFC&#xD;
      health literacy, access to health care, and awareness and use of available community&#xD;
      resources. Frequent placement changes and unstable housing make it difficult for AYAFC to&#xD;
      keep their health information, identity records and personal documents together, which is&#xD;
      critical for accessing health services, enrolling in health insurance, and maintaining&#xD;
      wellness. Since many have access to a smart phone, using technology is one way to promote&#xD;
      adolescent health and wellness. An app is a possible solution to address many of the barriers&#xD;
      that impede successful transition to independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to engage AYAFC and stakeholders who support these young people&#xD;
      throughout North Texas to collaboratively design an app to support the transition from foster&#xD;
      care to adulthood. This project will utilize a mixed methods approach to inform the&#xD;
      transition process while addressing both individual and systems level barriers to increase&#xD;
      the success of AYAFC's transition to independent living. This project builds upon work done&#xD;
      by a multidisciplinary community task force led by the Principal Investigator, and the&#xD;
      development of an adolescent transition process at the Rees-Jones Clinic. Community partners&#xD;
      are fully engaged in the design of the intervention and will be involved in AYAFC and&#xD;
      stakeholder recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation of the results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is uniquely community-based as the only known digital information-sharing&#xD;
      project that will solicit input directly from AYAFC and multiple community stakeholders.&#xD;
      Prior studies had input from youth in care, child welfare personnel and health care&#xD;
      providers; our project includes stakeholders involved in life skills and employment training,&#xD;
      housing support, legal advocacy, and education for a more robust community perspective. Other&#xD;
      information sharing resources have been web-based, which is more challenging to access, or&#xD;
      resulted in a paper guidebook. Our innovative app maximizes ease of access and portability&#xD;
      without requiring significant cellular data usage. Assessing the health literacy skills of&#xD;
      AYAFC can inform future interventions to support transitions to wellness in adulthood while&#xD;
      youth are still in foster care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is supported by the Region 3 Foster Care Consortium, a coalition of&#xD;
      organizations and individuals committed to improving the lives of children involved in the&#xD;
      foster care system. The Empowering Youth Task Force members are community partners who&#xD;
      specialize helping youth in foster care successfully transition to adulthood. Each member&#xD;
      organization contributes expertise on specific issues surrounding AYAFC they serve. They will&#xD;
      engage in participant recruitment, app design and dissemination. Members of the Empowering&#xD;
      Youth Task Force include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rees-Jones Center for Foster Care Excellence is a community leader in clinical care,&#xD;
      policy and advocacy and research. Roles include project design; development focus group&#xD;
      questions; focus group and survey data collection and analysis; expertise on adolescent&#xD;
      transitions from the medical provider, behavioral health provider, foster parent, and&#xD;
      caseworker perspective; stakeholder engagement, and information dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Krissi Holman Family Resource Library at Children's Health provide expertise in&#xD;
      literature review and health literacy. Roles include project design; development focus group&#xD;
      questions; survey and focus group and data collection and analysis. They will provide links&#xD;
      to reliable health information and resources, and plain language educational materials that&#xD;
      can be utilized through the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transition Resource Action Center at City Square supports transition-age youth with&#xD;
      employment, education and housing, providing perspective on the issues facing young adults&#xD;
      aging out of foster care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Southern Methodist University Dedman Law School Child Advocacy Clinic is a community&#xD;
      expert on legal issues for youth aging out of foster care and will provide information&#xD;
      resources (letter of support attached) The University of North Texas' Persevere UNTil Success&#xD;
      Happens (PUSH) Program supports former foster youth and will provide additional perspectives&#xD;
      on the needs of youth transitioning out of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services and their Child Protective Services&#xD;
      and Preparation for Adult Living Program contributes expertise in child welfare transition&#xD;
      services available to youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superior Star Health Transition Services provides expertise in health insurance and support&#xD;
      for AYAFC and will provide perspective regarding youth engagement in health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional community partners include Dallas Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and&#xD;
      Zoie's Place, who provide information as unbiased child advocates and perspective about needs&#xD;
      surrounding life skills training, support and transitional housing for AYAFC, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Most AYAFC have phones. An app is an ideal tool to help them manage reputable&#xD;
      sources for health education and information, document storage, and access to community and&#xD;
      child welfare resources. A community-engaged approach with AYAFC with first-hand knowledge of&#xD;
      the foster care system will result in an app that is relevant and acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study Design: Aim 1: Using mixed methods, (survey and focus groups) conduct a needs&#xD;
      assessment that measures health literacy and assesses health information, supportive care,&#xD;
      and resource needs for AYAFC transitioning from foster care to independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Methods: Survey of AYAFC to assess health literacy skills, assessment of knowledge&#xD;
      of health and community resources, attitudes surrounding available resources and confidence&#xD;
      in accessing digital information. Focus groups with AYAFC and community stakeholders to&#xD;
      assess current needs surrounding health literacy, health information and community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AYAFC Inclusion Criteria for all focus groups and surveys: 1) AYAFC: English-speaking, ages&#xD;
      18-24 who live in Texas Region 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community stakeholders Inclusion Criteria (focus groups): English-speaking adults (18+) who&#xD;
      support AYAFC (e.g. caregivers, medical, legal, and social service professionals)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: App Development and Implementation: App development and implementation will use a&#xD;
      user-centered design approach. This involves a needs assessment and targeted user feedback to&#xD;
      develop an app framework. After legal approval, app infrastructure, capabilities and&#xD;
      functionality are developed, design build-out and front and back-end integration occurs. User&#xD;
      acceptability testing occurs at each step with testing and piloting before full roll-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation method: (a) Survey of implementation outcomes. (b) 4 additional focus groups with&#xD;
      AYAFC and community stakeholders to assess attitudes toward app content, design, and&#xD;
      usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: By survey, reassess health literacy skills, and knowledge, attitudes, and confidence&#xD;
      in accessing health information and needs for community resources.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        At least 40% of adolescents in foster care have a chronic health problem or significant&#xD;
        mental health diagnosis; many take medications daily. One third of adolescents in foster&#xD;
        care do not have a permanent home prior to turning 18. They often have multiple placement&#xD;
        changes, extended involvement in the child welfare system and substantial neglect, abuse&#xD;
        and trauma histories. They may lack trust in adults, systems of care and ongoing support as&#xD;
        they transition to adulthood. They also may lack access to their health information,&#xD;
        identity documents and resources needed to successfully transition to adulthood. In 2019,&#xD;
        over 1,100 children aged out of care in Texas. Almost 25% of children aging out of foster&#xD;
        care had been in care before they were teenagers; many were in group homes or shelters and&#xD;
        had multiple foster care placements. In Texas, youth who aged out of foster care are less&#xD;
        likely to finish high school, go to college or be employed than youth not in care.&#xD;
