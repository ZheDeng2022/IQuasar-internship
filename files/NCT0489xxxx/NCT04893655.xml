  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining adequate perfusion pressure and oxygen supply is essential for organ survival.&#xD;
      Splanchnic hypoperfusion during the perioperative period in abdominal surgery may result in&#xD;
      mucosal ischemia with increased permeability of the gut barrier. Additionally, the liver is&#xD;
      also sensitive for hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, especially during liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetics (such as propofol or sevoflurane) have a cardiovascular depressant effect,&#xD;
      resulting in a reduction of cardiac output (CO). Dobutamine is used to counteract myocardial&#xD;
      depressant effect of anesthetics. Additionally, dobutamine is frequently used during&#xD;
      abdominal surgery to maintain splanchnic perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dobutamine could increase hepatic blood flow (HBF) indirectly by increasing cardiac output or&#xD;
      directly by stimulating adrenergic receptors in the splanchnic circulation. The hepatic&#xD;
      circulation has a large number of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and could be sensitive&#xD;
      for adrenergic stimulation such as dobutamine. Hence, dobutamine could have a direct effect&#xD;
      on the hepatic vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of dobutamine on hepatic blood flow during&#xD;
      goal directed hemodynamic therapy and to distinguish between potential direct and indirect&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive standardized anesthesia care for pancreaticoduodenectomy according to&#xD;
      the existing departmental protocol for these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive individualized goal-directed hemodynamic therapy based on the&#xD;
      transpulmonary thermodilution technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At designated times, hemodynamic variables will be recorded. These include :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate (bpm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central venous pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic arterial pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diastolic arterial pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac index (L/min/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse pressure variation (PPV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume variation (SVV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of hepatic flow and pressure will be performed by the surgeon :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic flow : in the hepatic artery (arterial HBF) and portal vein (portal HBF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure measurements : in portal vein (PPorta) and caval vein (PCava)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be done :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  without inotropic support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with infusion of dobutamine 2mcg/kg/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with infusion of dobutamine 5mcg/kg/min&#xD;
