  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our study is to make a comparison between the effectiveness of physical&#xD;
      resistance exercise and imaginary resistance exercise in improving handgrip strength,&#xD;
      dexterity, and eye-hand coordination among stroke patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Randomized Control Trial study will be conducted in which patients with stroke will be&#xD;
      allocated to Group A that will receive imaginary resistance exercises and patients in group B&#xD;
      will receive physical resistance exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be applied (3 days /week) for 12 weeks, which consists of 5 different&#xD;
      types of resistance using 5 different resistive objects, each will have 15 repetitions. Each&#xD;
      session includes handgrip exercises with physical resistance exercises for one group and&#xD;
      imaginary resistance exercises using Virtual Reality Box for another group. As for improving&#xD;
      dexterity and eye-hand coordination, the Purdue pegboard test and finger-to-nose test will be&#xD;
      used respectively in both groups with 15-15 repetitions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>12th Week</time_frame>
    <description>It is an isometric instrument that can provide the most stable results during repetitive gripping exercises. This instrument has been reported to have high validity and reliability. This is considered to be a &quot;Gold Standard&quot; instrument, and many researchers have used the Jamar as a standard to validate other instruments.</description>

    <measure>Finger to Nose Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12th Week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a part of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity to evaluate impairment of upper limb in stroke patients. The total movement time is used as a clinical outcome measure for quantification of movement quality and motor performance. Most commonly the person is seated and upon command moves the index fingertip back and forth between the ipsilateral knee and the tip of the nose five times, as fast, as accurate, as possible.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Purdue Peg Board Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12th Week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a functional assessment tool to screen for hand dexterity. It was designed to assess fine motor hand function using three common objects, pegs, washers, and collars, to be inserted on a pegboard. With its long history and wide usage, its reliability in healthy subjects is well established because it employs tasks that resemble activities of daily living. It is economical and easy to administer</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Goniometer</measure>
    <time_frame>12th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Goniometer has been the most widely used tool for measuring joint range of motion. To ensure reliable measurement, standardized, specific positions and landmarks are used to measure each joint movement.</description>

    <description>Handgrip exercises with the imagination of resistance in hand by getting feedback in VR Box will be given as an intervention. Stretching will be given at the beginning and the end of each session. This will include imaginary resistance exercises for handgrip by using Virtual Reality Box. Five types of different resistances will be imagined by patients by watching their own videos in VR box, which will be recorded on day one to make them familiar with the resistive objects and the resistance experienced from them by asking patients to perform 15-15 repetitions of each object. Every imaginary resistance exercise will have 15 repetitions. After performing exercises, the participants will ask to perform Finger-to-Nose Test and Purdue Pegboard Test.</description>
