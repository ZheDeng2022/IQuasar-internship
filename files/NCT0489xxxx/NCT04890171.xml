    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of ESD for undifferentiated type of EGC meeting the expanded&#xD;
      indication compared with surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive treatment of early gastric&#xD;
      cancer (EGC). Because of the stomach preservation, ESD provides a better quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) in EGC patients than surgery. In addition, medical costs are lower in patients&#xD;
      underwent ESD than in those underwent surgery. In 2018, gastric cancer management guidelines&#xD;
      by the Korean Gastric Cancer Association and Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA)&#xD;
      stated that undifferentiated type of EGC, clinically diagnosed as tumor confined to the&#xD;
      mucosa without ulcer, and size â‰¤2 cm, is included in the expanded indication of ESD. In the&#xD;
      2018 JGCA guideline (version 5), ESD is an investigational treatment for patients with&#xD;
      undifferentiated type of EGC meeting the expanded indication whereas surgery (gastrectomy&#xD;
      with lymph node dissection) is a standard treatment. Previous single center retrospective&#xD;
      studies reported favorable long-term outcomes of ESD for undifferentiated type EGC meeting&#xD;
      the expanded criteria on final pathological evaluations compared with that of surgery. More&#xD;
      recently, a multi-center retrospective cohort study including 18 Korean university hospitals&#xD;
      also reported no significant difference in overall mortality between ESD and surgery after&#xD;
      propensity score matching (hazard ratio [HR] for overall mortality in the ESD group, 2.36;&#xD;
      95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-6.10; p=0.078) during a median follow-up of 75.6 months.&#xD;
      However, gastric cancer recurrence occurred only in the ESD group, and the HR for gastric&#xD;
      cancer recurrence in the ESD group was 25.49 (95% CI 1.32-491.27; p=0.032). The 3-year&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) rate including gastric cancer recurrence or death was 94.9% in&#xD;
      the ESD group and 98.1% in the surgery group. Thus, surgery group had a better DFS than ESD&#xD;
      group (p=0.002 by log-rank test), and the HR for gastric cancer recurrence or death in the&#xD;
      surgery group compared with the ESD group was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.10-0.64; p=0.003). However,&#xD;
      previous studies could provide only a low level of evidence because of study limitations&#xD;
      including the retrospective study design and incomplete data of patient survival and gastric&#xD;
      cancer recurrence during follow-up. The studies did not evaluate QoL and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      after ESD and surgery. Therefore, we designed a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      provide a high level of evidence for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ESD for&#xD;
      undifferentiated type of EGC meeting the expanded indication.&#xD;
