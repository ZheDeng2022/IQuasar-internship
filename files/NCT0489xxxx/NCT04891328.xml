    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the lived experiences of children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental diagnoses and their caregivers with an intensive model of therapy.&#xD;
      Children will receive usual care during the summer intensive program and the investigators&#xD;
      will access medical records to assess effectiveness. Children and caregivers will also be&#xD;
      asked to participate in semi-structured interviews upon the completion of the episode of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to explore the lived experiences of children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental diagnoses and their caregivers with an intensive model of therapy.&#xD;
      Research questions include: 1.) What are the perceptions of children and caregivers about&#xD;
      intensive therapy after participating in multiple intensive therapy episodes over time? 2.)&#xD;
      Why do caregivers choose to continue with an intensive model of therapy periodically for&#xD;
      their child with neurodevelopmental diagnoses? 3.) What were the outcomes for children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disabilities participating in an episode of intensive therapy? Children&#xD;
      will receive usual care during the summer intensive program and the investigators will access&#xD;
      medical records to assess effectiveness. Children and caregivers will also be asked to&#xD;
      participate in semi-structured interviews upon the completion of the episode of care.&#xD;
