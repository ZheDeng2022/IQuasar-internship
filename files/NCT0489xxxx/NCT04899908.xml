  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AGuIX (Activation and Guidance of&#xD;
      Irradiation by X-ray) gadolinium-based nanoparticles make radiation work more effectively in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with brain metastases that are more difficult to control with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a double-blind, randomized phase II clinical trial of brain-directed&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation with or without AGuIX (Activation and Guidance of Irradiation by&#xD;
      X-ray) gadolinium-based nanoparticles in the management of brain metastases at higher-risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence with radiation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study agent (AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles) has two main parts. The first is&#xD;
      gadolinium, also known as &quot;contrast,&quot; which is typically injected into a vein during a MRI&#xD;
      scan. The second part is a nanoparticle (linked to the gadolinium) that may make focused&#xD;
      radiation work more effectively. The AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles are deposited&#xD;
      within the brain metastases via the bloodstream and then the brain metastases are radiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AGuIX gadolinium-based&#xD;
      nanoparticles as a treatment for any disease. AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles have been&#xD;
      tested in other studies for safety and efficacy in patients with brain metastases who are&#xD;
      also receiving radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to determine whether AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles improve outcomes&#xD;
      relative to placebo.Participants will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Radiation plus AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Radiation plus placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NH TherAguix, the manufacturer of the AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles, is supporting&#xD;
      this research study by providing the AGuIX gadolinium-based nanoparticles that will be&#xD;
      evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NH TherAguix is also covering the cost of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 112 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who cannot undergo a brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who cannot receive gadolinium&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring radiation to either &gt;10 targets (if naïve to whole brain radiation)&#xD;
             or &gt;20 targets (if whole brain radiation has been given previously) per the discretion&#xD;
             of the treating clinician and/or study PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential deleterious&#xD;
             effects of gadolinium on the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, women who are breastfeeding are&#xD;
             not eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In cohorts who have received prior brain-directed radiation, patients are not eligible&#xD;
             for this study if they have active (at the time of protocol screening) brain&#xD;
             metastases that require radiation that are in or within 1.0cm of the brainstem, eyes,&#xD;
             optic nerves, or optic chiasm if the juxtaposed organ at risk (i.e. brainstem, eyes,&#xD;
             optic nerves, or optic chiasm) has previously received either &gt;6.0 Gy in a single&#xD;
             fraction or, if prior radiation was fractionated, a cumulative dose in 2.0 Gy&#xD;
             equivalents, using an alpha/beta ratio of 2, of &gt;40.0 Gy. In addition, all patients&#xD;
             who have had prior brain-directed radiation, regardless of&#xD;
             technique/dose/fractionation, are not eligible for the study until written approval is&#xD;
