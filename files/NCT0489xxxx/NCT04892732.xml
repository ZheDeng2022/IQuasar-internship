  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective&#xD;
        cohort design comparing budesonide-formoterol versus budesonide alone. The patients will be&#xD;
        required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days before&#xD;
        initiation of budesonide-formoterol or budesonide.&#xD;

        Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please see https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WD618wrywYjEaXzfLTcuK-VCcnb6b-gV for&#xD;
        full code and algorithm definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible cohort entry dates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Budesonide-formoterol was approved by FDA on July 21, 2006 for management of asthma. The&#xD;
        initial eligible cohort entry date was the first date after July 21, 2006 for both the&#xD;
        databases investigated (IBM MarketScan, Optum CDM). The last date eligible as cohort entry&#xD;
        date was the end of available data for IBM MarketScan and Optum CDM. The following eligible&#xD;
        cohort entry dates were included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IBM MarketScan: July 21, 2006 - December 31, 2018 (end of available data)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optum CDM: July 21, 2006 - June 30, 2020 (end of available data)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥12 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented clinical diagnosis of asthma for ≥1 year prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of at least one asthma exacerbation in the previous year (but none in the 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to randomization. An asthma exacerbation was defined as an event requiring&#xD;
             treatment with systemic corticosteroids or requiring hospitalization (i.e. an&#xD;
             inpatient stay or &gt;24-hour stay in the observation area of an emergency room or local&#xD;
             equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A stable dose of ICS alone or in combination with a LABA, leukotriene receptor&#xD;
                  antagonist or other maintenance therapy/therapies for ≥4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  randomization (any patient maintained on a stable high-dose ICS with or without a&#xD;
                  LABA or LTRA or other maintenance therapy/therapies was required to have an ACQ6&#xD;
                  total score of &lt;1.5 at screening) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A stable dose of LTRA or xanthine monotherapy (for ≥4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  randomization) or daily SABA (in the 4 weeks before randomization but ≤8 puffs a&#xD;
                  day on two consecutive days, or ≥25 puffs in one day, in the 7 days prior to&#xD;
                  screening). Patients on LTRAs, xanthines, or daily SABA, were eligible only if&#xD;
                  they recorded an ACQ6 total score of ≥1.5, and in the investigator's clinical&#xD;
                  judgment, the patient's asthma severity could have justified treatment with ICS&#xD;
                  or ICS/LABA combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of life-threatening asthma (defined as an asthma episode that required&#xD;
             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia requiring non-invasive ventilatory&#xD;
             support)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Any asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to randomization OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &gt;4 separate exacerbations OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. &gt;2 hospitalizations (an inpatient stay or &gt;24- hour stay in the observation area&#xD;
                  of an emergency room or local equivalent) due to asthma in the previous year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received systemic corticosteroids for any reason in the 4 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had an ongoing asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent respiratory disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic&#xD;
             bronchitis, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and/or any&#xD;
             pulmonary disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A smoking history of &gt;10 pack-years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Respiratory infection or other viral/bacterial illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (current/planned) and lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma) within the 5 years prior to&#xD;
             study commencement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Omalizumab or any other monoclonal/polyclonal antibody use in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant β-blocker use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug/alcohol abuse&#xD;
