  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Biorepository is a prospective observational cohort study for patients under the care of&#xD;
      a licensed physician or qualified physician extender. Target minimum enrollment is&#xD;
      approximately 3,000 patients within the first 5 years of the study with no defined upper&#xD;
      limit of enrollment. Sites from Corrona's current North America network will be asked to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites and subjects will not receive results from any laboratory testing&#xD;
      conducted on the Samples. Personal identifying information will not be collected along with&#xD;
      the Samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will provide informed consent to contribute Samples to include blood (serum, plasma,&#xD;
      whole blood) to the Biorepository. In the future, Subjects may be asked to contribute other&#xD;
      samples (i.e. saliva, urine, stool) and an additional informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
      Subjects will retain the right to withdraw their consent for use of their Samples at any&#xD;
      time. In such case, Corrona will destroy any unused/remaining Samples in its possession.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a biorepository of biological samples (&quot;Samples&quot;) from&#xD;
      eligible patients enrolled in the Corrona Rheumatology Registries (each, a &quot;Registry&quot;,&#xD;
      together the &quot;Registries&quot;), including but not limited to registries related to rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthritis (PsA/SpA), osteoarthritis, and&#xD;
      lupus (the &quot;Biorepository&quot;). Collected Samples will be biobanked for immediate or future&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biorepository will be used for various purposes, including to support identification and&#xD;
      validation of biomarkers predictive of drug toxicities, safety outcomes (e.g. infections,&#xD;
      malignancies, autoimmunity, venous thromboembolism), or response to specific therapies used&#xD;
      for the diseases studied in the Registries. Other objectives may include research on&#xD;
      biomarkers that describe disease activity or phenotypic disease subsets, and research to&#xD;
      understand mechanism of disease or comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide array of testing methods may be used, such as DNA and RNA sequencing, targeted&#xD;
      analysis to analyze protein, lipid, metabolite, small molecule or biologic assays, and/or&#xD;
      other studies. Analysis of Samples may include testing for existing and commercially&#xD;
      available laboratory measures or experimental analysis. Samples will be selected for testing&#xD;
      depending on factors such as: the disease under study, qualifying treatment and/or cohort,&#xD;
      patient characteristics, risk factors or disease activity indicators, and research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biorepository study will seek to support research in various rheumatologic disease states&#xD;
      through Sample analyses.&#xD;
