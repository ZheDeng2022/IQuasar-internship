  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOBI-1 is a multicenter clinical trial that will evaluate the use of the Infrascanner for the&#xD;
      monitoring of traumatic intracranial hematomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MOBI-1 is a single-arm, multi-center derivation / validation study that will evaluate the use&#xD;
      of the Infrascanner for monitoring traumatic intracranial hematomas. All patients will&#xD;
      receive standard care plus hourly infrascanner assessments. This study will test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Infrascanner has sufficient diagnostic performance to detect the expansion of&#xD;
           intracranial hematomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have expanding intracranial hematomas will be identified faster when&#xD;
           monitored with hourly infrascanner assessments compared to standard care alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical / research staff will be able to attain all data points and relay the&#xD;
           assessments to the medical team.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive regular clinical neurological assessments as ordered by the clinical care team. In addition, a research team member will perform an infrascan. This process will be repeated hourly at the same timepoint as the clinical neurological assessments. If a patient's neurological status deteriorates at any time point, and the medical team orders an early (unplanned) CT scan, the neurological data collection will cease once the patient is sent to CT.&#xD;
Infrascan results will not be shared with the clinical care team, and will not guide the participants' care in any way.</description>

        This study will enroll up to 440 patients over 14 months, at 10 trauma centers. Currently,&#xD;
        there are no high quality published datasets or literature to document the mean or&#xD;
        variability in time to the detection of hematoma expansion that could be used for&#xD;
        meaningful sample size projections. Therefore, this study has been designed to provide&#xD;
        reasonable estimates of the future study outcomes.&#xD;
