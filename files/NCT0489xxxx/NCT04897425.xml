      Brief summary: This single-arm, pilot clinical investigation aims to evaluate Mindful&#xD;
      SensoriMotor Therapy (MSMT) enhanced with brain modulation as a treatment of pain due to&#xD;
      sensorimotor impairment, such as Phantom Limb Pain (PLP). MSMT consists of consciously&#xD;
      retraining the motor and sensory networks used by the missing limb via myoelectric pattern&#xD;
      recognition and haptic feedback. In this trial, we further enhance the effect of MSMT by&#xD;
      brain modulation, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).&#xD;

      People with upper or lower limb disarticulation (amputation at joint level) or nerve injury&#xD;
      will participate in this study. It is a single-arm study in which all participants receive&#xD;
      the same intervention. Each participant attends a screening visit, up to 5 baseline&#xD;
      assessments, 15 interventions, and 3 follow-ups at 1, 3, and 6 months after the last&#xD;
      intervention. Brain imaging will be performed pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Pain Rating Index (PRI) is calculated as the sum of 15 descriptors presented to the participant at the end of each intervention session. Descriptors are rated from 0 (no pain) to 3 (maximum pain) and therefore, the PRI is a number between 0 and 45. The higher PRI number, the greater pain the person feels</description>

    <time_frame>PDI assessed at the beginning the end of the treatment. [ Time Frame: 28-40 weeks, depending on the frequency of the sessions.]</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index (PDI) measures the impact of the pain on the ability of a person to participate in essential life activities. The PDI is the sum of 7 categories and each of the category rates between 0 and 10. Therefore, the index is comprised between 0 and 70. The higher the index the greater the person's disability due to pain is.</description>

    <description>The participant can choose between one, two, or five interventions per week depending on their availability.&#xD;
Steps of each intervention:&#xD;
Pain Evaluation: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
Functional Assessments (1st, 5th, 10th, and last sessions)&#xD;
Preparation:&#xD;
Locate participant in a comfortable position for training (comfortable chair, about a meter distance to the screen, pleasant arm position)&#xD;
Placement of the surface electrodes&#xD;
Positioning of the feedback wearable device over the affected body part&#xD;
Placement of the brain modulation cap&#xD;
Treatment modalities:&#xD;
Motor training&#xD;
Sensory training&#xD;
Sensorimotor training&#xD;
Assessments&#xD;
Step 4 is repeated for different phantom movements, initially one at a time, progressing to several joints simultaneously. A treatment session lasts 2 hours.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has given written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must have chronic neuropathic pain due to sensorimotor impairment&#xD;
             (example PLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least six months should be passed since the date of injury (acute pain cases should&#xD;
             not be included in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is under pharmacological treatments, there must be no variations on&#xD;
             the medication dosages (steady consumption) for at least 1 month before the screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant has previously been treated for neuropathic pain, the last session&#xD;
             of that treatment(s) must be at least 3 months before the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any pain reduction potentially correlated to previous neuropathic pain treatments must&#xD;
             have been observed at least 3 months prior to the screening visit, as reported by the&#xD;
             participant.&#xD;
&#xD;

             situation (i.e. satisfied with the fitting of the prosthesis or not using a&#xD;
             prosthesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have enough contact surface at the site of the amputation or the&#xD;
             injured nerves for the system to work, in the researcher's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  The participant has a sufficient understanding of both Swedish and English to be able&#xD;
             to participate in all study assessments, in the researcher's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should not have any other condition or symptoms that can prevent them&#xD;
             from participating in the study, in the researcher's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No mental inability, reluctance, or language difficulties that result in difficulty&#xD;
             understanding the meaning of study participation, in the researcher's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant should not have any condition associated with the risk of poor&#xD;
             protocol compliance, in the researcher's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        - The potential participant will be excluded from the study if the person does not meet at&#xD;
        least one of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
