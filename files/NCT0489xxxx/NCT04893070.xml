  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In April 2020, a meta-analysis on the long-term sequelae of respiratory syndromes related to&#xD;
      seasonal coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) showed a significant alteration in quality of life,&#xD;
      with in particular a decrease in physical and emotional capacities and a deterioration of&#xD;
      social life. An improvement of the quality of life is evidenced after 6 months but without&#xD;
      reaching the level usually observed in healthy people. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on&#xD;
      quality of life can be explained by the persistence of pleomorphic symptoms in the medium to&#xD;
      long term. In the military population, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 cases present minor to&#xD;
      moderate forms of the disease. Military personnel have living conditions that differ from&#xD;
      those of the general population, in particular because of their geographic mobility, which&#xD;
      may be responsible for isolation from the family. This isolation can be regular (we speak of&#xD;
      &quot;geographical celibacy&quot; when the soldier is posted in a geographical area far from the family&#xD;
      unit) and/or occasional, during missions on the national territory or outside. This&#xD;
      singularity justifies a study on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection on the quality&#xD;
      of life in this specific population.&#xD;
