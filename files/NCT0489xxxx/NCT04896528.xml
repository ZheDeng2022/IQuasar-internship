  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 30 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and&#xD;
      treated with Avatrombopag. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data each&#xD;
      month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment. Primary outcome measure is percentage&#xD;
      of participants whose PLT reaches ≥75×109/L, or increases by ≥50×109/L or ≥100% from baseline&#xD;
      at least once within 20 days of initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure:1)Number of days required for PLT to reach ≥50×109/L after&#xD;
      treatment; 2)Number of days required for PLT to reach ≥75×109/L after treatment; 3)Percentage&#xD;
      of subjects without platelet transfusion within 20 days of treatment; 4)Percentage of&#xD;
      subjects without clinically relevant bleeding within 20 days of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Avartripopa is a new generation of oral TPO receptor agonist that simulates the biological effects of TPO in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
TPO stimulates megakaryocytes through binding and activation of TPO receptor, which is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryotic cell lines and platelets.&#xD;
By binding to the transmembrane region of the thrombopoietin receptor, Ava Tripopa activates the thrombopoietin receptor in humans, stimulates signal transduction and mimics the biological effects of thrombopoietin, leading to an increase in platelet count.</description>
