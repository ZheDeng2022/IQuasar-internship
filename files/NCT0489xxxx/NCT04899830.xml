  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the mobile robot assist device for tele-interaction: the &quot;COVEALINK 2&quot;&#xD;
      robot. This telepresence robot is designed for remote use inside the home. It works with an&#xD;
      Internet connection (Wifi or 4G). It consists of a control interface (an application&#xD;
      installed on the smartphone or tablet of the hospitalized patient) and a mobile robot placed&#xD;
      in the home of the hospitalized patient (composed of a mobile platform, a visualization&#xD;
      screen whose tilt is adjustable remotely for better adaptation to the interlocutors and an&#xD;
      audio communication system). From the app installed on his smartphone or tablet, the patient&#xD;
      hospitalized in the center for a long time (2 months minimum) will be able to start remotely&#xD;
      (from the center where he is hospitalized) the robot and have it move within his home to&#xD;
      communicate with the people present at the time of use (family, friends, neighbors etc.).&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with hospitalized patients using questionnaires developed by the LP3C (Laboratory of Psychology, Cognition, Behavior, Communication). Measurement of acceptance at Day 30.

    <description>This assessment is done using validated measurement scale relating to depression and anxiety: HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression). The HAD scale is an instrument used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It comprises 14 items graded from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), thus making it possible to obtain two scores (maximum score for each score = 21 ).To screen for anxiety and depressive symptoms, the following interpretation is used for each of the scores (A and D): - 7 or less: no symptoms - 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology - 11 and over: definite symptomatology.</description>

    <description>This assessment is done using validated measurement scale relating to psychological well-being: EBEP (Psychological Well-Being Scale). The Ryff scale of psychological well-being &quot;is constructed from six key dimensions: autonomy, mastery of the environment, personal development, positive relationships, giving meaning to one's life and acceptance of life. self. It consists of 18 items sides 1 to 6, where 6 indicating strongly agree. A high total score indicates psychological well-being.</description>

    <description>This assessment is done using validated measurement scale relating to quality of life: questionnaire general SF-36 (Short Form 36 Healt Survey). The SF-36 questionnaire is a multidimensional questionnaire that assesses quality of life in relation to health status, regardless of causal pathology, gender, age and treatment. It assesses functioning and overall well-being using a questionnaire using 36 questions divided into 8 dimensions (physical functioning, role limitations related to physical health, physical pain, general health, vitality, functioning or social well-being, role limitations related to mental health, mental health).</description>

It takes the form of a questionnaire comprising 6 items rated from 0 to 1: - 1 = no handicap - 0 = maximum handicap.</description>
