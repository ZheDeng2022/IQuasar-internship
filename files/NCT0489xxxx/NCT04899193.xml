      The main purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence (BE) of the fixed combination&#xD;
      of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa in Pergoveris freeze-dried (FD) (Test 1) or in&#xD;
      Pergoveris Liquid (Test 2) versus the co-administration of Gonal-f and Luveris (Reference),&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously (SC) in pituitary suppressed, healthy premenopausal Chinese&#xD;
      female participants, at the doses of 900 international unit (IU) of follitropin alfa and 450&#xD;
      IU lutropin alfa.&#xD;
