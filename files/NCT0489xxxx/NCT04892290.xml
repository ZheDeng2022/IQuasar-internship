      Background: Postdural puncture headache (PDPH), which is one of the complications of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, is a condition that negatively affects the quality of life of patients, causes&#xD;
      late mobilization and prolonged hospital stay. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SGB) has&#xD;
      created a minimally invasive, easy, and safe treatment alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluating the effectiveness of topical SGB on PDPH treatment. Design:&#xD;
      Retrospective observational study Setting: Single center tertiary level of care hospital&#xD;
      study. The files of PDPH patients between Jan 2018 and Jan 2020 were scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: PDPH patients aged 18-65 are included and any patients with primary/secondary&#xD;
      headache history are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Patients were divided into 2 groups. The group that given only&#xD;
      conservative treatment was named as Group C, and the group of patients who had additionally&#xD;
      been applied SGB was named as Group SGB. Headache severity was measured with Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) at the 1st,3rd, 12th and 24th hours of the treatment, in supine and upright&#xD;
      position.&#xD;

Both groups will be compared with successfully treated patients ratios.</description>
