    <textblock>
      A European cross-sectional study was conducted with the aims of: i) examining inter-country&#xD;
      differences in prevalence of tinnitus by comparing prevalence estimates in countries with&#xD;
      relatively low versus high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and comparing prevalence&#xD;
      estimates in countries within different European regions (i.e., Northern, Southern, Eastern&#xD;
      and Western Europe); ii) understanding the effect of sex, age, socio-economic variables, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), and marital status on overall prevalence of tinnitus; iii) assessing the&#xD;
      effect of hearing difficulty on tinnitus prevalence; and iv) exploring the effect of tinnitus&#xD;
      severity on use of healthcare resource for tinnitus Overall, approximately 12,000 individuals&#xD;
      aged 18 years or over are enrolled in 12 different European countries (BG, DE, ES, FR, GR,&#xD;
      IE, IT, LV, PL, PT, RO, UK). Survey sample from each country were representative of the&#xD;
      country-specific population in terms of sex, age, and socio-economic characteristics.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Tinnitus is a common symptom of clinically heterogeneous pathologies&#xD;
      and is defined as the conscious perception of an auditory sensation in the absence of a&#xD;
      corresponding external stimulus. Tinnitus, in its debilitating form, negatively affects&#xD;
      emotional health and social well-being, and can precipitate psychological distress severe&#xD;
      enough to cause self-harm and suicidal ideations, while exerting substantial individual and&#xD;
      societal financial burden. Therefore, it becomes crucial to implement adequate preventive&#xD;
      measures and health interventions. According to population-based studies from Western Europe&#xD;
      and US, tinnitus prevalence lies between 10% and 15%. Nonetheless, there is a lack of clear&#xD;
      understanding of global prevalence of tinnitus. Inherent methodological drawbacks and between&#xD;
      study differences hinder deriving a global estimate by pooling data from studies conducted in&#xD;
      different countries and world regions. Therefore, uncertainties with regards to the&#xD;
      prevalence of tinnitus remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this population-based cross-sectional study is to estimate&#xD;
      the overall and country specific prevalence of any tinnitus, bothersome tinnitus, and severe&#xD;
      tinnitus in 12 European Union (EU) countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data have been analyzed to fulfil the following secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine inter-country differences in prevalence of tinnitus by making the following&#xD;
           comparisons:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparing prevalence estimates in countries with relatively low versus high gross&#xD;
                domestic product (GDP) per capita&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparing prevalence estimates in countries within different European regions&#xD;
                (i.e., Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western Europe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the effect of sex, age, socio-economic variables, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
           and marital status on overall prevalence of tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of hearing difficulty on tinnitus prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the effect of tinnitus severity on use of healthcare resource for tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design To achieve the aims of this study, the investigators conducted&#xD;
      face-to-face population-based cross-sectional survey in 12 strategically selected EU28&#xD;
      countries (Bulgaria, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland,&#xD;
      Portugal, Romania, and Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each country, the study sample is representative of the general population aged 18 years&#xD;
      and above in terms of age, sex, geographic area, and socio-economic characteristics.&#xD;
      Multi-stage methodology was used as the preferred sampling methodology. In the first stage,&#xD;
      the primary unit of selection was geographic area or voting center. In the second stage,&#xD;
      households or municipalities were selected. In the last stage, respondents were chosen&#xD;
      randomly, in order to be representative of the population. Other methods, including&#xD;
      stratified or simple sampling or quota methods, were also accepted wherever it is not&#xD;
      possible to conduct a multistage random sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of countries For the present study, an appropriate sample of 12 European&#xD;
      countries-all EU28 Member States (MS) -representing geographical, legislative and cultural&#xD;
      variations across the EU, have been selected. The selected European countries were as&#xD;
      follows: Bulgaria (BG), England (UK), France(FR), Germany(DE), Greece (GR), Ireland (IE),&#xD;
      Italy (IT), Latvia (LV), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO), and Spain (ES). These&#xD;
      countries were selected after taking into account several aspects, including: i) different&#xD;
      geographical distribution; ii) different level of per capita income. According to geographic&#xD;
      area, the investigators considered countries from northern (IE, UK), central/western (DE,&#xD;
      FR), central/eastern (BG, LV, PL, RO), and southern Europe (ES, IT, GR, PT). Moreover, the&#xD;
      selection included the 7 most populated EU28 MS (DE, ES, FR, IT, UK, PL, RO), and, among less&#xD;
      populated countries, the investigators prioritized middle-income countries (BG, RO). Overall,&#xD;
      the 12 selected EU MS represent 78.8% of the EU28 overall population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population In each of the 12 selected European countries, approximately 1000&#xD;
      individuals, representative of the general population aged 18 years and above in terms of&#xD;
      age, sex, geographic area, and socio-economic characteristics, were enrolled in this&#xD;
      cross-sectional study. The final sample therefore includes a total of 11,427 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size computation The sample size for each country allowed us to obtain prevalence&#xD;
      estimates with a maximum standard error (SE) lower than Â± 1.6%. Therefore, with such a sample&#xD;
      size the investigators have been able to provide stable prevalence estimates (with a&#xD;
      relatively small 95% confidence interval), both overall and country-specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection In each country, individuals were surveyed by trained interviewers through&#xD;
      face-to-face interviews using a structured standardized questionnaire. Data collection was&#xD;
      coordinated by DOXA, a leading market research organization and Italian branch of the&#xD;
      Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association (WIN/GIA), and performed in&#xD;
      collaboration with its European partners. Data was collected within computer assisted&#xD;
      personal interviews (CAPI). The fieldworks lasted two to three months in each country. The&#xD;
      English version of the questionnaire has been developed by collaborators from University of&#xD;
      Nottingham (UK) University of Regensburg (Germany), and Mario Negri Institute (Italy). Before&#xD;
      fieldwork, the tinnitus-related questions were translated from English into various&#xD;
      country-specific languages using the good practice guidelines for questionnaire translation.&#xD;
      The details of the translation process have been published as a technical note.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The country-specific information provided by DOXA and its European partners for each European&#xD;
      country include information on sampling methodology (e.g., sampling method used, response&#xD;
      rate, fieldwork dates, age range). The survey questionnaire is designed to collect&#xD;
      individual-level information for each survey participant, and is divided in two sections. The&#xD;
      first section provided information on: socio-economic and demographic characteristics (e.g.,&#xD;
      sex, age, level of education, and profession). The second section provided information on&#xD;
      tinnitus prevalence, tinnitus severity, healthcare resource use for tinnitus, and hearing&#xD;
      difficulty prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Creation of the survey dataset Once the fieldwork was completed,&#xD;
      DOXA collected data from its European partners and after internal checks provided to Mario&#xD;
      Negri Institute the 12 anonymous data files in text format, with the corresponding codebook&#xD;
      in English language. The 12 data files were managed by the team at the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Lifestyle Epidemiology, Department of Environmental Health Sciences of Mario Negri Institute.&#xD;
      Using the statistical package SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), they performed&#xD;
      the input of the 12 textual data file into 12 corresponding SAS datasets, and then created a&#xD;
      unique final dataset in SAS. This dataset was checked for coherence and for the presence of&#xD;
      possible errors, cleaned, and finalized through the generation of queries which were&#xD;
      addressed by DOXA and its European partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Statistical analyses required to achieve objectives has been conducted&#xD;
      by the teams from the Laboratory of Lifestyle Epidemiology, Department of Environmental&#xD;
      Health Sciences of Mario Negri Institute and the University of Nottingham, using SAS&#xD;
      statistical package. Prevalence of three working definitions of tinnitus (any, bothersome and&#xD;
      severe tinnitus) have been estimated through univariate statistical analyses (i.e.,&#xD;
      descriptive statistics for categorical data, including absolute or relative frequencies),&#xD;
      overall, by country, and in strata of selected demographic and socio-economic (individual and&#xD;
      country-specific) characteristics. Continuous variables have been summarized through the use&#xD;
      of means and standard deviations. Alternatively, they have been categorized, and thus&#xD;
      described through absolute or relative frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analyses have been conducted to identify sub-groups of the population (e.g.,&#xD;
      based age-groups, low vs. high educated subjects) or clusters of countries (e.g., based on&#xD;
      income levels and regional groups) where tinnitus is more frequent. Thus, odds ratios (OR),&#xD;
      and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), were estimated through logistic&#xD;
      regression models after adjustment for selected individual-level characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS Informed consent At recruitment, information on survey&#xD;
      characteristics was given to all participants by suitably qualified professionals, who were&#xD;
      able to provide answers to any possible questions and to eliminate any concern respondents&#xD;
      may have. Information explaining the condition (i.e., tinnitus) was provided to survey&#xD;
      participants in the country-specific language in a clear, jargon free manner, using fully&#xD;
      understandable terms and language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in EU countries, according to their current legislation, written consent is not&#xD;
      mandatory for this type of study (observational study collecting anonymized information), all&#xD;
      participants were asked to sign the informed consent form for participation in the study.&#xD;
      Since data was collected with CAPI method (using computer or tablet), participants had the&#xD;
      possibility to tick an electronic document in order to express their willingness to&#xD;
      participate in the study. No written signature was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ethics Committee of the study coordinator (Ethics Committee of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto&#xD;
      Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy) notified that no preventative evaluation was required&#xD;
      for the present study, since anonymous data was collected (File number 37/2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to personal data and withdrawal from the study In this survey no sensitive personal&#xD;
      data (e.g., health, sexual lifestyle, ethnicity, political opinion, religious or&#xD;
      philosophical conviction), genetic information, or data involving tracking or observation of&#xD;
      participants was collected. According to other personal data, it was made clear that subjects&#xD;
      are completely free to withdraw their records from participation in the survey, and that the&#xD;
      consent given by participants in the study can be withdrawn, without any explanation or&#xD;
      justification. In this case, all data pertaining to the subjects in question was destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ownership of the data Individual-level anonymous data sent from DOXA and its European&#xD;
      partners, and stored at the Mario Negri Institute, are the property of the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE AND IMPLICATIONS One of the expected outcomes of this study is the first estimate&#xD;
      of tinnitus prevalence from a Pan-European study. Given the lack of standardized tinnitus&#xD;
      prevalence questions and a global prevalence estimate, this study provides both standard&#xD;
      assessment measures and an estimate of how prevalent tinnitus symptoms are. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators report the prevalence of any tinnitus using the same set of research&#xD;
      questions in various languages. This measure identifies the commonality of the condition.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators assess the proportion of individuals having bothersome and&#xD;
      severe symptoms, who exert the true burden on financial and personnel resources in the&#xD;
      healthcare system. These estimates measured in a Pan-European study demonstrate the size of&#xD;
      the problem. This can guide resource allocation for implementing effective measures and&#xD;
      attract various stakeholders, including research funders, industrial and healthcare&#xD;
      organizations, to engage in needful endeavors for tackling tinnitus.&#xD;
