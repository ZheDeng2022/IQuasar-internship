      This study is a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      short-term efficacy of low-dose Interleukin-2 injection as an add-on therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients aged 18-75 who have been diagnosed with CSU and remain symptomatic&#xD;
      despite oral antihistamine treatment .&#xD;

      Backgrounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urticaria is a common disorder that present with localized edema reaction caused by&#xD;
      dilatation and increased permeability of small blood vessels in skin and mucosa. The main&#xD;
      clinical manifestations are wheal and erythema reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the recurrent, transient (&lt;24h), pruritic&#xD;
      wheals of the skin and mucosa lasting for more than 6 weeks ,with or without angioedema,&#xD;
      excluding chronic inducible urticaria and urticarial vasculitis. Among all patients with&#xD;
      chronic urticaria, CSU patients accounts for about 80%. Although the pathogenesis of CSU is&#xD;
      still unclear, increasing evidence has shown an autoimmune feature of this chronic disease.&#xD;
      Oral antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment for patients with CSU. However, a&#xD;
      proportion of patients with CSU remain symptomatic despite treatment with standard- or&#xD;
      doubled-dose of antihistamines. In recent years, studies have shown that low-dose recombinant&#xD;
      human IL-2 (rhIL-2) treatment has good therapeutic effect in a variety of autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, without serious side&#xD;
      reactions. Therefore, we propose low-dose rhIL-2 as an add-on treatment for patient with CSU&#xD;
      that are recalcitrant to treatment with antihistamines. Here we designed this clinical trial&#xD;
      to explore its therapeutic effect as well as therapeutic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial to assess the short-term&#xD;
      efficacy of rhIL-2 treatment for patients with CSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RhIL-2 injection combined with the current dose of antihistamine (Use one kind or two to&#xD;
      three kinds in combination, and use one or two doses of each kind of antihistamine，keeping&#xD;
      doses before enrollment) will be applied to CSU patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      end points include clinical response and immunological changes, as well as safety.&#xD;
