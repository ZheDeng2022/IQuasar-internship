  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine sleep patterns and sleep quality following total&#xD;
      joint arthroplasty, in order to understand when patients should expect to return to baseline&#xD;
      or improved sleep following total joint arthroplasty. Patients prospectively enrolled in this&#xD;
      study are to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients&#xD;
      will receive the SleepScore Max device and smart device app to track their sleep patterns&#xD;
      starting one week prior to surgery and until six months after surgery. The SleepScore Max&#xD;
      device tracks duration of sleep, time to fall asleep, number of nightly awakenings, rapid eye&#xD;
      movement sleep, light sleep, deep sleep, and room temperature and light levels. Through the&#xD;
      associated application, patients will also record caffeine and alcohol consumption and&#xD;
      exercise. In addition to sleep tracking, patients will fill out Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index (PSQI), PROMIS, Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and Knee Injury&#xD;
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) surveys at specified visits. Secondarily, Visual&#xD;
      Analog Pain (VAP) scores and opioid consumption measure in milligram morphine equivalents&#xD;
      (MME) will be measured during hospital stay and at subsequent post-operative clinic visits.&#xD;
      The clinical goal of this study is to better under sleep patterns in patients undergoing TKA&#xD;
      and THA and hopefully provide this patient population improved sleep recommendations and&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
