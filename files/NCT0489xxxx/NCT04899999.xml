  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if graphic messages prevent future vaping use among&#xD;
      African American and Latino adolescents. The images have been developed in a user-design&#xD;
      model and include four main themes: health reward, financial reward, self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      social norms. We will assess pre- and post-exposure reactions on likelihood of future vaping&#xD;
      among African American and Latino adolescents.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked three questions. (1) Are you curious about using e-cigarettes (vaping)?; (2) Do you think that you will use e-cigarettes (vaping) in the next 12 months?; and (3) If one of your best friends were to offer you an e-cigarette, would you use it? Responses include 1= definitely not, 2= probably not, 3= probably yes, 4= definitely yes. Participants who answer &quot;Definitely not&quot; to all three questions will be categorized as not susceptible.</description>
