  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patterns of tooth loss are evaluated in many selected populations in numerous countries&#xD;
      and so the frequency of partial edentulism seems to vary widely between different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of various patterns of partially edentulous arches should be frequently&#xD;
      revised and updated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could help identify the changing treatment needs of the population and provide&#xD;
      guidelines to prevent tooth loss emphasis should be placed on dental education, improve the&#xD;
      quality of prosthodontic care being provided to patients oral and general health promotion&#xD;
      which should highlight the control of common oral diseases such as caries at their various&#xD;
      stages of progression and periodontal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, regular dental check-ups should be made mandatory at schools, colleges and&#xD;
      workplaces and community field trips should be conducted in order that increase in oral&#xD;
      health awareness can also discourage patients attitude waiting until acute symptoms develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our knowledge, no available studies investigated the prevalence of partial&#xD;
      edentulism among patients in faculty of dentistry Cairo university. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      wouldbe of valuable information to oral health planners for proposing strategies that will&#xD;
      help dentalhealth care management in faculty of dentistry Cairo,&#xD;
