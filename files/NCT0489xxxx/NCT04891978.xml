  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this community program intervention study is to assess the process&#xD;
      and potential benefits of integrating the AIRQ™, Asthma Checklist, and educational resources&#xD;
      (PRECISION program) into clinical practice using either in-person or telehealth visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess asthma patients' clinic visit experiences when the&#xD;
      AIRQ™, the Asthma Checklist, and educational resources (PRECISION program) are utilized as&#xD;
      part of a telehealth or in-person visit with their HCP, and to explore change in AIRQ™ scores&#xD;
      from the initial visit to follow-up visit(s) (when available).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This community program intervention study will examine the process of integrating the AIRQ™,&#xD;
      Asthma Checklist, and educational resources (PRECISION program) into clinical practice using&#xD;
      either in-person or telehealth visits. Providers use of patients' responses to the AIRQ™,&#xD;
      Asthma Checklist, and educational resources to guide treatment and asthma work-up and&#xD;
      management also will be examined. The study duration is 12-months, with study enrollment&#xD;
      lasting nine (9) months for each site (implementation stage), and an additional three (3)&#xD;
      months of follow-up to assess the sustainability of using the PRECISION program in clinical&#xD;
      practice (sustainability stage). The nine-month implementation stage will allow for the&#xD;
      recruitment of approximately 50 patients at each site (maximum of 75 patients at each site)&#xD;
      for an initial study visit, plus the potential for follow-up visit(s). The three-month&#xD;
      sustainability stage will allow for sites to continue to implement the PRECISION program in&#xD;
      their clinical practice and for sites to describe any continued benefits of using the&#xD;
      PRECISION program at their site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) clinical sites will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      this study, categorized into the following four practice clusters: (1) primary care site&#xD;
      (e.g., private practice, FQHC; (2) specialty care site (pulmonary, asthma/immunology); (3)&#xD;
      novel sites (e.g., pharmacy, nurse practitioners, nurse educators, prescribers and&#xD;
      Non-prescribers, telehealth component of Allergy and Asthma Network; and (4) third-party&#xD;
      payer sites. While all sites will be able to conduct both in-person and telehealth visits,&#xD;
      sites will aim to conduct a minimum of approximately 25% of their initial patient visit using&#xD;
      a telehealth platform. Both platforms (in-person and telehealth) can be used for the&#xD;
      follow-up visit(s) for all practice types.&#xD;
