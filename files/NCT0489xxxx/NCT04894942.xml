  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcaneonavicular coalition represents approximately 1% of the population between 8 and 12&#xD;
      years. They are manifested by repeated ankle sprains or by pain. - The diagnosis is&#xD;
      radiological on an X-ray of the foot in oblique-3/4 incidence as well as magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging. Treatment is second-line surgery after failure of orthopedic treatment. This surgery&#xD;
      is either by direct approach or by arthroscopy, by performing a bone resection to recreate&#xD;
      sufficient space in the joint in question. The patients in this study will only be operated&#xD;
      on openly.&#xD;
