  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to estimate the cumulative amount of lemborexant excreted&#xD;
      in breast milk following a single dose administration of lemborexant 10 milligram (mg) to&#xD;
      healthy lactating women and to estimate the relative infant dose (RID) expressed as a percent&#xD;
      of the daily maternal dose.&#xD;

    <measure>RID: Relative Infant Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>0-240 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Relative infant dose is defined as the infant drug exposure via breast milk which is the body weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dose. Relative infant dose will be calculated by the formula: Daily infant dose milligram per kilogram (mg/kg)/maternal dose (mg/kg)*100, where estimated daily infant dose is as per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance (2019). Daily infant dose (mg/kg) = Ae/weight of infant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting one or More TEAEs Based on Severity</measure>

    <description>All TEAEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, and severe). The definitions are as follows: Mild (Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity); Moderate (Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity); Severe (Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity).</description>

&#xD;
          4. Breastfeeds an infant who is already able to feed from a bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agrees to collect all breast milk from predose to end of the study using an electric&#xD;
             pump provided by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the protocol and visit schedule&#xD;
