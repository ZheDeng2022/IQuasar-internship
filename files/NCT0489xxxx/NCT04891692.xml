  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a 10-week long intervention with the StimaWELL 120MTRS&#xD;
      system on multifidus morphology and function in individuals with chronic low back pain. Half&#xD;
      the participants will receive muscle therapy at the device's phasic setting, while half will&#xD;
      receive muscle therapy at the device's combined setting. This study also evaluates the acute&#xD;
      effect of a single treatment with the StimaWELL 120MTRS on multifidus stiffness in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
