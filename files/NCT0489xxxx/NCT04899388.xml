    <description>The patient is placed in the supine position. After sterilization of the skin and drapping, the low frequency convex probe of Sonosite M Turbo ultrasonography( FUJIFIM sonosite, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) is placed..&#xD;
A curvilinear 2-5MHz ultrasound probe will be initially placed in a transverse plane over the anterior superior iliac spine and then aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees. In this view, the iliopubic eminence, the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus muscle will be observed. A 22-gauge, 80-mm needle will be inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly.</description>

The transducer was shifted from the midline, 3.5-4 cm laterally to the side of the surgery to visualize the erector spinae muscle and transverse process . 0.5-1 ml of the prepared LA solution (20 ml bupivacaine 0.5%, 10 ml lidocaine 2%, 10 ml normal saline was administered leading to hydrodissection to confirm correct location. All LA was administered to this location between the transverse process and the erector spinae muscle</description>
