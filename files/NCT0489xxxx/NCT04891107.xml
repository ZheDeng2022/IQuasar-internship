  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the effects of music, tailored to the&#xD;
      participant's cadence, on adherence, quality of life, gait speed, functional mobility, and&#xD;
      walking activity in individuals with Parkinson disease when used in the home and community&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Parkinson disease will be enrolled to determine the effects of a community&#xD;
      walking program with a music-based device on adherence, quality of life, walking speed and&#xD;
      walking activity. The walking program will be carried out independently by participants in&#xD;
      their home/community environment. Noninvasive functional assessments commonly administered in&#xD;
      clinical practice will be used to measure the variables of interest.&#xD;
