      The purpose of this study is to explore the changes of fasting and postprandial cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some studies have proved that&#xD;
      non-fasting blood glucose concentration is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      lacunar infarction. At present, there are differences in cerebral blood flow velocity between&#xD;
      diabetic patients and healthy controls. Therefore, it is of certain significance to explore&#xD;
      the changes of fasting and postprandial cerebral blood flow in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, due to the aging population and the increase in obesity, the incidence of diabetes&#xD;
      is on the rise. Diabetes is the main independent risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases,&#xD;
      especially ischemic stroke. Some studies have proved that non-fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction.&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can evaluate intracranial blood flow patterns real-time and&#xD;
      reliably, and provide information about cerebral hemodynamics, cerebrovascular reactivity and&#xD;
      various pathological changes. At present, there are some differences in the study of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow velocity in diabetic patients. The purpose of our study is to determine the&#xD;
      changes of cerebral blood flow on an empty stomach and 1 hour after meal in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. In this study, 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be selected as&#xD;
      the experimental group. 20 healthy volunteers whose sex and age and BMI matched with the&#xD;
      experimental group will be selected as the control group. Fasting blood glucose and TCD will&#xD;
      be measured in the two groups, and the data of mean flow velocity (Vm), Gosling's pulsatility&#xD;
      index (PI) and cerebrovascular reactivity of cerebral artery will be obtained. One hour after&#xD;
      drinking 300ml lukewarm water which has dissolved 75g glucose powder, the blood glucose will&#xD;
      be detected again and TCD examination will be performed again. Finally, the data will be&#xD;
      collected for statistical analysis.&#xD;
