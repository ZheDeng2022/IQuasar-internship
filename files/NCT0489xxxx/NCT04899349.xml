    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of dapagliflozin plus metformin extended&#xD;
      release (XR) compared with metformin XR during treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant in&#xD;
      participants with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation&#xD;
      following progression on or after endocrine-based therapy.&#xD;

      The study will only include participants who have at least one baseline risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of severe hyperglycemia, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes (FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and/or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-diabetes (FPG ≥ 100 mg/dL to &lt; 126 mg/dL or 5.6 to &lt; 7.0 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7 to&#xD;
           &lt; 6.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥ 75 years Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 66&#xD;
           participants in each treatment arm) to receive the combination of dapagliflozin plus&#xD;
           metformin XR or metformin XR alone starting on Cycle 1 Day 1. For both arms participants&#xD;
           will receive fulvestrant starting at Cycle 1 Day 1 and alpelisib starting at Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
           8. Randomization will be stratified by diabetic status at baseline, i.e. normal vs pre-&#xD;
           diabetic/diabetic (based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and/or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)&#xD;
           laboratory values).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a 28-day screening phase, a 12 cycle treatment phase, and a&#xD;
      post-treatment phase which includes safety and efficacy follow-up (if applicable).&#xD;
