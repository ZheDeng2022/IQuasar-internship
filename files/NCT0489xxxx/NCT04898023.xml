  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zinc and green tea supplementation have both been independently studied for supporting immune&#xD;
      health during cold and flu-like illness in non-hospitalized patients with clinical trials&#xD;
      demonstrating promising but inconsistent results. Combination therapy may offer an improved&#xD;
      effect as the antioxidant compounds found in green tea have been shown to increase cellular&#xD;
      zinc concentrations thereby inhibiting viral replication. This study seeks to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of combination supplementation using established doses of zinc and green tea extract&#xD;
      on symptom duration and severity from cold and flu-like illness, including COVID-19, in adult&#xD;
      community patients enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
