    <textblock>
      In Latin America, inadequate treatment adherence and compliance in IBD patients is around 64%&#xD;
      in Brazilians, 54.4% in Mexicans and 50.3% in Argentinians. In industrialised countries, it&#xD;
      has been described that in IBD patients, features as younger age, low disease-related&#xD;
      knowledge or low treatment adherence and compliance are negatively associated with&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The following research pursues to better understand&#xD;
      potential factors related to IBD patients' treatment adherence and compliance as well as&#xD;
      patients' IBD-related knowledge level in a Latin American population, and their preferences&#xD;
      and barriers when interacting with ICTs for clinical purposes; to develop and to validate an&#xD;
      IBD MAHS for Spanish-Speaking patients with Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

      State of the Art:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chronic condition with a particular approach but also with an unpredictable course&#xD;
      difficult treatment adherence and compliance is seen among Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD)&#xD;
      patients. In Latin America, inadequate treatment adherence and compliance in IBD patients is&#xD;
      around 64% in Brazilians, 54.4% in Mexicans and 50.3% in Argentinians. In the last, a&#xD;
      sub-analysis per medication estimated an inadequate adherence in 52.2%, 40.2% and 15.3% for&#xD;
      5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), thiopurine and biologics, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In industrialised countries, it has been described that in IBD patients, features as younger&#xD;
      age, low disease-related knowledge or low treatment adherence and compliance are negatively&#xD;
      associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In Uruguay, IBD annual incidence rate&#xD;
      between 2007-2011 was higher in children and young adults (3.45 and 9.12 per 105 habitants)&#xD;
      than ≥45 years-old patients (2.92 per 105 habitants). In Chile, using the Crohn's and Colitis&#xD;
      Knowledge score (CCKNOW), there were estimated a median score of 9 out of 24 (range 1 - 20).&#xD;
      Using the IBD-32 questionnaire in a 50-patients cross-section study, 40% moderate to low&#xD;
      HRQoL was identified in Argentina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living with chronic diseases is associated with the necessity of self-management education&#xD;
      (SME). SME may reduce depression and anxiety, improving HRQoL. As in other chronic diseases,&#xD;
      the 90s Internet advent was accompanied by new IBD-related websites, which served mainly as&#xD;
      scholarly sources for IBD patients. Since Web 2.0 in the 2000s, social media (including&#xD;
      social networks) emergence let users create and share content across digital devices. Web&#xD;
      sites, emails, blogs, social media and mobile Applications software (mobile Apps) comprehend&#xD;
      Information and communication technologies (ICTs) resources, which facilitates SME through&#xD;
      specific disease-related knowledge transfer using the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A United States cross-sectional study demonstrated in 1960 IBD patients that 32% agreed that&#xD;
      social media could help disease management. Social media use was higher in IBD younger&#xD;
      patients, female, active disease and Crohn's disease. However, 50% could not rate the quality&#xD;
      of IBD information posted online, and 68.3% had concerns about privacy or confidentiality.&#xD;
      The rising of IBD-related content represented the following limitations: educational content&#xD;
      low in quality, non-supervised content by corresponded healthcare providers, and privacy&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The popularity of smartphones and tablets has facilitated an increased development of mobile&#xD;
      Apps for health support (MAHS) designed by healthcare providers. A good example is the MAHS&#xD;
      called myIBDcoach, an HTML web-based tool designed for computers, tablets, and smartphones in&#xD;
      the IBD context. Through a randomised trial among Dutch patients, it was demonstrated that a&#xD;
      telemedicine intervention with myIBDcoach significantly the baseline treatment adherence&#xD;
      improved after a 12-months follow-up (estimated intervention effect of 0.46, 95% IC 0.22 to&#xD;
      0.70; p=0.0002), much more than others health outcomes as HRQoL or disease-related knowledge.&#xD;
      Available IBD MAHS consider more clinical care features than mainly education: monitoring,&#xD;
      treatment, follow-up, patients' emotions, even bathroom localisation through GPS function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem statement A low disease-related knowledge can influence treatment adherence and&#xD;
      compliance in IBD patients, impacting clinical, occupational and social conditions. In the&#xD;
      Romanised World, the association between disease-related knowledge and treatment adherence&#xD;
      and compliance in IBD patients, or even social issues as work disability, as to how they&#xD;
      interact with ICTs for clinical purposes, seems to be more understood in Europe and North&#xD;
      America than Latin America. In the last, a better comprehension of these situations is&#xD;
      required in order to improve existing treatment adherence and compliance. This context&#xD;
      requires more prospective studies in a region with epidemiologic, ethnic and cultural&#xD;
      particularities as Latin America, with a rising IBD annual incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IBD MAHP can play an essential role in reinforcing treatment adherence and compliance in&#xD;
      Latin American IBD patients. However, most of the available IBD MAHS is hard-handled,&#xD;
      non-validated or non-Spanish language resources. To date, there is only three available in&#xD;
      Spanish, but developed in Spain: one in Pediatrics (miEII-PED), and another two addressed to&#xD;
      adults patients but still on the validation process (TeleCumple and TECCU). ICTs have&#xD;
      demonstrated improved IBD treatment adherence and compliance. Nevertheless, IBD MAHS deserves&#xD;
      to be more validated and in the corresponding language and cultural context. We hypothesise&#xD;
      that a locally designed, easy-handled IBD MAHS improves IBD-related knowledge and treatment&#xD;
      adherence and compliance on IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Scope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research pursues to better understand potential factors related to IBD&#xD;
      patients' treatment adherence and compliance as well as patients' IBD-related knowledge level&#xD;
      in an Argentinian population, and their preferences and barriers when interacting with ICTs&#xD;
      for clinical purposes; to develop and to validate an IBD MAHS for Spanish-Speaking patients&#xD;
      with Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study design and settings The DAMASCO trial (Development and Assessment&#xD;
      of a Mobile App for Sanitary Support of Spanish-Speaking' with Crohn's and ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis) comprehends three stages. Stage I corresponds to a survey-based prospective cohort&#xD;
      observational trial of out-patients in whom IBD-related knowledge level, treatment adherence,&#xD;
      compliance, and ICTs preferences and barriers will be assessed in IBD patients. Stage II and&#xD;
      III correspond to the design and health outcomes validation of a Spanish-based IBD-MAHP&#xD;
      through qualitative study and a randomised trial, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DAMASCO trial has been initially conceived as a monocentric study with the participation&#xD;
      of IBD patients attended by the Bowel Team, Gastroenterology Service of Hospital Nacional&#xD;
      Profesor Alejandro Posadas (HNPAP), El Palomar, Buenos Aires - Argentina, between May 2021 to&#xD;
      August 2022. However, the authorship does not discard the future participation of other&#xD;
      Argentinian or even from other Latin American Spanish-speaking countries. For the moment,&#xD;
      oral confirmation has been obtained from the followings: Instituto Ecuatoriano de&#xD;
      Enfermedades Digestivas (IECED, Guayaquil - Ecuador) and Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia&#xD;
      (HNCH, Lima - Perú). Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and further worldwide and local politics&#xD;
      around the Social Distancing, Quarantine and Isolation, it is foreseen that the study will be&#xD;
      started in the second trimester of 2021, during the following two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Data search strategy. During May 2021, it will be requested to the Department of&#xD;
      Statistics and Censuses of each participating centre, records of in-patients and out-patient&#xD;
      attention between January 2016 to December 2020 due to the following presumptive or&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis following the 10th revision of the International Classification of&#xD;
      Diseases (ICD-10): Crohn's disease (ICD-10 K50.0, K50.1, K50.8 and 50.9), ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (ICD-10 K51.0, K51.1, K51.2, K51.3, K51.4, K51.5, K51.8, K51.9), indeterminate colitis or IBD&#xD;
      unclassified (ICD-10 K52.3). Selection criteria will be explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Database recovering and recruitment of patients. A dataset concerning an IBD&#xD;
      patients' list attended at each participating centre will be finally performed following&#xD;
      selection criteria detailed above, avoiding duplicated cases. For stage I, patients will be&#xD;
      recruited by phone or email invitation through the contact information available at&#xD;
      corresponding hospital records, but also by personal invitation during Gastroenterology&#xD;
      consultation, as long as they belong to the pre-established IBD patients' list. Patients'&#xD;
      recruitment will comprehend the acceptance of answering corresponding surveys, which will be&#xD;
      available in sheet forms or in an electronic version based on the SurveyMonkey platform.&#xD;
      Surveys will comprehend baseline data, IBD-related knowledge, treatment adherence and&#xD;
      compliance and ICTs preferences and barriers (explained below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group and IBD MAHS development and validation. In stage II, a qualitative study will be&#xD;
      performed using focus group discussion to explore the experiences and perceptions of patients&#xD;
      with IBD using ICTs for health support in different contexts. Focus groups will be&#xD;
      established following the Krueger and Casey guidelines. Collected data will address the&#xD;
      development of an IBD MASH. The developed IBD MASH will be validated on a randomised pilot&#xD;
      study along stage III. Methodology and ethical aspects of stage II and III will be defined in&#xD;
      another proposal, after stage I preliminary findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Technical considerations. M.A.P.T. will perform the Statistical Analysis&#xD;
      using the latest available R version (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna,&#xD;
      Austria). A p&lt;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant, but for the&#xD;
      univariate-analysis assessment, it will be regarded as a p&lt;0.2, when appropriated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Due to that previously mentioned topics are still pending for larger description&#xD;
      among the Latin American population, it is preferred to estimate sample sizes for exploratory&#xD;
      analysis. The total number of patients registered in the prospective IBD database of a&#xD;
      digestive centre in La Argentina (n=4000) has been considered as a reference for the&#xD;
      universe. It has been decided a margin of error of 5% and a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.&#xD;
      Proportions estimation considers finite population correction, and it has been calculated&#xD;
      using the R function sample.size.prop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Considering that around 29% of Chilean IBD patients answered correctly more than 50% of&#xD;
           CCKNOW, the sample size for estimating this IBD-related knowledge level rate on our&#xD;
           population will be n=294.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Considering that around 50.3% of Argentinian IBD patients have inadequate treatment&#xD;
           adherence, the sample size for estimating the rate of treatment adherence and compliance&#xD;
           in our population will be n=351.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Considering that around 16.7% of American IBD patients use social media to obtain or&#xD;
           post IBD-related information, the sample size for estimating this aspect on our&#xD;
           population will be n=203.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis. Quantitative variables will be described in means (standard deviation,&#xD;
      SD) or median (minimum-maximum range) following statistical distribution (Kolmogórov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test). Qualitative variables will be described in frequency (%), and the 95% CI will be&#xD;
      calculated when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychometrical testing of QUECOMIICAT: Cronbach's alpha coefficient, principal component&#xD;
           analysis (PCA), test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between QUECOMIICAT and SEAMS: linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factors modelling: univariate and multivariate are based on logistic regression&#xD;
           (OR, Odds Ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The DAMASCO trial (stage I) has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      of the HNPAP. In order to use the previously mentioned surveys, the authorship has obtained&#xD;
      corresponding authorisation from the authors of QUECOMIICAT questionary, Spanish-validated&#xD;
      version of SEAMS, and surveys which inspired designed ICTs preferences and barriers&#xD;
      instrument used on this research. Enrolled patients will sign an informed consent before&#xD;
      answering respective surveys along stage I. A brief study explanation will be attached to the&#xD;
      surveys. Stage II and III ethic aspects will be discussed after stage I preliminary findings&#xD;
      and detailed in a subsequent research proposal. Patient identity and record confidentiality&#xD;
      will be granted as described by Law Nº 25.326 Personal Data Protection (Ministry of Justice&#xD;
      and Human Rights, Argentine Republic). The study will be conducted in adherence to the 1947&#xD;
      Nuremberg Code and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, and later amendments (the latest in&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
