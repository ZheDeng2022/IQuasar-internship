  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-arm phase II study, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficiency of zanubrutinib combined with R-CHOP regimen in newly diagnosed primary&#xD;
      intraocular lymphoma. Progression-free survival (PFS) of the cohort is the primary endpoint.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the eligible patients will be treated with ZR-CHOP regimen (Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV d1,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2 IV d1, epirubicin 70mg/m2 IV d1, vindesine 4mg IV d1，prednison&#xD;
      60mg/m2 d1-5 PO). An interim evaluation will be performed after 4 cycles, the patients who&#xD;
      achieve CR or PR will receive another 4 cycles of ZR-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients with stable disease (SD) or progressed disease (PD) will withdraw from the trial&#xD;
      and receive salvage regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following-up, surveillance physical examination and CT scans should be performed&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years to determine the status of disease.&#xD;
