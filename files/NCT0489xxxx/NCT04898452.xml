  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a new model for across services&#xD;
      interaction with the use of welfare technology and telemedicine. The model includes&#xD;
      innovative and new routines for the exchange of patient information, quality systems and&#xD;
      procedures between the municipality and the hospital. This model will first be tested for use&#xD;
      in intravenous antibiotic therapy. The results of the study will be used to further develop&#xD;
      the service. In the larger context, it is desirable to provide knowledge that is transferable&#xD;
      to other diagnostic groups, treatment methods and geographical areas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research-based innovation study has an evaluation approach with follow-up evaluation as&#xD;
      the overall approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-project was carried out with a qualitative approach under the auspices of SINTEF&#xD;
      2018/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main project consists of sub-study 1 and sub-study 2 (2020/2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 1: The project use an iterative, user-centered service methodology with a&#xD;
      qualitative approach. Here, SINTEF has the main responsibility for a qualitative summary&#xD;
      after conducting interviews, observations and group discussions with patients, next of kins&#xD;
      and health professionals regarding the development and testing / quality assurance of the new&#xD;
      concept / service course for home treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2: The approach here is quantitative. Descriptive data must be obtained from the&#xD;
      hospital and municipal patient records, patient administration system (PAS) at Kristiansund&#xD;
      hospital, alarm data from the Regional Response Center and pump log from the individual&#xD;
      patient's infusion pump after home treatment.&#xD;
