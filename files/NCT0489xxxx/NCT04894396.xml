  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate and compare the use of a prefabricated Orthotic, with and without a metatarsal&#xD;
      pad in decreasing pain and fear of falling in older adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that around 24% of community-dwelling adults over the age of 45 experience&#xD;
      frequent foot pain. Falls and fear of falling are also significant issues in this population&#xD;
      as both can result in avoidance of activities and decreased physical performance. In cases&#xD;
      where fear of falling decreases physical performance and increases activity avoidance, it&#xD;
      actually becomes a risk factor for falling itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that various types of Orthotic insoles improve balance and reduce&#xD;
      lower-extremity pain in older adults. However, research which directly compares the effects&#xD;
      of two different types of insoles is limited. Hence, this randomised control trial will&#xD;
      investigate and compare the use of a prefabricated Orthotic, with and without a metatarsal&#xD;
      pad, in decreasing pain and fear of falling in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised control trial will be conducted over a 6-week period. The study population&#xD;
      will include 206 participants who will be randomised into 2 groups (Group A and Group B).&#xD;
      Participants in Group A will receive an Orthotic with a metatarsal pad and participants in&#xD;
      Group B will receive a neutral Orthotic without the metatarsal pad. All participants will be&#xD;
      required to continue with usual activities, using the Orthotic wherever possible for a period&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Participants will be asked to provide data in the form of completed surveys&#xD;
      twice, once at the study onset and once at the end.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain as assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores will be collected using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as follows: Levels of pain on a 0 to 10 scale with 0 representing no pain, 2 - mild pain, 5 - moderate pain, 7 - severe pain, and 10 represents extremely severe pain. Utilization of this scale is in line with previous research [and will measure pain in the feet, ankles, knees, hips, and lower back.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in foot pain &amp; functionality as assessed by the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Foot Pain &amp; Functionality scores will be collected using the FHSQ or Foot Health Status Questionnaire. The Foot Health Status Questionnaire is designed to assess foot pain, foot health and its relation to quality of life. The questionnaire has four domains consisting of 13 key items. The four domains are; foot pain, foot function, footwear and general foot health. The current study will only use the 2 subsections of Foot Pain and Foot Function. In these subsections, participants will be required to rate foot pain in the last week from 1 (none) to 5 (severe), how often the participant experienced different types of foot pain during the last week from 1 (never) to 5 (always), how much the participants feet interfered with everyday activities in the last week from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) and overall foot health from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Previous research has found the FHSQ to exhibit a strong degree of context, criterion and construct validity with high retest reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of falling as assessed by the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) short.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of falling will be measured using the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) short, The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) (short) is a 7-item version of the FES-I. The questionnaire will ask participants to rate the concern about the possibility of falling when completing everyday tasks on a scale of 1 to 4 (where 1 = not at all concerned and 4 = very concerned). This version has been validated for community-dwelling older population. Furthermore, the short FES-I can predict future falls, muscle weakness, frailty and overall disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of foot structure using the Gaitway scanner.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All the participants would undergo analysis with the Gaitway scanner. The results of the scanner will only be documented for purposes of the study and the results of the scanning will not be used to determine the Orthotic the individual participant receives.</description>

When the investigators provide the Orthotics, an instruction sheet will also be provided, explaining how to use the orthotic. Alternatively, an online video tutorial on how to use the Orthotic will also be available throughout the study.
