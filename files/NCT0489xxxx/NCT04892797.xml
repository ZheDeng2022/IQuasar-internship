      The adaptive immune response, consisting of antiviral T and B cells, is critical for&#xD;
      providing protection against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, both during an active infection and&#xD;
      later following a subsequent exposure. They can both also potentially contribute to&#xD;
      pathogenesis if they are overstimulated. Despite these advances in knowledge, there are still&#xD;
      significant gaps in understanding of what constitutes a protective or immunopathologic immune&#xD;
      response and its durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant knowledge gaps also remain pertaining to the early recognition of COVID patients&#xD;
      with increased risk of clinical deterioration who require continued hospitalization and the&#xD;
      use of more intensive treatments designed to improve outcomes. Data from non-COVID patients&#xD;
      with MI show that platelet surface expression of FcγRIIa, the low-affinity receptor for the&#xD;
      Fc fragment of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, identifies patients at high and low risk of subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is increased by interferon γ20 that is&#xD;
      significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 infections. The high prevalence of arterial&#xD;
      thrombosis among COVID-19 patients and the central role of thrombosis in respiratory failure&#xD;
      support the hypothesis that elevated platelet expression of FcγRIIa will identify COVID&#xD;
      patients at increased risk of thrombotic complications and clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the potential role of platelet activation in thrombosis associated with&#xD;
      COIVD-19, the endothelium may also play a significant role. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that elevated EMPs in plasma will identify patients at high risk of thrombosis and clinical&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin to address the knowledge gaps above and obtain preliminary data for future large&#xD;
      grant submission, the investigators propose a small, prospective, single-center cohort study&#xD;
      that will enroll patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and exhibiting a range of&#xD;
      disease severity. Biosamples will be obtained and used to study T and B cells, antibody&#xD;
      repertoire, and durability of protective immunity, and also to quantify platelet expression&#xD;
      of FcγRIIa and circulating EMPs, as described in the protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 illness has&#xD;
      spread worldwide. Globally, there are &gt;86 million infections and over 1.8 million confirmed&#xD;
      deaths, with the pandemic continuing at record levels throughout the USA. While new data on&#xD;
      COVID-19 are emerging daily, several knowledge gaps remain, including understanding of the&#xD;
      adaptive immune response to infection, the propensity for infected patients to experience&#xD;
      thrombotic events, and identification of biomarkers that might predict clinical&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive immune response, consisting of antiviral T and B cells, is critical for&#xD;
      providing protection against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, both during an active infection and&#xD;
      later following a subsequent exposure. They can both also potentially contribute to&#xD;
      pathogenesis if they are overstimulated. Much has been learned about the T and B cell&#xD;
      responses to SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most comprehensive&#xD;
      study to date shows that most individuals make a balanced T and B cell response that persists&#xD;
      for at least 8 months. Despite these advances in knowledge, there are still significant gaps&#xD;
      in understanding of what constitutes a protective or immunopathologic immune response and&#xD;
      their durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant knowledge gaps also remain pertaining to the early recognition of COVID patients&#xD;
      with increased risk of clinical deterioration who require continued hospitalization and the&#xD;
      use of more intensive treatments designed to improve outcomes. In addition, the&#xD;
      identification of low risk patients who can be discharged from the hospital would reduce the&#xD;
      use of potentially scarce medical resources, particularly during a surge. Among patients with&#xD;
      thrombosis, 49% required critical care and 43% died. Data from non-COVID patients with MI&#xD;
      show that platelet surface expression of FcγRIIa, the low-affinity receptor for the Fc&#xD;
      fragment of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, identifies patients at high and low risk of subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is increased by interferon γ20 that is&#xD;
      significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 infections. Because FcγRIIa amplifies platelet&#xD;
      activation, greater expression of FcγRIIa on the surface of the platelet increases platelet&#xD;
      reactivity. The high prevalence of arterial thrombosis among COVID-19 patients and the&#xD;
      central role of thrombosis in respiratory failure support the hypothesis that elevated&#xD;
      platelet expression of FcγRIIa will identify COVID patients at increased risk of thrombotic&#xD;
      complications and clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the potential role of platelet activation in thrombosis associated with&#xD;
      COIVD-19, the endothelium may also play a significant role. The endothelium is a key site of&#xD;
      entry for COVID-19 infection and endothelial injury contributes to thrombotic events that&#xD;
      increase morbidity and mortality. Endothelial microparticles (EMPs), submicron membranous&#xD;
      vesicles indicating endothelial activation and injury, are released by the endothelium into&#xD;
      blood and reflect the competency of endothelial function by identifying endothelial&#xD;
      activation and injury, which promote thrombosis. Circulating EMPs can be quantified with the&#xD;
      use of flow cytometry. The investigators hypothesize that elevated EMPs in plasma will&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk of thrombosis and clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin to address the knowledge gaps above and obtain preliminary data for future large&#xD;
      grant submission, the investigators propose a small, prospective, single-center cohort study&#xD;
      that will enroll patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and exhibiting a range of&#xD;
      disease severity. Blood will be obtained on study days 1, 3±1, 7±1 (and every 7±1 days&#xD;
      thereafter up to day 28 while hospitalized), and again at 12 months of follow up.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs will be collected on these same study days through day 28, but not&#xD;
      at 12 months. These biosamples will be used to study T and B cells, antibody repertoire, and&#xD;
      durability of protective immunity, and also to quantify platelet expression of FcγRIIa and&#xD;
      circulating EMPs, as described in the protocol.&#xD;

        This study will enroll patients hospitalized at the University of Vermont Medical Center&#xD;
        who have a positive test result for COVID-19. These patients are expected to have a greater&#xD;
        acuity of illness and burden of disease based on the fact that they require inpatient care.&#xD;
        Enrolling hospitalized patients ensures a greater opportunity to collect serial biological&#xD;
        specimens over the course of the illness due to the proximity of the patient to medical and&#xD;
        research staff and UVM laboratories.&#xD;
