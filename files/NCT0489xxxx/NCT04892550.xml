  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because changes in sagittal thoracic alignment have been reported to alter the mechanical&#xD;
      loading of the cervical spine and decreased thoracic mobility has been identified as one of&#xD;
      the predictors for neck and shoulder pain , it makes sense that thoracic articular treatment&#xD;
      improves local kinematics and simultaneously neck pain improves. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of a multimodal program, with thoracic hyper kyphosis&#xD;
      rehabilitation using the Denneroll™ thoracic traction orthosis , applied to participants with&#xD;
      chronic non-specific neck pain and thoracic hyper-kyphosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions directed at improving hyper-kyphosis of the thoracic spine may have therapeutic&#xD;
      effects on the cervical spine; however, there is a lack of controlled studies evaluating&#xD;
      this. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect effects of a multimodal program,&#xD;
      with thoracic hyper kyphosis rehabilitation using the Denneroll™ thoracic traction orthosis ,&#xD;
      applied to participants with chronic non-specific neck pain and thoracic hyper-kyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 80 participants, with chronic non-specific neck pain and thoracic&#xD;
      hyper-kyphosis will be included. Participants will be randomly assigned to the control or an&#xD;
      intervention group. Both groups will receive the multimodal program; additionally, the&#xD;
      intervention group received the Denneroll™ thoracic traction orthosis. Outcome measures will&#xD;
      include kyphotic angle (max.), neck pain and disability , sensorimotor control outcomes; head&#xD;
      repositioning accuracy , smooth pursuit neck torsion test and overall stability index .&#xD;
      Measures will be assessed at three intervals: baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months after&#xD;
      cessation of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Thoracic kyphosis was assessed using a 4D formetric device where determination of thoracic kyphosis angle is measured between tangents from the cervicothoracic junction and that of the thoracolumbar junction</description>

    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 10-week post treatment ,and at 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The neck disability index to assess activities of daily living impact was administered. The NDI has good reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change</description>

    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 10-week post treatment ,and at 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Neck pain average intensity over the previous week was assessed using a 0-10 numerical rating score where 0 = no pain, …, 10 = bed ridden and incapacitated.</description>

    <measure>Change in cervical joint position sense testing</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 10-week post treatment ,and at 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of head repositioning accuracy with the CROM device is performed in an upright seated posture on a stool with no backrest, the CROM device is placed on the participants head, both feet were firmly on the floor with knees bent at an approximate 90° angle. The neutral head position is established as the beginning and reference positions where the CROM device is adjusted to zero for the primary plane of rotational movement. Individuals will be instructed to close their eyes, memorize the starting position, actively rotate their head 30° about the vertical axis, and reposition their head to the starting position with no requirements for speed; only accuracy was encouraged. HRA is measured as the difference in degrees in the primary plane of movement between the origin and the return positions</description>

    <measure>Change in head and eye movement control: smooth pursuit neck torsion test</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 10-week post treatment ,and at 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Electro-oculography will be used for the smooth pursuit neck torsion test to assess disturbances in eye movement control. The test will be performed with the participant's head and trunk in a neutral forward position and then a trunk rotation position (head neutral, trunk in 45° rotation)</description>

    <description>Participants in both groups will complete a 10-week, 3 x per week, 30 sessions total multimodal program consisting of physical pain relief methods, thoracic spine manipulation, myofascial release, and therapeutic exercises.&#xD;
In addition, the participants in the intervention group will receive the Denneroll™ thoracic traction orthosis. All participants will begin at 3-minutes per session of DTTO application, each visit they will be encouraged to increase the duration by 2-3 minutes, until such time they will be able to reach the goal of 15-20 minutes per session.</description>

    <description>The participants will be instructed to lie flat on their back on the ground with their knees slightly bent at 20-30° for comfort and arms gently folded across their stomach. The examiner will position the apex of the Denneroll in one of three regions: lower thoracic (T9-T12), mid-thoracic (T5-T8), and upper-thoracic (T1-T4) depending on the apex of each participant's thoracic kyphosis deformity. For lower thoracic kyphosis (T9-T12) the Denneroll is turned 180° so the peak contacts the lower thoracic spine (T10) while the tapered end supports the mid thoracic region</description>
