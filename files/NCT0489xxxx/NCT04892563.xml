      Rib fractures, while in isolation are self-limited and benign, can be exquisitely painful.&#xD;
      Poorly controlled rib fracture pain can compromise respiratory function leading to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Currently, opioid medications are the&#xD;
      mainstay of analgesia but are associated with significant adverse effects, such as&#xD;
      respiratory depression and delirium. In an effort to improve acute pain in the ED and&#xD;
      concomitantly reduce opioid use, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia has been implemented&#xD;
      more frequently The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a relatively new ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      procedure for thoracic analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the serratus anterior plane (SAP) block has been used for this indication.&#xD;
      However, typical anatomical distribution limits the effectiveness of the SAP block to&#xD;
      anterior rib fractures, while the majority of traumatic rib fractures are posterior, thus&#xD;
      require a more central blockade such as the proposed ESPB. The ESPB can be done as a single&#xD;
      injection into the superficial structures of the back under ultrasound guidance and as such,&#xD;
      is a both a relatively safe and technically easy procedure to perform, especially in&#xD;
      comparison to the more traditional alternatives of epidurals, paravertebral and intercostal&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no prospective studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the ESPB in the&#xD;
      emergency department setting for acute rib fractures. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      ESPB will provide improved acute pain scores in the emergency department compared to parental&#xD;
      analgesia alone. Secondarily, investigators hypothesize that this will translate to less&#xD;
      inpatient opioid requirements and improved incentive spirometry values.&#xD;

      Rib fractures, while in isolation are self-limited and benign, can be exquisitely painful.&#xD;
      Poorly controlled rib fracture pain can compromise respiratory function leading to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Currently, opioid medications are the&#xD;
      mainstay of analgesia but are associated with significant adverse effects, such as&#xD;
      respiratory depression and delirium. Additionally, even short courses can predispose to&#xD;
      life-long addiction perpetuating the opioid epidemic. In an effort to improve acute pain in&#xD;
      the ED and concomitantly reduce opioid use, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia has been&#xD;
      implemented more frequently. As an example, ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks for hip&#xD;
      fractures have a promising track record for reducing opioid use and improving pain scores.&#xD;
      The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a relatively new ultrasound-guided procedure for&#xD;
      thoracic analgesia. It was first described in 2016 by Forero, et al., as an effective&#xD;
      alternative to traditional neuraxial blockade for post-operative and chronic thoracic pain. A&#xD;
      recent literature review by Kot et al., 2019 revealed six prospective studies in&#xD;
      post-operative patients concluding that the ESPB was at least as effective as opioids in&#xD;
      thoracic pain reduction, easy to use and with a low complication rate. One prospective study&#xD;
      in post-operative breast surgery patients demonstrated a reduction in morphine by 65%&#xD;
      compared to control. Most literature on the ESPB in the ED are case reports, which&#xD;
      demonstrate its versatility in a myriad of clinical situations such as renal colic, acute&#xD;
      herpes zoster, acute transverse process fractures, extensive burns, mechanical back pain,&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis and acute rib fractures. This review found the ESPB to be effective at&#xD;
      reducing pain scores for all reported indications with no complications. The ESPB is a&#xD;
      particularly attractive multimodal form of analgesia in the ED where acute traumatic rib&#xD;
      fractures are a common presentation. Usually the involuntary splinting from acute pain&#xD;
      results in the typical pulmonary complications, but high doses of opioids and the subsequent&#xD;
      respiratory depressive effects can lead to higher rates of atelectasis, pneumonia and&#xD;
      respiratory failure. In order to combat this &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot; scenario,&#xD;
      regional analgesia has emerged as an effective means of improving both pain respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics. Previously, the serratus anterior plane (SAP) block has been used for this&#xD;
      indication. However, typical anatomical distribution limits the effectiveness of the SAP&#xD;
      block to anterior rib fractures, while the majority of traumatic rib fractures are posterior,&#xD;
      thus require a more central blockade such as the proposed ESPB. The ESPB can be done as a&#xD;
      single injection into the superficial structures of the back under ultrasound guidance and as&#xD;
      such, is a both a relatively safe and technically easy procedure to perform, especially in&#xD;
      comparison to the more traditional alternatives of epidurals, paravertebral and intercostal&#xD;
      injections. Another consideration of these technically more difficult procedures is that they&#xD;
      are relatively contraindicated in the anticoagulated patient precluding a substantial number&#xD;
      of elderly patients from their therapeutic benefits. The aforementioned reviews have&#xD;
      supported the safety of the ESPB with no complications reported. Specifically, of the 10 case&#xD;
      reports utilizing this block in the ED, none reported any complications. The 3 cases reported&#xD;
      by Luftig et al, in 2018 specific to ED management of acute rib fractures were technically&#xD;
      feasible, highly efficacious and safe. However, there have been no prospective studies&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of the ESPB in the emergency department setting for acute&#xD;
      rib fractures. The investigators hypothesize that the ESPB will provide improved acute pain&#xD;
      scores in the emergency department compared to parental analgesia alone. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that this will translate to less inpatient opioid requirements and&#xD;
      improved incentive spirometry values.&#xD;
