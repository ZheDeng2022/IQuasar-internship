    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical&#xD;
      activity of FHD-286 oral monotherapy in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies,&#xD;
      specifically relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or R/R myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes (MDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an ascending multiple dose escalation clinical trial. It is primarily intended&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FHD-286 when administered orally to subjects with&#xD;
      advanced hematologic malignancies, specifically R/R AML and R/R MDS. This dose escalation&#xD;
      study will allow for the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FHD-286 in patients with advanced hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. This study will also evaluate the PK/PD profiles of multiple dose&#xD;
      administration of FHD-286 and provide a preliminary assessment of antitumor activity in&#xD;
      subjects with R/R AML and R/R MDS as well as other associated hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, including&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK/PD findings, and antitumor activity, will form the basis for&#xD;
      subsequent clinical development of FHD-286.&#xD;

         15. Subject is on medications that are strong CYP3A inhibitors, are strong CYP3A inducers,&#xD;
             or are sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow TIs. Exceptions may be made for therapy&#xD;
             in the case of life-threatening infections, for example a triazole anti-fungal agent&#xD;
             to reduce the risk of invasive fungal infections, at the discretion of the Medical&#xD;
             Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;

         17. Subject on medications that are acid-reducing agents (ARA) such as histamine&#xD;
             H2-receptor antagonists (H2 blockers), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The last&#xD;
             dose of PPIs must be administered 7 days prior to administration of study drug.&#xD;
             Antacids are acceptable when administered in a staggered dosing manner with FHD-286.&#xD;

             Medical Monitor approval. Local steroid therapies (inhaled or topical steroids) are&#xD;
             acceptable. Appropriate steroid replacement to manage endocrine toxicities resulting&#xD;
