  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to collect image data and relevant clinical data from medical&#xD;
      records of patients with suspicion of lung consolidation or pleural effusion. The information&#xD;
      will be used to test the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in identification of&#xD;
      features associated with the above lung conditions.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center, post-market clinical study. Enrollment&#xD;
      will continue (up to a maximum of 300 subjects) until diagnostic LUS exams are acquired for&#xD;
      each of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pleural effusion positive: 75 patients confirmed as positive for pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung consolidation positive: 75 patients confirmed as positive for lung consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease negative: 150 patients confirmed as negative for both of the above conditions&#xD;
           Subjects are not required to return to the clinical site for follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
           Accrual of subjects is anticipated to be completed in approximately 12 months. Adult&#xD;
           subjects with suspicion of pleural effusion or lung consolidation will be enrolled in&#xD;
           the study. In addition, pediatric subjects with suspicion of lung consolidation (with&#xD;
           weight of at least 10 kg) will be enrolled and may comprise up to one-third of the lung&#xD;
           consolidation group (i.e., 25 positive and 25 negative cases).s.&#xD;

        Adult subjects with suspicion of pleural effusion or lung consolidation will be enrolled in&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects presenting to the Emergency Department, admitted to the hospital, or seen in&#xD;
             the outpatient setting with suspicion of pleural effusion or lung consolidation who&#xD;
             received chest imaging to include chest X-ray or CT, or for whom chest X-ray or CT are&#xD;
             planned. Suspicion of pleural effusion or lung consolidation may be based upon imaging&#xD;
             findings or presentation of symptoms including (but not limited to) dyspnea, hypoxia,&#xD;
             tachypnea, rales, or dullness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adult subjects must be able to be to undergo scanning at least 10/14 lung zones,&#xD;
             including including all anterior (1-4) and lateral zones (5-8), and the lowermost&#xD;
             posterior zones (11 and 14). Pediatric subjects must be able to undergo scanning in at&#xD;
             least 8 lung zones, including all anterior zones (1-4), and the lowermost anterior and&#xD;
             posterior zones (6, 8, 10, and 12); see Section 8.1.3 Lung Ultrasound Exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing to provide informed consent (or assent where age appropriate) to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Subjects under 18 years of age require informed consent of a&#xD;
             parent or guardian and assent as required by institutional IRB.&#xD;

             for airflow limitation severity defined as FEV1 &lt; 30% of predicted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known severe restrictive lung disease with baseline FVC &lt; 50% or TLCpleth &lt;50%&#xD;
             predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of subcutaneous air that precludes imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Significant scoliosis (Cobb angle â‰¥ 20 degrees).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pediatric subjects with chronic lung diseases other than asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pediatric subjects on chronic respiratory support (i.e., nasal canula, CPAP, BiPAP, or&#xD;
             tracheostomy).&#xD;
