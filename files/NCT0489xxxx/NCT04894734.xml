  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the safety and clinical effectiveness of Spinal cord stimulation (SCS)&#xD;
      with conventional medical management (CMM) or CMM alone to treat subjects with Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Injury (SCI). Participation in this research study is expected to last approximately 18&#xD;
      months. All subjects will be evaluated and proceed with implantation of SCS device(s) as well&#xD;
      as receiving CMM. Under the direction of the study physician, the patient may receive a&#xD;
      variety of treatments, such as medications and physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placebo arm: SCS OFF + CMM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment arm: SCS ON +CMM For the study treatment with SCS, the study physician will&#xD;
           perform a trial procedure to see if the study procedure works for the patient and may&#xD;
           implant a permanent device if it is successful. There is a temporary trial procedure, or&#xD;
           a &quot;test drive,&quot; which usually lasts 5-7 days. If this is successful, patient will&#xD;
           discuss a more permanent implant. For nine months, treatment group subjects will have&#xD;
           the SCS turned on and will have rehabilitation as part of their CMM. Participants in the&#xD;
           placebo arm will have their SCS remain off and will undergo CMM with rehabilitation&#xD;
           therapy similar to the treatment group. Neither the subjects nor the treatment team will&#xD;
           know which patients are in the treatment or placebo arm. At the end of 9 months, the&#xD;
           study group will be revealed and the placebo group subjects will be allowed to crossover&#xD;
           and have their SCS turned on. Rehabilitation visits may be remote. There may be&#xD;
           additional blood tests and clinical exams to collect data on the effectiveness of the&#xD;
           therapy. Data at follow-up visits will be compared to the subjects' baseline data and&#xD;
           that of the control group at the respective visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to analysis, study population details, including the number of participants randomized,&#xD;
      the number of participants in each site and each study arm and received intended treatment,&#xD;
      and the number of participants lost to follow-up will be described. Data from all enrolled&#xD;
      participants will be included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      We will follow the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement for&#xD;
      reporting results for clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial to test a potential solution to a&#xD;
      challenging clinical problem by examining the feasibility of Epidural Electrical Stimulation&#xD;
      (EES) for improving pain and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with SCI. This clinical&#xD;
      trial will be a parallel-group, two arm, randomized clinical trial (N=20) of adults with: (1)&#xD;
      History and imaging (MRI/CT) consistent with a traumatic, thoracic SCI; (2) Thoracic ASIA-A&#xD;
      clinical exam that is with consistent with history and radiology; (3) Chronic pain (i.e.,&#xD;
      Pain &gt;3 for &gt; 3 months, on &gt; 50% of the days); (4) Willing and able to provide online or&#xD;
      telephone consent; (5) 1 to 5-years after injury; (6) 18-65 years of age; (7) Medically&#xD;
      stable enough to undergo surgical implantation of an SCS and participate in all&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo EES and be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to EES on and EES off. The&#xD;
      stimulation will be subthreshold (no paresthesias, which may not be present in any case given&#xD;
      ASIA A status). Those in the EES off category will have their EES turned on at the 9-month&#xD;
      timepoint. The primary outcome will be average pain-related activity score on the MPI-SCI&#xD;
      survey. The primary timepoint to compare &quot;EES on&quot; (treatment) vs. &quot;EES off&quot; (control) will be&#xD;
      at 9-months (Figure 5). The primary timepoint to compare early EES vs. late EES will be at&#xD;
      18-months. The MPI-SCI survey is a validated, modified version of the MPI tailored for&#xD;
      patients with SCI, for spinal cord injury, which assesses self-reported behavioral and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors associated with chronic pain. The MPI-SCI consists of twelve 7-point&#xD;
      subscales in three sections: (1) pain impact, (2) responses by significant others, and (3)&#xD;
      activity. Our primary outcome is the average score of the 4 pain subscales (household&#xD;
      activities, activities away from home, social activities, and outdoor work) for pain and&#xD;
      consequences of SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory trial to determine the effect size of EES and evaluate a number of&#xD;
      different endpoints to guide the selection of primary outcome for a Phase III trial. We will&#xD;
      assess the following secondary outcomes before randomization and at a 3-month interval after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These endpoints were chosen in accordance with International Campaign for Cures of Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Injury (ICCP) recommendations at the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Research Spinal Cord Injury Measures meeting and other recent reviews. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include: (1) 10-point Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) for pain intensity; (2) Guy/Farrar&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale; (3) Other subscales in MPI-SCI;(4) ASIA&#xD;
      upper-extremity motor score (UEMS); (5) ASIA lower-extremity motor score (LEMS);(6) Total&#xD;
      ASIA motor score; (7) ASIA sensory score; (8) ASIA impairment grades; (9) QoL survey (PROMIS&#xD;
      29); (10) Electromyography (EMG); (11) Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) survey; (12)&#xD;
      Ashworth spasticity scale; (13) Bladder control using urodynamics. If successful, this trial&#xD;
      would establish the treatment benefits of EES to alleviate pain and augment rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with SCI and this treatment model could be replicated at other health care centers&#xD;
      across the country. We hypothesize that patients who receive EES will outperform their&#xD;
      counterparts in the control group in pain and exploratory endpoints including motor, sensory,&#xD;
      bladder and QOL outcomes. We also hypothesize that when the control group crosses over to&#xD;
      late stimulation, they will show improvement on a lesser scale than the early intervention&#xD;
      group, but that the patients will also show significant improvement compared to their control&#xD;
      period. Standardized, validated, and reliable tests of pain, disability, functioning,&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, medication use, quality of life, and sleep will be administered to&#xD;
      each subject at Baseline, and followed through the course of treatment and follow-up. After&#xD;
      subject enrollment, demographic and third party payer coverage data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will compare the impact of EES on pain and QOL in patients with SCI between treatment&#xD;
      and control groups, using the SCI version of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI-SCI);&#xD;
      Aim 2 will compare motor recovery in individual lower extremity muscle groups as assessed by&#xD;
      EMG and dynamometry between treatment and control groups up to 9-months, followed by a second&#xD;
      comparison of unblinded early versus late stimulation for another 9-month period; Aim 3 will&#xD;
      compare the impact of EES on sensory, bladder and quality-of-life in patients with SCI&#xD;
      between treatment and control groups, outcomes as assessed by PROMIS29 (including measures of&#xD;
      pain interference, sleep and mood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Current standard of care (SOC) for SCI includes medical and surgical stabilization&#xD;
      followed by inpatient rehabilitation and discharge home with minimal hope for further&#xD;
      improvement. If successful, this project would help determine whether this well-established&#xD;
      clinical intervention can help patients with SCI neuropathic pain and rehabilitation and have&#xD;
      more widespread clinical applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain may be triggered by sudden noises or physical jarring and exacerbated by other&#xD;
      pathology, such as urinary tract infections or disturbance of bowel function. Neuropathic&#xD;
      pain either at or below the level of injury may be associated with allodynia (pain caused by&#xD;
      a normally nonpainful stimulus) or hyperalgesia (an exaggerated pain response) in the&#xD;
      affected dermatomes19-25. While below-level neuropathic pain is a consequence of the damage&#xD;
      to the spinal cord, segmental neuropathic pain may arise from damage to spinal nerve roots or&#xD;
      the spinal cord itself. With segmental neuropathic pain, distinguishing between peripheral&#xD;
      (root pathology) and central (spinal cord pathology) mechanisms can often be difficult.&#xD;
      However, unilateral pain exacerbated by spinal movement may indicate nerve root damage. This&#xD;
      damage triggers secondary pathological changes in the spinal cord19-25. Duke is committed to&#xD;
      advancing the treatment of SCI-related pain, along with the latest innovations in pragmatic&#xD;
      clinical research, which improve pain control, quality of life, and satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Immediately after providing consent and completing the baseline assessment,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized using 1:1 allocation to SCS ON or SCS OFF, respectively.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by severity of pain using the MPI-SCI baseline scores.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized within these strata in permuted blocks. The stratified&#xD;
      randomization sequence will be generated by the study biostatistician and the sequence will&#xD;
      be stored in the study recruitment database and concealed from study staff until&#xD;
      randomization. Once a patient is randomized, their treatment assignment cannot be changed.&#xD;
      Both the patient and the provider will be formally blinded to treatment assignment. Only the&#xD;
      biostatistician and programming team will be unblinded to treatment assignments.&#xD;

    <description>The MPI-SCI consists of twelve 7-point subscales in three sections: (1) pain impact, (2) responses by significant others, and (3) activity. Our primary outcome is the average score of the 4 pain subscales (household activities, activities away from home, social activities, and outdoor work) for pain and consequences of SCI. These 4 scales are commonly used to create a single general activity scale. To define the degree to which pain and other consequences of injury reduced participation in a specific activity, 2 additional validated items will be used in section 3: (1) &quot;Pain has reduced my participation in this activity,&quot; and (2) &quot;Other consequences of SCI have reduced my participation in this activity.&quot; The response range from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely).</description>

    <description>The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), based on the Frankel scale, is a clinician-administered scale used to classify the severity (completeness) of injury in individuals with SCI. It identifies sensory and motor levels indicative of the highest spinal level demonstrating &quot;unimpaired&quot; function. Preservation of function in the sacral segments (S4-S5) is a key for determining the AIS grade. AIS scores are considered essential when classifying persons with SCI as to their neurological status.</description>
