      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer. ASCP is a highly aggressive type&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer. It is very rare. Researchers want to see if a drug called Minnelide can&#xD;
      be used to treat ASCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if Minnelide is an effective treatment for ASCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with ASCP whose cancer did not respond to previous treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of ability to do daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram to test heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body and/or brain scans. For these, participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of&#xD;
      the body. They may have a contrast agent injected into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample. If one is not available, participants will have a tumor biopsy. The biopsy will&#xD;
      be taken with a small needle put through the skin into the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in 28-day cycles, for up to 12 cycles. There is a 7-day resting&#xD;
      period between cycles. Participants will take Minnelide by mouth every day for 21 days of&#xD;
      each cycle. They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 1 study visit every cycle. They will review their medicine&#xD;
      diary. They will repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional tumor biopsies. Some participants may need to take birth&#xD;
      control during the study and for up to 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an end-of-treatment visit 4 weeks after they stop taking the study&#xD;
      drug. They will repeat some screening tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (ASCP) is a highly aggressive variant of&#xD;
           pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the most common type of pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASCP is estimated to account for 0.5-4% of the 55,000 people who are diagnosed with&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer in the U.S. each year, making it a very rare tumor type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prospective clinical trials specific to ASCP have ever been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical data in ASCP models indicate that an activated superenhancer network drives&#xD;
           epigenetic changes which cause the prognostically unfavorable squamous differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genomic analysis of ASCP tumors identifies frequent amplification of MYC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minnelide is a small molecule anti-superenhancer drug that inhibits MYC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recommended dose of Minnelide has previously been established through clinical&#xD;
           testing for other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the single agent antitumor activity (disease control rate) of the&#xD;
      anti-superenhancer agent Minnelide in participants with advanced, previously treated ASCP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed ASCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease and progression on&#xD;
           at least 1 prior treatment regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II single cohort clinical trial with one arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of evaluable participants needed for the primary endpoint is 25; maximum&#xD;
           accrual set at 55 participants (accounting for screen failures and inevaluable&#xD;
           participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive Minnelide at 2 mg/day PO on Days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be continued for up to 12 cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment response will be assessed by imaging every 2 cycles (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor biopsies will be requested mid-cycle 1 and at time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A disease control rate of &gt;= 40% in this highly refractory population would constitute a&#xD;
           positive study. Up to 12 participants will treated be initially. If 3 of the 12&#xD;
           participants have a response, then up to 13 additional participants will be entered to&#xD;
           determine the true response rate.&#xD;

             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
