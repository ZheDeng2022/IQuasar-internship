      The clinical study with UMC119-06-05 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This will be a dose escalation, open label,&#xD;
      single-center study in adult with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. UMC119-06-05 is ex&#xD;
      vivo cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells product which is&#xD;
      intended for treatment of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common type&#xD;
      of arthritis diagnosed. KOA is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of&#xD;
      articular cartilage. The prevalence of the Knee osteoarthritis will continue to increase as&#xD;
      life expectancy and obesity rises. Osteoarthritis is typically a progressive disease that may&#xD;
      eventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each&#xD;
      individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating&#xD;
      over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they&#xD;
      typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include&#xD;
      knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain&#xD;
      after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options&#xD;
      when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and&#xD;
      other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies,&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment&#xD;
      of KOA.&#xD;
