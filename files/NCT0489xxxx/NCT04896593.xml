  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-group open-label trial will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      a suicide prevention mobile application when used as an adjunct to usual care in adolescents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 20 adolescent (age 13-17) inpatients at elevated risk for suicide.&#xD;
      Participants will download the app onto their phones during their inpatient stay and will&#xD;
      complete a single therapy session involving psychoeducation and crisis response planning.&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to use the app on their own in addition to their usual&#xD;
      outpatient services to learn and practice suicide prevention skills. Participants and their&#xD;
      parents will be interviewed 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
