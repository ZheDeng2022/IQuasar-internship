  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot trial among ship-board US Navy personnel surrounding a holiday weekend tested an&#xD;
      evidence-based video on responsible drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service members &gt;18 years were eligible to volunteer if they were aboard during data&#xD;
      collection. Participants were randomized to intervention or control arms, with all given a&#xD;
      brief survey before (T1) and after (T2) the weekend. The intervention arm viewed a 3-minute&#xD;
      video at T1. A urine specimen collected at T1 and T2 for ethyl glucuronide (EtG) measurement&#xD;
      used &gt;100ng/ml for significant alcohol use. Multivariable regression measured odds of&#xD;
      detecting EtG at T2, controlling for T1 EtG detectability, age, and alcohol misuse at&#xD;
      baseline per AUDIT-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      86 subjects participated at T1, and 100 at T2, with complete data for 72 (control, n=34;&#xD;
      intervention, n=38) who participated in both T1 and T2 were analyzed. Average age was 28&#xD;
      years with 25% and 32% reporting white or black/African-American, 54% married and 84% &lt;E6. At&#xD;
      T1, 22% (n=16) and T2, 32% (n=23) had EtG&gt;100ng/ml. At T1, 50% and 55% in control and&#xD;
      intervention arms respectively, screened positive for alcohol misuse by AUDIT-C; T1 AUDIT-C&#xD;
      screen positivity was significantly associated with detecting EtG&gt;100ng/ml at T1 (p=0.04).&#xD;
      Control arm EtG&gt;100ng/ml participants increased 1.7-fold over the weekend, from n=7 at T1 to&#xD;
      n=12 at T2; the intervention arm had no increase in EtG&gt;100ng/ml participants, with n=11 at&#xD;
      T1 and n=11 at T2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      U.S. Navy active duty personnel were recruited to participate in a randomized pilot trial&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of a 3 minute video intervention designed to promote safer drinking&#xD;
      and reduce adverse consequences of alcohol use. All subjects were provided informed consent&#xD;
      prior to participation. An incentive of a $5 gift card was provided upon completion of T1,&#xD;
      and a $10 gift card provided after completion of T2. Subject participation and data were&#xD;
      anonymous; personal identifiers were collected in order to link samples and surveys between&#xD;
      timepoint 1 (T1) and timepoint 2 (T2), but after the linking, all identifier data were&#xD;
      destroyed. To minimize risk associated with collecting personal identifiers, we did not&#xD;
      retain any personal identifiers, to include sex categorization of participants. Subjects&#xD;
      completed the T1 survey with only study ID on the form and were then asked to provide a urine&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples were collected in toilet facilities onboard the ship. The collections were not&#xD;
      monitored. Urine samples were labelled with the subject ID number and stored at 4 degrees C&#xD;
      until they could be shipped. For T1, samples remained refrigerated over the weekend as&#xD;
      receiving personnel would not be available during the weekend; at T2, the samples were&#xD;
      shipped the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1, after providing the urine sample, the intervention subjects watched a 3 minute video,&#xD;
      while the control subjects left the area without watching the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the long weekend, subjects were asked to return to the study area, complete a brief&#xD;
      survey, and provide a second urine specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 minute video was created for this pilot study. One of the authors with experience in&#xD;
      inoculation theory (RJD) guided the content of the video, which was produced, directed and&#xD;
      filmed at the New York University Film School.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T1 surveys collected data on year of birth (as a verification in linking T1 and T2 data&#xD;
      in event of linking error), demographic information to include race, relationship status, and&#xD;
      pay grade. Additional questions included &quot;have you ever had a drinking problem?&quot;, the AUDIT-C&#xD;
      questions , and questions regarding if conflicts, accidents or other issues had occurred as a&#xD;
      result of alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T2 survey collected year of birth (see above), AUDIT-C questions (modified to reflect&#xD;
      data only from the preceding weekend), and the same questions regarding conflicts, accidents&#xD;
      or other issues as a result of alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for EtG testing Chemicals and materials Standards of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and&#xD;
      ethyl glucuronide-d5 (EtG-d5) were purchased at concentrations of 1 mg/mL in 1 mL methanol&#xD;
      from Cerilliant Corp (Round Rock, TX, US). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)&#xD;
      grade methanol, acetonitrile and formic acid, and Sarstedt Inc 10 mL sc tubes 16x100 mm were&#xD;
      purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, US). Nano-Filter vials ® 0.2 µm PES&#xD;
      with pre-slit gray cap were from Thomson Instrument Company (Oceanside, CA, US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample preparation: dilution and filtration One hundred µL of urine sample, 300 µL of water&#xD;
      and 100 µL of the internal standard EtG-d5 at 0.5 µg/mL were vortex-mixed in a clean&#xD;
      Starstedt tube. Two hundred µL of the sample were transferred into the shell vial of the&#xD;
      Filter Vial. The plunger with filter was inserted all the way into the shell vial. Twenty µL&#xD;
      of the filtered sample were directly injected into the LC-MS/MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibrators were prepared at concentrations 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µg/mL, and&#xD;
      quality controls at 0.15 and 7.5 µg/mL, using 100 µL of blank urine, 200 µL of water, 100 µL&#xD;
      of the corresponding working solution and 100 µL of the internal standard solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental analysis The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Nexera UHPLC system&#xD;
      (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, US). The Nexera UHPLC system consisted of two binary LC-20AD XR&#xD;
      high-performance liquid chromatography pumps, online degassing unit (DGU-20A 3R), cooled&#xD;
      autosampler (SIL-20A XR) and an oven (CTO-20AC). The column was a Hypercarb column (2.1x 100&#xD;
      mm, 3 µm) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The mobile phase, 0.1 % formic acid in water (A) and&#xD;
      acetonitrile (B), was delivered at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Column temperature was 30C. The&#xD;
      gradient began with B at 5% then increasing to 95% in 6 min. B at 95% was held for 0.5 min&#xD;
      after which it decreased to 5%, and it was held for 1 min. Total run time was 7.5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mass spectrometer was a triple quadrupole LCMS-8050 from Shimadzu equipped with&#xD;
      electrospray ionization source (ESI). The heating gas and drying gas flows were 15 and 10&#xD;
      L/min, respectively, with a nebulizing gas flow at 2 L/min. The interface temperature was&#xD;
      300°C and the heat block temperature was 400°C. All compounds were analyzed using ESI in&#xD;
      negative ionization mode, and two transitions in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode were&#xD;
      acquired for each analyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp,&#xD;
      College Station, TX). Descriptive statistics were calculated to characterize participant&#xD;
      demographics and by alcohol use at T1 and T2. Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical&#xD;
      variables with n&lt;15 in any category and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for non-normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables to examine bivariate associations between the groups. All tests were&#xD;
      two-sided with significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement of self-reported alcohol consumption. The AUDIT-C score is scored on a scale from 0-12. The higher the AUDIT-C score is, the more likely it is to indicate a alcohol use disorder. In males, a score of 4 or higher is a positive screen. In women, a score of 3 or higher represents a positive screen. In this trial, we did not collect male/female data and used a cutoff of 4 for all participants.</description>
