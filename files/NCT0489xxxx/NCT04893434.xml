  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a new type of DCE (dynamic contrast-enhanced) MRI (magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging) to see whether, compared with traditional MRI, it produces better images that&#xD;
      provide more information about tumors, which may help doctors make better decisions about&#xD;
      treating women who have cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is commonly used to detect and evaluate many types of cancer, but its slow processing&#xD;
      speed and the risk that images will be blurred if the patient moves inside the scanner can&#xD;
      limit its use in clinical practice. DCE MRI is a new imaging technique that uses additional&#xD;
      computer processing to collect information continuously during scanning, which produces more&#xD;
      detailed images faster than traditional MRI, which reduces the risk of movement-related&#xD;
      blurring and provides important information about tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCE MRI scan in this study will be done in a standard MRI scanner, using a contrast agent&#xD;
      (gadobutrol; GadavistÂ®) that has been approved by the FDA.&#xD;

    <description>10 volunteers will undergo a single DCE-MRI of the normal cervix to fine-tune parameters and test the performance of reconstruction and quantification algorithms. Goldenangled radial LAVA data will be continuously acquired for 5 minutes and the contrast agent will be injected intravenously after 1 minute (same contrast agent and injection rate. 60 cervical cancer patients will be enrolled (inclusion criterion: newly diagnosed FIGO stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer scheduled for standard of care pelvic MRI for staging). Data from 30 of the patients will be used to assess repeatability; DCE-MRI will be acquired at baseline and repeated 48 hours (+/- 24 h) later (no therapy between the 2 scans). Data from the other 30 patients will be used to document treatment induced changes in DCE-MRI; patients in this group will undergo DCE-MRI at baseline and repeated after 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) of completion of chemoradiation treatment.</description>

    <description>Each patient will undergo 3 Gadavist injections. The intravenous injection of the GBCA Gadobutrol (Gadavist, Bayer Healthcare) at 0.1 mL/kg body weight (0.1 mmol/kg), administered as a bolus at a flow rate of approximately 2 mL/s. Each volunteer will undergo 1 and each patient 2 research Gadobutrol injections (the 3 injections mentioned in the protocol for patients is to account for the fact they will have had 1 injection as part of their standard of care, but the study only includes 2 research injections).</description>

    <description>All subjects will be imaged on the same 3T MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) at MSK for all examinations. For SA1, subjects will undergo a single research DCE-MRI exam. Patients in SA2 will undergo a standard of care pelvic MRI at baseline (which includes DCE-standard) in accordance with standard clinical operating procedures at MSK.</description>
