  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of patients with lymphoma is based on the administration of a chemotherapy&#xD;
      containing anthracyclines (ATC), and allows cure rates of 65% to 80% at 5 years. The&#xD;
      administration of ATCs can lead to an increase in the risk of systolic dysfunction of the&#xD;
      left ventricle (DSVG) which ranges from 6 to 15% at 1 year, and of heart failure from which&#xD;
      impact at 3.5 years can reach 5%. The major issue in the management of this toxicity is the&#xD;
      early identification of this population for monitoring and prevention. No pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention strategy is currently recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology, this identification&#xD;
      is based on the measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the overall&#xD;
      longitudinal strain (SLG) before and after the last administration of ATC ( at D84 or D126,&#xD;
      depending on the duration of the chemotherapy protocol). Recent studies have evaluated the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of earlier strategies highlighting the benefit of SLG measured after&#xD;
      150 mg / m2 of ATC (D42). However, the tools are lacking to detect these patients as close as&#xD;
      possible to the onset of ATC, a necessary condition for effective secondary prevention. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that an early assessment of myocardial binding of 18F-FDG, analyzed during the&#xD;
      first routine PET / CT scan as part of the assessment of the response to chemotherapy (D42)&#xD;
      should verify a population at risk of developing DSVG at 1 year.&#xD;

      This is a study that evaluates the sensitivity of the cardiac uptake of 18F-FDG measured on&#xD;
      D42 of the administration of ATCs to identify at 1 year the patients at risk of occurrence of&#xD;
      a DVSG defined by a drop of more than 10 units of the LVEF and LVEF &lt;53%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : A multicentre clinical trial with 11 sites participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size : 484 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of inclusion: 25 months Patient observation period: 12 months Total duration: 37&#xD;
      months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an inclusion visit, then protocol visits at D42, D84 or D126 and at the end of the&#xD;
      study (M12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no interim analysis planned. Analyzes will be performed at the end of the test after&#xD;
      reviewing the data and freezing the database.&#xD;
