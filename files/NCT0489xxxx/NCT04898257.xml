    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, open-label, single-center, proof-of-concept, pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of Lactibiane Tolerance® in treating leaky gut in IBS-D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 consecutive patients with IBS-D and an increased intestinal permeability assessed by&#xD;
      51Cr-EDTA or 99mTc-DTPA will receive the multistrain probiotic Lactibiane Tolerance® 10&#xD;
      billion CFU 1 capsule twice a day (30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner)&#xD;
      for 30 days treatment. At the end of treatment, patients will repeat intestinal permeability&#xD;
      assessment by 51Cr-EDTA or 99mTc-DTPA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota has many beneficial effects on the GI tract: barrier, immunomodulatory,&#xD;
      metabolic, trophic among others. Microbiota unbalance or dysbiosis has been associated to&#xD;
      digestive and extradigestive diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder that affects the small and large&#xD;
      intestine which causes cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea and/or constipation.&#xD;
      Only a small number of people with IBS have severe signs and symptoms. Some people can&#xD;
      control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. Others will need medication&#xD;
      and counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal permeability is the phenomenon of the gut wall in the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      exhibiting permeability. It is a normal function of the intestine to exhibit some&#xD;
      permeability, to allow nutrients to pass through the gut, while also maintaining a barrier&#xD;
      function to keep potentially harmful substances (such as antigens) from leaving the intestine&#xD;
      and migrating to the body more widely. In a healthy human intestine, small particles (&lt; 4 Å&#xD;
      in radius) can migrate through tight junction claudin pore pathways and particles up to 10-15&#xD;
      Å (3.5 kDa) can transit through the paracellular space uptake route. One way in which&#xD;
      intestinal permeability is modulated is via CXCR3 receptors in the gut wall, which respond to&#xD;
      zonulin. Gliadin (a glycoprotein present in wheat) activates zonulin signaling irrespective&#xD;
      of the genetic expression of autoimmunity, leading to increased intestinal permeability to&#xD;
      macromolecules. Bacterial pathogens such as cholera, select enteric viruses, and parasites&#xD;
      modulate intestinal tight junction structure and function, and these effects may contribute&#xD;
      to the development of chronic intestinal disorders. Excessive intestinal permeability is a&#xD;
      factor in stress, infections and in some several autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, but it is not clear if increased&#xD;
      intestinal permeability is a cause or a consequence of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to its ability to modulate gut associated immune system, to compete with other GI&#xD;
      bacteria and to increase enterocyte regeneration, probiotic therapy could be proposed to&#xD;
      overcome an increased intestinal permeability. In particular, preliminary data suggested that&#xD;
      the probiotic multistrains Lactibiane Tolerance® could be effective in Leaky gut treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, Nébot-Vivinus et al. demonstrated that Lactibiane Tolerance® could prevent&#xD;
      epithelial barrier disruption induced by lipopolysaccharide, stress or colonic soluble&#xD;
      factors from IBS patients and prevent visceral hypersensitivity in experimental models of&#xD;
      epithelial barrier function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Drouault-Holowacz et al. demonstrated that Lactibiane Tolerance® has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties in vitro by stimulating IL-10 production and in vivo by&#xD;
      conferring a significant protective effect in the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid&#xD;
      (TNBS)-induced colitis -induced colitis model (more than 50% decrease of colitis symptoms,&#xD;
      P&lt;0.01).This pilot study has been designed to evaluate the effect of multistrains probiotic&#xD;
      Lactibiane Tolerance® in a consecutive subset of IBS-D patients with increased Intestinal&#xD;
      permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in this study will be for approximately 45 days which includes up to a&#xD;
      2-week screening period and a 30-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will participate to the following visits: screening, enrolment, day 15 and day&#xD;
      30.&#xD;
