  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flow controlled ventilation (FCV) is a fairly new mode of mechanical ventilation, consisting&#xD;
      of a constant inspiratory and expiratory flow. Inspiration is thus comparable to volume&#xD;
      controlled ventilation (VCV). The actively controlled, constant flow during expiration is&#xD;
      unique. FCV is known to minimize dissipated energy to the lung [ref] and is therefore&#xD;
      supposed to aid in lung protective ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VICAR study is designed as a prospective single cohort crossover trial. The intervention&#xD;
      consists of a sequence of respiratory modes: baseline pressure controlled ventilation (PCV)&#xD;
      during 5 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of FCV with an evone respirator (Ventinova Medical&#xD;
      B.V., Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and eventually 30 minutes of VCV. Every participant will&#xD;
      receive the intervention. Respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and&#xD;
      inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2) will be held constant. According to the manufacturers&#xD;
      guidelines, an I:E ratio of 1:1 will be pursued during FCV. During FCV, the respirator will&#xD;
      be set with the same PIP as during baseline PCV. For VCV, the same tidal volume as during&#xD;
      baseline PCV will be set.&#xD;
