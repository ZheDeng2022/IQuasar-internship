  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare the SARS-CoV-2 incidence 7 days after having been screened&#xD;
      negative, between two groups of adults randomized to either go to a concert or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened via a rapid saliva test a few hours before the show. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that attending a standing concert in respect of safety precaution doesn't&#xD;
      increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

      Context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous Spanish randomized study in November 2020 concluded in a non superiority of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 incidence in RT-PCR-negative participant of a concert compared to a control group.&#xD;
      In the same way, investigators want to compare the SARS-CoV-2 incidence of participants of a&#xD;
      concert 7 days after the show with a control group, using a saliva test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While naso-pharyngeal RT-CPR is the gold-standard for virological SARS-COV-2 tests, this&#xD;
      method can be painful and results take time. Saliva rapid tests have satisfactory diagnostic&#xD;
      performances and easy access to results. Saliva rapid tests may lead to mass screening in&#xD;
      cultural mass events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has the specific feature to be set in closed concert hall with limited size&#xD;
      attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experimental monocentric randomized non-inferiority will compare 2 parallel groups (with&#xD;
      single blind for the screening tests results). The randomization will be centralised and&#xD;
      stratified on the age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed via an information notice and a preselection screening&#xD;
      questionnaire on the internet. Eligible participants will have to come on the day of the show&#xD;
      near the concert place to be included (after information and signing of the consent form).&#xD;
      participants will receive a saliva sample tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positively screened participants will have to go home. The others will be randomized in two&#xD;
      groups. Participants will both have to come back 7 days after for the second screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concert place have a strong fan base to recruit participants from. To include all the&#xD;
      participants, two concerts will take place, separated by a few days. Participants will&#xD;
      receive goodies to maximize the chance of them attending to both screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project received a methodological support from the Clinical and Epidemiological Research&#xD;
      Unit of the Montpellier Hospital and is promoted by the Montpellier Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sys2diag and SkillCell which developed the screening tests are involved as well as VOGO for&#xD;
      the technical part and data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is financially helped by Région Occitanie, Montpellier Métropole,&#xD;
      Saint-Jean-de-Vedas, SACEM, APEM, Tout à Fond and Boomerang.&#xD;
