  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of rapid antigen testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the investigators plan to conduct a large trial to assess the&#xD;
      impact of using rapid tests to screen people before participating at a mass gathering event,&#xD;
      i.e. a music concert. Among participants who wish to attend and fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, half will be offered access to rapid testing and concert (provided the test is&#xD;
      negative), and the other half will not. Allocation will be by randomisation. A week after the&#xD;
      concert both groups will be tested by means of a standard PCR-test.&#xD;

      To investigate the impact of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing on the incidence of COVID-19,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to conduct a large trial to assess the impact of using rapid tests to&#xD;
      screen people before participating a mass gathering event, i.e. a music concert. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that screening by means of rapid testing eliminates any increase in risk of&#xD;
      COVID-19 from attending a mass gathering event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit Individuals aged 18-45 years, who wish to attend a specific&#xD;
      concert, have not received vaccination or had Covid-19 in the past six months, and are not in&#xD;
      any risk group for severe disease. At recruitment, all participants (both concert and&#xD;
      no-concert groups) will sign a consent form where they commit to using a contact tracing app,&#xD;
      and to allowing the research group to use their data in the Norwegian Emergency Preparedness&#xD;
      Register (BEREDT C19). They will also consent to having a COVID-19-test (PCR) conducted 6-8&#xD;
      days after the concert date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placing their payment, they will be randomised to be given access to a music concert&#xD;
      (concert group), or not (no-concert group). Those who are randomised to the concert group&#xD;
      will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a rapid antigen test, shortly before the concert. Those&#xD;
      who test positive will be excluded from attending the concert and will immediately be offered&#xD;
      a PCR-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed to stay at home if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or are&#xD;
      in quarantine. Participants who have symptoms or are quarantined at the time of the follow-up&#xD;
      test will be offered a test through home visit by a mobile clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection control measures will be applied to all concert participants in line with standards&#xD;
      established by the sector, e.g. hand hygiene measures and a logistical system that seeks to&#xD;
      minimise the risk of transmission during entry to the arena and exit after the concert&#xD;
