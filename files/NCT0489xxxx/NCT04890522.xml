  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of distant metastasis is a key challenge for nasopharyngeal carcinoma because&#xD;
      of poor outcomes, among which, chemotherapy is the cornerstone. However, many studies&#xD;
      reported the use of different chemotherapy regimens to prolong the survival of metastatic&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, while few of them focused on how to reduce the side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy or improve the life quality of patients. Blocking the immune checkpoint is one&#xD;
      of the effective strategies of tumor immunotherapy. Thus, we sought to find a proper&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen combined with PD-1 antibody JS001.&#xD;
