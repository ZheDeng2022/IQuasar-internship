      This is an interventional, single arm, open-label, feasibility trial with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, followed by concomitant proton therapy and capecitabine, followed by&#xD;

      This is an interventional, single arm, open label, feasibility trial of preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy + concomitant chemo-proton therapy followed by surgery (when feasible) for&#xD;
      patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Aim of this study is to test referral&#xD;
      and enrollment procedures as well as technical feasibility. Proton therapy will be delivered&#xD;
      in MedAustron, which is a stand alone facility. Pancreatic cancer patients are typically&#xD;
      complex cases that require multidisciplinary care. Moreover delivery of high dose of proton&#xD;
      therapy to large volumes including the upper abdomen lymphnodes and pancreatic neural plexus&#xD;
      is technically challenging, therefore a feasibility study is deemed necessary. Following this&#xD;
      study, a larger study will be performed aiming to confirm the ability of preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy + concomitant chemo-proton therapy to improve resectability and ultimately&#xD;
      outcome of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer without increase in toxicity.&#xD;
