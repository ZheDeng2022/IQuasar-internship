    <textblock>
      Contrasting hypotheses, including that of a protective role of nicotine, have been generated&#xD;
      concerning the association between smoking and the occurrence of COVID-19 infection. The&#xD;
      question has attracted a lively scientific and public debate. However, the studies conducted&#xD;
      so far are based on clinical samples, with a majority of hospital case series, thus most&#xD;
      likely suffering from bias due to selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct an analysis of the potential causal association between&#xD;
      smoking or the use of the Swedish smokeless tobacco snus and the occurrence of COVID-19 using&#xD;
      data from a newly identified retrospective cohort in Sweden. Information on tobacco use will&#xD;
      be extracted by public dental clinic records in Stockholm Region between October 2015 and&#xD;
      January 2020. Information on diagnoses of COVID-19 will be obtained through record linkage&#xD;
      with health care registers of inpatient and outpatient care during the period February&#xD;
      2020-August 2021. Socio-demographic information will be accrued from the register of the&#xD;
      total population in Stockholm Region (Statistics Sweden). The risk of COVID-19 for tobacco&#xD;
      users compared to non-tobacco users will be calculated as measure of association adjusting&#xD;
      for potential confounders.&#xD;

      Background The role of tobacco use in the incidence and in the prognosis of the Severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome-Cov2 disease (COVID-19 pandemic) has raised much international interest,&#xD;
      due to contrasting findings reported so far in the scientific literature. On one side smoking&#xD;
      may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in clinically overt COVID-19 requiring hospital&#xD;
      admission. Several cross-sectional studies (case series) indicated a higher risk of negative&#xD;
      disease progression among smokers compared to non-smokers in cases hospitalized with severe&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease (Guan et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020, Zhang et al 2020). On the other&#xD;
      side, studies also suggest also that smoking is associated with a decreased risk of hospital&#xD;
      admission with a diagnosis of COVID-19, or a decreased risk of occurrence of the disease in&#xD;
      the community. These studies have noted 4 to 5 times lower proportions of smokers among&#xD;
      patients hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with the underlying source population (Dreher et&#xD;
      al. 2020, Rossato et al. 2020). A metanalysis of hospital case series (Farsalinos et al.&#xD;
      2020) confirmed this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the public health importance of tobacco use as a risk factor for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, it is urgent to provide both the scientific and the broad lay community with sound&#xD;
      information from large population studies, something that the World Health Organization has&#xD;
      also recommended (https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/smoking-and-covid-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The present study aims to elucidate the potential causal association between tobacco use&#xD;
      (smoking and snus) and COVID-19 using a population-based cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In Sweden, the public dental clinics collect information at each visit on lifestyle&#xD;
      and co-morbidities with relevance for oral health (health declaration), with a uniform&#xD;
      instrument in use from October 2015. Smoking and snus use are ascertained as past use,&#xD;
      current use and categories of intensity of current use. During February 2020 the usual&#xD;
      routine activity of the clinics was disrupted by the pandemic, and the so-called oral health&#xD;
      check-up was discontinued. About 450 000 adult clients of the public dentistry in Stockholm&#xD;
      Region were identified in the period October 2015 to January 2020. Among these about 120000&#xD;
      were assessed within 7 months from the onset of the pandemic, therefore represent recent&#xD;
      experiences. The investigators expect about 9% to be smokers and about 11% to be snus users.&#xD;
      With the help of the national personal numbers assigned to every resident in Sweden at birth&#xD;
      or at immigration, the investigators will link the reports of smoking among these clients&#xD;
      with diagnoses of COVID-19 and other comorbidities registered in the regional database of&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient health care. The information in the dental clinic registers will be&#xD;
      linked to the total population of the region of Stockholm, in order to extract&#xD;
      socio-demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan The investigators will examine the role of tobacco use on the risk&#xD;
      of the following events: any diagnosis of COVID-19, hospitalization, receiving intensive&#xD;
      care, and death because of COVID-19 using generalized linear models, with and without&#xD;
      possible confounders (age, gender, country of birth, type of employment, education and&#xD;
      cohabitation), and within subgroups to identify potential effect modification (age group,&#xD;
      gender [in analyses of snus use], assumed infection risk associated to occupation, pandemic&#xD;
      period, and strategies of virologic testing, very restricted in the first 3 months, available&#xD;
      on individual request thereafter).&#xD;
