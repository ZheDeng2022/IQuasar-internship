  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a structured 12-week program designed for&#xD;
      older adults will improve physical function and, in parallel, circulating biomarkers of aging&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in repeated chair rise time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study, approximately 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Chair stand test where participants will perform a chair rise movement for five repetitions. The series of 5 repetitions will be timed and measured in seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in plasma protein levels reflective of biological age</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks. The concentration of target proteins (pg/mL) in the plasma will be measured and compared between baseline and week 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in expression of senescence-related genes in blood cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks. The expression of senescence-related genes (arbitrary units) will be measured in immune cells isolated from whole blood and compared between baseline and week 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Physical Component Scale (PCS) from the 12-Item short form general health survey (SF-12).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Performance-based Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the timed up-and-go test (seconds to complete).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mental Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Mental Component Scale (MCS) from the 12-Item short form general health survey (SF-12)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-assessment of well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a linear analogue self-assessment scale of well-being from 0 (&quot;as bad as it can be&quot;) to 10 (&quot;as good as it can be&quot;) of mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, level of social activity, and overall quality of life during the past week</description>
