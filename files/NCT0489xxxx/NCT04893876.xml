  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in rectal cancer management have significantly reduced morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      most commonly performed operation for rectal cancer is restorative proctectomy (RP), leaving&#xD;
      up to 70% with long-term bowel dysfunction called Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS).&#xD;
      LARS manifests as stool frequency, incontinence and difficult defecation. LARS, along with&#xD;
      other functional impairments such as sexual and urinary dysfunction (SUD), can impact quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) and cause emotional distress. High-quality longitudinal data on these sequalae&#xD;
      are lacking, leading to variable estimates of their prevalence, risk factors and prognosis.&#xD;
      Most studies are European, cross-sectional, lack pre-treatment evaluation and long-term&#xD;
      follow-up, and use inconsistent assessment measures. Thus, a North American study that&#xD;
      evaluates patients longitudinally from diagnosis will provide quality data to fill this&#xD;
      knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the proposed study is to contribute evidence regarding the impact of LARS,&#xD;
      SUD, emotional/financial distress, and patient activation on long-term post-treatment QoL in&#xD;
      North American rectal cancer after RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter North American, observational, prospective cohort study relies on validated&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at diagnosis, during and post-treatment. Patients&#xD;
      from 20 sites will be recruited over 2 years and followed for 3 years. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is QoL as measured by the European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer QoL&#xD;
      questionnaire. We anticipate accrual of 1200 patients. Factors associated with QoL will be&#xD;
      explored. Impact of patient activation in relation to functional outcomes on QoL over time&#xD;
      will be explored using a difference-in-differences approach. The study involves a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team who will provide expertise in research methodology, nursing, oncology&#xD;
      and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main contributions of this study are 1) provision of reference baseline North American&#xD;
      values for important rectal cancer PROMs for clinical and research use, 2) an understanding&#xD;
      of the evolution of functional outcomes and QoL post-treatment to counsel patients&#xD;
      peri-operatively and throughout survivorship, and 3) to provide the basis for future tailored&#xD;
      programs to support rectal cancer survivors.&#xD;

      Advances in rectal cancer management have significantly reduced morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      most commonly performed operation for rectal cancer is restorative proctectomy (RP), leaving&#xD;
      up to 70% with long-term bowel dysfunction called Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS).&#xD;
      LARS manifests as stool frequency, incontinence and difficult defecation. LARS, along with&#xD;
      other functional impairments such as sexual and urinary dysfunction (SUD), can impact quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) and cause emotional distress. There is no well-established treatment strategy&#xD;
      for LARS or SUD. High-quality longitudinal data on these sequalae are lacking, leading to&#xD;
      variable estimates of their prevalence, risk factors and prognosis. Most studies are&#xD;
      European, cross-sectional, lack pre-treatment evaluation and long-term follow-up, and use&#xD;
      inconsistent assessment measures. Thus, a North American study that evaluates patients&#xD;
      longitudinally from diagnosis will provide quality data to fill this knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the proposed study is to contribute evidence regarding the impact of LARS,&#xD;
      SUD, emotional/financial distress, and patient activation on long-term post-treatment QoL in&#xD;
      North American rectal cancer after RP. This study aims to address the following research&#xD;
      questions: 1): How do North American rectal cancer patients who underwent RP experience&#xD;
      changes in function (bowel, sexual and urinary), distress (emotional and financial) and QoL&#xD;
      after RP from baseline through early and late timepoints following treatment? 2): How do&#xD;
      patient-, disease-, treatment-, functional- and distress-related factors predict QoL at&#xD;
      baseline and at early and late timepoints post-treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter North American, observational, prospective cohort study relies on validated&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at diagnosis, during and post-treatment. Patients&#xD;
      from 20 sites will be recruited over 2 years and followed for 3 years. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is QoL as measured by the European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer QoL&#xD;
      questionnaire. We anticipate accrual of 1200 patients. Estimating a 30% attrition rate, in&#xD;
      1000 different simulated datasets and α=0.05, we will be able to detect a 1 point difference&#xD;
      in QoL 88% of the time (95%CI: 85.8, 90.0). Given that a 10-point difference is considered&#xD;
      clinically significant, this sample size affords good precision. 1) QoL, LARS, SUD,&#xD;
      emotional/financial distress will be measured at baseline, early (12 &amp; 18 months) and late (2&#xD;
      &amp; 3 years) timepoints. 2) Changes over time for each outcome will be studied using linear&#xD;
      mixed models (LMM) and generalized LMM as appropriate to account for the hierarchical and&#xD;
      longitudinal structure of the data. 3) Factors associated with QoL will be explored using&#xD;
      LMM. 4) Impact of patient activation in relation to functional outcomes on QoL over time will&#xD;
      be explored using a difference-in-differences approach. The study involves a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team who will provide expertise in research methodology, nursing, oncology&#xD;
      and surgery.&#xD;
