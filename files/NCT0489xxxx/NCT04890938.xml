  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition affecting 1 in 6 Canadians&#xD;
      and does not have a cure. Flare-ups of COPD are the most common reason someone goes to&#xD;
      hospital in Canada. This is made worse because within 30-days of having a flare-up, 1 in 5&#xD;
      patients will come back to hospital for the same problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flare-ups of COPD often have many causes and these are different person to person. Sometimes&#xD;
      it is related to behaviours such as smoking or not using medicines properly. Other times, it&#xD;
      is from lung inflammation. Education programs that help people learn about their disease and&#xD;
      maintain healthy behaviours, and using phlegm to decide on which medicines will be useful,&#xD;
      have been studied separately and appear to work, but many people still have flare-ups. To&#xD;
      help fix this problem, we need to look carefully at each patient, to make sure they are on&#xD;
      the right medicine but also have the right behaviours and support to benefit from medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to see if patients who are taught the right behaviours and have&#xD;
      their lung inflammation controlled with the right medicines will have fewer COPD flare-ups&#xD;
      than those who get normal care.&#xD;

      STRIVE is a randomized-controlled trial comparing a two-pronged intervention, including&#xD;
      sputum-biomarker-directed treatment of airway inflammation, and comprehensive care&#xD;
      management, to standard care, for COPD patients with frequent exacerbation from two sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of 6-months of comprehensive care management (CCM) and sputum&#xD;
      biomarker-directed treatment of airway inflammation, including hospital and clinic visits.&#xD;
      Cinic visits will occur at 2, 6 and 16 weeks after hospital discharge. For the intervention&#xD;
      group, the key elements of CCM will be provided, including case management, self-management&#xD;
      education, and coordination of community/hospital resources (1). Spontaneous sputum&#xD;
      biomarkers will be used to direct therapy at the time of AECOPD and during clinic visits&#xD;
      after hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of 6-months of CCM and sputum biomarker-directed treatment of airway inflammation, including hospital and clinic visits. Clinic visits at 2, 6, and 16 weeks. The key elements of CCM will be provided, including case management, self-management education, and coordination of community/hospital resources (1). Clinic nurse will review inhaler technique with the patient. Sputum (spontaneous) biomarkers will be measured with results used to direct therapy at the time of AECOPD and during clinic visits after hospital discharge, at both sites.</description>

    <description>This group will also receive clinic visits at 2, 6, and 16 weeks with a study physician, and also education material, inhaler technique assessment and education, and case management from the clinic personnel. The study physician will pursue further investigation and/or further intervention if they see fit, including an inhaler regimen following the Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines (2).</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Combination Product</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Sputum-guided management and comprehensive care management</intervention_name>
    <description>Those in the intervention group will have their treatment determined by the presence and type of airway inflammation whether during AECOPD or as part of clinic optimization. Corticosteroids are given for airway eosinophilia (sputum eosinophils &gt;3%), and antibiotics for airway neutrophilia (sputum neutrophils ≥65% and total cells &gt;10 million cells/gram) or a positive sputum culture. Specialized stains to identify aspiration (Oil Red O; (3)) and left ventricular dysfunction (Perl's Prussian blue; (4)) will guide swallowing assessment and cardiac work-up, respectively. If a sputum sample is not produced as an outpatient spontaneously, then sputum induction will be pursued 8 weeks after discharge. If there are no sputum samples to guide inhaler regimen, then it will be determined by the study physician guided by the Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines (2) if a sputum-guided regimen has not already been established.</description>
