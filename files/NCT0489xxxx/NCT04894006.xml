  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test a 3-month, community health worker (CHW) delivered home visit,&#xD;
      culturally and language-appropriate intervention for ethnic and underserved dementia family&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) using wearable technology for real time monitoring&#xD;
      of caregivers' stress and sleep. The CHW delivered home visit intervention includes stress&#xD;
      reduction techniques by mindful deep breathing and compassionate support/listening and&#xD;
      caregiving education to improve caregiver's health, wellbeing, and positive interactions with&#xD;
      the PWD. This dementia caregiver study using wearable technology has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly lessen health disparities in dementia care, assisting underserved ethnic&#xD;
      dementia caregivers in self-management and increasing their quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's dementia, a disease with no effective&#xD;
      treatment and no cure. Two-thirds of the caregivers for persons with dementia (PWD) are women&#xD;
      (most often family) and a third are themselves over 65. Dementia takes a significant toll on&#xD;
      caregivers, often resulting in chronic stress, depression, sleep disorders, poor health&#xD;
      related quality of life (HRQOL), and early mortality due 24/7 care responsibility for PWD.&#xD;
      Research has shown significant barriers to dementia care for underserved populations,&#xD;
      including Latinos and Asian minorities. Underserved family caregivers for PWD tend to&#xD;
      underutilize public health services available, and do not seek treatment until the situation&#xD;
      is unmanageable with current resources reporting barriers that included language, time, and&#xD;
      finances. Monitoring the caregiver's health and wellbeing is important as well as their&#xD;
      maintaining a positive interaction with the PWD. Thus, there is a need for an innovative and&#xD;
      feasible intervention to improve underserved caregiver's mental and physical health. Little&#xD;
      research is reported for dementia caregiver interventions in underserved minorities and one&#xD;
      given at home by community health workers (CHWs). The proposed intervention meets the needs&#xD;
      of these family caregivers in developing a positive relationship with the PWD by educating&#xD;
      caregivers to better understand the PWD's behaviors. Another component of the intervention is&#xD;
      stress reduction techniques, including mindful breathing and compassionate support/listening&#xD;
      to reduce depression and improve family relationships making the caregiving less burdensome.&#xD;
      By monitoring the physiological responses of stress (i.e. heart rate variability), sleep and&#xD;
      activity, we can objectively measure changes as a result of the intervention. Using Wearable&#xD;
      Internet of Things (WIoT) technology, a combination of Watch/ring-Smartphone-Cloud, has&#xD;
      proven to be a significant method of monitoring behavioral and physiological measures&#xD;
      providing evidence of change over time uniquely associated with this intervention. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data show that the intervention with WIoT brought to the caregiver by CHW home&#xD;
      visitors was acceptable to ethnic caregivers (Latino, Vietnamese, and Korean) and effective&#xD;
      in reducing caregiver stress and burden over the short term. With the addition of&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Whites, the proposed caregiver-centered, culturally/language appropriate, CHW&#xD;
      home-visit-based 3-month intervention has 3 parts:1) stress reduction by mindful breathing&#xD;
      and compassionate support/ listening to improve caregiver's health and well-being; 2)&#xD;
      education on caregiving skills to improve responses to the PWD and their behaviors; 3) WIoT&#xD;
      physiological and behavioral monitoring. This randomized controlled trial will compare&#xD;
      outcomes (burden, depression, self-efficacy, HRQOL, stress, sleep, PWD behaviors) between the&#xD;
      intervention, attention control with use of WIoT only, and usual care groups at baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, and 6 months. This intervention using the CHW-model and WIOT technology has the&#xD;
      potential to lessen health disparities in dementia caregiving in underserved family&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

    <description>The caregiver-centered, culturally and language specific home visit intervention with wearable devices (smartwatch/ring) will be delivered by trained bilingual community health workers (CHW) for Latino, Vietnamese, Korean, non-Hispanic White caregivers of PWD. The home visit intervention components will include (1) stress reduction techniques; mindful breathing and compassionate support/listening and (2) weekly education on dementia caregiving skills to handle difficult behaviors of PWD and knowledge of resources available for dementia care. The duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks that include 6 home visits (4 times for the first month and then once a month for two months) carried out in the participant's home. The on-site home visit intervention delivered by CHWs will focus on stress reduction techniques and caregiving skills education for 4 weeks and two monthly caregiver-driven topics for the following two sessions.</description>

Caregivers will also receive resource information regarding Alzheimer's association and local social service information. CHWs will contact them monthly via phone for 6 months asking about the WIoT technology and answering general questions from participants. CHW will also visit participants' home at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months to administer survey assessments.</description>

The education of dementia caregiving skills will include (1) understanding about Alzheimer's and dementias, (2) appropriate communication skills with PWD, (3) daily activities for or with PWD together (e.g., puzzles, writing, reading, singing, taking a walk, etc), and (4) care resources including support groups, adult day centers, or other dementia related social services (legal and financial matters). For stress reduction techniques to be effective, the investigators have installed an app on the smartwatch to remind them to practice mindful breathing exercises two times a day and when needed.</description>
