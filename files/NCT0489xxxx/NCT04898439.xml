  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate the health effects of making schools greener and more&#xD;
      biodiverse. We will mainly focus on cognitive effects, well-being, and BMI. The research&#xD;
      hypothesis is that greening schools positively influences the health of children through more&#xD;
      exercise and cleaner air.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spending time in nature has been associated with improved physical and mental health and&#xD;
      well-being. Developing nature-based health-promoting interventions such as providing more&#xD;
      nature in schools to improve children's well-being will lead to benefits for society in our&#xD;
      rapidly urbanizing world. Although the benefits of exposure to nature have been demonstrated,&#xD;
      knowledge of integrating exposure to nature into public health guidelines is scarce. The&#xD;
      latter requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the impact of nature-based&#xD;
      interventions both on health and on the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Little is known&#xD;
      about the health effect of greening and, in particular, increasing biodiversity in schools&#xD;
      and we want to investigate further with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project, therefore, aims to investigate the health effects of greening primary schools&#xD;
      and increasing biodiversity and will mainly focus on the effects on cognition, well-being,&#xD;
      and BMI. For this, all children from 4th to 6th grade in the participating schools will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study (Belgium). This study comprises control schools and&#xD;
      intervention schools, the schools are examined before the greening and after the greening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the informed consent form is signed by the parents, they complete a questionnaire that&#xD;
      assesses the child's diet, physical activity, and general questions. A urine sample will be&#xD;
      taken for the determination of black carbon particles. The child will also perform computer&#xD;
      tests measuring different aspects of &quot;cognition&quot;. During these tests, we will also look at&#xD;
      the eye movements that play an important role in the cognitive ability of the child. To get&#xD;
      an idea of a possible effect on BMI, height and weight will be measured. The child fills in a&#xD;
      welfare questionnaire and a questionnaire about the perception of nature itself.&#xD;

    <description>We measure the cognitive function of children by means of a battery of tests including: stroop test, Continuous Performance, digit span, digit signal and digit selection. We combine the computer tests with eye tracking to provide information about saccadic gain during the tests. The computer tests provide data on how much time per reaction (msec) was needed or how many digits could be remembered.</description>
