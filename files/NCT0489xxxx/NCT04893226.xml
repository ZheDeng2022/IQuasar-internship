  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel two-arm clinical trial design to study the efficacy of&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding on metabolic risk in postmenopausal women, who may be particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable to disruption of circadian eating rhythms and the associated metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. It is hypothesized that time-restricted feeding will improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance, body weight, and other metabolic parameters in&#xD;
      metabolically-unhealthy postmenopausal women.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, parallel two-arm clinical trial design to study the efficacy of&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding (TRF) on metabolic risk in postmenopausal women. Data will be&#xD;
      collected for 18 weeks. Baseline food timing, activity/sleep, and metabolic parameter (OGTT,&#xD;
      body composition, anthropometric measurements, lipid panel, inflammatory markers) data will&#xD;
      be collected in the first two weeks (baseline). Subjects will then be randomized to the TRF&#xD;
      intervention or no TRF for 16 weeks. Subjects in the TRF group will be educated about the&#xD;
      health benefits of TRF. Then each subject in the TRF group will self-select a 10-h window and&#xD;
      consume all daily calories during this time frame. Subjects in both the TRF and no TRF groups&#xD;
      will text the time of their first and last daily meals for the duration of the study. At the&#xD;
      end of the 16-week TRF intervention or no TRF, metabolic and anthropometric measurements will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
