  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study for the Safety Run-in Cohorts is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of magrolimab in combination with other anticancer therapies and to&#xD;
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of magrolimab in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) for the following combinations: magrolimab +&#xD;
      daratumumab, magrolimab + pomalidomide + dexamethasone, and magrolimab + bortezomib +&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study for the Dose Expansion Cohorts is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of magrolimab in combination with other anticancer therapies in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as determined by objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;

             year. Other exceptions may be considered with sponsor approval. Previous hormonal&#xD;
             therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for prostate cancer and&#xD;
             treatment with bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand&#xD;

                  who test positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) will require HBV DNA&#xD;
