      This study compares the actual standard of care of intubation in Swiss pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care units vs the use of apneic oxygenation using either high flow or low flow oxygen to&#xD;
      prevent hypoxemia and to prolong apnea time during intubation of critically ill children,&#xD;
      with the final aim to improve airway management safety at PICUs. Primary study objective: To&#xD;
      demonstrate that airway management supported by oxygen supplementation (either HFNC or low&#xD;
      flow oxygen) can prevent significant desaturation (SpO2 &gt; 85%) among patients in pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units (PICU) and neonatal intensive care units (NICU).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled multicenter trial in Swiss pediatric ICUs with randomization to 3&#xD;
      groups: 1) standard of care with conventional preoxygenation with bag-mask ventilation vs 2)&#xD;
      conventional preoxygenation with bag-mask ventilation and apneic oxygenation with low-flow&#xD;
      Oxygen fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 100% 0.2 L/kg/min vs 3) conventional preoxygenation&#xD;
      with bag-mask ventilation and apneic oxygenation with THRIVE FiO2 100% 2L/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible children meeting the inclusions criteria will be prepared for oral intubation&#xD;
      according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the respective NICU/PICU. SpO2, heart&#xD;
      rate, invasive or non-invasive blood pressure values shall be recorded continuously (for&#xD;
      invasive continuously and for non-invasive intermittently every 2 minutes and 30 seconds),&#xD;
      once the decision to intubate has been made. The sealed envelope for randomization will then&#xD;
      be opened. All patients must be intubated orally. The induction will be performed according&#xD;
      to the clinical needs of the child. All children will be intubated using the C-MAC&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope with a Miller or Macintosh-blades (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) age&#xD;
      adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before oral intubation preoxygenation is performed for 2 minutes with a facemask usually used&#xD;
      at the study site with an FiO2 of 1.0 and flow rates of 6-10L/min in all groups. After&#xD;
      induction, all patients will be paralyzed with an age appropriate dose of muscle relaxant to&#xD;
      ensure apnoea. The dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent and the depth of the anesthesia&#xD;
      shall be adjusted according to clinical parameters such as absent reactions to jaw thrust and&#xD;
      normocardia. In all groups, after induction, bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen and flow&#xD;
      rates of 6-10 Lmin-1 will be continued for about 45-60 seconds until apnea sets in.&#xD;
      Thereafter bag-mask ventilation will be stopped and one of the three study interventions will&#xD;
      be applied according to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: When apnea sets in, deep laryngoscopy and endotracheal oral intubation are&#xD;
      performed without apneic oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group - high flow: Prior to the introduction of the laryngoscope, apneic&#xD;
      oxygenation is commenced with a high-flow nasal cannula flow rate of 2L/kg/min using OptiFlow&#xD;
      system at an FiO2 of 1.0. After starting THRIVE laryngoscopy and tracheal oral intubation is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group - low flow: Prior to the introduction of the laryngoscope, the&#xD;
      administration of low-flow oxygen (0.2 l/kg/min) will take place via conventional neonatal&#xD;
      nasal cannula (Intersurgical, Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom). After starting low-flow&#xD;
      oxygen laryngoscopy and tracheal oral intubation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chest x-ray, which is a routine procedure, shall be performed at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      procedure to verify the endotracheal tube (ETT) position and rule out a pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study termination criteria constitute successful intubation or the occurrence of a &quot;Can't&#xD;
      Intubate, Can't Oxygenate&quot; emergency. A maximum of 4 intubation attempts in total may be&#xD;
      performed. The last intubation attempt must be performed by the most experienced physician in&#xD;
      the room. Additional devices like stylet, bougie, etc, can be used at any stage of the&#xD;
      intubation process. If the intubation remains unsuccessful the difficult airway algorithm&#xD;
      will be followed and a supraglottic airway device (SAD) device will be inserted. Unsuccessful&#xD;
      intubation requiring a SAD will lead to immediate study termination. Equipment malfunction&#xD;
      (e.g. HFNC, C-MAC VL) will lead to study cessation. In the event of an unexpected difficult&#xD;
      intubation, the difficult airway algorithm will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group - High flow: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen 2L/kg/min using OptiFlow&#xD;
      system by Fisher&amp;Paykel and an oxygen inspiration concentration FiO2 of 1.0; enabling apneic&#xD;
      oxygenation during laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picture showing nasal prongs for high-flow oxygen. Intervention group - Low flow: Low-flow&#xD;
      oxygen (100%, 0.2 l/kg/min) via conventional neonatal nasal cannula (Intersurgical,&#xD;
      Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom) enabling apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally practiced standard of care with preoxygenation with facemask with an FiO2 of&#xD;
      1.0, followed by bag mask ventilation after induction before oral intubation without apneic&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 210 patients, 70 per group. Assuming a desaturation rate of&#xD;
      40% in the control group and a desaturation rate of max 15% with low-flow oxygen and HFNC,&#xD;
      aiming at a power of 80% and setting an alpha-level at 0.025 the investigators would need&#xD;
      n=56 patients per group. Accounting for some drop-outs, they seek to enroll n=70 patients per&#xD;
      group, i.e. a total of n=210 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pilot studies to this protocol and in recent published data a maximum desaturation of 10%&#xD;
      was observed during intubation for both therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in desaturation rate between the 2 intervention groups will be analyzed for&#xD;
      non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a desaturation rate of 85% with HFNC and desaturation rate of 85 % with low-flow&#xD;
      oxygen, aiming at a power of 80% and setting an alpha-level at 0.025 (one-sided&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial), with a non-inferiority limit of 17% the investigators would need n=70&#xD;
      patients per group.&#xD;
