      Is precariousness a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in intensive care units ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the first wave overwhelmed hospitals in Paris&#xD;
      area (Ile-de-France) with a variable impact depending on the territory. Several studies&#xD;
      highlighted variable ICU mortality rates during COVID-19 surges across territories (10 to&#xD;
      60%) with higher rates in those most affected by poverty 20,34,35,36. We assessed the impact&#xD;
      of precariousness, as an independent risk factor, on mortality linked to Covid-19 between&#xD;
      ICUs at Delafontaine hospital and Ambroise Paré hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: we carry out a retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive ICU patients&#xD;
      aged ≥ 18 years admitted at Delafontaine and Ambroise Paré hospitals during the first wave of&#xD;
      the Covid-19 outbreak in order to compare mortality rates according to predefined risk&#xD;
      factors (age, diabetes, arterial hypertension, BMI, active solid or haematological cancer,&#xD;
      IGS2, poverty rate at the threshold of 60% (%) according to the island grouped for&#xD;
      statistical information (IRIS)37 of the patient, invasive ventilation or not) that include&#xD;
      precariousness.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the first health crisis overwhelmed hospitals in Ile de&#xD;
      France with a different impact depending on the territory . According to data on deaths&#xD;
      registered in the civil registry published by the National Institute of Statistics and&#xD;
      Economic Studies (INSEE), Seine-Saint-Denis has recorded the highest excess mortality rate in&#xD;
      Ile-de-France, over the period from 1st March to 19th April. Seine-Saint-Denis has an excess&#xD;
      mortality of over 130%, compared to over 74% in Paris and over 122% in Hauts-de-Seine. By&#xD;
      considering the mortality rates according to the place of residence rather than the place of&#xD;
      death, excess mortality has reached 134% in Seine-Saint-Denis, over 114% in Hauts-de-Seine,&#xD;
      and over 99 % regarding Paris1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seine-Saint-Denis is one of the French department33 most affected by poverty, which is a&#xD;
      factor of vulnerability3-5, and constitutes a risk factor for mortality after hospitalization&#xD;
      in the context of traumatic, cardiovascular or cancer pathologies6-11. In addition,&#xD;
      precarious people have a reduced life expectancy30, but it is not a risk factor for ICU&#xD;
      mortality when considering severity on admission12-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ile-de-France, the mortality rate in intensive care could significantly vary depending on&#xD;
      the territory (10 to 60%)20,34,35,36, reflecting thus the disparities noticed in mortality&#xD;
      from Covid-19. The opensafely study enumerates some of the primary mortality risk factors&#xD;
      from Covid-19 such as age, sex, obesity, smoking, ethnicity, diabetes, solid and&#xD;
      hematological cancers, kidney failure, chronic cardiorespiratory diseases but also&#xD;
      precariousness21 independently and with a dose-response effect, whereas these risk factors&#xD;
      could result from precariousness itself22-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing these risk factors for severe infection with Covid-1921, we assume a link between&#xD;
      precariousness and mortality in intensive care with Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate this hypothesis, we suggest to study two intensive care populations (Ambroise&#xD;
      Paré Boulogne Hospital in the Hauts-de-Seine and Delafontaine Hospital in Seine-Saint-Denis)&#xD;
      from contrasted territories regarding the socio-economic context in Ile de France38. The&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics of Seine-Saint-Denis31 may be one of the reason to explain&#xD;
      this particularity. It is an area densely populated (6,802 inhabitants per km2), just like&#xD;
      Hauts-de-Seine32 (9,164 inhabitants / km2) with households often living in over-occupied&#xD;
      dwellings (21% against 12,8% in Hauts-de-Seine and 5% in France excluding Mayotte). The&#xD;
      socio-professional category of workers is more represented than in the other departments of&#xD;
      Ile-de-France and the population therefore does not necessarily have a job suitable for&#xD;
      teleworking. Hence the fact that precariousness could promote the circulation of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition: the definition of precariousness is complex, multifactorial and non-consensual.&#xD;
      We describe precariousness as &quot;a state of social instability characterized by the absence of&#xD;
      one or more securities, in particular that of employment, allowing individuals and families&#xD;
      to assume their professional, family and social obligations, and to enjoy their fundamental&#xD;
      rights &quot;29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to establish a link between precariousness and mortality in intensive care from&#xD;
      Covid-19, we choose to determine the precariousness of each patient according to the economic&#xD;
      data of the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. It would allow to obtain a&#xD;
      poverty rate (percentage of living below 60% of median income) according to the place of&#xD;
      residence of each one, which we will divide into quintiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: there is a difference in mortality between resuscitation services at Delafontaine&#xD;
      hospital and Ambroise Paré hospital with the underlying idea that precariousness is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for mortality linked to Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan and objectives: we will carry out a retrospective observational cohort&#xD;
      study on analysis of the files of patients hospitalized in intensive care at Delafontaine and&#xD;
      Ambroise Paré hospitals, aiming to compare their mortality according to predefined risk&#xD;
      factors during the first wave of the epidemic at Covid-19 (admission dates between March 13&#xD;
      and May 11, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: all patients hospitalized in intensive care at Delafontaine hospital (12&#xD;
      intensive care beds and 6 CCU beds) and Ambroise Paré hospital (12 intensive care beds and 6&#xD;
      CCU beds) that has developed a Covid-19 pneumonitis confirmed biologically by nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      PCR or on deep respiratory samples (bronchial, tracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage)&#xD;
      or strongly suspected with a compatible CT27 and a very evocative clinical history depending&#xD;
      on the practitioner in charge would be included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: all minor patients under the age of 18 and patients transferred after&#xD;
      less than 24 hours of care in the service would be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study locations: this study concerns the Ambroise Paré hospital in Boulogne and the&#xD;
      Delafontaine hospital in Saint-Denis, whose sectors are different, specifically regarding&#xD;
      precariousness of their surrounding populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data studied: age, diabetes, arterial hypertension, BMI, unhealed solid or&#xD;
           haematological cancer, IGS2, poverty rate at the threshold of 60% (%) according to the&#xD;
           island grouped for statistical information (IRIS) 37 of the patient, invasive&#xD;
           ventilation or not, date of start of invasive ventilation, date of end of ventilation,&#xD;
           NIV or high flow oxygen therapy at initial treatment, prone position, curarization,&#xD;
           placement of ECMO, introduction of corticosteroid therapy within 7 first days of&#xD;
           hospitalization, date of entry (defined as D0), date of discharge from intensive care&#xD;
           (death or conventional discharge), date of discharge from hospital, death and date of&#xD;
           death if it occurred in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients transferred to another intensive care unit after the first 24 hours for&#xD;
                specific treatment or discharge from the service will be included and their data&#xD;
                recovered by the recovery of hospitalization reports&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients discharged from the hospital for a rehabilitation center or another long&#xD;
                stay are considered alive for the study and will not have follow-up after&#xD;
                resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data to compare the workload related to Covid on the two hospitals will be collected in&#xD;
           order to discuss the results obtained (see table below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Average number of Covid patients present each day in each hospital during the&#xD;
                period (Average patients / days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of usual conventional hospital beds (permanently open which can admit&#xD;
                patient urgently and / or whose length of stay is not under control)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of resuscitation beds and usual CCUs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Average number of Covid patients present each day in each intensive care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total number of patients transferred to an intensive care unit in another hospital&#xD;
                over the period within the first 24 hours of care by the intensive care team&#xD;
                Primary endpoint: mortality in intensive care at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary judgment criteria: mortality at 90 days in hospital, length of hospital stay in&#xD;
      intensive care unit, length of hospital stay in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  univariate comparison of risk factors in the 2 groups (Chi2 / Student)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multivariate analysis on variables whose frequency varies in the 2 groups (logistic&#xD;
           regression test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of observed outcome, discussed after having identified side effect resulting from&#xD;
      the differences between intensive care units of two hospitals, which could be a compounding&#xD;
      factors during patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main compounding factors would be the workload on the hospital and the specific initial&#xD;
      treatments in the lack of data from the literature at this stage of the pandemic.&#xD;
