  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ Motor Neurone Disease (ALS/MND) is a rare and invariably fatal&#xD;
      neurological disease. ALS/MND has a terribly high burden on patients, family and carers, and&#xD;
      carries great socioeconomic burden. Current best treatment options are expensive and attempt&#xD;
      to control disease progression and manage symptoms while offering no cure. Better treatments&#xD;
      are wanting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monepantel is a well-known veterinary drug, registered as a livestock wormicide in 39&#xD;
      countries. The industry collaborator, PharmAust Ltd, has found that monepantel shows&#xD;
      off-target activity, inhibiting a cellular signaling system controlled by mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR). This stops cancer growth and reduces protein accumulation in diseased&#xD;
      cells. PharmAust has already tested monepantel in humans and pet dogs in Phase I and II&#xD;
      anti-cancer clinical trials, respectively, in Australia. Data from these trials show that&#xD;
      monepantel treatment associates with an exceptionally high safety profile, mTOR signaling&#xD;
      inhibition and anticancer activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal protein accumulation within motor neurons of the brain associates with the cause of&#xD;
      ALS/MND. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway slows disease progression in certain&#xD;
      preclinical models of ALS/MND and is suggested to provide synergy with the ALS/MND&#xD;
      standard-of-care drug, riluzole. An alternative mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, is currently the&#xD;
      subject of an ALS/MND clinical trial in humans investigating control of disease progression.&#xD;
      Monepantel has a different structure to rapamycin and an apparently better safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I Clinical Trial hypothesis is that monepantel administration to individuals&#xD;
      living with ALS/MND will safely reduce disease associated protein accumulation in motor&#xD;
      neurons and provide therapeutic benefit. To test this hypothesis, the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of oral monepantel administration and markers of efficacy will be tested in individuals&#xD;
      living with ALS/MND in a dose escalating Phase I/II Clinical Trial. To mitigate risk, only&#xD;
      patients with sporadic and certain known familial types of ALS will be eligible. To further&#xD;
      mitigate risk, the monepantel starting dose will be reduced a calculated five-fold compared&#xD;
      to that already used in human cancer patients and already demonstrated to be safe and&#xD;
      effective as an mTOR inhibitor. Dependent upon incremental outcomes, three higher doses may&#xD;
      then be tested, each for minimally 28 days with a duration at the optimal dose of at least&#xD;
      six months.&#xD;

    <description>The ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) is a validated rating instrument for monitoring the progression of disability in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Measurements include: (1) speech (2) salivation (3) swallowing (4) handwriting (5) cutting food and handling utensils (with or without gastrostomy) (6) dressing and hygiene (7) turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes (8) walking (9) climbing stairs and (10) breathing. Possible scores range from 0 (normal function) to 4 (severe loss of function). Change = (Week 4 score - Baseline score)</description>

    <description>The ECAS-cognitive screen is a validated screen comprises 16 items organized into two sub-scales. An ALS-specific sub-scale taps into the cognitive domains of language, verbal fluency, and executive and social functions.
