  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In AI patients, adhesion still remains the first option in order to achieve an early,&#xD;
      minimally invasive intervention, and the altered enamel still represents an acceptable&#xD;
      substrate for bonding in some AI variants. Many cases have revealed that the direct composite&#xD;
      restorations provide satisfactory esthetic and functionality in restoring AI-affected teeth.&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of composite&#xD;
      restorations in posterior teeth in patients afflicted with Amelogenesis Imperfecta using&#xD;
      nanohybrid and nanofill composite materials&#xD;

    <measure>Number of failed restorations evaluated according to the modified USPSH criteria in patients with occlusal restorations.</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In restorations, retention rate, color match, wear or loss of anatomic form, marginal discoloration, caries, marginal adaptation, and surface texture were scored success or failure according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. According to this criteria, success restorations received Alfa (A) or Bravo (B) scores. Alfa (A) represents the ideal clinical situation; Bravo (B) is the clinically acceptable. Failed restorations received Charlie (C) or Delta (D) scores. Charlie (C) is the clinically unacceptable situations where the restorations had to be replaced; Delta (D) is the situation where the restoration is fractured, mobile or missing and needed to be replaced immediately.</description>

             molars and premolars,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AI diagnosis had to be made, which had to be verified clinically, and also confirmed&#xD;
             by anamnestic family history, or clinical examination concerning Witkop's&#xD;
             classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
