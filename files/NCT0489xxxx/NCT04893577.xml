      This will be a randomized, efficacy assessor-blinded, parallel group, pilot study of up to 20&#xD;
      subjects with documented herpes labialis. Patients will be treated with the study drug, EDTA&#xD;
      Eye Drops or the active comparator of Abreva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be assessed during a screening visit that must take place no greater&#xD;
      than 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 (Baseline) visit. During the screening period, subjects that&#xD;
      meet all other entry criteria will undergo UV susceptibility testing to determine their&#xD;
      individual MED (minimal erythemal dose). UV susceptibility testing takes place over two days&#xD;
      with exposure to UV light on specified regions on the subject's back followed by an&#xD;
      assessment of the exposed areas 24 hours later to identify the MED. Subjects who have a&#xD;
      measurable MED will be allowed to enroll in the study. Each subject will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either EED or Comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who express a cold sore will track the lesion with a diary card to rate their pain&#xD;
      levels, and any unusual symptoms at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 10. Patients may also&#xD;
      take photographs of the lesion throughout the study.&#xD;

      1.1 Background and Rationale Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are common and can cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity both at the time of the original infection and when recurrences occur.&#xD;
      There are two types of HSV - HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1, the most common cause of oral &quot;cold&#xD;
      sores,&quot; is transmitted mainly by oral-to-oral contact. Genital herpes is usually caused by&#xD;
      HSV-2, although HSV-1 can also cause genital breakouts. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are&#xD;
      lifelong, with the virus living in the ganglia of nerves that supply the area of the original&#xD;
      infection and recurring sporadically in the same area of that nerve's innervation. Most&#xD;
      infections and recurrences are asymptomatic, but infectious viral shedding can occur.&#xD;
      Patients who are not asymptomatic can develop prodromes of tingling, pain or paresthesia, and&#xD;
      eventually blisters and ulcerations with pain. Healing generally occurs within 10 to 19 days&#xD;
      after onset in primary infection or within 5 to 10 days in recurrent infection. Lesions&#xD;
      usually heal completely, but recurrent lesions at the same site may cause atrophy and&#xD;
      scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to WHO, in 2012 an estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) had HSV-1&#xD;
      infection globally. Some patients have predictable outbreaks after exposure to noxious&#xD;
      stimuli, such as sunlight fever, menstruation, or stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found that calcium signaling is involved in the translocation of the virus&#xD;
      from the ganglia to the eruption site. It has been found that an increase of calcium levels&#xD;
      in the extracellular matrix will precipitate the calcium signaling events that are causal to&#xD;
      the migration of the HSV virus from the proximal ganglia to the eruption site. (Hunsperger&#xD;
      2003, Cheshenko 2003) Further, Husperger found in her experiments (in vitro) that the&#xD;
      chelation of calcium greatly reduced the reactivation of the HSV virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDTA Eye Drops (EED), which consists of a calcium chelator and a permeation enhancer, could&#xD;
      be one such intervention. Livionex has had some anecdotal evidence that this intervention&#xD;
      could work at preventing an HSV eruption and post prodromal viral shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRB-approved clinical studies of HSV-1 have been performed in normal human volunteers with a&#xD;
      history of HSV-1, who develop recurrences with prodromes after exposure to UV light. We will&#xD;
      use this technique to induce recurrences in susceptible, HSV-1 infected individuals then&#xD;
      treat with EED or Comparator 5 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abreva has been chosen as the Comparator product in this study because it is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for treatment of HSV-related cold sores. Dosing 5 times/day has been selected as the&#xD;
      dosing regimen because that is the dosing regimen approved for Abreva by FDA. The&#xD;
      manufacturers of Abreva recommend that subjects not be treated for greater than 10 days. A&#xD;
      maximum of 7 days treatment with study product has been chosen for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, treatment in both groups of subjects, will be 5 times daily and will last until healing&#xD;
      of the lesion, or up to 7 days following the onset of the prodrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. OBJECTIVE To collect preliminary efficacy and safety data on the use of EED in subjects&#xD;
      with a history of herpes labialis, following UV Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, efficacy assessor-blinded, parallel group, pilot study of up to 20&#xD;
      subjects with documented herpes labialis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be assessed during a screening visit that must take place no greater&#xD;
      than 2 weeks prior to the Baseline visit. During the screening period, subjects that meet all&#xD;
      other entry criteria will undergo UV susceptibility testing to determine their individual MED&#xD;
      (minimal erythemal dose). UV susceptibility testing takes place over two days with exposure&#xD;
      to UV light on specified regions on the subject's back followed by an assessment of the&#xD;
      exposed areas 24 hours later to identify the MED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have a measurable MED will be allowed to enroll in the study. Each subject will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either EED or Comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, subjects will undergo UV radiation at a level 3 times their MED. The exposed area&#xD;
      of the lip will be marked with indelible ink and a baseline photograph may be taken.&#xD;
      (Specifics on the process for UV exposure will be explained in the study manual.) Subjects&#xD;
      will be dispensed study medication and instructed how to apply it to the exposed area. Dosing&#xD;
      of the study product will be done 5 times daily, beginning at the time that a subject first&#xD;
      senses the start of the prodromal phase. The EED is a clear viscous eye drop, and the&#xD;
      Comparator is a white cream substance. Therefore, the subject and principal investigator will&#xD;
      be unblinded, and only efficacy assessments will be done by a qualified trained blinded&#xD;
      assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a diary card to record their pain levels, progression of lesion&#xD;
      development and any unusual symptoms (not normally seen with their outbreaks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 3,4, 5, and 6 the subject will follow up via virtual video call with blinded&#xD;
      assessors during which the subject's diary card will be reviewed and compliance with dosing&#xD;
      checked. Video calls will take place on weekedays. If however, Study Days 3-6 fall on a&#xD;
      weekend day virtual video visits will not occur and subjects will be asked to upload photos&#xD;
      to a secure, private MyChart account. If the subject has noted any unusual symptoms, these&#xD;
      will be discussed with medical personnel to determine if a treatment emergent adverse event&#xD;
      has occurred or, if the subject has not started treatment, whether their medical history&#xD;
      should be updated. A photo will be taken of the irradiated area (as marked on Day 1) and the&#xD;
      subject will be discharged and reminded to follow up on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7 the subject will follow up via virtual video call for assessment of the irradiated&#xD;
      area. Study staff will review the subject diary to determine if the subject is correctly&#xD;
      noting the lesion stage and whether or not they have experienced a treatment emergent adverse&#xD;
      event. If the subject has not experienced any prodromal symptoms or an outbreak of HSV by Day&#xD;
      7, they will be released from the study. All other subjects will be asked to upload a photo&#xD;
      of the radiated area to their private individual Dropbox folder and asked to continue with&#xD;
      dosing as instructed. They will be discharged from the clinic with a reminder to return on&#xD;
      Day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 10, the subject will return to the clinic for assessment of the irradiated area. Study&#xD;
      staff will review the subject diary to determine if the subject is correctly noting the&#xD;
      lesion stage and whether they have experienced a treatment emergent adverse event. More study&#xD;
      product will be dispensed as needed, a photo of the irradiated area will be taken, and the&#xD;
      subject will be discharged with a reminder call the clinic and schedule an end of study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit as soon as their lesion is healed or at 7 full days of treatment, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Study staff will ensure that the subject is seen within 24 hours of occurrence of&#xD;
      either of these two milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EOS visit is expected to be the final study visit. A photo will be taken of the&#xD;
      irradiated area, the diary card will be carefully reviewed and study product (including empty&#xD;
      containers) will be collected. Subjects who developed a lesion that has not yet healed will&#xD;
      be given the option to begin taking a prn medication that has been previously prescribed to&#xD;
      treat an outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an adverse event has occurred but has not resolved by the EOS visit, the subject will be&#xD;
      contacted once weekly and status of the AE noted until such time as the event has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENT EDTA Eye Drops Livionex Inc. has agreed to supply EED. It consists of 2.6%&#xD;
      EDTA plus a permeation enhancer (MSM). EED will be packaged in standard dropper bottles and&#xD;
      labeled as containing 2.6% EDTA plus MSM as a surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: Abreva Abreva, manufactured by Avinir Pharmaceuticals, is an antiviral agent&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for treatment of cold sores. It is packaged in tubes of 2g each.&#xD;
