    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a combined&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and exercise online programme compared to an online&#xD;
      self-management guide. Pain management programmes are the recommended treatment for chronic&#xD;
      pain, however a number of barriers to their widespread implementation have been identified&#xD;
      including geographical distance from speciality programmes, functional disability limiting&#xD;
      the mobility of people with CP and economic limitations(1). eHealth interventions have the&#xD;
      potential to address a number of these barriers and recent reviews have reported reductions&#xD;
      in pain(2), improved knowledge and understanding about chronic pain and chronic pain&#xD;
      management, improved function(3) and improvements in quality of life(4) following eHealth&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this study will be delivered online. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to a combined MBSR and exercise programme (Group A) or an online self-management&#xD;
      guide (Group B). Group A will take part in an 8 week live online weekly mindfulness sessions&#xD;
      based on the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme facilitated by a qualified&#xD;
      mindfulness teacher, in addition to a supervised exercise classes led by a Physiotherapist.&#xD;
      Group B will receive access to an 8 week online self-management guide containing 8&#xD;
      self-directed guides, which will be made available to participants biweekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of feasibility and acceptability will be investigated in addition to a preliminary&#xD;
      examination of between group clinical effects at baseline immediately post intervention and&#xD;
      at a three month follow up, using validated patient reported outcome measures. In addition&#xD;
      all participants will wear a Fitbit activity monitor for the duration of the eight-week&#xD;
      interventions to capture activity measures. A qualitative study will also be conducted to&#xD;
      gather participants' perceptions of the programme and its usefulness&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel-groups, randomised-controlled, feasibility trial. Seventy-five&#xD;
      participants aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with a chronic pain condition by&#xD;
      a Consultant in Pain Medicine or a General Practitioner will be recruited to the feasibility&#xD;
      study. Participants will be individually randomised to one of two interventions. Group A will&#xD;
      take part in live online weekly mindfulness sessions based on the Mindfulness Based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction (MBSR) programme facilitated by a qualified mindfulness teacher, in addition to&#xD;
      supervised exercise classes led by a Physiotherapist. The combined 3 hour intervention (2&#xD;
      hours MBSR, 1 hour exercise) will take place one day per week for 8 weeks. Group B will&#xD;
      receive access to an 8 week online self-management guide containing 8 self-directed guides,&#xD;
      with the material released biweekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key outcomes measures will include; (1) recruitment rates, eligibility rates, willingness&#xD;
      to be randomised; (2) feasibility and acceptability of data collection instruments and&#xD;
      procedures; (3) intervention adherence, engagement and attrition rates; (4) feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the interventions and; (5) participants' subjective perceptions of the&#xD;
      programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also include a preliminary examination of between group clinical effects at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately post intervention and at a three month follow up, using the following&#xD;
      validated patient reported outcome measures; Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Generalised Anxiety Depression Assessment, Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9, Pain Disability Index, Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Short-Form-36 Health Survey, Patient Global Impression of Change Scale and measure of&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction adapted from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity levels (average daily step count, distance travelled and active minutes)&#xD;
      will be measured for all participants using Fitbit Charge 4 activity monitors for the&#xD;
      duration of the eight-week intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the feasibility study will primarily be descriptive and will address the outcomes&#xD;
      relating to the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions and the procedures of the&#xD;
      study. Between-group comparisons of clinical treatment effects will be descriptive and&#xD;
      exploratory to consider the viability of the combined MBSR and exercise intervention that may&#xD;
      warrant further exploration in a fully powered RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of participants will be invited to attend focus groups where semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with the aim of gathering information on the participants'&#xD;
      subjective perceptions of the programme and its usefulness.&#xD;
