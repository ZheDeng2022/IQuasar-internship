    <textblock>
      Skin breaking procedure through an automated heel lancet for blood draws is a common painful&#xD;
      procedure in the Neonatal Intensive care unit (NICU). Recurrent pain in preterm neonates is&#xD;
      associated with long-term complications. The primary objective of the study is to compare&#xD;
      pain scores between two groups (24% sucrose and breast milk) during blood draw using an&#xD;
      automated heel lancet in preterm neonates. The investigator conducted a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in preterm neonates, to compare the pain scores in infants&#xD;
      receiving either breast milk or sucrose. Premature Infant pain profile- Revised pain profile&#xD;
      is used to assign pain scores. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of pain scores&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;

      Blood draw by automated heel lancet is a common painful procedure in the Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
      care units (NICU). The cutaneous sensory receptors on all mucosal and cutaneous surfaces are&#xD;
      developed by 20 weeks gestational age (GA) and the neuronal circuits that carry pain stimuli&#xD;
      from skin to cerebral cortex are developed by around 26 weeks of GA. Recurrent pain in&#xD;
      preterm neonates impacts their postnatal growth, development, is associated with altered pain&#xD;
      perception, and increased behavioral responses for future painful procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral sucrose is a commonly administered and effective non-pharmacologic intervention used in&#xD;
      the NICU for pain relief. There is insufficient evidence on its mechanism of action, minimum&#xD;
      effective dose, the effect of repeated doses on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and&#xD;
      the consistency in providing pain relief with repeated doses over time. Moreover, the&#xD;
      analgesic effect of sucrose is a developmentally transient phenomenon. Another&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention studied for pain relief in neonates is breast milk. The&#xD;
      analgesic property of breast milk is presumed to be from its sweet taste from lactose,&#xD;
      flavor, and odor. Breast milk has high levels of tryptophan, a melatonin precursor which may&#xD;
      increase secretion of beta-endorphin, an endogenous opioid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of data comparing analgesic properties of breast milk and sucrose in&#xD;
      preterm neonates, along with insufficient evidence of sucrose as mentioned earlier, The&#xD;
      investigator conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing sucrose&#xD;
      with breast milk for pain relief in preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare pain scores between two groups (24% sucrose&#xD;
      and breast milk) during blood draw by automated heel lancet, in preterm neonates. The pain&#xD;
      scores between the two groups will also be compared at 30 seconds intervals until two minutes&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is conducted at Hutzel Women's Hospital and Children's Hospital of Michigan&#xD;
      NICU. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from Wayne State University prior to&#xD;
      study initiation. Before the study was initiated, physicians were trained in assessing the&#xD;
      PIPP-R pain scale. The pain scores were given by two physicians who were blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment arm, at baseline, during, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120 seconds post-procedure. These&#xD;
      scores were given either at the time of the procedure or a video is recorded to be scored&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were identified and written informed consent was obtained from the&#xD;
      parents. The timing and need for a blood draw are decided by the clinical team and are&#xD;
      performed by the nurse taking care of the participant. Randomization was done by the&#xD;
      pharmacist through a computer-generated program. Participants were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either 0.5 ml 24 % sucrose or 2 ml breastmilk, 2 minutes prior to the procedure. On&#xD;
      the day of the procedure, the pharmacist sent a closed sealed envelope with a randomization&#xD;
      group to the nurse taking care of the participant. Pain scores are given by two physicians&#xD;
      during and post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Te Investigators collected maternal characteristics of participants like age, prenatal care,&#xD;
      race, history of diabetes and hypertension, receipt of antenatal steroids, magnesium,&#xD;
      histological diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, mode of delivery, and duration of rupture of&#xD;
      membranes. Neonatal characteristics collected include sex, APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes,&#xD;
      birth weight, gestational age, weight on the day of the procedure, postmenstrual age, number&#xD;
      of skin pricks prior to the day of the procedure, and adverse events pre-defined as heart&#xD;
      rate &gt;240beats/minute or heart rate &lt;80 beats/minute for &gt;20 seconds, oxygen saturation &lt;80&#xD;
      for &gt;20 seconds, no spontaneous respiration for &gt;20 seconds, choking, gagging were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this non-inferiority trial, the investigators chose the clinically significant difference&#xD;
      to be 2 between the median PIPP-R scores during the procedure The investigators required 88&#xD;
      patients (44 in each group) to show that the lower limit of one-sided 95 % CI will be above&#xD;
      the non-inferiority limit of -2 for an alpha error of 5% and power of 90 %.&#xD;
