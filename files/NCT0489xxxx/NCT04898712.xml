  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH), a common disease after minor head trauma, is characterized&#xD;
      by blood collection in the subdural space, which can result in severe neurological&#xD;
      impairment. The current standard of care is the surgical evacuation of CSDH. Although&#xD;
      clinical and surgical outcomes are satisfying in most cases, considerable morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and recurrence rates of 3-31% are frequently reported. Therefore a non-surgical&#xD;
      approach to treat CSDH is desirable. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug, has&#xD;
      been shown to decrease hematoma volume in a small cohort of CSDH patients. The present study&#xD;
      is designed to test the hypothesis that TXA can reduce the volume of CSDH. Volume&#xD;
      measurements of residual CSDH after burr-hole surgery will be performed to quantify treatment&#xD;
      success. The trial is designed as a double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where half of&#xD;
      the patients will be assigned to daily intake of TXA, whereas the other half will receive&#xD;
      placebo. The primary endpoint is defined as volume change in milliliter after 4-8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Secondary endpoints are hematoma volume at 8-12 weeks, patient safety, the number&#xD;
      of patients with resolution of the CSDH after 4-8 and 8-12 weeks of study participation, the&#xD;
      neurological outcome, the rate of reoperation, the time to reoperation, drug safety and&#xD;
      compatibility, and participant quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
