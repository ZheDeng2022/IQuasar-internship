  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical thrombectomy is a very effective treatment in patients who have suffered an acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke associated with intracranial large vessel occlusion. However, less than half&#xD;
      of the patients achieve functional independence despite treatment. The optimization of blood&#xD;
      pressure after mechanical thrombectomy based on the degree of recanalization achieved at the&#xD;
      end of the procedure could improve the perfusion of the ischemic brain tissue thanks to the&#xD;
      improvement of blood circulation provided by collateral circulation. For this, authorized&#xD;
      hypotensive or hypertensive drugs will be used. Moreover, this individualized treatment would&#xD;
      allow to decrease reperfusion injury and therefore decrease the risk of intracerebral&#xD;
      bleeding complications and cerebral edema. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial in which&#xD;
      the standard management of blood pressure after mechanical thrombectomy will be compared with&#xD;
      a specific protocol in which blood pressure targets are applied according to the degree of&#xD;
      recanalization obtained during the thrombectomy procedure. The beneficial effect and risk&#xD;
      reduction of this treatment will translate into a better short and long-term outcome&#xD;

    <description>Post-thrombectomy patients will have their blood pressure measured every hour for the first 24 hours after thrombectomy, and every 6 hours from 24 to 72 hours. The target blood pressure is not predefined by the study, but in patients who have received previous treatment with rt-PA, it is advisable to keep it below 180/110 mmHg. If the patient has not received rt-PA, there is no limitation, although the guidelines recommend keeping the pressure below 200/120 mmHg.&#xD;
The hypotensive or hypertensive treatments used will be noted.</description>

    <description>Post-thrombectomy patients will have their blood pressure measured every 30 minutes for the first 24 hours after thrombectomy, and every 1 hour from 24 to 72 hours. Blood pressure objectives will depend on the degree of recanalization achieved after thrombectomy (see intervention section).&#xD;

    <description>In patients randomized to perfusion optimization, medication will be adjusted to maintain blood pressure according to the degree of recanalization:&#xD;
Patients with TICI 2b: systolic blood pressure 140-160 mmHg.&#xD;
Patients with TICI 2c-3: systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mmHg.&#xD;
Hypotensive drugs will be used when necessary. Intravenous labetalol is the treatment of choice, administered as a bolus or intravenous infusion. Alternative: urapidil (bolus or continuous infusion pump). If both drugs cannot be used or are insufficient, sodium nitroprusside can be used.&#xD;
Hypertensive drugs for TICI2b patients whose target pressure is 140-160mmHg and are below this range. Initially, a bolus of physiological saline or 100cc Plasmalyte® will be administered. If this treatment is not effective enough (blood pressure measurements persist &lt;140 mmHg), intravenous phenylephrine will be administered.</description>
