  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR), platelets to&#xD;
      lymphocytes ratio (PLR), eosinophils to lymphocytes ratio (ELR), red blood cell distribution&#xD;
      width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), systemic immune inflammation index (SII),&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) which are the hematological&#xD;
      parameters associated with systemic inflammation in acute and subacute/chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      Secondary purpose; evaluation of the prognostic roles of hematological parameters associated&#xD;
      with systemic inflammation in low back pain in predicting chronicity.This study is a&#xD;
      retrospective case-control study. The data of patients who applied to the emergency&#xD;
      department with the complaint of acute (less than 4 weeks) low back pain or to the Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic with the complaint of subacute (lasting 4-12&#xD;
      weeks) or chronic (longer than 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain in the last 3 years will&#xD;
      be scanned. The data of patients who applied with complaints other than medical conditions&#xD;
      known to be associated with painful conditions and/or inflammatory response will be screened&#xD;
      as a control group. The data of patients between the ages of 18-65 will be included in the&#xD;
      study. In conclusion, the data of 150 patients who presented with acute non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain, 150 patients who presented with subacute/chronic non-specific low back pain and 150&#xD;
      participants as the control group will be included in the study for use in analysis.&#xD;
      Participants' age, gender, duration of low back pain (days), if evaluated, conditions&#xD;
      associated with low back pain in cases with subacute/chronic pain, ESR, CRP, RDW, MPV,&#xD;
      neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count and platelet count in blood tests at&#xD;
      admission examinations will be recorded. NLR will be calculated by dividing the number of&#xD;
      neutrophils by the number of lymphocytes, PLR by dividing the number of platelets by the&#xD;
      number of lymphocytes, ELR by dividing the number of eosinophils by the number of&#xD;
      lymphocytes, and SII by the formula &quot;platelet numberxneutrophil number/lymphocyte number&quot;.&#xD;
