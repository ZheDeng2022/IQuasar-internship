    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health are of increasing concern.&#xD;
      Perceived stress can lead to binge eating and weight gain. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about the relationship between eating behavior and the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting eating behaviors and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older who have access to a computer or smartphone&#xD;
      connected to the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an online study. Participants will answer surveys through the study website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a one-time survey. It will ask about their experiences throughout&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, their socioeconomic standing, their mental and physical health, and&#xD;
      their eating habits. They will have the option to repeat the survey once a month for the next&#xD;
      12 months. This will show changes in their thoughts and behaviors over time. They will&#xD;
      provide their email address to get survey links.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have the option to complete a 2-minute survey on their smartphone.&#xD;
      They will complete the survey daily for 7 days in a row. It will ask about their stress and&#xD;
      eating behavior in real time, in their home environment. They will provide their phone number&#xD;
      to get survey links via text message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has taken part in a previous NIH study on the Phoenix AZ campus, they will&#xD;
      be asked to share their first and last name, date of birth, and email address. This&#xD;
      information will be used to connect data from this study to their past data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is typically 25 minutes but may last up to 1 year....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit previous NIDDK study participants as well as newly recruited individuals from&#xD;
      the general population to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the impact of&#xD;
      psychosocial stressors that impact eating behavior and weight. The study will describe the&#xD;
      relationship between specific COVID-19 related stressors (e.g. fear of becoming sick) and&#xD;
      self-rated measures of food insecurity, unpredictability, perceived stress, behavioral health&#xD;
      dysfunction, eating behaviors and weight change among a range of participants including&#xD;
      previous NIDDK-Phoenix study volunteers and various newly recruited volunteers from the&#xD;
      general global population. Participants will be invited to enroll in a follow-up study which&#xD;
      will involve completing additional surveys on a monthly basis for 12 months. A smaller cohort&#xD;
      of these participants will may also enroll in a 1-week daily assessment study that will&#xD;
      utilize Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to examine stress and eating behavior in&#xD;
      real-time, in the home environment. Participants will complete an online consent form and&#xD;
      online survey through a secure weblink (REDCap). Because the situation with the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic is rapidly changing, survey data collection is an effective way to measure outcomes&#xD;
      at multiple time points with relatively low subject burden.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nighttime Eating Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>2 questions taken from the Night Eating Diagnostic Questionnaire (NEDQ), a self-report questionnaire containing 14 questions about eating after the evening meal and waking up in the night to eat. Symptoms are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, which are then summed to obtain a NEQ Global Score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IES-2 consists of 23-items measuring individuals tendency to follow their physical hunger and satiety cues when determining when, what, and how much to eat. Scores are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Items are summed and an average score is computed for the entire scale and its four subscales.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>TFEQ consists of 18 items on a 4-point response scale (definitely true/mostly true/mostly false/definitely false) (scores recorded on a 0-100 scale). Higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint, uncontrolled, or emotional eating.</description>
