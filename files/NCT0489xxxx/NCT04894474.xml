  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults living with a person who has tested positive for the coronavirus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. People who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 can take part in this study. The&#xD;
      study is done to find out whether a medicine called BI 767551 can prevent COVID-19. BI 767551&#xD;
      is an antibody against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are put into 3 groups randomly, which means by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets BI 767551 via an inhaler and placebo as an infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets BI 767551 as an infusion and placebo via an inhaler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets placebo both via an inhaler and as an infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants get study medicine once at study start and after 1 week. Placebo inhaler and&#xD;
      infusion look like BI 767551 inhaler and infusion but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 3 months. During this time, they visit the study site&#xD;
      about 10 times. About 7 of the 10 visits can be done at the participant's home. Participants&#xD;
      are regularly tested for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The doctors check whether the&#xD;
      participants have been infected with the coronavirus and whether they have symptoms. The&#xD;
      results are compared between the treatment groups. The doctors check the health of the&#xD;
      participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by BI 767551.&#xD;
