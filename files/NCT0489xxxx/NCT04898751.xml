  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with a wide variety of cutaneous&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events (cirAEs). These cirAEs are reported to be the most common&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and the first to appear. This study examines the&#xD;
      appearance of cirAEs within the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database,&#xD;
      VigiBase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICIs have revolutionized clinical oncologic care. The ICIs that are currently FDA approved&#xD;
      fall into three main categories: those that block the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated&#xD;
      antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4; ipilimumab), block the programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1;&#xD;
      nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab), and block the programmed cell death ligand-1&#xD;
      (anti-PD-L1; atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) pathway. There is a considerable diversity&#xD;
      of cirAEs that have been reported with these ICIs in both monotherapy and combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VigiBase is the WHO pharmacovigilance database that monitors individual case safety reports&#xD;
      associated with certain drugs. The largest database of its kind in the world, VigiBase is&#xD;
      managed by the Uppsala Monitoring Center (UMC) in Sweden, and since its inception in 1967 has&#xD;
      received over 19 million individual case safety reports (ICSRs) from over 130 contributing&#xD;
      countries. In this study, the investigators examine the appearance of cutaneous immune&#xD;
      related adverse events in the setting of immunotherapy within VigiBase.&#xD;
