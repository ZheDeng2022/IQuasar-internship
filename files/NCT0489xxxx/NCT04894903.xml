  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a novel patient portal intervention on&#xD;
      the number of patients with diabetes care gaps (e.g., no diabetes eye exam i the last 12&#xD;
      months). The intervention is designed to: (a) notify patients when selected, clinically&#xD;
      meaningful, evidence-based diabetes monitoring &amp; preventative care (e.g., annual urine&#xD;
      microalbumin) are due and (b) allow patients to initiate orders for the care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the patient panels of the 94 randomized primary care&#xD;
      physicians (PCPs) on staff at all 14 VUMC-affiliate adult primary care clinics located&#xD;
      throughout Middle Tennessee. PCPs will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or usual care.&#xD;
      Based on randomization of their primary care physician, 500 adult patients with type 1 or 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus will be assigned to one of two arms. 250 will be assigned to receive access&#xD;
      to the intervention embedded within an existing patient web portal (My Health at Vanderbilt)&#xD;
      at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 250 will be assigned to a usual care comparison arm&#xD;
      with access currently available version of My Health at Vanderbilt without the intervention.&#xD;
      Patients will be invited by mail (or email) to be screened for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible and interested patients will be offered a link to a secure study website where they&#xD;
      will complete a web-based consent form. At enrollment, participants will complete a baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and diabetes health data will be abstracted from the patients' electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR) before being assigned to the intervention or control arm. Participants&#xD;
      will receive additional follow-up questionnaires and diabetes health data will be abstracted&#xD;
      from the EHR at 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month follow-ups to assess outcomes. In&#xD;
      addition, system usage data (user analytics) will be collected throughout the study period.&#xD;

    <description>The number of patients with one or more of the following care diabetes care gaps: (1) no diabetes eye exam in the last 12 months, (2) no hemoglobin A1C blood test in the last 6 months, (3) no urine microalbumin in the last 12 months, and (4) no pneumovax vaccination despite existing indication. The presence of a diabetes care gap will be assessed by electronic health record (EHR) abstraction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Number of Diabetes Care Gaps at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The total number the following care diabetes care gaps: (1) no diabetes eye exam in the last 12 months, (2) no hemoglobin A1C blood test in the last 6 months, (3) no urine microalbumin in the last 12 months, and (4) no pneumovax vaccination despite existing indication.

    <measure>Change in Patient Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up, baseline to 6-month follow-up, baseline to 9-month follow-up, and baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The uni-dimensional, 13-item, Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) is a valid measure of patient activation (i.e., the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care). Each item uses a 4- point Likert-type scale of response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. PAM-13 item responses result in total raw scores ranging from 13 to 52, which are converted to the linear interval scale of patient activation scores, ranging from 0 (lowest activation) to 100 (highest activation). The PAM-13 has good psychometric properties including excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87). The PAM-13 scores have been used to predict healthcare outcomes including medication adherence and emergency room utilization.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Self-Efficacy to Manage Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up, baseline to 6-month follow-up, baseline to 9-month follow-up, and baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item Manage Disease in General Scale of the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scales is a validated measure of self-efficacy (i.e., the confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care) and is closely related to patient activation. The items were adapted to be specific to diabetes rather than a generic condition or illness. Each item uses a 10-point Likert-type scale of response options ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident). Responses result in total raw scores ranging from 5 to 50. The score for the scale is the mean of the items. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change in Understanding of Diabetes Monitoring and Preventative Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up, baseline to 6-month follow-up, baseline to 9-month follow-up, and baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Unique study specific items (four items) to assess participant's understanding of measures of diabetes monitoring and preventative care (e.g., Diabetes Eye Exams) will be administered to all study participants. Each multiple-choice item has only one correct answer and the overall measure is scored as the percent of the items answered correctly.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up, baseline to 6-month follow-up, baseline to 9-month follow-up, and baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-5) is a valid measure of diabetes distress. The PAID-5 contains 5 items which have a five-point response option (0-4 representing 'Not a problem' through to 'Serious problem'). Total scores on the PAID-5 can range from 0 to 20, with higher scores suggesting greater diabetes-related emotional distress care (e.g., Diabetes Eye Exams) will be administered to all study participants.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction/Usability of My Health at Vanderbilt (for control group) and My Diabetes Care (for intervention group)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up, 9-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a valid measure of usability and assesses user's perceptions of ease of use, likability of the interface, and overall satisfaction. Each question on the 10-item questionnaire is scored on a 5-point Likert scale [0 (Strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree)] and the sum is totaled (0-40). The total sum is then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores to a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on prior research, a score above 68 would be above average and a score of 85 or above suggests excellent usability. The SUS has been used in several studies of patient facing health information technology (the article describing its psychometric properties has been cited over 500 times) and has excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.91).</description>
