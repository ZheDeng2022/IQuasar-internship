  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      demyelination and axonal loss of the central nervous system. The etiology of the disease is&#xD;
      not known exactly and possible causes are; genetic, vitamin D deficiency, viral,&#xD;
      environmental and autoimmune factors have been identified. Common findings of MS are in the&#xD;
      literature; sensory, visual problems, fatigue, urinary retention / incontinence, motor&#xD;
      problems (inability to walk, upper extremity skills, coordination and balance problems),&#xD;
      cognitive deficits, tone, speech and swallowing disorders. In the rehabilitation of MS; It is&#xD;
      seen that balance, coordination, strengthening, aerobic and neurodevelopmental exercise&#xD;
      methods are used and these approaches have reached moderate / high level evidence in the&#xD;
      literature. Task-oriented circuit therapy(TOECT), one of the current neurophysiology-based&#xD;
      approaches; It is a motor learning-based exercise approach based on the theory of dynamic&#xD;
      systems, one of the theories of motion control, aiming at the acquisition of skills for a&#xD;
      specific functional activity. When the existing studies are examined, it has been determined&#xD;
      that there are a limited number of randomized controlled studies examining the effects of&#xD;
      TOECT and that sufficient evidence cannot be obtained with these studies. In previous&#xD;
      studies, it has been observed that standardization of exercise approaches applied to the&#xD;
      control group could not be achieved and the control groups generally included applications&#xD;
      that could create passive or effect summation compared to the experimental groups. In&#xD;
      addition, in the literature, TOECT, which includes rehabilitation games to be applied in the&#xD;
      form of station training, in MS patients; There is no randomized controlled study examining&#xD;
      the effects on balance, walking, fatigue, trunk and upper extremity functions and kinematics.&#xD;
      In this direction, the purpose of the research is; To examine the effects of&#xD;
      technology-supported TOECT and technology-supported home program applied as station training&#xD;
      on walking, quality of life, fatigue, balance, trunk and upper extremity functions of&#xD;
      patients with MS, using kinematic and clinical methods. Volunteers who agree to participate&#xD;
      in the study will be divided into two groups by the block randomization method. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive exercise training 3 sessions per week (24 sessions in total) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Evaluations will be made before and after 8 weeks treatment&#xD;

The expected result is initially set as &quot;0&quot;, -2 means the worst expected result, while +2 represents the most positive possible result.&#xD;
Fatigue Intensity Scale: Fatigue intensity scale will be used to evaluate fatigue. The scale consists of 9 items. Each item is rated from 1 to 7. The score of the scale is obtained by the arithmetic mean of all items. People with a score of 4 and above are considered to be tired.</description>

    <description>ABILHAND Stroke Hand Function Questionnaire will be used to question the hand functions of volunteers. In the questionnaire, the level of difficulty perceived by the volunteers while performing activities such as feeding, dressing and housework is questioned. The questionnaire consists of 56 items and each item is scored as 0 (impossible), 1 (difficult) and 2 (easy). High score means good hand skills.</description>

    <measure>Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and after 8 weeks treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota Manual Dexterity test will be used to evaluate volunteers' hand agility. Test 60 blocks; There are two stages of placement and translation. The placement test is performed by the volunteer placing the blocks towards the distance from the target close to him, and the total time is recorded. The placement test will be repeated for both hands. In the flip test, the volunteer is asked to take the blocks from the corner of the dominant side with the non-dominant hand, turn them bimanually and place them with the dominant side. The test goes from the far dominant corner to the non-dominant corner. The second row starts on the non-dominant side and runs towards the dominant side. At this stage, the person takes the block with the dominant hand, turns it bimanually and places it with the non-dominant side. This is repeated in the third and fourth rows as in the first and second rows and the total time is recorded. In the literature, it is recommended for use in patients with MS.</description>

    <description>To the telerehabilitation group; A home program consisting of strengthening, balance and coordination exercises determined according to the needs of volunteers with MS will be given. A session will be applied in the home program under the guidance of a physiotherapist. The exercise will take 1 hour. The exercise participation status of the patient will be monitored with a mobile (smartphone) application. Exercises will be constantly updated according to the needs of the patient, the updated exercises will be sent to the mobile application via video, and the patient will be able to communicate with the physiotherapist via video conference whenever he / she wishes. Progress and complication of the treatment program will be achieved by increasing the weights used, changing the ground characteristics and support surface during balance exercises and increasing the complexity of coordination exercises.</description>
