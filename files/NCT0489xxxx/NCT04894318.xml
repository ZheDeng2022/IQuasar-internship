      The aim of this study is to compare LDL sub-group concentration before and after a diet with&#xD;
      low-fat and low-cholesterol prescribed to dyslipidemic patients for 12 weeks.&#xD;

      The study was conducted between January 2018-July 2019 in Erciyes University Health&#xD;
      Application and Research Center. This study was planned as a clinical trial for treatment and&#xD;
      47 patients were included. All participants were given written consent. The study was&#xD;
      evaluated to be ethically appropriate by Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A low-fat (&lt;30% of total energy), and low-cholesterol (&lt;200 mg/day) diet was planned for the&#xD;
      participants at the baseline, according to the gender, lifestyle, working conditions,&#xD;
      nutritional habits, BMI, concomitant diseases and risk conditions. The patients were called&#xD;
      for monthly controls and followed up for a total of 12 weeks. When the patients admitted at&#xD;
      the first and second months, Body Impedance Analyzer (BIA) measurements were performed and&#xD;
      dietary adherence was controlled. If necessary, the energy requirements of the patients were&#xD;
      re-calculated and their diets were re-newed and if the patients had any questions on the&#xD;
      diet, they were answered. Blood samples were taken from the patients at the baseline and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks and the effects of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet on biochemical and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements were evaluated. Energy restricted diet were planed for overweight&#xD;
      and obese patients (~ 500-1000 kcal/day). In addition, patients were recommended to walk at a&#xD;
      moderate speed for at least 30-40 min per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection A questionnaire including socio-demographic characteristics, nutritional&#xD;
      habits, physical activity status, and comorbid diseases was filled by the researcher. The&#xD;
      food consumption frequency of the participants was evaluated by dividing the frequencies into&#xD;
      four groups as consuming 5-6 times daily, consuming every other day, consuming 1-2 times a&#xD;
      week and consuming 1-2 times a month or never at all. Food consumption records were also&#xD;
      taken from each patient. Physical activity was questioned by the 'International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (short form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The suitability of the data for normal distribution was evaluated by&#xD;
      histogram, q-q graphs and Shapiro-Wilk test. Variance homogeneity was tested with Levene&#xD;
      test. Two groups independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. In the qualitative data, two repeated measurement comparisons were&#xD;
      used with McNemar-Bowker test. The paired t-test and Wilcoxon tests were used in the&#xD;
      quantitative data for two repeated measurements. Spearman analysis was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between quantitative variables. Data analysis was performed by Turcosa Cloud&#xD;
      (Turcosa Ltd Co) statistical software. Significance level was accepted as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements After the completing the questionnaire, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements were taken. Body weight: When the patient was in fasting state in the morning&#xD;
      measured with thin clothes. While measuring body weight, the individual was asked to remove&#xD;
      his heavy clothes (coats, jackets, etc.), belongings in the pockets (wallet, key ring, phone,&#xD;
      address book etc.) and shoes. Attention is given to place the feet on the balance and to&#xD;
      ensure a balanced distribution of body weight to the two feet. The individual was asked to&#xD;
      stand upright and without moving. The measurement was made with a sensitivity of 0.1 kg (100&#xD;
      g). Height: The height was measured with a stadiometer while the feet were side-by-side and&#xD;
      the head was in the Frankfort plane. Body mass index (BMI): BMI was calculated by dividing&#xD;
      subjects body weight by square of his/her height. [BMI = Body weight (kg)/height (m)²]. Waist&#xD;
      circumference: The waist circumference was measured with a non-elastic tape measuring the&#xD;
      mid-point between the lower rib and the crista iliac crest. Waist-to height ratio: It was&#xD;
      calculated by the division of waist circumference (cm) into height (cm). Neck circumference:&#xD;
      Neck circumference was measured with a non-elastic plastic band from the middle of the neck&#xD;
      height between the middle cervical spine and the middle anterior neck with a sensitivity of&#xD;
      0.1 cm. In men with Adam's apple, it was measured just below the protrusion. BIA&#xD;
      measurements: Body composition of the participants was determined with Tanita BC-418 MA&#xD;
      (Tanita Corporation of America, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) device. In order to make&#xD;
      accurate measurements; metal jewelery on individuals, socks, clothes that will affect the&#xD;
      measurement excessively were removed and information about the person's age, height, gender&#xD;
      and whether they are dealing with regular sports activities were entered into the device.&#xD;
      Then, individuals were removed from the instrument with their heels on the electrodes and the&#xD;
      measurement was made. It was taken into consideration that participants did not perform&#xD;
      intensive physical activity 24-48 hours before the measurement. It was observed that&#xD;
      individuals did not have heavy physical activity 24-48 hours before the measurement, they&#xD;
      were fasted for at least 4 hours, no alcohol was used 24 hours before, and they did not&#xD;
      consume too much beverages (tea, coffee) before the measurement (at least 4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters In the Endocrinology polyclinic; the patients were diagnosed with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia by an endocrinologist and their fasting blood glucose (mg/dL), triglycerides&#xD;
      (mg/dL), total cholesterol (mg/dL), HDL-cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL-cholesterol (mg/dL) levels&#xD;
      were evaluated. Patients were selected according to the inclusion criteria and blood was&#xD;
      drawn after fasting for at least 10-12 hours. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL (mg/dL)),&#xD;
      large-LDL (mg/dL), small-LDL (mg/dL) medium density lipoprotein (IDL (mg/dL)) (Mid A, B, C)&#xD;
      values. After centrifugation, blood samples were kept in the freezer at -80°C in Erciyes&#xD;
      University Endocrinology Service until analysis period. For patients who were not initially&#xD;
      evaluated for insulin (mg/dL), some blood was collected and delivered to Erciyes University&#xD;
      Blood Collection Department and studied at the Central Biochemistry Laboratory of Erciyes&#xD;
      University. Fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol levels were measured by spectrophotometric method using Roche Diagnostics&#xD;
      (Basel, Switzerland). Insulin was measured by the ECLIA study method using the Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). LDL subgroups were measured in serum samples using a&#xD;
      Lipoprint System (Quantimetrix Inc., Redondo Beach, CA, USA). This system separates&#xD;
      lipoproteins in a non-denaturing gel gradient of polyacrylamide based on net surface charge&#xD;
      and size. The dye binds proportionally to the relative amount of cholesterol in each&#xD;
      lipoprotein. After the electrophoresis, densitometric analyzes and proportional&#xD;
      concentrations of lipoprotein classes and subclasses were calculated on the Lipoware&#xD;
      software. In this system, VLDL, IDL corresponding to 3 midbands (Mid A, B, C) and 7 LDL&#xD;
      subgroups: LDL-1 to -2 (large, bouyant, pattern A); LDL-3 to -7 (small, dense; pattern B).&#xD;
      The system also gives the average LDL particle size. Type A if particle size was ≥268Â,&#xD;
      medium level if particle size was 265-268Â, type B if particle size was ≤265Â.&#xD;
