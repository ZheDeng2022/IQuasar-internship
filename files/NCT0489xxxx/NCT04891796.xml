      Aim: to collect further information on issues related to tobacco control which should be&#xD;
      addressed and advocated in further tobacco control measures in Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this policy-related survey by landline and mobile telephone are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to update information on prevalence of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes,&#xD;
           heat-not-burn tobacco products and waterpipe tobaccos ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the effects of new pictorial health warning policy in the public;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the level of public support on current and future tobacco control&#xD;
           measures and taxation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to address the timely impacts of smoke-free policies, public support for further tobacco&#xD;
           control measures and assist COSH in shaping policy direction for government;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study is a cross-sectional retrospective landline and mobile telephone survey based&#xD;
      on questionnaires. The target sample size is planned to be 5,100 Hong Kong residents,&#xD;
      including 1,700 current, ex and never smokers respectively. All three smoking status are to&#xD;
      be evenly sampled by landline and mobile telephone. All data will be collected using a&#xD;
      Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system, which allows real-time data capture and&#xD;
      consolidation. All interviews shall be conducted anonymously except for those who are willing&#xD;
      to participate subsequent studies pictorial warning opinion. Analysis of survey data will aim&#xD;
      to identify current opinion on tobacco control policies and implications for future policies.&#xD;
      All eligible subjects who complete the telephone survey will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
      Comparison with past trends conducted by previous landline and mobile phone surveys and,&#xD;
      where possible, extrapolation of future trends will be explored. Weightings will be applied&#xD;
      to adjust for the sex and age of Hong Kong population, and to handle the over-sampling issues&#xD;
      of ex- and current smokers. The data analysis will be conducted by experienced statisticians&#xD;
      in the applicants' team.&#xD;
