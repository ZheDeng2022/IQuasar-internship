    <textblock>
      Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) comprises physical, sexual and emotional abuse and&#xD;
      controlling behaviors imposed by an intimate partner. It is estimated that up to 92% of women&#xD;
      who survive IPV may have suffered one or more traumatic brain injuries (TBI) from blows to&#xD;
      the head, face, and neck, and/or anoxia or hypoxia due to strangulation. Even mild TBI may&#xD;
      manifest as alternations in consciousness, black out, dizziness, disorientation, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, muscles weakness or paralysis and deficits in&#xD;
      memory, attention, planning as well as executive functions. These signs and symptoms of TBI&#xD;
      and their consequences impact the quality of life of women surviving IPV. Furthermore,&#xD;
      survivors experiencing multiple IPV may acquire larger extent of the injury. Though this is&#xD;
      recognized as an urgent and serious issue worldwide, it has been remarkably understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the quality of life of women experiencing IPV-related TBI, and to prevent&#xD;
      potential longer-term consequences, an evidence-based therapeutic treatment is an urgent&#xD;
      need. The Supporting Survivors of Abuse and Brain Injury through Research (SOAR) Project at&#xD;
      the University of British Columbia-Okanagan was designed to integrate TBI knowledge into&#xD;
      community-based supports. This Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research (MSFHR) trainee&#xD;
      application will focus on the evaluation of the effectiveness of a community support network&#xD;
      intervention for women with IPV-related TBI. The outcomes will generate valuable evidence to&#xD;
      inform potential new TBI-informed policies regarding community-based and health care supports&#xD;
      for survivors of IPV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, about 35% of women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) over the course of&#xD;
      their lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rapid increase of the incidence of IPV&#xD;
      as vulnerable women are more likely to be trapped at home with their abusers. In Canada, IPV&#xD;
      affects one in four women over their lifetime. In a study conducted in the United States, a&#xD;
      heterogeneous (with respect to race, age, education level and employment status) sample of 99&#xD;
      community and shelter women, showed that about 75% sustained at least one IPV-related&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 50% of women sustained multiple IPV-related TBIs. Similar to&#xD;
      post-concussive signs and symptoms, women with IPV-related TBI demonstrate cognitive&#xD;
      impairments (e.g., deficits in memory, attention, reasoning, planning and executive&#xD;
      functioning), psychopathological problems (such as depression, anxiety, fatigue and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorders), and/or sensorimotor problems (such as paralysis or paresis&#xD;
      of facial or extremity muscles, numbness, loss of sensation, muscle spasms, facial droop, and&#xD;
      unilateral weakness), due to blows to the head, face, or neck and/or strangulation which&#xD;
      ultimately impacts quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very few studies conducted in this population have reported the prevalence of IPV-related&#xD;
      TBI, characteristic signs and symptoms, prevalence and primary sequelae of non-fatal&#xD;
      strangulation, and brain network organization associated with TBI and its cognitive effects.&#xD;
      A recent randomized trial on prevention of IPV and relationship problems focused on the&#xD;
      parents of newborns demonstrated that prevention interventions for at-risk couples were not&#xD;
      effective and rather showed iatrogenic effects for some couples. Therefore, therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for IPV-related TBI survivors is crucial, and any physical or cognitive impairment&#xD;
      in these survivors require therapeutic interventions similar to non-partner related TBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective therapeutic interventions would not only improve IPV-related TBI survivors' quality&#xD;
      of life but also has the potential to prevent longer-term neurodegeneration if early&#xD;
      detection is possible and timely treatment is provided. However, women rarely receive any&#xD;
      therapeutic assessment or interventions after sustaining IPV-related TBI due to the lack of&#xD;
      awareness regarding early detection and need of therapeutic interventions. On the other hand,&#xD;
      evidence-based therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life of survivors of&#xD;
      IPV-related TBI are still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Supporting Survivors of Abuse and Brain Injury through Research (SOAR) Project at&#xD;
      UBC-Okanagan is a multidisciplinary, community-based partnership designed to i) investigate&#xD;
      the incidence and characteristics of IPV-related TBI; ii) use integrated knowledge&#xD;
      translation to co-create and disseminate knowledge products designed to increase knowledge&#xD;
      and awareness of TBI in those who provide support for IPV survivors; and iii) evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a community support network intervention for women with IPV-related TBI.&#xD;
      This MSFHR trainee application will focus on this last aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will characterize quality of life, resilience, and neurocognitive and&#xD;
      sensorimotor function prior to, immediately after, and 6 months after a 6-month&#xD;
      community-based intervention incorporating executive function, physical activity,&#xD;
      mindfulness/meditation, and health counseling components by comparing with a group receiving&#xD;
      usual care and control participants. In addition, exploratory analyses will demonstrate the&#xD;
      response to the intervention depending upon the severity of the IPV-related TBI, whether&#xD;
      strangulation was part of the experience or not, and the extent of psychopathological&#xD;
      comorbidities (e.g., post traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, depression, adverse childhood&#xD;
      experiences, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to disseminate the findings not only through conference presentations and&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journal publications but also through ongoing engagement with our local,&#xD;
      regional, and national community partner organizations. We have already co-developed and&#xD;
      implemented a knowledge product - the Women's Support Workers module of the Concussion&#xD;
      Awareness Training Tool (CATT) to help raise knowledge and awareness of brain injury in those&#xD;
      who provide support to survivors of IPV. We would envision incorporating some of the key&#xD;
      takeaway findings from the SOAR project into an updated version of the CATT module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes of this study will add strong evidence to the effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for, and strengthen our understanding of, this understudied&#xD;
      experience. More broadly, this study will (i) enhance professional knowledge and research&#xD;
      skills in understanding this underserved population, (ii) build up research knowledge on this&#xD;
      topic, and (iii) increase knowledge on the efficacy of a novel intervention. Thus, clearly&#xD;
      and objectively characterizing the potential for a community support network to improve&#xD;
      resiliency, quality of life, and neurocognition will have far-reaching implications for&#xD;
      social support policy and funding for this population and their caregivers.&#xD;

Assessments include 12 different tasks to measure short-term memory, response inhibition, attention, verbal reasoning, visuospatial working memory, deductive reasoning, episodic memory, visuospatial processing, mental rotation, planning, spatial short-term memory, and working memory. The detail on CBS tests are available online at https://cambridgebrainsciences.com. Some of the tasks have to be solved as quickly and accurately as possible, whereas others have to be solved only as accurately as possible. Neurocognitive functions are assessed in terms of accuracy (number of correct judgments) and efficiency (ratio between total judgments and correct judgments) and/or speed (number of judgments at all) for each subtest. Higher scores indicate higher performance in each task.</description>

Resiliency will be characterized using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. This 25-item self-rated questionnaire measures responses to five factors associated with resilience on a 5-point Likert scale as follows: not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all of the time (4). The scale is rated based on how the participant has felt over the past month. The total score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. It has sound psychometric properties.</description>

Quality of Life will be measured using a modified version of the SF-36. This 36-item questionnaire consists of 8-scaled scores covering several aspects of quality of life and general health. The SF-36 has eight scaled (Vitality, Physical functioning, Bodily pain, General health perceptions, Physical role functioning, Emotional role functioning, Social role functioning, and Mental health) scores. The scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100; with lower scores indicating more disability and higher scores indicating less disability. The SF-36 is a reliable and well validated tool.</description>
