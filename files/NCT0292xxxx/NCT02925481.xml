  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year more than 26,000 pregnancies in the United States end in stillbirth (late fetal&#xD;
      death at &gt;20 weeks of gestation). A 2011 issue of the Lancet, dedicated entirely to&#xD;
      stillbirth, recognized it as a &quot;too-often-ignored&quot; public health problem despite occurring&#xD;
      once in every 160 pregnancies. The death of a baby is highly traumatic and can incite&#xD;
      negative mental, emotional, and physical health consequences lasting years after the loss.&#xD;
      Bereaved mothers with stillbirth have a 4-fold higher risk of depression and 6-fold higher&#xD;
      risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health consequences are likely&#xD;
      to negatively affect subsequent pregnancies, many of which occur within the first year after&#xD;
      loss (50-98%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-conception care is provided to women of reproductive age between pregnancies; however,&#xD;
      few interventions focus on PTSD symptomatology and its related comorbidities in bereaved&#xD;
      mothers. Treatment for bereaved mothers may include psychiatric medication and/or referral to&#xD;
      support groups. Because bereaved mothers with stillbirth may have additional mental and&#xD;
      physical health risks, pharmacological interventions are typically a first and sole line of&#xD;
      treatment and may not sufficiently allay bereaved mothers' emotional distress. Moreover,&#xD;
      women may be trying to conceive or may have already conceived and report reticence to taking&#xD;
      medication. Additionally, support groups with little emphasis on coping may not be helpful&#xD;
      for some grieving mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological approaches, such as yoga, may be an alternative option for bereaved women&#xD;
      with stillbirth. Yoga has been established as an effective, safe, acceptable, and cost&#xD;
      effective approach to improving mental health in a variety of populations, including pregnant&#xD;
      and post-partum women. Yoga has also been used as a means to cope with PTSD associated with&#xD;
      surviving a traumatic event (i.e., interpersonal violence, military veterans). The&#xD;
      investigators are unaware of any studies that have explored yoga to reduce PTSD in bereaved&#xD;
      mothers with stillbirth. Furthermore, online streaming yoga (on-demand videos played in the&#xD;
      home) has recently grown in popularity and may address the unique barriers that women&#xD;
      experiencing stillbirth may have. To reduce PTSD symptoms and its co-morbid conditions (i.e.,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression) the investigators propose to develop and test the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a home-based, online streamed yoga intervention (www.udaya.com) for bereaved&#xD;
      mothers with stillbirth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 (pre-recruitment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racial/ethnic panel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit a panel of racial/ethnic minority women (African American and&#xD;
      Hispanic women) who have experienced stillbirth (n=5) and discuss potential benefits and&#xD;
      perceptions of yoga to inform the study. Women will be asked to complete a web-based&#xD;
      eligibility and informed consent survey via Qualtrics. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      inquire on ways to encourage enrollment of racial/ethnic minority women into the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this information to potentially modify recruitment materials in phase&#xD;
      2. If modification for recruitment materials are needed based on interviews, the&#xD;
      investigators will submit the modifications to the IRB at that time. Interviews will take&#xD;
      approximately 15-20 minutes and will be conducted over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iterative design process for yoga prescription: Before the investigators begin recruitment&#xD;
      for the study the investigators will implement the following steps to determine the yoga&#xD;
      prescription for the LD and MD intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify videos from existing Udaya library. Videos prescribed will be selected for&#xD;
           qualities pertaining to selected potential mechanisms proposed in our conceptual model.&#xD;
           Classes chosen will include detailed instruction and specific alignment cues to promote&#xD;
           focus and attention, thus potentially reducing sensitivity to internal sensations and&#xD;
           increase affect tolerance (emotional regulation) (e.g., press your hands into the mat in&#xD;
           cobra pose, lift your toes during chair pose). Also slow moving classes with longer&#xD;
           holds to encourage non-reactivity and awareness of negative thoughts or self-criticism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gather a panel of women who have experienced stillbirth (n=5) and a panel of women who&#xD;
           regularly do yoga (n=5) to review the videos (including, as appropriate, engaging in&#xD;
           practices. Women will be asked to complete a web-based eligibility survey and informed&#xD;
           consent via Qualtrics. Each woman will review ~9 yoga videos within a 6 week period&#xD;
           (videos outlined in #1). Women will be asked to come into the Healthy Lifestyles&#xD;
           Research Lab at Arizona State University on a weekly basis for 6 weeks (1-2x/week).&#xD;
           Before and after the review, the team will actively explore if individuals feel they are&#xD;
           connected to their body, feel emotionally regulated, and self-compassionate (see #3&#xD;
           below). Sessions not perceived as useful for self-compassion and emotional regulation&#xD;
           will be replaced for the proposed study. If no previously developed videos are&#xD;
           supportive of improving self-compassion and emotional regulation, the investigators will&#xD;
           produce new classes (up to six 30-min classes) in partnership with Udaya.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have participants rate their current self-compassion and emotional regulation to gather&#xD;
           the pre-post mean score changes for all videos. This pre-post questionnaire will take&#xD;
           roughly 5 minutes to complete. The investigators will also ask questions during&#xD;
           post-intervention interviews to glean further insights about the utility of the yoga&#xD;
           sessions for improving self-compassion and emotional regulation. This process will&#xD;
           inform the videos to be used in the future larger trial Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our purposes, all classes for the intervention will be screened for applicability by the&#xD;
      yoga therapist. Participants' username and passwords will provide them access to only the&#xD;
      yoga videos prescribed; participants will not have access to the complete Udaya library of&#xD;
      yoga videos. Participants will be asked to complete the yoga videos in a specific order,&#xD;
      which will include specialized preparatory instructions for each class to quell apprehension&#xD;
      and further ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this process the investigators will finalize the yoga prescription for Phase 2 and will&#xD;
      submit any modifications to the IRB before recruitment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Enrollment: Interested participants will complete an eligibility screener on a&#xD;
      Qualtrics link, or contact the research team via phone or email. Our current screener takes&#xD;
      approximately 5-10 mins to complete. Research team members will follow a script to respond to&#xD;
      interested participants who phone or email, and refer them to the eligibility screener.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will receive an email requesting times to schedule a 15 minute intake&#xD;
      call (i.e., explain the study) and an email confirmation for the appointment. Following the&#xD;
      intake appointment, eligible participants will receive a Qualtrics link asking them to&#xD;
      electronically sign an informed consent and participate in a baseline assessment of&#xD;
      self-report measures that will take approximately 20 minutes. After this step, participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to intervention or control group (See below). Ineligible participants will&#xD;
      be notified by phone and offered a discounted Udaya.com membership.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The investigators will randomize participants into low dose intervention group&#xD;
      (LD; n=30), moderate dose intervention group (MD; n=30), or stretch and tone control group&#xD;
      (STC; n=30) after the informed consent and baseline questionnaires have been complete.&#xD;
      Research personnel will use a computer-generated list of numbers (i.e., randomizer.org).&#xD;
      Research personnel who assign participants to a group will not be the same as those who&#xD;
      download or clean data. Additionally, group status will be entered separately so that&#xD;
      research personnel downloading data will be blinded to treatment assignment. Women in LD and&#xD;
      MD will be prescribed 60 mins or 150 mins of yoga per wk respectively, for 12 wks. The STC&#xD;
      group will complete a minimum of 60 mins/wk of stretching/toning exercises to match LD&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracking. Participation in the videos for all groups (LD, MD, STC) will be tracked (class&#xD;
      taken, time of day, length of use etc.) on the Udaya.com website throughout the study. Before&#xD;
      beginning the study, the research team will send each participant a daily log Qualtrics link&#xD;
      to self-track: (a) completion of yoga/stretching sessions; (b) rate of perceived exertion;&#xD;
      (c) assessment of mindfulness; (d) other PA participation; (e) participation in psychotherapy&#xD;
      (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy); and (f) pregnancy, mental health, and use of&#xD;
      psychiatric medication (see daily/weekly log). Research personnel will contact participants&#xD;
      weekly (via email/text) to remind them to participate in yoga/stretching and complete&#xD;
      daily/weekly logs. Participants will be given a choice of text or email reminders. If a&#xD;
      participant from the intervention or STC is not meeting their minimal dose requirement and/or&#xD;
      not tracking their sessions, research personnel will reach out to the participant via&#xD;
      text/email reminder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control (STC). The investigators will inform the adaptation of the STC group using Consultant&#xD;
      McAuley's well established, evidence-based control group originally designed for older&#xD;
      adults. The investigators will modify the prescription for the control group to be more age&#xD;
      and population specific for the proposed study. All videos will be produced by Udaya.com and&#xD;
      taught by a trained exercise professional. The STC group will complete a minimum of 60&#xD;
      mins/wk of stretching/toning exercises to match the LD intervention group. The instructor&#xD;
      will ask participants to perform each isolated stretch, limbering, or toning exercise for&#xD;
      20-30 seconds and repeat five times. Participants will be asked to perform slow, controlled,&#xD;
      and complete movements. Women will be given 4 upper body, 4 lower body, 3 trunk/core, and 1-2&#xD;
      balance exercises, with appropriate progression over 12 wks. Retention of women in the&#xD;
      control group is important to the internal validity of the study. As such, the stretch,&#xD;
      limbering, and toning exercises will be combined in different orders within each video to&#xD;
      prevent boredom as recommended by Consultant McAuley. An important adaptation for the control&#xD;
      group is the provision of modifications of each individual exercise. For each exercise, the&#xD;
      instructor will demonstrate a modified version that is slightly less difficult and a more&#xD;
      challenging version that adds difficulty for those who have mastered the movement&#xD;
      capabilities, these modifications will allow the program to be highly adaptable for women&#xD;
      with a wide range of capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STC videos will have discussion related to form and safety by the instructor (i.e., no&#xD;
      guidance for movement with breath or mindfulness). Additionally, videos will have students in&#xD;
      the background following instructor cues and demonstrating variations of exercises. There&#xD;
      will be no final relaxation pose in the STC videos (i.e., the rest period during which the&#xD;
      efforts of PA are soothed, the mind is most receptive to stillness, and the cultivation of&#xD;
      mindfulness culminates). Usernames and passwords for women in the control group will be&#xD;
      specific to accessing only the STC group videos on Udaya.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy during Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case that a woman becomes pregnant during this study the investigators will ask her to&#xD;
      complete the Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination for Pregnancy (PARmed-X for&#xD;
      Pregnancy), a health-screening tool for participation in prenatal exercise. The PARmed-X for&#xD;
      pregnancy is completed with their primary care physician to identify any contraindications to&#xD;
      exercise, and includes 29 questions pertaining to general health status, status of current&#xD;
      pregnancy, physical activity habits over the last month, and absolute and relative&#xD;
      contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been well established that yoga is safe during pregnancy and postpartum and all&#xD;
      classes prescribed will be suitable for women up to 20-wks gestation (the maximum possible&#xD;
      based on our study eligibility). At any time during the study, if the participant's medical&#xD;
      team advise her not to participate in yoga or other exercise, she would be immediately&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. Pregnancy status will be tracked throughout the 12-week study&#xD;
      period via weekly assessment in weekly logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention questionnaires will be administered via web-based survey (i.e., Qualtrics)&#xD;
      at the end of week 12. In addition, follow-up surveys will be administered via web-based&#xD;
      survey (i.e., Qualtrics) at 20-wks post baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews following best practices for conducting interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with 15 participants. The qualitative interviews will be used to supplement information&#xD;
      gained from the satisfaction surveys and to further understand the use of non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions such as yoga in this population. Purposive sampling strategies (i.e., maximum&#xD;
      variation sampling) will be used to understand individuals' experiences and inform the future&#xD;
      larger trial. The investigators will specifically select participants from the study&#xD;
      (approximately 5 from each intervention group, and 5 from control group or until data&#xD;
      saturation has been reached) that represent those who had high/low compliance (at least 3 of&#xD;
      5 will be those who had low compliance (i.e., not reaching their prescribed minimal dose of&#xD;
      yoga) and at least 3 of 5 will be racial/ethnic minorities). Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      administered in the intervention groups at post-intervention (12 wks) and at follow-up (20&#xD;
      wks) and will last approximately 15-20 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were measured using the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R). The IES-R was developed to reflect the criteria for PTSD per the Diagnostic Symptom Manual (DSM-IV). There scale consists of 22 questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely). There are three subscales (i.e., avoidance, intrusion, hyperarousal) and the sub of the three subscales scores comprise the total score. A total score ≥33 indicates the likely presence of PTSD.</description>
