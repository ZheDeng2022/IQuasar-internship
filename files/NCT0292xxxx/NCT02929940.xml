    <textblock>
      Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the third most common genetic disorder leading to&#xD;
      death worldwide. Apart from lung disease, AATD also leads to liver involvement in up to 50%&#xD;
      of patients. Hence, liver involvement is the second most common cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in AATD patients. But the natural history of disease in adults is not well&#xD;
      understood and specific therapies are still in the phase of preclinical studies. Despite&#xD;
      these facts and the therapeutic and preventative potential, the AATD-related liver disease is&#xD;
      still largely being neglected by both the patients and the healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the hepatologic care of patients with AATD, the investigators initiated a&#xD;
      prospective multi-center study in Europe that systematically evaluates the liver function in&#xD;
      these patients and their relatives. The investigators cooperate with both patient&#xD;
      organizations as well as with lung centers specialized on AATD-related lung disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) is a frequently overlooked metabolic disorder.&#xD;
      Apart from lung disease, AAT deficiency also leads to liver disease. This can affect people&#xD;
      of all ages and all ethnic groups. Although involvement of the liver is the second most&#xD;
      common cause of decreased quality of life and life expectancy in Alpha1 patients, no&#xD;
      preventative care plan, like that one implemented to avoid lung involvement, has yet been&#xD;
      drawn up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic liver involvement therefore often remains undetected until a very late stage in&#xD;
      diagnosed cases of AAT deficiency. This is compounded by the fact that the patients affected&#xD;
      generally have only unspecific symptoms if any at all. Moreover, routine diagnostic&#xD;
      measurements (e.g. liver function tests) often reveal no abnormalities. In the case of a late&#xD;
      diagnosis, the diverse complications of liver disease can no longer be effectively prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver involvement in AAT deficiency can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis is the life-threatening consequence of many liver disorders and carries a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Besides AAT deficiency, many other - potentially treatable - conditions, such as&#xD;
      viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol consumption and diabetes, can cause liver damage. Liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis itself leads to many, often life-threatening secondary disorders such as heavy&#xD;
      bleeding or liver cancer. It is therefore crucial that liver disorders such as AAT deficiency&#xD;
      are diagnosed at an early stage, so as to prevent complications and to treat concomitant risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators collaborate with various patient support groups and other hospitals&#xD;
      specialising in AAT deficiency-associated lung disease. Together with their collaborators,&#xD;
      the investigators hope to improve the care of affected patients and help to bring about&#xD;
      therapeutic advances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to clarify how liver function is modified in patients with AAT&#xD;
      deficiency. For this, among other things, the investigators use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) modern ultrasound-based scanners for non-invasive measurement of the degree of liver&#xD;
      scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Specialized liver parameters in blood samples, which also provide information on any&#xD;
      existing liver disorders (iii) Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants receive a full, cost-free analysis of their individual liver involvement&#xD;
      and are given appropriate recommendations for disease prevention. The examinations provide a&#xD;
      relief to many and to everybody,the investigators are able to offer an individual liver&#xD;
      damage prevention plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients (of every genotype) as well as any family members interested will be&#xD;
      studied and advised. Besides the specialist clinic in Aachen (Germany), free examinations&#xD;
      throughout and even outside of Germany will be offered.&#xD;
