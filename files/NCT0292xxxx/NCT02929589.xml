  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      oxycodone/acetaminophen prescribed with or without ibuprofen for pain control following open&#xD;
      unilateral inguinal hernia repair, with allowed exception of any currently prescribed opioid&#xD;
      (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, methadone, oxymorphone, transdermal&#xD;
      fentanyl), which can be continued. The patients will not be allowed to continue any&#xD;
      over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen containing&#xD;
      medications, that were not prescribed by the investigators during this study. Patients not&#xD;
      receiving Ibuprofen will be given a placebo pill composed of corn starch. The placebo pill&#xD;
      will be formulated into the same shape, size and color as the ibuprofen capsule. Neither the&#xD;
      investigators nor the research subjects will know if the subject is receiving a placebo&#xD;
      versus Ibuprofen. The subjects will complete pain level and medication diaries, and will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 months after their surgery. The research aims to discover the appropriate&#xD;
      amount of opioid medication to prescribe to patients undergoing an elective open inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair, and reduce the total opioid dose needed by utilizing ibuprofen in combination.&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the subjects who take ibuprofen will use less&#xD;
      oxycodone/acetaminophen, and have comparable or lower mean pain levels. This could contribute&#xD;
      to reducing the surplus opioids prescribed by physicians after surgery, which can lead to&#xD;
      opioid use disorders. This particular procedure is common in men, and the findings have the&#xD;
      potential to decrease the symptoms and pain of Active Duty members and DoD beneficiaries who&#xD;
      undergo an inguinal hernia repair, and are at risk for prescription drug abuse or dependence.&#xD;

      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discuss the purpose of the study and the required completion of study-related questionnaires&#xD;
      and their potential impact for active duty members. (research-driven) Obtain signed Informed&#xD;
      Consent Document and HIPAA Authorization (research-driven).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review the patient's past medical history in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology&#xD;
      Application (AHLTA) or ESSENTRIS to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      (research-driven) The investigators will record the subject's tobacco use history, alcohol&#xD;
      use history, marijuana use history, other illicit drug use history, and previous&#xD;
      non-prescription use of opioids. (standard of care) Obtain an overall pain score, from 0 to&#xD;
      100, with 100 being the worst pain imaginable. (research-driven) Obtain a localized pain&#xD;
      score from 0 to 100, with 100 being the worst pain imaginable, which the patient attributes&#xD;
      specifically to the hernia that is scheduled for surgical intervention. (research-driven)&#xD;
      Instruct patients to discontinue use of any over-the-counter pain medications, such as&#xD;
      ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen containing medications, that were not prescribed by the&#xD;
      investigators during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have the following blood test drawn, which include (research-driven):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting comprehensive metabolic panel (liver function, renal function, plasma glucose tests)&#xD;
      via 1 venipuncture (5-10 milliliters, approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn)&#xD;
      Subject's CMP results must be within 30 days of the day of surgery or it will need to be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test (5-10 milliliters,&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood) or urine pregnancy test (10 drops or less than 1&#xD;
      milliliter of urine) (research-driven). Visit 1 (may occur the same day as the screening&#xD;
      visit or the same day as visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care local anesthesia used for this type of surgery is bupivacaine. The&#xD;
      surgeon will be reminded via a note in the medical record. (standard of care) Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized by the MOFMC Pharmacy into one of two naturally stratified groups (e.g., opioid&#xD;
      naive patients and non-opioid naive patients), with further randomization into an opioid +&#xD;
      ibuprofen study group or an opioid + placebo study group The MOFMC Pharmacy staff will&#xD;
      maintain a key that can be used to un-blind the randomization scheme if needed for an&#xD;
      emergent patient care issue. Study ID numbers will be used to maintain blinding and&#xD;
      confidentiality. (research-driven)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid naive patients (used an opioid for less than 14 days in the past 6 months, and no&#xD;
      history of opioid use disorder at any time) will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Subjects will be prescribed ibuprofen 800 milligrams by mouth every 8 hours as&#xD;
      needed for pain for 5 days, and 1 to 2 tablets of oxycodone/acetaminophen 5 milligrams/325&#xD;
      milligrams (Qty. 30) by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Subjects will be prescribed 800 milligrams of a placebo pill (containing corn&#xD;
      starch) to be taken by mouth every 8 hours as needed for pain and 1 to 2 tablets of&#xD;
      oxycodone/acetaminophen 5 milligrams 325 milligrams (Qty. 30) by mouth every 4 hours as&#xD;
      needed for pain for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Opioid naive patients (opioid use for more than 14 days in the past 6 months, or history&#xD;
      of opioid use disorder) will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Subjects will be prescribed ibuprofen 800 milligrams by mouth every 8 hours as&#xD;
      needed for pain for 5 days, in addition to their preferred opioid medication prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: Subjects will be prescribed or advised to continue to take only their preferred&#xD;
      current oral opioid prescription (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, methadone,&#xD;
      oxymorphone, or transdermal fentanyl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the Beck Depression Inventory-II or the Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PHQ-9) depression screen, and it will be reviewed on the same day of completion.&#xD;
      (research-driven) Subjects will complete the Pre-Operative Activities Assessment Scale (AAS),&#xD;
      and it will be reviewed on the same day of completion. (research-driven) Subjects will&#xD;
      complete the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) , and it will be reviewed on the same day of completion.&#xD;
      (research-driven) Subjects will be asked &quot;How likely do you think it is that you will develop&#xD;
      an addiction problem from pain medication you take after surgery?&quot; and chose from 1 of 4&#xD;
      answers: 1: &quot;not at all&quot;; 2: &quot;unlikely&quot;; 3: &quot;somewhat likely&quot;; or 4: &quot;very likely&quot;.&#xD;
      (research-driven) Subjects will be asked &quot;On a scale of 0-100, with 0 being no pain and 100&#xD;
      being the worst pain imaginable, what is your average level of pain at rest in the past 24&#xD;
      hours?&quot; (research-driven) Subjects will be asked &quot;On a scale of 0-100, with 0 being no pain&#xD;
      and 100 being the worst pain imaginable, what was your lowest level of pain when at rest in&#xD;
      the past 24 hours? (research-driven) Subjects will be asked &quot;On a scale of 0-100, with 0&#xD;
      being no pain and 100 being the worst pain imaginable, what was your highest level of pain&#xD;
      when at rest in the past 24 hours? (research-driven) Subjects will be given a Medication and&#xD;
      Pain Level Diary and will be instructed to complete it every day for 14 days beginning after&#xD;
      their surgery. The investigators will record information from the subjects' surgery, for&#xD;
      example: the start and end times of surgery and anesthesia, how long the surgery lasted, how&#xD;
      difficult the surgery was, were the ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, or iliohypogastric nerves&#xD;
      identified and were they protected, injured, or transected, and which opioids the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist gives at any point during the case after incision. (research-driven) The&#xD;
      preoperative instructions will include standardized verbal and written instructions: &quot;After&#xD;
      your surgery, it is expected that the patient will experience a certain amount of pain for a&#xD;
      short period of time. The patient will be prescribed pain medication that you should take&#xD;
      only when you are in pain. If the patient is no longer experiencing pain, the patient should&#xD;
      stop taking the medication. If the patient does not require all of the pain medication that&#xD;
      was prescribed, the patient should record the amount of medication that was unused and then&#xD;
      properly dispose of the remainder.&quot; (standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (day of surgery-prior to surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive prescriptions for medications according to their randomization group.&#xD;
      These prescriptions will be filled at the MOFMC pharmacy, which will perform the subjects'&#xD;
      randomization assignments. The ibuprofen and placebo capsules will be delivered to the MOFMC&#xD;
      Pharmacy after being compounded by Solutions Specialty Pharmacy. (research-driven) Subjects&#xD;
      will complete the Pre-Operative AAS (approximately 5 minutes to complete), and it will be&#xD;
      reviewed on the same day of completion. (research-driven) Research staff will record the&#xD;
      start and end times of the surgery, record the amounts of standard of care pain medications&#xD;
      used during their hospital stay, document any standard of care pain assessments that were&#xD;
      performed, and document the anesthesia the subject received. (research-driven) Subjects will&#xD;
      be reminded in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to complete their Medication and Pain&#xD;
      Level Diary and reminded to complete it every day for the 60 days beginning after they are&#xD;
