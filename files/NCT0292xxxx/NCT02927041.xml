  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard in hemodynamic evaluation has been the combined use of echocardiography and&#xD;
      right heart catheterization. Fall backs to echocardiography are its time consumption and&#xD;
      requirement for specialist interpretation while the Swan-Ganz® catheter shows a poor&#xD;
      correlation of central venous pressure to volume status and provides indirect and difficult&#xD;
      to interpret measurements in patients with unique pathophysiological states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next generation continuous hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography (hTEE®) is being&#xD;
      increasingly utilized to assist with complex resuscitations and to monitor the hemodynamic&#xD;
      profiles of critically ill patients. hTEE is proving to be an essential diagnostic,&#xD;
      therapeutic and monitoring tool for the rapid evaluation of the hemodynamic state in the&#xD;
      critically ill patient and or hemodynamically compromised patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the role of hTEE in clinical&#xD;
      decision-making in 30 patients recruited from OR-Trauma and in 30 patients from the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular-OR. Hemodynamic trans-esophageal echocardiography (hTEE) incorporates an&#xD;
      FDA-approved miniaturized, disposable probe for continuous use in patients for up to 72&#xD;
      hours. This device has been used for postoperative assessment in the ICU for several years&#xD;
      with successful placement of probes and without any adverse incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe allows for the rapid, intermittent or continuous evaluation of bi-ventricular&#xD;
      function, volume status and valve function at bedside or intraoperatively. It also allows for&#xD;
      the evaluation of pericardial effusions and or the exclusion of pericardial tamponade.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device can evaluate trans-valvular flow as well as valvular regurgitation with the use of&#xD;
      the color flow function. In many situations hTEE enables imaging not feasible by&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography due to wounds, dressings, lines or edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hTEE does not provide the visual acuity and detail of formal TEE, but it has the&#xD;
      advantage of requiring a significantly smaller probe (hence the decreased risk of possible&#xD;
      injury) with the ability of providing rapid, repeatable and sequential assessment by&#xD;
      caregivers intraoperatively or at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be reviewed for outcome measures comparing efficiency, accuracy and clinical&#xD;
      decision making capability of the FDA approved hTEE cardiac monitoring system vs. the&#xD;
      standard of care Swan-Ganz/ echocardiographic information for publication. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      will be to demonstrate whether or not after implementation of probes in surgical trauma and&#xD;
      CVICU patients, there is a difference in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality and Morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Organ dysfunction and failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood product administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of ICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study Design and Statistical Procedures This is a two phase, single center, non-blinded,&#xD;
      non-randomized, observational and retrospective study to be carried out at Memorial Hermann&#xD;
      Hospital. The data from the hTEE study group will be compared to the control group (in-house&#xD;
      OR-Trauma and CV surgery databases) and will be analyzed on a patient to patient basis for&#xD;
      its impact on clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon our literature review, we hypothesize that hTEE will help guide point-of-care&#xD;
      management upwards of 75 percent of cases. A decrease in iatrogenic complications from&#xD;
      inappropriate blood product administration, volume resuscitation and or drug intervention&#xD;
      based off of antiquated protocols and inaccurate technology is expected. Its use may benefit&#xD;
      the hospital financially by decreasing the incidence of organ failure and mortality and&#xD;
      allowing for the fulfillment of discharge criteria earlier from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initiation A. Development of protocol and datasheet. (1 month) B. Training of anesthesia&#xD;
           attendings, fellows, residents and technicians. (1 month) C. Formal presentation at&#xD;
           Grand rounds. (1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OR- Trauma/ CVICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Training of the primary proceduralists. Board runners - 892 office. (1 month) B.&#xD;
           Recording of real-time hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiographic movies of 60&#xD;
           patients. (3 months) C. Image analysis for clinical decision making with research&#xD;
           assistants. (3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Database retrospective review of above stated endpoints. (3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
           After admission to the OR and fulfillment of inclusion criteria, the hTEE probe will be&#xD;
           placed by a trained attending or fellow as per standard care. A standardized exam will&#xD;
           be performed that includes a: (1) superior vena cava view, (2) trans-esophageal&#xD;
           four-chamber view and a (3) trans-gastric short axis view.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As per current standard care, the information will be documented in the medical record&#xD;
           and discussed with the PI, key study personnel and the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the purpose of the study, we will document carefully what impact the hTEE assessment&#xD;
           has on the management plan on the first 60 patients who meet criteria and compare&#xD;
           results to the standard of care use of CVP/ Echocardiography combination in terms of&#xD;
           clinical decision making. Subsequent hTEE assessments will be made sequentially as&#xD;
           clinically indicated, and the information obtained will be analyzed in the same way. All&#xD;
           images will be stored for clinical interpretation on the machine itself, which is&#xD;
           accessible to authorized personnel only. All patient data that is collected for the&#xD;
           study will be coded; No subject identifiers will be recorded on study forms. See the&#xD;
           privacy and confidentiality section for details.&#xD;
