      Methods: All patients &lt;75 years registered in the Swedish Secondary Prevention after Heart&#xD;
      Intensive care Admission registry (SEPHIA), will be followed-up within one year&#xD;
      post-myocardia infarction (MI). The REACH risk prediction and a calibrated model for&#xD;
      recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death will be used to estimate base case,&#xD;
      and calibrated CVD outcomes based on gender-specific risk factors. The predicted impact of&#xD;
      the LDL-C reduction on the risk of CVD will be based on Cholesterol Treatment Trialists´&#xD;
      Collaboration findings.&#xD;

      SWEDEHEART is a Swedish national registry consisting of several sub registries in which&#xD;
      patients with acute coronary syndrome are prospectively registered. Patient characteristics,&#xD;
      hospital treatments, drug treatments at discharge, and outcome for patients consecutively&#xD;
      included and treated at all Swedish coronary care units are collected in this registry.SEPHIA&#xD;
      is a sub registry collecting data on secondary prevention and cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Follow-up are registered at six to ten weeks and at 12 to14 months post MI by office visits&#xD;
      or phone. Around 80 % of all Swedish acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients below the age&#xD;
      of 75 years are included in this register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a cohort of 5 904 (74% men) registered in the SEPHIA registry and who had one&#xD;
      year follow-up during 2013, will be included. Data are aggregated and delivered from the&#xD;
      SWEDEHEART/SEPHIA national registry. All patients were informed about their participation in&#xD;
      the registry, the follow-up, and their right to decline participation. No written consent was&#xD;
      obtained&#xD;
