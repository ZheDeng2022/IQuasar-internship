      The goal of this study is to determine whether or not exposure to blue spectrum light reduces&#xD;
      acute kidney injury and systemic inflammation in subjects undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
      Subjects scheduled to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will be exposed to either bright&#xD;
      (1000 lux) blue spectrum (480nm) light or to ambient, white fluorescent light for a 24 hour&#xD;
      photoperiod the day prior to surgery and for a 24 hour photoperiod in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Light modifies the biology and physiology of mammals, including humans. The cellular biology&#xD;
      of both the immune system, as well as, the cells comprising tissues and organs (e.g., kidney,&#xD;
      liver) are under the regulation of light and exhibit circadian rhythms. Studies show that the&#xD;
      severity of organ injury varies with the time of the day, the duration of the day, and the&#xD;
      season. This variation is due to the biology of circadian rhythms, and light is the principle&#xD;
      environmental cue entraining circadian biology. More recent data suggest that modulating the&#xD;
      spectrum of light to which an organism is exposed may therapeutically modulate the cellular&#xD;
      response to stress or injury. Specifically, exposure to a short (24 hour) photoperiod of high&#xD;
      illuminance, blue spectrum light attenuated liver and kidney injury when animals were&#xD;
      subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), a model in which the blood flow to an organ is&#xD;
      temporarily reduced and then restored. A predominant cause of organ injury in this model is&#xD;
      the misdirected and exacerbated inflammation of a type of immune cell called the neutrophil.&#xD;
      However, blue light inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic kidney and liver, and&#xD;
      thereby reduced inflammation and neutrophil-mediated organ injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery is an operation characterized by excessive inflammation&#xD;
      and a high risk of organ injury, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). Thus, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that exposure to blue light, by comparison to standard environmental, white fluorescent&#xD;
      light, will reduce inflammation, organ injury and improve the outcome of patients undergoing&#xD;
      CPB.&#xD;
