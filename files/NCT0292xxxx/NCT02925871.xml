  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to design, implement and evaluate new person-centred transitions between stroke&#xD;
      units and the home. The development of person-centred transition will be performed together&#xD;
      by people with stroke, significant others, stroke unit staff and interdisciplinary teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, a prospective observational study of current transitions from stroke units to&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the home without coordination. The aim is to identify factors that are&#xD;
      facilitators or barriers to transitions, patient and caregiver outcomes, use of health care&#xD;
      during the first year after stroke. In phase 2, a co-design process of new person-centred&#xD;
      transitions will be carried out by people with stroke, significant others, stroke unit staff&#xD;
      and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams. In phase 3 new person-centred transitions&#xD;
      will be implemented and evaluated in a feasibility study and in a cluster non-randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phased approach, as recommended for development and evaluation of complex interventions,&#xD;
      will be used. In phase 1 the current transitions from stroke units to the home environment&#xD;
      will be explored and facilitators / barriers to coordinated person-centred safe transitions&#xD;
      will be identified. Knowledge generated in phase 1 will inform phase 2; a co-design process&#xD;
      of new coordinated person-centred transitions conducted by people with stroke, significant&#xD;
      others and staff from stroke units and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams together.&#xD;
      Knowledge from phase 1 and phase 2 will inform phase 3; implementation and evaluation of the&#xD;
      missing link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Aims: Explore current state of transitions combined with rehabilitation in the home,&#xD;
      identify facilitators and barriers to person-centred transitions, current patient and&#xD;
      caregiver outcome, satisfaction, and resource use of health services during the first year&#xD;
      after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design: prospective longitudinal observational study. Participants: people with&#xD;
           mild/moderate stroke, referred from stroke units to home rehabilitation and their&#xD;
           significant others will be asked to participate before discharge from the stroke unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Baseline data on medical and socio-demographic aspects and functioning&#xD;
           will be collected from the medical records. Data on satisfaction with the transition&#xD;
           process will be collected after discharge from the stroke unit. At 3, and 12 months&#xD;
           people with stroke will be assessed regarding disability, perceived impact of stroke,&#xD;
           participation in social activities, health related quality of life, perceived needs of&#xD;
           health services and satisfaction with services received using reliable validated&#xD;
           measures and structured interviews. Data on caregiver burden, life satisfaction and&#xD;
           informal care will be collected from significant others. Data on use of health care will&#xD;
           be obtained from the register at Region Stockholm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses: Statistical analyses to identify factors at baseline associated with&#xD;
           satisfactory transitions, and associations between perceived quality of transitions and&#xD;
           patient and significant other outcomes at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants: staff of stroke units and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Focus group interviews with staff of stroke units on experiences of&#xD;
      identifying candidates for home rehabilitation, the planning and decisions; and with the&#xD;
      interdisciplinary teams on experiences of preparation for rehabilitation in the home and&#xD;
      establishing new contacts with people referred for home rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Grounded theory. c) Participants: Strategic samples of people with stroke based on&#xD;
      satisfaction with transition and their significant others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Semistructured individual interviews on the experiences of the transition&#xD;
      from the stroke unit to the home and the initiation of the home rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Grounded theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Aims: Develop new person-centred coordinated transitions. Design: Workshops with all&#xD;
      stakeholders using a collaborative design process which include reflection, analysis, and&#xD;
      description of the problem, visualization to get a common picture, modelling and/or&#xD;
      prototyping. Participants: People with stroke, significant others, staff from stroke units&#xD;
      and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams in a series of five workshops. Data&#xD;
      collection: field-notes, diaries and documentation of the design process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 Aims: Implement and evaluate the new person-centred transitions between stroke units&#xD;
      and the home in a feasibility study and in a cluster non-randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      regarding satisfaction with the transitions, patient and caregiver outcomes and use of health&#xD;
      care during the first year after stroke and explore experiences of the new transitions from&#xD;
      all stakeholders involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design: Feasibility study. Participants: people with mild/moderate stroke, referred from&#xD;
           stroke units to home rehabilitation and their significant others will be asked to&#xD;
           participate before discharge from the stroke unit. The intervention will be implemented&#xD;
           at a geriatric stroke unit and an acute stroke unit at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm,&#xD;
           Sweden. The controls will be recruited from a geriatric stroke unit and an acute stroke&#xD;
           unit at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. In total, 50 persons will&#xD;
           be consecutively included, 25 from the intervention site and 25 from the control site.&#xD;
           In addition, staff of the participating stroke units and interdisciplinary teams will be&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Data on feasibility, operationalised as fidelity and acceptability, of&#xD;
           the intervention will be collected by participant observations, interviews, and data&#xD;
           from the healthcare record. Data on likely effectiveness will be collected using&#xD;
           questionnaires and registry data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses: Observations and interviews will be analysed using qualitative content&#xD;
           analysis. Likely effectiveness of the co-designed care transition support in terms of&#xD;
           outcomes and resource use, will be examined statistically and compared with control and&#xD;
           pre-study historic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Design: cluster non-randomized controlled. Participants: people with mild/moderate&#xD;
           stroke, referred from stroke units to home rehabilitation and their significant others&#xD;
           will be recruited from four hospitals with geriatric stroke wards and acute stroke&#xD;
           units. The intervention will be implemented at two hospitals, and their corresponding&#xD;
           home rehabilitation teams, and patients from two other hospitals will serve as controls.&#xD;
           In addition, staff of the participating stroke units and interdisciplinary teams will be&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b.1) Data collection (effect): Sociodemographic and disease-related data will be collected&#xD;
      from hospital records and cognitive function, depression, and fatigue in structured&#xD;
      interviews. One week after discharge data will be collected on the primary outcome patient&#xD;
      health literacy, and the secondary outcomes satisfaction with the transition process,&#xD;
      medication adherence and lifestyle behaviour. At 3 and 12 months, data will be collected on&#xD;
      health literacy, medication adherence, life-style behaviour, self-efficacy, perceived impact&#xD;
      of stroke, and personal, instrumental, and social activities in everyday life. At 12 months,&#xD;
      data will be collected on number of recurrent strokes and unplanned hospitalizations within&#xD;
      the first year after stroke from Region Stockholm's database. All data will be collected&#xD;
      using validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b.2) Data collection (process evaluation): Semi-structured interviews will be held with a&#xD;
      purposive sampling of about 15 patients, and about 15 healthcare professionals. For people&#xD;
      with stroke, the interviews will be conducted one-week and 3 months after discharge. For&#xD;
      professionals, the interviews will be conducted 3 months after start of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b.3) Data collection (implementation strategy): Data on appropriateness, and feasibility of&#xD;
      the implementation strategy will be collected using interviews, at 1 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      start of the delivery of the intervention. A purposive sampling of professionals and&#xD;
      front-line managers will be used in recruitment for interviews. Data on&#xD;
      fidelity/sustainability to the intervention components will be collected with participant&#xD;
      observations, administrative systems, and patient records. Data on the contextual factors,&#xD;
      guided by the Integrated Promoting Action Research Implementation in Health Services&#xD;
      Framework will be collected during the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b.1) Analyses: Patients in the intervention group will be compared to control group using&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. Regression models adjusting for covariates (e.g. age, gender,&#xD;
      stroke severity, and other disease-related data) will be used for analyses of primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b.2) Analyses: Qualitative content analysis b.3) Analyses: Data on functioning of the&#xD;
      implementation will be analysed using a mixed method approach with descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      qualitative content analysis. To enable generalization of findings, we will use nomenclature&#xD;
      from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change compilation and the recommendations&#xD;
      for reporting and specifying implementation strategies.&#xD;

    <measure>EuroQol-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol 5D, consists of the EQ-5D Index and the EQ Visual Analog Scale. The EuroQol 5D comprises 5 pre-defined dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort and Anxiety/depression. The respondent rates each dimension on a three level scale as having no problem, a moderate problem or a severe problem. The answers are then converted to an index value (the EQ Index) ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (full health). The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20-centimeter vertical visual analog scale with end-points ranging from 0 to 100. The single global question in the EQ VAS asks the individual to label his/her health as &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; (0) to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;</description>
