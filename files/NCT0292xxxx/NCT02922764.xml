      Study RGX-104-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of&#xD;
      RGX-104, an oral small molecule targeting the liver X receptor (LXR), as a single agent and&#xD;
      in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab, docetaxel, or pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      carboplatin/pemetrexed. RGX-104 activates LXR, resulting in depletion of both myeloid-derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as tumor blood vessels. MDSCs block the ability of T-cells&#xD;
      and other cells of the immune system from attacking tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses and schedules of orally administered RGX-104&#xD;
      with or without nivolumab, ipilimumab, docetaxel, or pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      carboplatin/pemetrexed (single agent or combination therapy) will be evaluated in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or&#xD;
      metastatic) who have had progressive disease (PD) on available standard systemic therapies or&#xD;
      for which there are no standard systemic therapies of relevant impact. Dose escalation in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab plus carboplatin/pemetrexed will be restricted to patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma&#xD;
      (EOC), NSCLC, or small cell lung cancer (SCLC)/high-grade neuroendocrine tumors (HG-NET) will&#xD;
      be treated at the MTD (or maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD&#xD;
      if there is evidence suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile). This stage will&#xD;
      provide further characterization of the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics, including&#xD;
      biomarkers of immunologic activity and LXR target activation, of RGX-104 as a single agent&#xD;
      (EOC), in combination with docetaxel (SCLC/HG-NET), and and in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      plus carboplatin/pemetrexed (NSCLC).&#xD;

             patients enrolled in the dose escalation stages must have disease that is resistant to&#xD;
             or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy, or for which there is no&#xD;
             standard systemic therapy or reasonable therapy in the physician's judgment likely to&#xD;
             result in clinical benefit or if such therapy has been refused by the patient.&#xD;
             Documentation of the reason must be provided for patients who have not received a&#xD;
             standard therapy likely to result in clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients enrolled in the expansion stages must agree to a tumor biopsy to be obtained&#xD;
             during the screening period and toward the beginning of Cycle 2 or at the time of PD,&#xD;
             if earlier. If a biopsy is deemed by the investigator to not be in the patient's best&#xD;
             interest, prior approval must be obtained from the Medical Monitor to waive this&#xD;
             requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;

             who are receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are permitted&#xD;
             onto the study and should continue use of these agents during study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to study therapy administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has previously received treatment with RGX-104 or another investigational&#xD;
             agent that is a known LXR agonist.&#xD;

          6. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of&#xD;
             the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history with substantial potential&#xD;
             for recurrence must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before study entry. Patients&#xD;
             with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, carcinoma in situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasia, and melanoma in situ), organ-confined prostate cancer with&#xD;
             no evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or&#xD;
             any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 heart failure (see Appendix 1),&#xD;
             uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically&#xD;
             significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Central&#xD;
             Nervous System (CNS) imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a&#xD;
             clinical suspicion of CNS involvement. Patients with stable, treated brain metastases&#xD;
             are eligible provided there is no evidence of CNS disease growth on imaging for at&#xD;
             least 8 weeks following radiation therapy or other locoregional ablative therapy to&#xD;
             the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids&#xD;
             (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within&#xD;
             14 days prior to study therapy administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection requiring therapy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or active or&#xD;
             chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The patient is oxygen-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The patient has a history of pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The patient has Grade ≥2 hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt;300 mg/dL or &gt;7.75&#xD;
             mmol/L) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride &gt;300 mg/dL or &gt;3.42 mmol/L) in the&#xD;
             fasting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. QTcF &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The patient has a physical abnormality or medical condition that limits swallowing&#xD;
             multiple pills, or has a history of non-adherence to oral therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. The patient requires statin (e.g., rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, etc.) therapy. If the&#xD;
             patient is taking a statin but discontinuation is considered appropriate, the statin&#xD;
             must be discontinued at least 5 days prior to starting study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The patient requires treatment with a medication that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4&#xD;
             (boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole,&#xD;
             ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole,&#xD;
             ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, or voriconazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. For the docetaxel escalation stage, patients with NSCLC with alkaline phosphatase &gt;&#xD;
             2.5 × institutional ULN and AST or ALT &gt; 1.5 × institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. For patients with NSCLC enrolled in the pembrolizumab plus carboplatin/pemetrexed&#xD;
             combination dose escalation or expansion stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient received radiation therapy to the lung that is &gt;30 Gray (Gy) within 6&#xD;
                  months of the first dose of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient completed palliative radiotherapy ≤7 days of the first dose of study&#xD;
                  medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has received live-virus vaccination ≤30 days of planned start of&#xD;
                  study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has clinically active diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess,&#xD;
                  gastrointestinal obstruction, peritoneal carcinomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while&#xD;
                  on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has known hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has known sensitivity to any component of carboplatin or pemetrexed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient is unable to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal&#xD;
                  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other than an aspirin dose ≤1.3 g per day, for&#xD;
                  a 5-day period (8-day period for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient is unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12&#xD;
                  supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. The patient has clinical or laboratory evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. The patient has experienced weight loss of &gt;10% of their body weight over the&#xD;
             preceding 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. The patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.&#xD;
