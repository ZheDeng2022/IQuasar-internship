  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two 1200-mg IV&#xD;
      infusions of oritavancin when administered one week apart.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies in adult subjects with ABSSSI have demonstrated that a single 1200-mg IV&#xD;
      dose of oritavancin was clinically non-inferior, well tolerated, and had a similar safety&#xD;
      profile to 7 to 10 days of IV vancomycin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1200-mg dose of oritavancin is the United States (US) approved therapeutic dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with ABSSSI will be enrolled in this study to obtain safety information of two&#xD;
      1200-mg IV infusions of oritavancin when administered one week apart. The safety information&#xD;
      will include the potential for antibody production following two 1200-mg IV infusions of&#xD;
      oritavancin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, double-blind study. Subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either two doses of oritavancin or one dose of oritavancin and a single dose of placebo one&#xD;
      week apart in order to obtain safety information. This safety information will include&#xD;
      information regarding the potential for antibody production following one or two doses of&#xD;
      1200 mg oritavancin.&#xD;
