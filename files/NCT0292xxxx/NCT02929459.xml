  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate comprehensively the effect of riboflavin&#xD;
      supplementation on the abundance of F. prausnitzii and on other members of the gut microbiota&#xD;
      in faeces of healthy volunteers. Additionally it will be assessed whether riboflavin&#xD;
      supplementation affects the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as adherent&#xD;
      invasive E. coli (AIEC). Finally, the effect of riboflavin supplementation on the production&#xD;
      of Short Chain Fatty Acids, the release of gut hormones and potential changes in glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis and appetite perception will be assessed.&#xD;
