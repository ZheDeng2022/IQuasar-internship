  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current lymphedema management protocols are based on the use of simple measures of hygiene&#xD;
      (regular washing with soap and water, skin and nail care), use of topical antibiotics or&#xD;
      antifungal agents, exercise and footwear. This is considered the &quot;standard of care&quot; in most&#xD;
      endemic countries in the absence of any structured treatment programs. Previous controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials and extensive field experience have shown the benefit of these measures in&#xD;
      reducing the frequency of attacks of acute dermato-lymphangio-adenitis (ADLA) that drive the&#xD;
      progression of lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the progression of lymphedema in a group of patients who receive a&#xD;
      six-week course of doxycycline will be compared with that of a group who receives doxycycline&#xD;
      &quot;look-alike&quot; placebo tablets. However, both groups will be enrolled into a standardized&#xD;
      &quot;regimen of hygiene&quot; described above. Thus, patients enrolled in the &quot;placebo&quot; group also&#xD;
      will receive the current standard of care, and the placebo used in the study will help to&#xD;
      identify the benefits of doxycycline on a background of simple hygiene measures. The regimens&#xD;
      will be explained to all participants who will be trained to use established standardized&#xD;
      methods of hygiene and be effectively applying it prior to the initiation of the drug&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, patients will be evaluated at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.. A common,&#xD;
      generic SOP with handouts that describes methods and the training schedule will be used so&#xD;
      that similar methods are employed across all sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This (LEDOXY) trial is designed as a randomized, controlled, observer-, provider- and&#xD;
      patient-blinded multicenter superiority trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint&#xD;
      of change in grade of lymphedema at 24 months. The population will be stratified according to&#xD;
      the Grade (Early Grade 1-3; Late Grade 4-6). Randomization will be performed as block&#xD;
      randomization within each center in blocks of (N=4-10) for each of the groups (Early and&#xD;
      Late).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of a 6-week course doxycycline on lymphedema without active filarial infection has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in a single setting in Africa (Ghana). In order to expand the benefits of&#xD;
      this observation, similar studies need to be carried out in other endemic settings. Lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis is endemic in many countries of Africa and Asia that are yet to implement&#xD;
      morbidity management programmes. In addition, the components of the proposed hygiene package&#xD;
      are likely to vary depending on the availability of material and human resources. The conduct&#xD;
      of this trial as a multi-center study will not only allow the evaluation of the efficacy of&#xD;
      the drug in a variety of settings but also facilitate its rapid adoption by the respective&#xD;
      control programmes of endemic countries, if proven to be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of study sites in endemic countries has been made based on the availability of a)&#xD;
      adequate numbers of patients with various grades of lymphedema and b) clinical trial teams&#xD;
      familiar with lymphedema management procedures and past experience with similar trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All screened patients will be enrolled into a programme of hygiene (described below) and will&#xD;
      be required to demonstrate ability to use established standardized methods of hygiene and&#xD;
      effectively applying it prior to the initiation of the drug treatment. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either daily doxycycline or placebo. Doxycycline and placebo will be&#xD;
      provided by Medopharm (India). Re-labeling and packaging of the drug and the placebo will be&#xD;
      done by Piramal Healthcare, Morpeth, UK Additionally, after un-blinding and data analysis,&#xD;
      the placebo group will be offered doxycycline treatment if the intervention proves to be more&#xD;
      effective in ameliorating LE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both doxycycline and placebo will be administered under supervision (directly observed&#xD;
      treatment) for 6 weeks. The first dose of doxycycline (two 100 mg tablets for those over 50kg&#xD;
      body weight and one 100 mg tablets for those between 40 and 50 kg body weight) or placebo&#xD;
      will be given after all the investigations have been completed and informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained and the patient has been initiated into the programme of basic hygiene. Patients&#xD;
      will be encouraged to eat before swallowing the tablets whole with a glass of water. Vomited&#xD;
      doses will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, patients will be required to come every day to the closest community health center&#xD;
      to take their drugs under supervision. Subjects living in villages at a distance from any&#xD;
      health center will be treated by the community health care provider or the local caregiver&#xD;
      living in this village who will be informed and trained in the possible adverse events&#xD;
      related to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since some study sites may be village based without a health centre, patients may be treated&#xD;
      in their village and required to attend daily at a fixed meeting point. The trial clinician&#xD;
      and the research team with the help of trained community health workers will normally&#xD;
      administer the treatment. Patients should come to the clinic every week with the patient and&#xD;
      collect the drugs for one week. The provider will keep a diary where he or she will mark down&#xD;
      the time of intake of the drug. A health worker may make surprise checks at the patient's&#xD;
      residence by looking at the diary and also by counting the remaining drugs to estimate&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
