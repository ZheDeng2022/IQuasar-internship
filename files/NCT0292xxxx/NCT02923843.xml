    <textblock>
      Frailty and multimorbidity is one of the biggest challenges of todays health care due to the&#xD;
      demographic development with more and more elderly surviving many diseases that was mortal&#xD;
      just a few decades ago. Health care in Sweden is one of the best in the world, yet many frail&#xD;
      older people do not receive appropriate health care. Several reports have described a&#xD;
      fragmented care with lack of good quality due to lack of a holistic view on the patient and&#xD;
      her situation. At the same time the care given is costly and ineffective with a lack of&#xD;
      continuity. Additionally, there are a lack of hospital beds in Sweden due to the ageing&#xD;
      population and a cut down of beds in the last decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is though a method, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), where studies have shown&#xD;
      many benefits for older patients including less need of hospital beds, better functional&#xD;
      outcomes and a better chance of living at home after an Acute Hospital Discharge, but this&#xD;
      method is not much used in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show that CGA in an Out-patient Care Setting save hospital beds&#xD;
      without decreasing the quality of care measured by sustained functional capacity. Other&#xD;
      parameters to be evaluated are mortality, degree of frailty, health economy, quality of life,&#xD;
      and cognition.&#xD;

      Frailty and multimorbidity is one of the biggest challenges of todays health care due to the&#xD;
      demographic development with more and more elderly surviving many diseases that was mortal&#xD;
      just a few decades ago. Health care in Sweden is one of the best in the world, yet many frail&#xD;

&#xD;
      There is though a method, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), where studies have shown&#xD;
      many benefits for older patients including less need of hospital beds, better functional&#xD;
      outcomes and a better chance of living at home after an Acute Hospital Discharge, but this&#xD;
      method is not much used in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show that CGA in an Out-patient Care Setting save hospital beds&#xD;
      without decreasing the quality of care measured by sustained functional capacity. Other&#xD;
      parameters to be evaluated are mortality, degree of frailty, health economy, quality of life,&#xD;
      and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Frailty has become a central concept in elderly research in recent years.&#xD;
      A common definition is a state of decreased reserve resistance to stressors as a result of&#xD;
      cumulative decline across multiple physiological systems, causing vulnerability to different&#xD;
      outcomes, such as falls, hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. The prevalence&#xD;
      of frailty increases with age and frail older people are at risk of further deterioration if&#xD;
      their needs are not acknowledged. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has given&#xD;
      priority to the development and use of targeted needs assessment for the frail older people.&#xD;
      Assessments that are both comprehensive and person-centred are required to achieve&#xD;
      satisfactory and appropriate care to older people with complex needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is a dynamic condition, conceptualized as a continuum from not frail, to pre-frail,&#xD;
      and frail. Those who are considered as pre-frail are more likely than non-frail to develop&#xD;
      full frailty if no specific interventions are implemented. Appropriate nutrition and exercise&#xD;
      are suggested as first-line treatments for frailty but other treatments should be considered&#xD;
      depending on the individual causes of frailty. The goal is to identify needs and provide&#xD;
      support to help older people to be as independent in their daily living as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has found that interventions including CGA results in functional benefits&#xD;
      for frail older patients including a better chance of living at home after an acute hospital&#xD;
      care-period. CGA involves a multidimensional team approach assessing medical, functional,&#xD;
      psychosocial and environmental needs . Several studies have implied less need of hospital&#xD;
      beds because of fewer readmissions when care is given according to CGA. As there are a&#xD;
      substantial lack of hospital beds in Sweden, which results in patients placed in corridors,&#xD;
      hazardous discharges and problems with the working environment, it would be important to find&#xD;
      an intervention that could both save hospital beds and give a better care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As frailty can be addressed by care based on CGA it is important to detect frailty, but also&#xD;
      to avoid the use of a complex CGA when not needed. A recent review have shown that frail&#xD;
      elderly benefits more of CGA than a more mixed population of elderly. There is unfortunately&#xD;
      no easy and overall accepted instrument to detect frailty. In research the criteria developed&#xD;
      by Fried have been most frequently used - but is resource-demanding and seldom used outside&#xD;
      academic research. Another more easy accessible method have been developed by Rockwood and&#xD;
      have been chosen from the The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      (ICHOM) as the preferred instrument to detect and measure frailty. The instrument is not well&#xD;
      known in clinical practise in Sweden, why it could be interesting to test whether it&#xD;
      applicable in Swedish Health Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been only very few studies on CGA in Out-patient Care - but one recent randomized&#xD;
      controlled study conducted in Sweden 2011-2013 showed a nearly 30% reduction of need of days&#xD;
      in hospital and a similar reduction of mortality three years after randomization. The&#xD;
      investigators would therefore perform a similar study in a slightly different population&#xD;
      based on experience from the former Swedish study in order to see whether the results are&#xD;
      reproducible in another health care setting in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This project is a single-centre trial with the base in Helsingborg Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria are identified by a special register in the ER&#xD;
      able to detect when a patient has visited the ER several times within a specified period. The&#xD;
      register is managed by an administrator without any coupling to the research project. The ER&#xD;
      administrator will every month send a list of possible participants to a research nurse. She&#xD;
      will control the list for exclusion-criteria (living in nursing home or outside the nearest&#xD;
      municipalities to Helsingborg Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All remaining possible participants will receive a letter of invitation explaining the&#xD;
      purpose of the study and the study protocol. Within seven days from the sending of the letter&#xD;
      the subjects are contacted by telephone for verbal informed consent and booking an&#xD;
      appointment at their home for further information, written consent and baseline assessment by&#xD;
      a study nurse. If an old person due to cognitive decline is unable to answer the study&#xD;
      questions or give informed consent, a proxy is contacted. Those accepting to participate will&#xD;
      be randomized by computer-generated numbers into two study arms: intervention or control&#xD;
      group. This information will be kept as a randomisation master list with the powered number&#xD;
      of participants (450) by a research administrator. When written informed consent has been&#xD;
      given and the baseline assessment done, the visiting study nurse will contact the&#xD;
      administrator who will give the patient a randomisation number consecutively according to the&#xD;
      master list. A letter will be sent within a week to inform the patient about to which group&#xD;
      he or she has been allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: After baseline assessment the intervention group receive an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary assessment based on CGA, tailored to each participant for 24 months. The&#xD;
      first visit is either at the hospital or in the patient's home, depending on the&#xD;
      participant's condition and ability to travel. The multidisciplinary teams consisting of&#xD;
      physician, nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist and occupational therapist with access to more&#xD;
      competences if needed. The team works according to CGA, and has the primary and continuing&#xD;
      responsibility for the patient during the study period of 24 months. The CGA is&#xD;
      person-centered and unique for each patient, but is based on the core elements such as&#xD;
      socio-demographic background, social network, health and medical history, medications,&#xD;
      functional status, cognitive status, nutritional status, somatic status and psychosocial&#xD;
      status including depression, providing a comprehensive assessment tailored for each person.&#xD;
      Structured questionnaires and validated measures will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team will be able to give a proactive care based on the CGA in collaboration with the&#xD;
      primary care and the municipality. The relatives will be involved when possible. The&#xD;
      intensity of follow-up depends on the participants' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care (control group) Participants allocated to the control group receive health care&#xD;
      from their general practitioner, the community services and in- and outpatient hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention and control group have access to the primary care centers, the hospital&#xD;
      and the ambulatories on equal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow ups of outcome measures will be performed in the older person's home at 12 and 24&#xD;
      months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size A power calculation has been made, based on the primary outcome variable, number&#xD;
      of days in hospital. Based on a former similar study in a slightly younger population there&#xD;
      will be an assumed difference between the intervention group and the control group of 4,1&#xD;
      days in hospital in 24 months (11,1 days in the intervention group and 15,2 in the control&#xD;
      group) with standard deviation of 15 days in both groups. To be able to detect a difference&#xD;
      between the intervention and the control groups with a two-sided test and with a significance&#xD;
      level of α=0.05 and 80% power, at least 211 participants in each group will be needed. There&#xD;
      will be almost no loss to follow-up of of this outcome based on previous research of this&#xD;
      patient-group and intervention, so a total of 450 persons will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both descriptive and analytic statistics will be used, in order to compare groups and for&#xD;
      analyses of changes over time. Non-parametric statistics will be used when ordinal data are&#xD;
      analysed. Otherwise, parametric statistics will be used. Besides descriptive statistics, the&#xD;
      chi2 and Fisher's 2-tailed exact test will be used to test differences in the proportions&#xD;
      between the groups, and odds ratio (OR) will be used to compare outcomes between groups. A&#xD;
      value of p &lt; 0.05 (2-sided) will be considered significant. The analysis will be made on the&#xD;
      basis of the intention-to-treat principle. Given the old age of the participants, a&#xD;
      relatively high drop-out rate will be inevitable, and missing data will not be at random.&#xD;
      Simply analyzing complete cases is not relevant and might lead to bias. Therefore, the&#xD;
      approach of data imputation will be the replacement of missing values with a value based on&#xD;
      the median change of deterioration between baseline and follow-up of all who participated at&#xD;
      follow-up. The reasons for this imputation method is 1) the study sample (frail older people)&#xD;
      is expected to deteriorate over time as a natural course of the aging process and 2) reasons&#xD;
      for not fulfilling the follow-ups are often deteriorated health. Worst-case change will be&#xD;
      applied for those who have died before follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim-analysis will be made on the primary outcome and mortality after one year of an&#xD;
      independent researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule The planning of the study will be completed during early autumn 2016.&#xD;
      Recruitment of clinical team-members are ongoing and in October 2016 the Out-Patient Care&#xD;
      Team will start to work based on CGA to be ready to include patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      November 2016 - December 17 Inclusion-period. A preliminary study has revealed 50 - 60&#xD;
      eligible patients per months in Helsingborg. With an attrition rate of 30-40% there will be&#xD;
      around 35 patients to be randomized a month. To reach the empowered number and with lower&#xD;
      inclusion rate during summer and vacations it will take 12-14 months to include all&#xD;
      participants and the study period for each participant will be 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      January 17 - March 19 Follow up of outcome measures. August 19 All data collection completed.&#xD;
      Quality assurance of data will be done by the project assistant and the project leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      August 19 - December 19: Analysis and article writing (researchers), as well as presentation&#xD;
      at conferences (for professionals as well as researcher; local, national and international,&#xD;
      done by professionals and researchers).&#xD;
