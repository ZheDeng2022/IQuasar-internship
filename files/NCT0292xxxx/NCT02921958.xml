    <textblock>
      Data was collected from Parents of children who were receiving occupational therapy services.&#xD;
      Three assessment tools were used: 1. Life Participation for Parents, 2. Infant Toddler&#xD;
      Sensory Profile, and 3) Child Behavior Checklist. Data was used to pursue 2 investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the Life Participation for Parents responsive to change after intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there correlations between child behavior, child sensory processing, and parental&#xD;
           participation in their own lives while raising a child with special needs.&#xD;

      Introduction and Purpose:The Life Participation for Parents is an assessment tool designed to&#xD;
      measure a parent's ability to participate in daily life while raising a child with special&#xD;
      needs. Previous studies have established the effectiveness of the instrument in providing&#xD;
      valuable information for designing family-centered goals and intervention. Further&#xD;
      investigation is needed to determine if the instrument is sensitive enough to measure change&#xD;
      after intervention. This study is designed to further develop the LPP as an assessment for&#xD;
      providing family-centered intervention for children with special needs and their families and&#xD;
      to investigate child characteristics leading to issues in parental participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Parents raising children with special needs encounter many challenges in their&#xD;
      daily lives. However, the initial studies using the LPP determined that these challenges&#xD;
      cannot be predicted by age, gender, or diagnoses of the child, the time the child has been in&#xD;
      therapy, or the age, gender, or marital status of the parent. These challenges are unique to&#xD;
      each individual and therefore an instrument is needed to assess individual parental needs to&#xD;
      facilitate family-centered intervention.Family-centered practice in pediatric occupational&#xD;
      therapy involves working with parents, families, and the child with special needs to&#xD;
      facilitate participation in life through engagement in occupation. Occupational therapy&#xD;
      practitioners frequently interpret family-centered practice as parental involvement in&#xD;
      establishing and facilitating child- related goals. However, family-centered practice goes&#xD;
      beyond child-related goals to incorporate changing the quality of life for the whole family.&#xD;
      Families are interdependent, and intervention with the child can have a significant impact on&#xD;
      life participation for the entire family, especially the parents. Raising a child with&#xD;
      special needs can influence a parent's time usage, health, and choice of activities. To&#xD;
      provide best-practice family-centered intervention, therapists need to understand individual&#xD;
      barriers to life participation for the child, parents, and other family members. The LPP is a&#xD;
      22 item self-report questionnaire using a 5 point Likert scale. Each item also has space for&#xD;
      a qualitative comment regarding the response. It is designed to be used by clinical&#xD;
      practitioners such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, or speech and language&#xD;
      pathologists in determining issues parents are having in participating in their daily lives.&#xD;
      The issues identified by the LPP can then initiate further conversations between parent and&#xD;
      clinician and assist with developing family-centered intervention goals. The LPP was&#xD;
      developed using an Occupational Adaptation frame of reference providing items on both the&#xD;
      efficiency and the effectiveness of a parent's ability to participate in life activities&#xD;
      effected by raising a child with special needs. A preliminary principle component analysis&#xD;
      revealed evidence for the two subscales. The LPP takes approximately10 minutes to complete by&#xD;
      the parent and is scored easily by the therapist. Two other questionnaires (Infant Toddler&#xD;
      Sensory Profile and Child Behavior Checklist) will be used to further investigate the impact&#xD;
      of child behaviors on parent participation. Occupational therapists treat numerous young&#xD;
      children with sensory processing abnormalities due to developmental delays. Sensory&#xD;
      processing is commonly understood to mean the process by which the brain receives and makes&#xD;
      use of all forms (tactile, auditory, visual etc.) of sensations to generate behavioral&#xD;
      responses to the environment. Research shows that between 45% and 96% of children with Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and other developmental disorders present with sensory&#xD;
      abnormalities, and sensory-related behaviors often drive referrals to occupational therapy.&#xD;
      The majority of research in this area focuses on school-age children with ASDs. The parents&#xD;
      of these children identify increased levels of stress and disruption to family life and&#xD;
      participation in routines as a result. Since family members are interdependent, each member's&#xD;
      ability to participate in occupations affects their own health and the health of the others.&#xD;
      There is virtually no research on how sensory abnormalities and sensory-driven behavior of&#xD;
      young children (0-3 years-old) affect parent participation in occupations. This is a critical&#xD;
      factor to occupational therapy intervention for young children and their families.3. Summary&#xD;
      of Project:The proposed study will use a pretest - intervention - posttest longitudinal&#xD;
      design to assess the sensitivity of the LPP to measure change. A previous study established&#xD;
      that the responses on the LPP were static over the short term (2-3 weeks) when there was no&#xD;
      focused intervention between pretest and posttest (Fingerhut, 2013). At pretest, parent&#xD;
      participants with children under the age of 3 will also be asked to complete the Infant&#xD;
      Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). This information will be&#xD;
      correlated with parent participation on the LPP to investigate the effect of these child&#xD;
      characteristics on parent participation.4. Study Procedures:Occupational therapist&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from pediatric occupational therapy clinics and early&#xD;
      intervention programs throughout Texas. Occupational Therapists (OTs) (n=30) will be&#xD;
      approached by the investigators to ask 2 parents from their current clients to complete the&#xD;
      LPP (n=60). If these parents identify issues that the therapist believes would be amenable to&#xD;
      family-centered intervention in a 3 month time frame the parents will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      longitudinal study. If not the therapist will continue to recruit until they enroll 2&#xD;
      parents. Parents with children under the age of 3 will also be asked to complete the ITSP and&#xD;
      CBCL at this initial stage. This information will be used to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      measured child characteristics on parental participation. The parents with children under the&#xD;
      age of 3 may also be enrolled into the longitudinal aspect of the study depending on the&#xD;
      issues they describe on the LPP. Parents with children under the age of 3 will continue to be&#xD;
      recruited until there are 50 participants.For parents recruited for the longitudinal aspect&#xD;
      of the study, the therapist will use the information from the LPP to further explore the&#xD;
      responses with the parents and then collaboratively establish one family-centered goal&#xD;
      related to an item or items on the LPP. The therapist will then design intervention to&#xD;
      address this goal in addition to the established intervention he or she was providing for the&#xD;
      child and family. The study researchers will provide information on family-centered&#xD;
      intervention, training, and strategies to assist the therapists in providing effective&#xD;
      family-centered intervention.Intervention will be provided for three months or until the&#xD;
      child's therapy is discontinued. At this point (3 months or discontinuation), the parent will&#xD;
      complete the LPP again. The therapist will complete a short survey including the goal&#xD;
      established, the intervention provided, and the observed outcome of the intervention.&#xD;
      Therapists will also be interviewed regarding their experience using the LPP to facilitate&#xD;
      family-centered intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis/ Study Questions1. Is there a significant positive change on the overall LPP&#xD;
      score for those parent participants whose intervention outcome was described as positive by&#xD;
      the therapist? (Wilcoxon signed ranks test). 2. Is there a significant positive change on the&#xD;
      LPP Items most closely related to the established goals for those parent participants whose&#xD;
      intervention outcome was described as positive by the therapist?(Wilcoxon signed ranks&#xD;
      test).3. Do levels of sensory processing as measured by the Infant Toddler Sensory Profile&#xD;
      (ITSP) correlate with parent participation as measured by LPP?4. Do levels of maladaptive&#xD;
      behavior, as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) correlate to levels of parent&#xD;
      participation as measured by the LPP?5. Does the pattern of sensory presentations as measured&#xD;
      by the ITSP correlate with maladaptive behaviors as measured by CBCL?Study data (demographics&#xD;
      and data) from LPP completion (pretest only for those in the longitudinal study) will be&#xD;
      added to data from previous studies (n= 162 + 60plus) for confirmatory principle component&#xD;
      analysis (oblique rotation).&#xD;
