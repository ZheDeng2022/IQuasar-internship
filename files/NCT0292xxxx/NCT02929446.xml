      Advances in surgical technique have led to a more complex surgery on patients with more&#xD;
      serious comorbidities and the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) is&#xD;
      considerable . The isolated effect of mobilization immediately after surgery has previously&#xD;
      not been studied. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of immediate mobilization&#xD;
      (within 2 hours after arrival to the postoperative recovery unit) after abdominal surgery and&#xD;
      also the patients and the staffs experiences of early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 300 Swedish-speaking,&#xD;
      adult patients (≥18 years) planned for elective open or robot assisted laparascopic abdominal&#xD;
      surgery with an expected anesthetic duration exceeding 2 hours are eligible for consecutive&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Patients who cannot mobilize independently before surgery, will be&#xD;
      excluded. Procedure: Randomization to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mobilization within 2 hours after arrival to the postoperative recovery unit after&#xD;
           surgery - to sit up as long as they can in a chair, or on the bedside + breathing&#xD;
           exercises standardized every hour, with a PEP-device or to&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mobilization within 2 hours after arrival to the postoperative recovery unit after&#xD;
           surgery - to sit up as long as they can in a chair, or on the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
           or to&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No mobilization - laying or sitting in bed with a maximum of 30° elevation of the head&#xD;
           rest. No mobilization out of the bed or breathing exercises until discharge or a maximum&#xD;
           of 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment: The primary outcomes are arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) over time and between groups. Secondary outcomes are arterial carbon&#xD;
      dioxide pressure (PaCO2), pH, bGlu, lactate (arterial blood gas sample) over time and between&#xD;
      groups; lung function assessed as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in the&#xD;
      one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) by a micro spirometer ( preoperatively and&#xD;
      the day after surgery); postoperative pneumonia and total length of stay at the postoperative&#xD;
      recovery unit and at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention both patients (n 25) and staff (n 20) will be interviewed about&#xD;
      experiences of early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance: If a fairly simple and cheap intervention, such as mobilization&#xD;
      immediately after open abdominal surgery, can lead to imporved oxygen saturation, shortened&#xD;
      stay at hospital in total, it should be included as a routine in postoperative care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 600 000 surgeries performed each year in Sweden. Advances in surgical&#xD;
      technique have led to a more complex surgery on patients with more serious comorbidities.&#xD;
      This, in turn, has led to longer operations, which expose patients to longer periods of&#xD;
      anesthesia. During anesthesia, muscle relaxant is used, the diaphragm is then relaxed and&#xD;
      abdominal contents are pressing against the muscle and lung tissue behind. This in&#xD;
      combination with surgery, supine position and immobilization during a longer period of time,&#xD;
      has a negative impact on the functional respiratory capacity (FRC) even after the surgery.&#xD;
      The ability to cough is eliminated and produced secretion remains in the airways increasing&#xD;
      the risk of airway closure. Therefore, the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications&#xD;
      (PPC) such as pneumonia, atelectasis (collapsed airways in the lungs) and respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency, is considerable. Mobilization (to sit, stand or walk) is recomended as an&#xD;
      intervention to improve and normalize breathing after surgery. However, the isolated effect&#xD;
      of mobilization immediately after surgery has previously not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that immediate mobilization (within 2 hours after arrival at the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery unit) after open or robot assisted laporascopic abdominal surgery will&#xD;
      affect respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Points of inquiry&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can mobilization or mobilization and breathing exercises (standardized every hour) with&#xD;
           a PEP-device, at a pressure of 10-15cmH2O positive expiratory pressure (PEP) affect&#xD;
           respiratory function ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can mobilization or mobilization and breathing exercises (PEP) reduce the prevalence of&#xD;
           postoperative pneumonia, shorten time at the recovery unit or total length of stay at&#xD;
           the hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do patients and staff expereience early mobilization after abdominal surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate whether mobilization&#xD;
      immediately after open or robot assisted laparascopic abdominal surgery can affect&#xD;
      respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients A total of 300 Swedish-speaking, adult patients (≥18 years) planned for elective&#xD;
      open or robot assisted laparascopic abdominal surgery with anesthetic time exceeding 2 hours&#xD;
      at Karolinska University Hospital Solna are eligible for consecutive enrollment in the study.&#xD;
      Patients who cannot mobilize independently before surgery will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure All patients will arrive at the postoperative recovery unit after the surgery where&#xD;
      the randomization will take place. Patients who are considered to be in need of non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation immediate after the surgery, or when mobilization is contradicted due to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, or if they arrive to the recovery unit after 6 pm, will not be considered&#xD;
      for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mobilization within 2 hours after arrival to the postoperative recovery unit after&#xD;
           surgery - to sit up as long as they can in a chair or on the bedside (if not possible to&#xD;
           mobilize to a chair) + breathing exercises with a PEP-device (standardized every hour at&#xD;
           a pressure of 10-15cmH2O) or to&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mobilization within 2 hours after arrival to the postoperative recovery unit after&#xD;
           surgery - to sit up as long as they can in a chair or on the bedside (if not possible to&#xD;
           mobilize to a chair).&#xD;
&#xD;
           or to&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No mobilization - that is laying in bed with a maximum of 30° elevation of the head&#xD;
           rest. No mobilization out of the bed or breathing exercises until discharge or a maximum&#xD;
           of 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions will continue during 4 hours and after that all patients will receive&#xD;
      the same treatment until they are transferred back to the surgical ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Baseline data such as age, sex, weight, smoking history, comorbidities,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)-classification, peripheral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) and results from a spirometry measurement will be collected during the meeting with&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist at the outpatient clinic two weeks prior to surgery. Treatment- and&#xD;
      patient care data such as need for analgesics, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory&#xD;
      rate will continually be registered in a bedside case report form. Time for, duration of and&#xD;
      frequency of mobilization will also be registered in the study protocol. Finally, information&#xD;
      of any deaths, respiratory complications such as pneumonia, patients' length of stay at the&#xD;
      recovery unit and at the hospital will be obtained from medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment The primary outcome is arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) (kPa) (6,7),&#xD;
      measured via arterial blood gas sample, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) , measured&#xD;
      peripherally with a pulse oximeter PaO2 and SpO2 assessed from arrival to the postoperative&#xD;
      recovery unit and thereafter every hour whith oxygen supply disconected for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2), ), pH, bGlu,&#xD;
      lactate (arterial blood gas sample) over time and between groups over time and between&#xD;
      groups; lung function assessed as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in the&#xD;
      one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) by a micro spirometer (preoperatively and&#xD;
      the day after surgery); number of patients with respiratory insufficiency, defined as SpO2&#xD;
      &lt;90%, or PaO2 &lt;8kPa and/or PaCO2 ≥6.5kPa measured without oxygen supply; postoperative&#xD;
      pneumonia and total length of stay at the wards and at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention both patients (n 25) and the staff (n 20) will be interviewed about&#xD;
      their experiences of early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The number of patients required to establish a statistical power of 80%&#xD;
      and a significance level of 5%, were 63 patients for each group. Parametric or non parametric&#xD;
      analyses will be used depending on data level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance If a fairly simple and cheap intervention, such as mobilization&#xD;
      immediately after open abdominal surgery, can lead to less postoperative complications,&#xD;
      shortened stay at the postoperative recovery unit, and at the hospital in total, it should be&#xD;
      included as a routine in postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The project has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in&#xD;
      Stockholm (Dnr: 2015/703-31/1, 2016/1831-32, 2016/2176-32, 2017/836-32). The patients will&#xD;
      receive verbal and written information about the study and informed consent forms will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participants.&#xD;
