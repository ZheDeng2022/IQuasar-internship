    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application to assist in the&#xD;
      prescription of topical corticosteroids (TCS), focusing on best fit choices of potency,&#xD;
      vehicle and volume. The mobile application will be developed from the results obtained in a&#xD;
      systematic literature review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      topical corticosteroid use. The quality of the guidelines will be assessed using the AGREE II&#xD;
      tool. After the app user enters in information concerning patients' rash location and desired&#xD;
      treatment duration, the app will generate a list of recommended topical steroids (focusing on&#xD;
      specific quantity and potency) for the patient's particular area of need. The objective of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate whether the use of a standardized application will change&#xD;
      prescribing practices for primary care physicians, physician assistants and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;

      Primary Study Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study to be measured would be topical&#xD;
      steroid prescription records (including unit sizes, potencies, and number of prescriptions)&#xD;
      from study participants before and during use of this app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Endpoints The study participants will also be asked to take surveys to rate&#xD;
      user satisfaction and clinical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps The literature has shown that patients with dermatologic&#xD;
      conditions may not receive appropriate management by PCPs. Dermatologic conditions are&#xD;
      common, affecting 20-36% of patients in PCP offices; however PCPs report diagnostic and&#xD;
      management uncertainty.1,2 PCPs have been shown to prescribe either inappropriately&#xD;
      high-potency TCS or, conversely, inappropriately low-potency TCS.3 In addition, it was&#xD;
      recently found that drug costs may be higher if multiple small tubes are dispensed over the&#xD;
      treatment course.4 Thus, there are opportunities to reduce cost by prescribing larger units,&#xD;
      when indicated; however PCPs may not have the knowledge to effectively and cost-efficiently&#xD;
      prescribe TCS. Teaching this information is not sufficient, since most (71%) medical schools&#xD;
      provided nine or fewer hours of instruction in the first two years.5 Importantly, mobile&#xD;
      devices and apps provide significantly increased access to point-of-care tools and, with use&#xD;
      by providers, demonstrate better clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes.6,7&#xD;
      Thus, our goal is to develop a point-of-care decision support app to educate PCPs while&#xD;
      facilitating evidence-based care and lower health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile application will be developed by a team at Penn State Hershey from the results&#xD;
      obtained in a systematic literature review and quality assessment of clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines for topical corticosteroid use. The quality of the guidelines will be assessed&#xD;
      using the AGREE II tool. After the app user enters in information concerning patients' rash&#xD;
      location and desired treatment duration, the app will generate a list of recommended topical&#xD;
      steroids (focusing on specific quantity and potency) for the patient's particular area of&#xD;
      need. It is ultimately up to the physician whether or not to follow or modify the recommended&#xD;
      suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale Smartphone applications are rising rapidly in popularity in the healthcare&#xD;
      field. 85% of clinicians are reported as owners of smart phones, with 50% of them using apps&#xD;
      in their practice.8 Use of smartphone technology and clinical decision support tools may mean&#xD;
      improvements in primary care practices by assisting in the standardization of the prescribing&#xD;
      practices for TCS while allowing dermatologists more availability for patients with higher&#xD;
      need.&#xD;

    <description>Practitioners will asked to use a novel application during their patient encounters over the next three months. This application should not modify treatment, it will only act as a vehicle to present evidence based research. Patients will not be subjects of this research, as the app is only presenting best practice which the physicians should be aware of.</description>
