    <textblock>
      Over 15 million family caregivers provide more than 85% of long-term care to older adults&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. Caregivers typically assume care&#xD;
      responsibilities without training or support and may in turn experience multiple health risks&#xD;
      including depression. Providing evidence-based caregiver supportive programs on a wide scale&#xD;
      basis is identified by the National Alzheimer's Plan Act as a national priority. One approach&#xD;
      is to augment existing community-based services for older adults with a caregiver&#xD;
      evidence-based program. Adult day service (ADS) is one such growing and critical&#xD;
      community-based option for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders but&#xD;
      which does not systematically address common caregiver challenges or burdens using&#xD;
      evidence-based programs. The purpose of the study is to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Adult Day Services (ADS) Plus to improve caregiver well-being and reduce depressive symptoms&#xD;
      compared to routine ADS use at 6 months; and 2) evaluate long-term maintenance effects of ADS&#xD;
      Plus at 12 months on caregiver well-being and depressive symptoms. ADS Plus consists of 5 key&#xD;
      components: care management, referral/linkage, education about dementia, situational&#xD;
      counseling/emotional support/stress reduction techniques, and skills to manage behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., rejection of care, agitation, aggression). Based on care challenges&#xD;
      identified by family caregivers, an &quot;ADS Plus Prescription&quot; is provided, a written document&#xD;
      detailing easy-to-use strategies to address specified care challenges and caregivers are&#xD;
      trained in their use. The proposed study will employ a practical trial design to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness and uptake of ADS Plus on a large scale. Thirty ADS programs throughout the&#xD;
      U.S. varying in geographic location and staffing levels will be involved. A total of 300&#xD;
      diverse caregivers (150 in 15 ADS Plus sites; 150 in 15 ADS usual care sites) will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers (CGs) provide 85% or more of the long-term care needs of older adults&#xD;
      including coordination, care transitions, hands-on assistance with daily care, health-related&#xD;
      services (e.g., wound care, medication management), financial support, monitoring on-site or&#xD;
      long-distance, managing challenging behaviors, and preserving quality of life. As conditions&#xD;
      worsen, CGs assume more extensive care responsibilities that can be time consuming,&#xD;
      physically demanding, and emotionally depleting. Although positive aspects of caregiving are&#xD;
      documented, on-going caregiving can be a source of chronic stress resulting in poor health,&#xD;
      lost income, psychological distress, and for those most distressed, increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGs typically provide care without formal support, have significant unmet needs, and limited&#xD;
      access to the knowledge and skills needed to care for older adults with complex conditions.&#xD;
      To date, most tested CG interventions have: a) focused on one disease state (e.g., dementia);&#xD;
      b) delivered interventions outside existing service settings/payment structures; c) required&#xD;
      extensive training of interventionists, d) had less reach to a mix of CGs/older persons; e)&#xD;
      required retooling of the intervention to enhance its implementation potential in real world&#xD;
      settings; and f) not been translated for delivery in community-settings nor sustained. The&#xD;
      study potentially overcomes these shortcomings by embedding an evidence-based approach in a&#xD;
      service and payment structure (adult day services [ADS]), addressing core needs of diverse&#xD;
      CGs of older adults with a mix of conditions, and evaluating outcomes of high relevance to&#xD;
      CGs (well-being, depression), older adults (behavioral symptoms), ADS (more days spent in&#xD;
      ADS) and society (reduction of nursing home placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult day services are a growing and important long-term care option. ADS is an important&#xD;
      community-based long-term care option for CGs and older adults with complex conditions&#xD;
      requiring daily assistance. ADS provides out-of-home, supervised, group services with the&#xD;
      goals of improving mood, well-being, and quality of life and enabling clients to remain at&#xD;
      home for as long as possible. ADS also aims to provide CGs &quot;respite&quot; from day-to-day care&#xD;
      responsibilities and is available during &quot;normal business hours,&quot; although some offer&#xD;
      flexible hours to meet the needs of working CGs. While some provide support groups and&#xD;
      educational opportunities, these activities are not consistently provided, systematically&#xD;
      integrated into routine practice, or evidence-based. Similarly, while some care planning may&#xD;
      occur at the time of client enrollment or annually, structured, consistent contacts with CGs&#xD;
      using standardized assessments and evidence-based approaches are not typically offered. The&#xD;
      intervention being evaluated, ADS Plus, is evidence-driven, embedded in ADS work flow, and&#xD;
      systematically addresses unmet CG needs that may boost ADS benefits for both CGs and older&#xD;
      adult clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study aims are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of ADS Plus to improve CG&#xD;
      well-being and reduce depressive symptoms compared to routine ADS use at 6 months; and 2)&#xD;
      evaluate long-term maintenance effects of ADS Plus at 12 months on CG well-being and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study aims will: 3) evaluate whether CGs using ADS Plus are more likely to&#xD;
      maintain relatives in ADS and less likely to place them in residential settings compared to&#xD;
      those in routine ADS over 12 months; 4) estimate ADS Plus costs and assess whether it results&#xD;
      in net financial benefits when compared to usual ADS at 6 and 12 months; 5) evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of ADS Plus on client behaviors and CG efficacy and upset managing symptoms; and 6)&#xD;
      evaluate theoretically-derived ( Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance&#xD;
      (RE-AIM) framework, Stress Process Model) mediational pathways of treatment change including&#xD;
      CG acceptance and staff adoption of ADS Plus over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of research design. The investigators propose a two group cluster randomized trial&#xD;
      using re-randomization and mixed methods to combine effectiveness and implementation&#xD;
      questions to enhance the yield of this translational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hybrid (also called a practical or embedded trial) will involve 30 ADS sites located&#xD;
      across the U.S. that will be randomized into two groups: 15 ADS programs will serve as&#xD;
      treatment sites and provide ADS services as usual and the ADS Plus intervention; 15 ADS&#xD;
      programs will serve as the control condition and will provide ADS as usual. Prior to&#xD;
      randomization, the investigators will carefully examine sites on important variables such as&#xD;
      size or capacity, location (urban, suburban, rural), percent of participants with a dementia&#xD;
      diagnosis, staff to client ratio, ownership structure, and how long each center has been&#xD;
      operating. The investigators will then implement re-randomization techniques to ensure&#xD;
      optimal balance between ADS Plus and control sites on these site-level factors. Each of 30&#xD;
      sites will enroll 15-23 CGs in the study, with the expectation that an average of 10 per site&#xD;
      will be retained at 6 months (43% attrition projected based on ADS Plus pilot and other CG&#xD;
      trials). This will yield a total of 300 retained participants (150 CGs in ADS Plus sites; 150&#xD;
      in ADS usual care sites) over a 2 year recruitment period. In accordance with the&#xD;
      translational focus, the inclusion criteria are purposely broad to reflect the real world&#xD;
      case mix of CGs using ADS such that any CG with an older relative (&gt;60 years) upon initial&#xD;
      intake and enrollment in a participating ADS will be eligible for study inclusion. Each of 30&#xD;
      ADS sites will designate a staff member to serve as research liaison for that site and&#xD;
      participate in 4 hours of paid training (via webinar). Research liaisons will be responsible&#xD;
      for informing CGs (at initial intake) of the study using Johns Hopkins University (JHU)&#xD;
      approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) scripts, recruitment letters and flyers. The&#xD;
      Research liaisons will provide a packet of study materials that will contain a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form, study flyer, study letter, consent to contact sheet. CGs expressing study&#xD;
      interest will sign an IRB approved form to agree to be contacted by study staff. Caregivers&#xD;
      will receive a telephone call from a JHU research interviewer. The interviewer will explain&#xD;
      study procedures, review the consent form that the caregiver has been provided in the packet.&#xD;
      If the caregiver is interested the staff will obtain verbal assent and instruct the caregiver&#xD;
      to sign the consent form with the date and time. If the CG is eligible and has signed the&#xD;
      consent and provided verbal assent a 45 minute baseline interview will be conducted either&#xD;
      immediately or at a time convenient for the CG yet within 1 week of screening. The consent&#xD;
      form will then be returned to the ADS site and scanned or faxed to JHU study staff. In&#xD;
      previous trials, the investigators found CGs can attend to an hour by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 15 ADS Plus sites will also designate a site interventionist and a backup interventionist&#xD;
      who will participate in up to one week of training (via webinar, on-line lectures) in ADS&#xD;
      Plus protocols. For those in ADS Plus sites, once the baseline interview is completed the JHU&#xD;
      project director will inform the site interventionist to contact that CG and begin ADS Plus&#xD;
      (to occur within 10 days from baseline interview). All CGs (treatment/control) will be&#xD;
      interviewed via telephone by JHU research staff at 3 months (interim check-in for retention&#xD;
      and collect data on key CG outcomes), 6 months (main trial outcome for CG benefits), and 12&#xD;
      months (long-term outcomes for older adult clients and CG). To evaluate implementation&#xD;
      processes, interviewers at the University of Minnesota (UoM) will administer a brief&#xD;
      checklist at 6 and 12-months to CGs (n=150) from the 15 ADS Plus sites and to the 15 ADS Plus&#xD;
      interventionists. Additionally, at 12-months the 15 ADS Plus interventionists will be&#xD;
      surveyed using semi-structured interviews by telephone to collect detailed process data on&#xD;
      treatment fidelity. These interviews will ascertain challenges and successes of administering&#xD;
      ADS Plus to identify areas to refine prior to ADS Plus dissemination in the final phases of&#xD;
      the proposed project. Also, at the conclusion of the randomized control trial (RCT), 20 of&#xD;
      150 CGs from the 15 ADS Plus sites will be purposively sampled (based on CG relationship,&#xD;
      gender, race/ethnicity, and cognitive impairment of client) to participate in a post-RCT&#xD;
      qualitative interview. A semi-structured telephone interview conducted by UoM interviewers&#xD;
      will explore how ADS Plus helped them (or not) and perceptions concerning effects of the&#xD;
      intervention for clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of ADS Plus. Theoretical Framework - ADS Plus draws upon the Pearlin et al.,&#xD;
      stress process model and its iteration in the NIH REACH trials. These models suggest that&#xD;
      factors such as care needs of older adults, behavioral symptoms, and/or CG health serve as&#xD;
      primary stressors for CGs. CGs evaluate whether external demands pose potential threats to&#xD;
      the older adult and/or themselves, and if so, whether they have sufficient coping mechanisms.&#xD;
      If CGs perceive external demands as threatening and their coping resources as inadequate,&#xD;
      they experience burden. The appraisal of stress is assumed to contribute to negative&#xD;
      emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that place CGs at risk for poor health,&#xD;
      diminished wellbeing and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery Characteristics - Families in settings assigned to intervention will receive ADS as&#xD;
      usual in addition to ADS Plus. ADS Plus consists of 5 key components: care management,&#xD;
      referral/linkage; disease education; counseling/emotional support/stress reduction, and care&#xD;
      skills managing daily challenges and behavioral disturbances (e.g., rejection of care). Each&#xD;
      component is tailored to CGs' unmet needs and care context. The intervention begins with two&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions with the appointed site interventionist to conduct a systematic needs&#xD;
      assessment from which to identify concerns and needs and develop an agreed upon care plan.&#xD;
      The interventionist then meets with CGs face-to-face at convenient times (e.g., when relative&#xD;
      is brought to or picked up at ADS) to implement the care plan, every other week for the first&#xD;
      3 months, and then for monthly reassessments for newly emerging care concerns thereafter.&#xD;
      Contact occurs at a minimum for about 1 hour per month over 12 months (face-to-face/&#xD;
      telephone). Targeted education materials concerning clients' conditions and related matters&#xD;
      are shared via email or traditional mail. The goal of each contact is to provide ongoing&#xD;
      emotional support, situational counseling, education about importance of taking care of self,&#xD;
      referrals/linkages and skills (e.g., stress reduction, behavioral management, how to talk&#xD;
      with doctors). The care planning process is collaborative and flexible, reflecting CG&#xD;
      fluctuating needs Usual care control group: CGs in the 15 sites assigned to serve as the&#xD;
      usual care control group will receive ADS as usual. As the study intent is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      added value of ADS Plus, comparing it to ADS (usual care) is appropriate and reflects the&#xD;
      translational purpose of the proposed study. Near completion of the study (project year 05),&#xD;
      control group sites will have the option of receiving training in ADS Plus for their setting.&#xD;
      As CGs in control sites would have completed the study prior to this training, it may benefit&#xD;
      these sites and their future clients/families but not those enrolled in the study.&#xD;
