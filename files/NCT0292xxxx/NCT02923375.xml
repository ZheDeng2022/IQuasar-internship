  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open label, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of two infusions of CYP-001, in adults who have steroid-resistant GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive standard of care treatment throughout the study, according to local&#xD;
      procedures. The first eight participants will be enrolled in Cohort A and receive a CYP-001&#xD;
      dose of 1 million cells per kg, up to a maximum dose of 100 million cells, on Day 0 and Day&#xD;
      7. Subject to a safety review of data from Cohort A, an additional eight participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled into Cohort B and receive a CYP-001 dose of 2 million cells/kg, up to a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 200 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. The primary evaluation period concludes for each&#xD;
      participant 100 days after the first dose of CYP-001. Participants will have study visits on&#xD;
      Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 100. Subsequently, participants will enter a long term&#xD;
      follow-up period, which concludes 2 years after the first dose of CYP-001.&#xD;

    <description>The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus™ platform technology. Cymerus™ refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus™ process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Progressive or relapsing haematological malignancy, a current solid tumour, or&#xD;
             previous malignant solid tumour that is likely to recur during the period of the study&#xD;
             (with the exception of a past history of basal or squamous cell carcinomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart failure (NYHA Functional Class II-IV) and/or pulmonary failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haemodynamically unstable and/or at high risk of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Terminal organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meningitis, pneumonia with hypoxemia, HIV or another severe or uncontrolled systemic&#xD;
             infection, which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to impact on the ability&#xD;
