  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve arm function in&#xD;
      children ages 6 to 17 with cerebral palsy and upper limb hemiparesis. Twenty participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either a group treated with neuromuscular electrical stimulation and&#xD;
      video games or video games alone. Both groups will receive 6 wks of treatment consisting of&#xD;
      home and lab sessions. Both the experiment group and control group interventions consist of&#xD;
      therapist-guided sessions in the rehabilitation clinic and self-administered or&#xD;
      caregiver-assisted sessions at home. While both groups will receive the same task practice&#xD;
      and video game training, only the experiment group will receive an electrical stimulation&#xD;
      device to assist with hand opening during practice. Changes in upper extremity motor&#xD;
      impairment and function will be assessed for each participant at baseline, mid treatment, end&#xD;
      of treatment and at 3 mo follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation clinic sessions - These will occur up to twice per week for the first 3 weeks&#xD;
      and once per week for the second 3 weeks of the 6 week treatment. They are therapist-guided&#xD;
      and last up to 90 min consisting of 45 minutes of contralaterally-controlled functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (CCFES)-mediated video games and up to 45 minutes of CCFES-mediated&#xD;
      functional task practice. Early sessions will focus on training the patient and caregiver to&#xD;
      self-administer play of a CCFES-mediated video game at home. As proficiency with one game&#xD;
      develops, more games will be introduced. The functional task practice part of the session&#xD;
      will engage the participant in using the CCFES system to assist them in practicing using&#xD;
      their hand in activities such as lacing beads, throwing balls, eating finger foods, and other&#xD;
      play and activities of daily living. Prior to the start of lab treatment, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess hand extensor and flexor muscle co-activation (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home sessions - These consist of CCFES-mediated hand opening and video game exercises with&#xD;
      caregiver assistance and supervision as needed. As proficiency develops and more games are&#xD;
      added, each home session will increase in duration up to 90 minutes per day, as determined by&#xD;
      the treating therapist based on the adherence of each participant. Self report of game&#xD;
      difficulty and engagement will be made at the completion of each game (see below)&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Assisting Hands Assessment Logit Score at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 time points: prior to treatment and at end of 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants played a game that required them to perform bimanual tasks while being video recorded. The amount of involvement of the affected arm is scored by viewing the video and converted into a logit score (0-100), with a higher value indicating a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Melbourne 2 Motor Assessment at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 time points: prior to treatment and at end of 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants perform 14 test tasks that require reach, grasp, release, and manipulation of simple objects. A video of the test is recorded for scoring across the 30 score items using a three, four or five point scale (higher values indicating better outcomes). Item scores relating to four elements of movement are measured and summed within the corresponding sub-scale. A percentage of the total score (range 0-100%) for each subscale is computed and reported separately, with higher values indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Box and Block Test Score at Treatment End</measure>
    <time_frame>2 time points: prior to treatment and after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Box and Blocks test counts how many times the participant can pick up 1 block at t time, move it over a partition, and release it in a target area within 60 seconds.&#xD;
The minimum score is 0. There is no maximum score. The average score of healthy individuals within the age range of this study ranges from 70 to 79.&#xD;
Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the score prior to treatment was subtracted from the score at 6 months after completion of treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Instrumented Sine Wave Finger Tracking Error at Treatment End</measure>
    <time_frame>2 time points: prior to treatment start and at end of treatment week 6.</time_frame>
    <description>Finger movement tracking is a method of measuring motor control. The degree of finger extension will be displayed as a cursor on a computer screen, its vertical position corresponding to the degree of finger extension. A sinusoidal trace having a frequency of 0.1 Hz (1 cycle in 10 seconds) will scroll across the screen. The amplitude of the sine-wave track will be scaled so that it oscillates between 15% and 85% of the participant's full active finger extension. The participant will be seated with the wrist and forearm stabilized in a neutral posture. The participant's task is to keep the cursor on or as close to the scrolling trace as possible by extending and flexing their index finger. The vertical distance between the cursor and the target trace will be calculated for every time point of data collected. The error for each 30-sec trial will be the average vertical distance that is equivalent to a percentage of volitional range of motion.</description>

    <measure>Number of Cumulative Hand Movement Repetitions During Game Play</measure>

        <description>Participants perform 14 test tasks that require reach, grasp, release, and manipulation of simple objects. A video of the test is recorded for scoring across the 30 score items using a three, four or five point scale (higher values indicating better outcomes).

A percentage of the total score (range 0-100%) for each subscale is computed and reported separately, with higher values indicating better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change in Instrumented Sine Wave Finger Tracking Error at Treatment End</title>
        <description>Finger movement tracking is a method of measuring motor control. The degree of finger extension will be displayed as a cursor on a computer screen, its vertical position corresponding to the degree of finger extension. A sinusoidal trace having a frequency of 0.1 Hz (1 cycle in 10 seconds) will scroll across the screen. The amplitude of the sine-wave track will be scaled so that it oscillates between 15% and 85% of the participant's full active finger extension. The participant will be seated with the wrist and forearm stabilized in a neutral posture. The participant's task is to keep the cursor on or as close to the scrolling trace as possible by extending and flexing their index finger. The vertical distance between the cursor and the target trace will be calculated for every time point of data collected. The error for each 30-sec trial will be the average vertical distance that is equivalent to a percentage of volitional range of motion.</description>

            <description>Contralaterally-controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES) enables patients with upper extremity hemiplegia to open their paretic hand by stimulating finger and thumb extensors with surface electrodes. CCFES is used during functional task practice and hand therapy video games to link motor intent with execution. Four intuitive and engaging games were developed to provide goal-oriented motor skill training, impairment-appropriate difficulty, and performance feedback that motivates iterative play and skill improvement.&#xD;
Contralaterally-controlled functional electrical stimulation: Contralaterally-controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES) is electrical stimulation of weak muscles of an impaired limb controlled via movement of the unimpaired contralateral limb.&#xD;
Hand therapy video games: Hand therapy video games are designed to provide therapy to weak muscles of an impaired limb via goal-directed movements.</description>
