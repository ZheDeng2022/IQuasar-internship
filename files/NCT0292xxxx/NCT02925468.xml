  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The correction of a deep overbite is assumed to involve incisor intrusion and the extrusion&#xD;
      or eruption of premolars and molars. The latter is also assumed to be the major contributor&#xD;
      for growing patients where the vertical facial growth increase accommodates for the&#xD;
      additional eruption of posterior teeth with anterior bite plane appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the nature and rate of adaptation of the occlusal changes following insertion&#xD;
      of a fixed anterior bite plane for the reduction of a deep overbite in growing patients will&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;

      All subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed of the study and written&#xD;
      consent sought for their participation. Subjects will be recruited from the new patient&#xD;
      clinics and routine treatment waiting list. A standard initial lateral cephalogram will be&#xD;
      taken of all subjects, unless this is already available within the specified age range.&#xD;
      Active growth will be determined using the Bacetti CVM method. For the Intervention group -&#xD;
      an intra-oral scanner will be used to accurately record the occlusal relationships prior to&#xD;
      insertion of the fixed anterior bite plane (T0) and repeated immediately after placement&#xD;
      (T1). Each subject will then be re-scanned on a six weekly basis for a period of six months&#xD;
      (T2-T5). Conventional clinical photographs and three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry will be&#xD;
      used to assess the vertical facial relationships at T0-T5. A further lateral cephalogram will&#xD;
      be taken at T5 to assess for skeletal change and assess for evidence of intrusion and&#xD;
      eruption as well as determine if there has been an alteration in incisor inclination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of subjects from the treatment waiting list who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be used. An intra-oral scanner will record the baseline occlusal relationship (T0) and&#xD;
      will be repeated after six months (T5). The control group will also have a standard&#xD;
      pre-treatment lateral cephalogram taken, as well as conventional and three-dimensional&#xD;
      stereophotogrammetry at baseline (T0) and after six months (T5). This will allow changes&#xD;
      resulting from growth to be assessed whilst no active orthodontic treatment has taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes to be assessed will be the nature of the change in occlusal-vertical&#xD;
      dimension and the rate of occlusal adaptation in relation to facial growth changes. The&#xD;
      intra-oral scans and photographs will be analysed using three-dimensional technology to&#xD;
      determine the immediate change and any resultant occlusal adaptation and change in lower face&#xD;
      height on a six weekly basis for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and guardians in the intervention group will be asked to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire immediately after visits T1 and T5. This will assess their experience of the&#xD;
      3-D scanning and bite planes (if applicable). We will also assess their knowledge of overbite&#xD;
      definition, process of overbite reduction and effects of an increased overbite on oral&#xD;
      health. The control group will be asked to complete the same questionnaire at T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic impact of managing the increased overbite as an initial phase of treatment&#xD;
      versus single phase comprehensive treatment will be investigated. A cost analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to investigate any economic difference in using bite turbos versus a removable&#xD;
      appliance to reduce the overbite.&#xD;
