  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A. Pancreatic cancer background In 2012, 1,172 new pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed&#xD;
      in Switzerland. Only 20% of the patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer are&#xD;
      candidates for surgical resection, the only potential treatment for cure. Over 30% of the&#xD;
      patients initially present with locally advanced disease. Patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      disease have no evidence of metastatic spread to the liver, lung, and peritoneum but present&#xD;
      with local involvement of vital structures that prohibits reasonable tumor resection.&#xD;
      Currently, those patients are evaluated for palliative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy.&#xD;
      However, even with best conventional medical therapy, median survival of patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced disease is mostly below 1 year. Over the last years, loco-regional therapies&#xD;
      gained increased attention including radiofrequency-, cryo-, and microwave ablation as well&#xD;
      as electrochemotherapy. However, all those entities are criticized by their complication&#xD;
      rates leading to morbidity and mortality, limited area of application given the complex&#xD;
      anatomical structures around the pancreas, and ill-defined improvements in overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Irreversible electroporation (IRE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation is an emerging ablative modality that gained enormous interest&#xD;
      over the last five years. For locally advanced pancreatic cancer, it was introduced in 2009.&#xD;
      IRE is mainly non-thermal and primarily works through apoptosis. Its well studied safety&#xD;
      profile allows ablation also within the context of locally advanced pancreatic cancer given&#xD;
      it mainly spares vessels from destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence shows that IRE for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is&#xD;
      effective compared to historic controls with a significant prolongation of local progression&#xD;
      free survival, distant progression free survival and overall survival. The improvement in&#xD;
      overall survival is about double the amount of what is seen with best new chemotherapy and&#xD;
      chemoradiation regimens used at the present time. Those results are even more impressive&#xD;
      given the discouraging improvements among palliative systemic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NanoKnife IRE device (Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY) is commonly used to perform IRE&#xD;
      procedures in pancreatic cancer patients and is commercially available since 2009 and got&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K clearance for soft tissue ablation in October 2011 in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Quality of life and nutritional status/long term outcomes Given the overall poor long-term&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures&#xD;
      are of utmost importance when treatment recommendations are discussed with patients. This is&#xD;
      especially true for patients with more advanced staged disease where definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection with curative intent is not possible. However, HRQoL reports for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing IRE are very limited. To the best of the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, no other specific investigations exist that assessed HRQoL measures&#xD;
      for patients undergoing IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, no specific assessment&#xD;
      exists that focuses on nutritional status for this patient group. In addition, impact on&#xD;
      local and distant recurrence as well as cancer-specific and overall survival are still&#xD;
      ill-defined and further information is needed.&#xD;
