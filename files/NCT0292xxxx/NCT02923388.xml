      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 in delaying&#xD;
      the onset and reducing the incidence and severity of Vincristine Induced Peripheral&#xD;
      Neuropathy (VIPN) in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is an emerging health burden for Bangladesh. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that about 20 million people are going to be affected annually by 2025 in&#xD;
      countries currently on developmental transition. Good prognostic outcome of ALL relies on&#xD;
      uninterrupted and complete course of chemotherapy. About 85% of adult patients and 98% of&#xD;
      children attain complete recovery with full course of treatment. One of the crucial&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents used to treat ALL is vincristine. It is needed to complete&#xD;
      vincristine with adequate dose in order to get a better prognostic outcome. About 45% of the&#xD;
      patients getting vincristine develop a deleterious side effect called Vincristine Induced&#xD;
      Peripheral Neuropathy (VIPN). Unfortunately, development of VIPN results in dose reduction,&#xD;
      protocol deviation and even abandonment of treatment with vincristine in some ALL patients.&#xD;
      Better prognostic outcome becomes an arcadia. So far, many researches have been conducted to&#xD;
      explore a way to prevent or treat VIPN. But still no conclusive recommendation can be made.&#xD;
      Therefore, VIPN has become an important issue need to be addressed. This study will be a&#xD;
      small effort to identify the potential of vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 as probable preventive&#xD;
      measures of VIPN. Evidence suggests that, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 two water soluble, non&#xD;
      toxic vitamins well recognized for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 plays&#xD;
      a very fundamental role in neurological function. It exerts its physiological effects through&#xD;
      mediating two principal enzymatic pathways by which it maintains the integrity of neuronal&#xD;
      membrane. On the other hand, vitamin B6 or pyridoxine is an essential co- factor in various&#xD;
      synthesis pathways including synthesis of myelin sheath. Patients will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      into two arms by using online research randomizer and newly diagnosed ALL patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this research. From the day of starting chemotherapy, patients on arm A&#xD;
      (Intervention arm) will be concurrently administered with vitamin B12 and vitamin B6. Vitamin&#xD;
      B12 will be given 500 Î¼g three times a week intravenously on a basis of every alternate day&#xD;
      except the day of receiving vincristine and vitamin B6 will be given 50 mg thrice daily&#xD;
      orally during the induction period (5 weeks) of chemotherapy cycle. On the other hand,&#xD;
      patients on arm B (Placebo arm) will be given placebo pill and intravenous placebo injection&#xD;
      at same interval. Prior to initiation of induction chemotherapy each participant will undergo&#xD;
      neuropathy evaluation per National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.4.0 scale and will be interviewed according to the neurotoxicity&#xD;
      subscale of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) -GOG- Ntx quality of life&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire. The participants will be re-evaluated once weekly on the outset of&#xD;
      2nd week, 3rd week, 4th and 5th week of vincristine chemotherapy during induction period.&#xD;
      They will be assessed per NCI-CTCAE v.4.0 scale for severity of neuropathy and by FACT- GOG-&#xD;
      Ntx by answering specific questions regarding the presence of tingling, numbness, pain,&#xD;
      muscle weakness and motor activities. As neuropathy and neuropathic pain are mostly&#xD;
      subjective issue rather than objective and reflected more comprehensively by the particular&#xD;
      person encountering with, so patient based measures will be used in this study. Incidence,&#xD;
      onset and severity of peripheral neuropathy will be compared on both arms.&#xD;
