      Residual Symptoms of Depression (SRD) are those symptoms that persist despite remission of&#xD;
      MDD. They are characterized by a high incidence (approx. 90% of patients in remission) at the&#xD;
      psychiatric clinic, have become a growing problem. Its presence is associated with a high&#xD;
      probability of relapse / recurrence and disability, as determined by decreased performance&#xD;
      and low quality of life. Their neglect has generated an increase in clinical and&#xD;
      socioeconomic costs, alerting the need for research to provide treatment strategies. The&#xD;
      application of different types of psychotherapy has been successful in abating SRD. The&#xD;
      present study aims to evaluate the clinical changes related to the application of music&#xD;
      therapy as a treatment of SRD, through a randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms&#xD;
      trial. Music Therapy (MT) is a psychotherapy provided by specialized health professionals,&#xD;
      and is defined as the clinical use of musical evidence-based interventions within a&#xD;
      therapeutic relationship. MT treatment group will design an application schema of 8 sessions&#xD;
      (2 hrs. Each) over a period of two months (one session per week). The control group will&#xD;
      receive the Usual Treatment (TU) which corresponds to the usual clinical psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment by the physician in the INPRF, with the same duration. The evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted with clinimetric testing at baseline, at the end of the track and after three&#xD;
      months of treatment. This study seeks to identify the presence of SRD in a Mexican sample and&#xD;
      explore a treatment designed for that purpose, also, show that the MT is a cost-effective&#xD;
      implementation can become a new clinical option to extend the possibilities of assistance and&#xD;
      deepen the investigation of this problem.&#xD;

      GENERAL PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical changes related to the application of music therapy as a treatment&#xD;
      for Residual Symptoms of Depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the pre and post treatment of residual symptoms by the HAM-D-21, BDI, SCL-90-R&#xD;
           and CIDRS levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the change of pre and post treatment obtained by the instruments for quality of&#xD;
           life (WHOQOL-BREF), functioning (GAF and PSP) and perceived stress (PSS) values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design - A randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms: the experimental group Music&#xD;
      Therapy (MT); and control group Usual (TU) treatment. MT treatment group will design and will&#xD;
      be completed in a period of two months, with an outline of 8 sessions (one per week). The TU&#xD;
      corresponds to the usual clinical psychiatric treatment (drug) assigned by the attending&#xD;
      physician in the INPRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION - patients attending the outpatient department of the National Institute of&#xD;
      Psychiatry &quot;Ramon de la Fuente&quot; between 20 and 45, considered in remission of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD) (DSM-IV) score ≤7 be included points on the Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Scale of (HAM-D-21) and / or ≤9 points in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which have had&#xD;
      a positive response to drug treatment and / or remain with pharmacotherapy phase continuation&#xD;
      or maintenance, and there report or detection of persistent residual symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, both participants in the control group and the experimental group, remain&#xD;
      drug therapy throughout the study according to the instructions of the attending physician,&#xD;
      so the period and type of administration shall be the sole decision of the same. In any case&#xD;
      this protocol assessments will be conducted as planned. In the case of any change in drug&#xD;
      therapy researchers take note of it for consideration in the final results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE - According to calculations made, the sample size is 48 patients. With an&#xD;
      allocation of 24 patients in each treatment (MT and UT). It is considered to recruit an&#xD;
      approximate previous historical studies in SRD sample (Fava et al., 1996; Fava et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size formula for &quot;comparison of two proportions&quot; (Fernández, 2001),&#xD;
      which was used as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = subjects required in each of the samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Za = Z value corresponding to the desired risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zb = Z value corresponding to the desired risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      p1 = Value of the proportion in the control group, placebo control or usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      p2 = Value of the proportion in the group of the new treatment, intervention or technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      p = average of the two proportions p1 and p2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a confidence level of 95% or safety was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effectiveness of standard treatment in preventing relapse (Fava et al was set at&#xD;
           32%., 1996; Paykel et al., 1999; Fava et al., 1998; Teasdale et al., 2000; Ma &amp;&#xD;
           Teasdale, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  was set at 70% of the desired effectiveness for MT in preventing relapse, considering&#xD;
           the performance of psychotherapies reported (Fava et al., 1996; Paykel et al., 1999;&#xD;
           Fava et al., 1998; Teasdale et al, 2000; Ma. &amp; Teasdale, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This accounted for 15% of subjects the possible loss of the sample according to the following&#xD;
      formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losses set to n = (1/1-R) shows&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = number of subjects lossless&#xD;
&#xD;
      R = expected loss ratio&#xD;

    <description>Music therapy (MT) treatment focuses on the use of 2 techniques of intervention: receptive MT and active MT. The work of receptive application is described as the use of prerecorded music or executed by the music therapist with effect on the patient, without the latter's active involvement in the psychotherapeutic process of musical creation. While the active application, both the music therapist and patient are involved in musical creation, for example, the use of voice, body and musical instruments (Muñoz, 2008). Contemplate their psychotherapeutic possibilities in 3 different dimensions of patient: body, emotional and social work, as explained above. Treatment with MT, as in cognitive behavioral therapy, includes breathing exercises, stress-relaxation techniques, psychoeducation, and exercises for the management of irrational thoughts and erratic behavior patterns (Dobson and Dozois, 2010).</description>
