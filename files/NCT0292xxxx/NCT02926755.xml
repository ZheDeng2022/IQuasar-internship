      The goal of this study is to use three (3) different imaging techniques:Fractional Flow&#xD;
      Reserve (FFR) allows precise measurement of blood flow in the arteries to the heart, and is&#xD;
      more reliable than pictures alone to determine the significance of blockages in the heart;&#xD;
      Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy-Intravascular Ultrasound (NIRS IVUS) provides information about&#xD;
      the amount of lipid and cholesterol in the plaque, and plaque volume; and Optical Coherence&#xD;
      Tomography (OCT) allows physicians to assess tears in the surface of plaque and plaque&#xD;
      thickness; to evaluate high risk non-infarct-related coronary lesion in patients who have&#xD;
      suffered a recent heart attack, underwent successful opening of the artery with a stent, and&#xD;
      have blockages greater than or equal to 50% in one or more of the other arteries to the&#xD;
      heart; and to correlate this findings with cardiovascular outcomes at 1 year.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open-label, single center registry. The study is designed to&#xD;
      characterize plaque (i.e., assess vulnerable plaque features such as plaque tears, plaque&#xD;
      thickness, plaque volume, and lipid content in plaque) in heart arteries in patients who have&#xD;
      suffered a recent acute heart attack, and who have blockages &gt;50% in one or more of the other&#xD;
      arteries in the heart. The procedure to do this will not be the same procedure that was done&#xD;
      to open the artery that caused the heart attack, but will be scheduled 2-40 days after the&#xD;
      first procedure, depending on the urgency to evaluate the other arteries and the stability of&#xD;
      the patient after the first procedure. The study will specifically evaluate the plaque&#xD;
      characteristics in the arteries that didn't cause the heart attack, to see if these arteries&#xD;
      have vulnerable plaque and is at risk for future heart attacks. If FFR shows abnormal blood&#xD;
      flow, these arteries will be treated with stents. All patients will be followed for 12 months&#xD;
      after the second catheterization. The purpose of the study is to determine how commonly&#xD;
      vulnerable plaques are identified in patients with acute heart attacks, and how often these&#xD;
      lead to future cardiac problems. Identification of plaque features that lead to future&#xD;
      problems may allow the development of new medications and devices to prevent future heart&#xD;
      attacks and death. These same plaque features are also thought to be operative in patients&#xD;
      with blockages in the arteries to the brain, so this study may have important implications&#xD;
      for stroke prevention as well. All patients will be considered eligible for participation if&#xD;
      they had a recent acute heart attack resulting from complete occlusion of an artery to the&#xD;
      heart, if the stent procedure to open the artery was successful, and if they have blockages &gt;&#xD;
      50% in at least one other major heart artery. Patients will not be eligible for participation&#xD;
      if they are too unstable with regard to heart, lung, brain, or kidney function, or if they&#xD;
      have previous bypasses to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In selected patients, Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) will be performed after the initial&#xD;
      procedure to open the artery within 40 days. CCTA images will be evaluated for plaque&#xD;
      characteristics, and correlated with the invasive findings.Fractional flow reserve via&#xD;
      computed tomography (FFRCT), a non-invasive computed tomography method of measuring blood&#xD;
      flow in the blocked arteries; will also be determined and correlated with invasive FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard portion of the procedure includes the angiogram (X-ray pictures of the&#xD;
      arteries), FFR (measurement of blood flow in the artery), IVUS and/or OCT (to assess the&#xD;
      diameter of the artery and the size of the stent), medications, and all office visits. The&#xD;
      research portion of the study requires all imaging studies be performed (NIRS IVUS, OCT, FFR)&#xD;
      rather than just one or two of these imaging studies, and the CCTA.&#xD;
