    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility of a large study of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically&#xD;
      ill children. Children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit who are expected to&#xD;
      require mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours will be randomized to intravenous&#xD;
      pantoprazole 1 mg/kg or matching placebo once daily until they no longer need mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite sparse pediatric data on the effectiveness of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, 60% of critically ill children receive these medications.&#xD;
      This may have unintended consequences - increasing the risk of nosocomial infections - which&#xD;
      may be more serious and common than bleeding these drugs are prescribed to prevent. A large&#xD;
      randomized trial (RCT) is needed to assess the balance of these risks and benefits, to&#xD;
      determine if a strategy of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill children is&#xD;
      not inferior to a strategy of routine stress ulcer prophylaxis. RCTs in pediatric critical&#xD;
      care are exceptionally challenging to complete; thus, a rigorous pilot RCT is crucial. The&#xD;
      pilot may prevent pursuit of a trial that is ultimately not feasible - which is ethically and&#xD;
      financially responsible. It is more likely that this carefully designed pilot trial will&#xD;
      ensure that the larger trial we undertake is successful.&#xD;
