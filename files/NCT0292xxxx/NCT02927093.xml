    <textblock>
      The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) provides care to refugees and migrant populations&#xD;
      along the Thai-Burma border since 1986. Services include antenatal and birthing care, with&#xD;
      2,500 births per year and Special Care Baby Units (SCBU) set up in 2008; all medical records&#xD;
      including clinical and laboratory data are archived. The treatment of neonatal jaundice is&#xD;
      based on treatment thresholds adapted from the neonatal jaundice guidelines, published by the&#xD;
      Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK. Total serum bilirubin (SBR) is done at&#xD;
      regular intervals to monitor neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) evolution, following SMRU&#xD;
      guidelines. The SCBU have been set up to provide intensive care for neonates in a resource&#xD;
      constrained setting and don't have equipment for assisted ventilation other than oxygen&#xD;
      therapy. Neonates presenting with high serum bilirubin levels and/or clinical signs of acute&#xD;
      bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) cannot receive exchange transfusion on site and have to be&#xD;
      referred to the Thai general hospital one hour drive from the clinics; and, for those&#xD;
      neonates surviving, there has not been a systematic follow-up of their growth and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a matched case-control series and a retrospective review of SCBU&#xD;
      charts of neonates with NH reaching exchange transfusion threshold. The SCBU database will be&#xD;
      searched for neonates born at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation hospitalized for phototherapy between&#xD;
      January 2009 and December 2014; charts will be manually researched to identify study&#xD;
      participants which will be classified as NH reaching exchange transfusion threshold (cases)&#xD;
      or as NH within moderate threshold (controls). Additionally neurological signs compatible&#xD;
      with ABE will be searched in the clinical notes and coded as present/absent. Cases discharged&#xD;
      alive from the SCBU will be traced back to evaluate their clinical and neurocognitive long&#xD;
      term outcome. Each case will be matched with a moderate NH control from the same clinic, sex,&#xD;
      gestational age and season of birth and hospitalized within the same month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will help to improving the clinical care during the neonatal period&#xD;
      and to developing a guideline for a better follow-up of children with NH reaching exchange&#xD;
      transfusion threshold.&#xD;

      The study will consist of a matched case-control series and a retrospective review of SCBU&#xD;
      charts of neonates with NH reaching exchange transfusion threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCBU database will be searched for neonates born at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation hospitalized&#xD;
      for phototherapy between January 2009 and December 2014. The SCBU charts of these neonates&#xD;
      will be manually researched to identify study participants which will be classified as NH&#xD;
      reaching exchange transfusion threshold (cases) or as NH within moderate threshold&#xD;
      (controls). Additionally neurological signs compatible with ABE that would likely be reported&#xD;
      by the clinical staff will be searched in the clinical notes and coded as present/absent;&#xD;
      those signs are: sleepiness, irritability, apnea, convulsions, abnormal position/tone, and&#xD;
      abnormal cry. Those charts will be included into the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases discharged alive from the SCBU will be traced back to evaluate their clinical and&#xD;
      neurocognitive long term outcome. Each case will be matched with a moderate NH control from&#xD;
      the same clinic, sex, gestational age and season of birth and hospitalized within the same&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both will be examined clinically and findings reported on a standardized forms, their visual&#xD;
      function will be tested using the Cardiff acuity and contrast cards and their neurocognitive&#xD;
      development will be assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales-Extended revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal demographics and additional birth variables (i.e. birth asphyxia, type of delivery,&#xD;
      breastfeeding) will be extracted from the antenatal care database and added to the selected&#xD;
      cases; laboratory results (G6PD deficiency, ABO incompatibility, haematocrit) are stored in&#xD;
      the SCBU database and will be retrieved. The general characteristics, the trajectory of SBR,&#xD;
      and the neonatal outcome will be described.&#xD;
