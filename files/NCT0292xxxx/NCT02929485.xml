  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are looking at how people make decisions about&#xD;
      reward-related items, both monetary and food related after taking either the dopamine agonist&#xD;
      bromocriptine or the COMT inhibitor tolcapone, in healthy control subjects. Subjects will&#xD;
      fill self-report questionnaires and undergo an MRI scan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to understand how the brain's dopamine system impacts monetary and&#xD;
      food-related decision making. The investigators aim to use tolcapone and bromocriptine due to&#xD;
      the temporary change in the levels of dopamine in the brain. The investigators also aim to&#xD;
      determine if genetics, personality traits, or a family history of alcoholism change how these&#xD;
      drugs affect decision making.&#xD;
