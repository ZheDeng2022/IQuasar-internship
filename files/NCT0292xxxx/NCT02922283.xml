  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cell infiltration of tumor lesions is a known prognostic factor in several tumor types and&#xD;
      is used as treatment mechanism in some of these tumor types. In metastatic melanoma,&#xD;
      treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors induces clinical benefit in about 30-50% of the&#xD;
      patients. These immune-based therapies are however accompanied by serious immune-related&#xD;
      adverse events and high costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor infiltrating T cells express the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor on their&#xD;
      surface. These T cells could therefore be visualized by molecular imaging with a&#xD;
      radio-labelled ligand for this receptor. For this purpose, the investigators have developed&#xD;
      the PET tracer [18F]FB-IL2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study commences with a biodistribution study (phase 1) in 5 subjects. Thereafter the main&#xD;
      study (phase 2) starts, in which 25 subjects will receive two [18F]FB-IL2 PET scans at&#xD;
      baseline and week 6 of treatment with either ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or the&#xD;
      combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. If [18F]FB-IL2 PET is able to detect a response to&#xD;
      treatment, it could serve as a non-invasive early indicator of T cell response to the&#xD;
      treatment. Besides, accumulation of the PET tracer in non-target tissue could indicate&#xD;
      infiltration of activated T cells in normal organs and thus may predict the development of an&#xD;
      immune-related adverse event.&#xD;

    <description>Biodistribution and kinetics will be assessed in the first five patients that participate in this trial (phase 1). A 60-minute dynamic PET scan of the chest and 2 total-body PET scans at 60 and 120 minutes will be acquired to determine tracer kinetics and residence time of the tracer in major organs.</description>

    <measure>The ability of the [18F]FB-IL2 PET to detect a treatment-induced immune response in tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For detection of a treatment-induced immune response the absolute tracer uptake in tumor lesions will be compared between the scan at baseline and the scan after 6 weeks of treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2 with the number of IL2 receptor positive immune cells.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of IL2 receptor positive cells will be scored by immunohistochemical staining of tumor biopsy material and will be correlated to the tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2 with response to therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The increase in tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2 ofu the tumor lesions on the PET scan at baseline and week 6 of treatment with immunotherapy, will be correlated to radiological response as measured on the CT scans at week 6, 12 and 16 according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To analyze heterogeneity in immune response to treatment between separate lesions, as determined by [18F]FB-IL2 PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both the heterogeneity between separate lesions in one patient and between lesions in different patients will be determined and if possible will be correlated to treatment response (lesion based).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment induced immune cell activation in non-target tissues and if possible the correlation of PET observations with side effects related to the tissue involved.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment induced immune cell activation in non-target tissue will be determined by visually comparing the PET results at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. In regions with a higher tracer uptake on the week 6 scan the absolute uptake will be determined and this will be correlated to the development of an immune-related adverse event. In case of immune-related side effects localized to the skin or colon, biopsy samples are optional and tissue infiltration of IL2 receptor positive cells can be correlated to [18F]FB-IL2 uptake on PET.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events of [18F]FB-IL2 PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded. Vital signs and blood parameters will be determined before and after tracer injection and directly after the PET scan for safety reasons.</description>
