      Patients with persistent symptoms of cerebrospinal-fluid leakage (positional headache,&#xD;
      photophobia, nausea and vomiting, clear drainage from the wound, fluctuant subcutaneous&#xD;
      wound) after a primary repair should be considered for revision surgery to avoid potentially&#xD;
      serious complications including CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) fistula formation. Prolonged bed&#xD;
      rest immediatel after reapir of an ID () incidental durotomy) is widely accepted and&#xD;
      frequently applied. current literature provides supporting retrospective evidence that&#xD;
      prolonged bed rest may not be required after watertight closure of dural tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to further investigate the impact of prolonged bed rest on the&#xD;
      need for early reoperation following primary repair of an ID after lumbar spinal surgery. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is the difference in reoperation rate between the two study&#xD;
      groups to further investigate if either one or the other postoperative mobilisation regimen&#xD;
      provides a significant benefit in terms of persistent dural leakage.&#xD;

      Patients with persistent symptoms of cerebrospinal-fluid leakage (positional headache,&#xD;
      photophobia, nausea and vomiting, clear drainage from the wound, fluctuant subcutaneous&#xD;
      wound) after a primary repair should be considered for revision surgery to avoid potentially&#xD;
      serious complications including CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) fistula formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent retrospective case series of 42 patients Radcliff et al. reported an increase in&#xD;
      medical complications including pneumonia and wound infections associated with prolonged bed&#xD;
      rest Current literature does not provide prospective nor retrospective evidence on the&#xD;
      influence of early mobilization on complications or reoperation rate after ID (incidental&#xD;
      durotomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged bed rest is widely accepted and frequently applied after ID. Contrarily, current&#xD;
      literature provides supporting retrospective evidence that prolonged bed rest may not be&#xD;
      required after watertight closure of dural tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to further investigate the impact of prolonged bed rest on the&#xD;
      need for early reoperation following primary repair of an ID after lumbar spinal surgery. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is the difference in reoperation rate between the two study&#xD;
      groups to further investigate if either one or the other postoperative mobilisation regimen&#xD;
      provides a significant benefit in terms of persistent dural leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as an unblinded, prospective randomised cohort trial. The treatment&#xD;
      arms consist of either strict prolonged bed rest for 48 hours or immediate postoperative&#xD;
      mobilisation. Patients are going to be randomised into either treatment arm after&#xD;
      intraoperative verification of ID. Randomization into either treatment arm is going to be&#xD;
      performed in a consecutive alternating manner. The according mobilisation regimen is going to&#xD;
      be prescribed by the surgeon performing the index procedure immediately after wound closure&#xD;
      as a standard option in the institutions proprietary hospital information system. Symptoms of&#xD;
      persisting liquor leakage are going to be assessed by Investigator. Additional confirmation&#xD;
      via MRI scan is routinely performed if persistent leakage is suspected and revision surgery&#xD;
      is planned. For Patients with symptoms of persisting dural leakage after a 48 hours course of&#xD;
      early mobilization a course of 24 hours of bed rest will be administered before revision&#xD;
      surgery is scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various case series, as well as large pro- and retrospective studies have been published&#xD;
      describing incidence, intraoperative management as well as long- and short term outcome of&#xD;
      ID. In addition, current literature provides retrospective evidence and small case series&#xD;
      considering benefit and adverse events of prolonged bed rest after primarily recognised and&#xD;
      repaired ID. To our knowledge this is the first prospective randomised trial to further&#xD;
      investigate the impact of immediate mobilisation on the incidence of persistent cerebrospinal&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
