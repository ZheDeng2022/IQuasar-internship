      Presbyopes (people who might have a significant loss of their ability to accommodate their&#xD;
      crystalline lens in the eye) will be recruited to wear a test lens and perform typical&#xD;
      clinical tests of visual acuity with different luminance levels and viewing distances/angles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the proposed study we plan to recruit presbyopes (people who might have a significant loss&#xD;
      of their ability to accommodate their crystalline lens in the eye) to wear a test lens and&#xD;
      perform typical clinical tests of visual acuity with different luminance levels and viewing&#xD;
      distances/angles. These are similar to the typical examinations conducted for regular contact&#xD;
      lens wearers. Results of this testing will be used to evaluate the efficacy of test lenses&#xD;
      and to provide additional information for revision of test lenses. If shown to provide&#xD;
      adequate eye comfort and intended vision correction, this lens design has the potential of&#xD;
      allowing tens of millions of presbyopes to adapt to contact lenses and significantly improve&#xD;
      their vision and well-being.&#xD;
