      The purpose of this study is to see if adding Mindfulness training to diabetes education&#xD;
      reduces feelings of stress and makes it easier to adhere to healthy behaviors that improve&#xD;
      diabetes outcomes (such as hemoglobin A1c).&#xD;

      Background: One million Veterans (25%) who receive health care through Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VHA) have diabetes and are therefore responsible for daily diabetes&#xD;
      self-management (DSM). DSM is essential for glycemic control and prevention of potentially&#xD;
      life threatening and disabling complications such as severe hypoglycemia, kidney failure,&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome and stroke. Importantly, 40% of individuals with diabetes suffer from&#xD;
      diabetes-related distress (DRD) that interferes with their ability to sustain healthy&#xD;
      self-management behaviors, and may be particularly problematic for Veterans who are at higher&#xD;
      risk for comorbid negative emotional states such as depression and post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has traditionally contained little content or&#xD;
      skill-building directly related to stress management, leaving this critical component of&#xD;
      diabetes self-management largely unaddressed in DSME. In the investigators' pilot work, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed a brief stress management intervention known as Mind-STRIDE,&#xD;
      which contains mindfulness training and home practice and is easily integrated into existing&#xD;
      DSME. While the investigators have previously demonstrated the feasibility, patient&#xD;
      acceptability, and initial efficacy of Mind-STRIDE, its effects on diabetes-related&#xD;
      psychological and physiological patient outcomes remain unknown. There is, therefore, a&#xD;
      critical need to determine the efficacy of this targeted mindfulness intervention for&#xD;
      improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM behaviors, and metabolic control of Veterans with&#xD;
      diabetes in order to offer comprehensive, evidence-based DSME that improves Veteran-centric&#xD;
      diabetes outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of Mind-STRIDE for&#xD;
      improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM, and metabolic control, and to characterize&#xD;
      distinctive Veteran experiences with DRD and Mind-STRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To achieve these objectives, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of 126 Veterans at a large VA medical center in southwest PA. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two study conditions: an experimental group that receives routine diabetes&#xD;
      education plus Mind-STRIDE, or to a usual care group that receives diabetes education alone.&#xD;
      DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, and DSM will be assessed using self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
      Metabolic control (Hemoglobin A1c) will be assessed using standard laboratory procedures.&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks, and will be analyzed using&#xD;
      mixed-effects models. Telephone interviews will be conducted at 15-weeks post-intervention in&#xD;
      a subset of participants from the experimental group, and will be analyzed using modified&#xD;
      Grounded Theory methods. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be compared and&#xD;
      interpreted using Convergent Parallel Design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status: Assessments were completed 4/09/2020.&#xD;

    <measure>Diabetes Self-efficacy Scale (DSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item psychometrically validated self-report questionnaire on a 10- point Likert Scale (1= Not confident at all; 10 = Totally confident). This scale measures diabetes self efficacy, a critical pathway to improved self-management that refers to an individual's confidence in their ability to perform key diabetes self-management behaviors. Scores are derived as the mean of the 8 questions. Minimum score =1; Maximum Score = 10. Higher scores denote higher diabetes self-efficacy.</description>

          <description>Comorbidity: 21-item Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) predicts one-year mortality based on age range (&lt;40=0;&gt;70=4), and comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes with/without complications; MI, stroke, solid tumor with/ without metastasis). Each condition is assigned a score of 1 to 6 depending on the magnitude of its associated1-yr mortality risk. Scores are summed and range from a minimum Score of 1 (since all participants had diabetes) to a maximum of 37 for highest risk for age and each condition. Higher scores reflect greater risk, with scores ≥5 representing more severe risk.</description>

        <description>An 8-item psychometrically validated self-report questionnaire on a 10- point Likert Scale (1= Not confident at all; 10 = Totally confident). This scale measures diabetes self efficacy, a critical pathway to improved self-management that refers to an individual's confidence in their ability to perform key diabetes self-management behaviors. Scores are derived as the mean of the 8 questions. Minimum score =1; Maximum Score = 10. Higher scores denote higher diabetes self-efficacy.</description>

        <title>Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)</title>
        <description>A 15-item psychometrically validated questionnaire on a 6-point Likert scale (1=Almost Always and 6= Never) The scale is scored by computing the mean of the 15 items. (Minimum score = 1; maximum score = 6). Higher scores reflect higher levels of dispositional (trait) mindfulness. Average score in the general US population is 4.22. Mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations.</description>

        <population>Number analyzed differs in one or more rows from overall number analyzed due to attrition and missed or abbreviated visit. One participant had to leave the 24 week visit after completing just 3 of the questionnaires and before completing the other questionnaires. He was then lost to follow-up. He was retained in the Intention-to-Treat analysis since 3 assessments including the primary outcome assessment were completed.&#xD;

        <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) is a standardized, validated scale that assesses 8 key symptoms of depression experienced over the prior two weeks on a 4-point Likert scale (0=not at all; 3= nearly every day). It is the same as the PHQ-9, without the question regarding suicidal ideation. Score is the sum of the 8 items (Minimum value =0; Maximum= 24). A score of 10 or greater is considered major depression, 20 or more is severe major depression.</description>

Minimum maximum values = (0= no days; 7 = 7 days). 1 item is scored as mean number of days (Minimum score =0; maximum score = 7), while the 2nd item is summed and reversed (0= 7days; 7= 0 days). The scores for the two items are summed for the subscale score (Minimum score=0; maximum score =7) Higher scores denote healthier dietary behaviors.&#xD;

          <description>A 2-item subscale of the SDSCA that measures 1) whether the participant smoked even a puff of a cigarette in the past 7 days (0=no; 1= yes) and 2) if so, the number of cigarettes smoked on an average day. The scores are summed. Minimum score =0, maximum score = &gt;40. Lower scores denote healthier smoking behaviors.</description>
          <population>Differing sample sizes are due to attrition and missed research visits or incomplete assessment. Two participants in the DSME + Mind-STRIDE intervention group did not complete the Smoking subset of the SDSCA because they do not smoke.</population>

        <description>Seven psychometrically tested items on a 4 point Likert scale that measure difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep (0= none; 4=very severe) and satisfaction with current sleep patterns (0=very satisfied; 4=very dissatisfied), Noticeable impairment of quality of life (0= not noticeable; 4= very much noticeable), Worry/distress re: sleep (0=not at all worried; 4=very much worried); Interference of sleep problem to daily functioning (0=not interfering; 4= very much interfering). Scores are summed. Minimum score = 0; maximum score = 20). Higher scores denote greater insomnia severity. Scores over 14 denote insomnia; Scores 8 to 14 denote subthreshold insomnia.</description>
