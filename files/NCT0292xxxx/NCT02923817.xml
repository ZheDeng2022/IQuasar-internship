  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to determine whether autologous mononuclear cells deriving from the&#xD;
      bone marrow are effective in the treatment of spinal cord injury.&#xD;

      Recruitment process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators selects the candidate of the study that fulfill the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      not violate any exclusion criteria from patients with spinal cord injury that admitted to the&#xD;
      department of neurosurgery - Danang hospital. The investigators then ask the patients and&#xD;
      patients family for informed consent. The patients that submit the informed consent to&#xD;
      participate is recruited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients is moved to operation theater at the day of the procedure. The bone marrow of&#xD;
      the patients is harvested by two investigators. The mononuclear cells of the bone marrow is&#xD;
      extracted from the bone marrow by using gravity centrifugation with Ficoll Paque 1.073. The&#xD;
      mononuclear cells is transferred to 5 mL syringe and handed back to the investigator. The&#xD;
      investigator will transplant the whole cell preparation back to the patients by lumbar&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final supernatant layer of the preparation is also sent to the lab for microbiological and&#xD;
      endotoxin testings. One small portion of the cell preparation is sent to the laboratory for&#xD;
      cell count and cluster of distribution tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is transferred back to the patient room and monitor for the outcomes at 2 weeks,&#xD;
      4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months. All of the data is entered, stored and monitored via&#xD;
      the eCB database system of TRI Cente, Kobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list is prepared for each subject with the name of AE developed, its severity and&#xD;
      seriousness, causal relationship with the treatment, and outcome. In addition, the incidence&#xD;
      of AEs in all cases and the 95% confidence interval are estimated. For each AE type, the&#xD;
      incidence, incidence by severity, and incidence by seriousness are calculated in addition to&#xD;
      estimation of the rate of each AE and its 95% confidence interval in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding secondary endpoints, the Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to compare the baseline&#xD;
      value at registration and value at 6 months after cell transplantation. In addition, assuming&#xD;
      the scores in each secondary endpoint to be consecutive scores, a linear mixed model with&#xD;
      time point as a fixed effect and cases as random effects is fitted to the data at&#xD;
      registration and 2 and 6 months after cell transplantation after assuming an appropriate&#xD;
      covariance structure between time points to assess their chronological changes.&#xD;
