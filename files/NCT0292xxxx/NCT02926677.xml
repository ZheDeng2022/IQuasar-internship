  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine three treatment conditions for traumatized youth:&#xD;
      Cue-Centered Treatment (CCT), Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), and&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TAU) to determine which treatment works most effectively for which youth.&#xD;
      The investigators would like to determine feasibility of training on the treatment&#xD;
      interventions. In addition, this study aims to inform development of systems of care for&#xD;
      chronically traumatized youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to determine whether 1) TF-CBT and CCT will have better outcomes than&#xD;
      TAU, 2) Child characteristics predict better outcome in either TF-CBT or CCT and to identify&#xD;
      which phases of treatment are most effective, and 3) Imaging findings will be predictors of&#xD;
      improved outcome. This research is important because while there are many existing trauma&#xD;
      interventions for youth, little is known about what is most essential in those interventions.&#xD;
      This study will shed light on what components of treatment are most effective. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there are minimal guidelines on how to select the most appropriate intervention for a&#xD;
      particular child. This study will contribute to that knowledge by informing which&#xD;
      interventions are suited best for which youth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The children will be referred from Stanford Youth Solutions and University of California, San&#xD;
      Francisco. Caregivers will undergo a telephone screening according to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Written consent for participation will be obtained from participants,&#xD;
      parents and/or legal guardians. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      treatment conditions: TF-CBT, CCT, or TAU. Assessments will be administered at 4 time points:&#xD;
      1) pre-treatment, 2) mid-therapy, 3) post-treatment, and 4) three month follow-up. A&#xD;
      medical/developmental history form will be completed only pre-treatment. The UCLA PTSD&#xD;
      Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) parent and child versions will be used to assess exposure to&#xD;
      traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Given that trauma has high comorbidity&#xD;
      with depression and anxiety disorders these symptoms will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).&#xD;
      Executive functioning will be assessed by both child and parent report using the Behavioral&#xD;
      Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) will be conducted at each of these&#xD;
      time points to assess tasks of working memory, response inhibition, and facial recognition.&#xD;
      The investigators will be using the NIRScout which is a portable NIRS recording unit. NIRS&#xD;
      technology uses specific wavelengths of light, introduced at the scalp, to enable the&#xD;
      noninvasive measurement of changes in the relative ratios of deoxygenated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (deoxy-Hb) and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in the capillary beds during brain activity.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in UCLA Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reaction Index for DSM 5 (Child Self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM 5 is a 31 item self-report measure with child and caregiver versions. The total severity score ranging from 0-80 is obtained by summing the four symptom category sub-scales (criteria B, C, D, &amp; E). A higher score corresponds to greater PTSD severity. The items map onto the DSM 5 criteria for PTSD as well as assessing for dissociative subtype.</description>

    <description>The UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM 5 is a 31 item self-report measure with child and caregiver versions. Scores range from 0 to 80 (higher score indicates more sever PTSD symptoms). The items map onto the DSM-V criteria for PTSD as well as assessing for dissociative subtype.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Children's Depression Inventory (CDI 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDI 2 is a 28 item self-report measure that assesses depressive symptoms in the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0-2 and all items are summed to obtain the total score (total score range: 0-54; a score of 19 or higher is suggestive of clinical depression). The survey contains questions related to negative mood, negative self-esteem, interpersonal problems, anhedonia, and ineffectiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MASC 2 is a 50 item self-report measure assessing anxiety in the following sub-scales: separation anxiety/phobias, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, OCD, physical symptoms and harm avoidance. The total raw score is obtained by summing all the sub-scales. Total raw scores range from 0-150 with higher scores indicative of more severe anxiety. The raw score gets converted into a T-score interpreted as such: 45-55 average, 56-60 slightly above average, 61-65 above average, 66-70 much above average, and score of 70 or above is considered to be indicative of clinical anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) (Parent Report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 3 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF is an 86 item measure that assesses impairment in executive function with symptoms rated on a likert scale of 1 &quot;never&quot;, 2 &quot;sometimes&quot; or 3 &quot;often&quot;. There are 8 clinical sub-scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor) and two validity scales (Inconsistency and Negativity). A Global Executive Composite score is obtained by summing all 8 clinical sub-scales. The Global Executive Composite ranges from 0-258 with higher scores indicating greater impairment in executive functions. The Global Executive Composite gets converted to a T-score with T-scores of 65 or above considered in the clinical range.</description>

          <description>The MASC 2 is a 50 item self-report measure assessing anxiety in the following sub-scales: separation anxiety/phobias, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, OCD, physical symptoms and harm avoidance. The total raw score is obtained by summing all the sub-scales. Total raw scores range from 0-150 with higher scores indicative of more severe anxiety. The raw score gets converted into a T-score interpreted as such: 45-55 average, 56-60 slightly above average, 61-65 above average, 66-70 much above average, and score of 70 or above is considered to be indicative of clinical anxiety.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC 2)</title>
          <description>The MASC 2 is a 50 item self-report measure assessing anxiety in the following sub-scales: separation anxiety/phobias, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, OCD, physical symptoms and harm avoidance. The total raw score is obtained by summing all the sub-scales. Total raw scores range from 0-150 with higher scores indicative of more severe anxiety. The raw score gets converted into a T-score interpreted as such: 45-55 average, 56-60 slightly above average, 61-65 above average, 66-70 much above average, and score of 70 or above is considered to be indicative of clinical anxiety.</description>

        <description>The BRIEF is an 86 item measure that assesses impairment in executive function with symptoms rated on a likert scale of 1 &quot;never&quot;, 2 &quot;sometimes&quot; or 3 &quot;often&quot;. There are 8 clinical sub-scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor) and two validity scales (Inconsistency and Negativity). A Global Executive Composite score is obtained by summing all 8 clinical sub-scales. The Global Executive Composite ranges from 0-258 with higher scores indicating greater impairment in executive functions. The Global Executive Composite gets converted to a T-score with T-scores of 65 or above considered in the clinical range.</description>
