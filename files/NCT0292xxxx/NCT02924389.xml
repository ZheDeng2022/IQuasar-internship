  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how well the HIV medication dolutegravir gets into&#xD;
      different parts of the body: including blood plasma, special blood cells, and rectal tissue.&#xD;
      Specifically, investigators want to compare how fast dolutegravir lowers the HIV viral load&#xD;
      in these three different sites. In addition, investigators seek to learn if there are any&#xD;
      differences in how dolutegravir acts in males and females. Results of this study will provide&#xD;
      more information about HIV medications and their limitations. In the future, this could help&#xD;
      create better HIV medications that can get into these hard-to-reach places and eventually&#xD;
      cure HIV infection.&#xD;

      Specifically, investigators want to compare how fast dolutegravir lowers the HIV viral load&#xD;

      cure HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to validate the integrated population PK-VD model that&#xD;
      quantitatively describes the relationship between dolutegravir (DTG) exposure and HIV viral&#xD;
      decay in blood plasma. The second aim of this study is to develop an integrated population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic-viral dynamic (PK-VD) model to describe the relationship between DTG exposure&#xD;
      and HIV viral decay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoir sites.&#xD;
      The third aim is exploratory and will investigate sex differences in DTG penetration into&#xD;
      blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoirs reservoirs as&#xD;
      well as its impact on the rectal microbiome.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    This study terminated early due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic making it unsafe to recruit&#xD;
    participants for in-person visits. Participants are living with HIV who are antiretroviral&#xD;
    therapy-naive and are at high risk of covid-19 complications.&#xD;
