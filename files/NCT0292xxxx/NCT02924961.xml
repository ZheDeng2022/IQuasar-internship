  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the fixed bearing (FB) Triathlon knee (Stryker, USA) and&#xD;
      the mobile bearing (MB) Triathlon knee (Stryker, USA) and study the effect of implant design&#xD;
      on kinematics and micromotion. During two tasks the kinematics measured with fluoroscopy&#xD;
      (kinematics and movement of the polyethylene bearing). Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric&#xD;
      Analysis (RSA) will be used to evaluate micromotion between prosthesis and the bone for the&#xD;
      MB and FB Triathlon knee.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to perform a kinematic evaluation of a MB and FB knee prosthesis&#xD;
      designs (Triathlon, Stryker, USA), by means of fluoroscopy and RSA and compare the different&#xD;
      designs. The findings of this study will contribute to improve total knee designs and improve&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate if there is micromotion of the prosthesis with respect to the bone and if&#xD;
           there is a different migration pattern between the designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess and compare the in vivo kinematic patterns of the knee designs by means of&#xD;
           fluoroscopy. This will be done on a subset of the patients (the first 20 patients able&#xD;
           to perform step-up and lunge motions 6 months post-operatively in a controlled manner&#xD;
           without the use of bars and walk more than 1 km)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if the polyethylene bearing in the mobile bearing is rotating and if this&#xD;
           changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Results of the RSA study will be used to correlate the kinematic parameters&#xD;
           (fluoroscopy) with the migration results in order to identify factors of risk for the&#xD;
           survival of total knee prostheses.&#xD;

    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>
