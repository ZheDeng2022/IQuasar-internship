      This study evaluates the role of histidine in patients with HARS Syndrome. Children with HARS&#xD;
      Syndrome will receive oral nutritional supplementation with histidine at a dose which will be&#xD;
      increased in the event of acute febrile illness. Vision, hearing and plasma biomarkers will&#xD;
      be monitored throughout the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HARS syndrome is a progressive degenerative disease affecting eyesight and hearing caused by&#xD;
      a mutation in the HARS gene which codes for an enzyme involved in protein synthesis. HARS&#xD;
      syndrome has been exclusively found in the Old Order Amish communities in Southwestern&#xD;
      Ontario and in Pennsylvania. Children with this disorder initially have normal vision and&#xD;
      hearing, but with a febrile illness, can have a sudden loss of vision and hearing, as well as&#xD;
      visual hallucinations. There is some evidence that vision loss progresses, albeit at a slower&#xD;
      rate, even without a febrile incident. In more severe cases, fluid accumulates in the lungs&#xD;
      (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) which can cause a drop in oxygen levels and&#xD;
      sometimes death. There is currently no specific treatment for HARS syndrome, apart from&#xD;
      supportive care. Anecdotal evidence of an adult with HARS syndrome who was treated with the&#xD;
      amino acid L-histidine suggests that there was an improvement in vision, however there were&#xD;
      no baseline objective measurements of vision prior to the use of histidine. We have designed&#xD;
      a pilot project in which histidine will be given to children with HARS for 6 months.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the histidine will be well tolerated and easily administered,&#xD;
      without side effects. Investigators will monitor vision, hearing and bloodwork to determine&#xD;
      if there is any change during the course of treatment. As well, investigators plan to&#xD;
      administer increased doses of histidine during acute illnesses, hoping to prevent&#xD;
      deterioration in breathing due to ARDS. The results of this initial pilot project may pave&#xD;
      the way for a longer term study of the use of histidine.&#xD;
