    <textblock>
      This is a prospective testing-validation, interventional, non-pharmacological study on a new&#xD;
      app for oral anticancer therapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 patients will be considered: 20 evaluable patients in the training step; 60&#xD;
      patients in the validation step. In the training step will be considered evaluable the&#xD;
      patients with: at least 6 weeks of treatment; visit at 6 weeks after the start of treatment&#xD;
      performed and questionnaires self-administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be visited every 6 weeks. In the training step, patients will remain under&#xD;
      observation for a minimum of 6 weeks, until change of therapy (due to progression of disease,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, death, discontinuation) or for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the validation step will remain under observation until change of therapy (due to&#xD;
      progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, discontinuation) or for a maximum of 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the capability of a newly developed interactive&#xD;
      health care application to support patients and health professionals in the shared management&#xD;
      of oral anticancer therapies, improving adherence, preventing complications at home,&#xD;
      toxicities, improper treatment reductions or interruptions, emergency accesses and to assess&#xD;
      the system usability and acceptability by patients and health professionals, integration in&#xD;
      the hospital workflow, monitoring over time patient perceived levels of quality of care,&#xD;
      quality of life, social support, anxiety, and self-care capability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, non pharmacological study for testing-validation of a&#xD;
      new app for optimising home management of oral therapies for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated according to the local clinical practice. Enrolment period: 8&#xD;
      (training step) + 12 (validation step) months. Total duration of the study: 36 months. This&#xD;
      is a multicenter study. Objective of the study is to assess the capability of a newly&#xD;
      developed interactive health care application to support patients and health professionals in&#xD;
      the shared management of oral anticancer therapies, and to assess the system usability and&#xD;
      acceptability by patients and health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adult 18-75 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤ 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  candidate for treatment with capecitabine or sunitinib as monotherapy (adjuvant and&#xD;
           advanced settings allowed);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sufficient ability to manage mobile devices after basic training course held at&#xD;
           baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clear understanding of the Italian language;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professionals and patients define the items of the system through participatory design&#xD;
      techniques (e.g. focus group sessions, joint review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define whether the system is capable of monitoring patient adherence, the number of pills&#xD;
      counted by the system (self-reported by the patient at home) will be compared with that&#xD;
      counted by the physician as residual pills returned by the patient at the hospital visit. A&#xD;
      difference in the number of pills within +/- 10% will be considered acceptable. A comparison&#xD;
      of type and grade of toxicity will be made between the adverse events indicated by the system&#xD;
      and those reported by the patient at the clinical visit. The quality of the system will be&#xD;
      considered adequate if all the grade 3 and at least 80% of the grade 2 or more toxicity data&#xD;
      reported by the patient at the time of the visit is recorded in the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate system usability and acceptability, Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires will&#xD;
      be used. Scores will be subdivided into different subscales and analyzed using the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank-sum test. Two new questionnaires have been developed and will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      patient expectations of the system, and system acceptability + patient-doctor communication.&#xD;
      An internationally validated questionnaire translated into Italian on system usability (SUS)&#xD;
      will be also administered at the end of observation. Conversational interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>At the time of therapy prescription, patients candidate for oral therapy with capecitabine or sunitinib will be provided with informations on the side-effects of therapy and on the use and functions of the mobile diary app TreC-Onco. Patients are required to manually insert data into the mobile diary app at least once a day. Patients will be visited every 6 weeks. During the visit, the clinician will compare adherence and toxicity data entered into the mobile diary app with those directly reported by the patient and by drug accountability.</description>

    <intervention_name>TreC-Onco</intervention_name>
    <description>TreC-Onco is composed of two tools aimed at supporting patient self-care and health professional monitoring and intervention:&#xD;
Mobile diary app. This is an Android app (for Android version 2.2 and higher) that allows patients to record parameters related to their health state (e.g. medications; blood pressure, weight, fever; side-effects or other symptoms) through a mobile device. Data are stored in a central database and are made available in real time to health professionals through a web dashboard on the TreC server or through a tablet app.&#xD;
Web dashboard. Through this, oncologists can check patient data, monitoring their side-effects and adherence to prescriptions. The Dashboard is optimized for the Firefox browser in version 7 or higher.</description>
