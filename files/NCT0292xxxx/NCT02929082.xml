  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FORCE project aims to measure actives forces of malignant tumor by magnetic resonance force&#xD;
      (FRM). Two main forces are considered as key indicators of therapeutic response and&#xD;
      metastatic potential: interstitial force and traction force at the interface cell/tumor.&#xD;
      Biomarkers of these forces will be developped using direct images of magnetic resonance force&#xD;
      (FRM). Efficiency of these non-invasive biomarkers will be evaluated through their capacity&#xD;
      to predict tumoral environment invasion, notably micro-vascular invasion, and therapeutical&#xD;
      results in Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal criteria will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. micro-vascular invasion assessed by pathological examination of surgical pieces (gold&#xD;
           standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. interstitial force and traction force at the cell/tumor interface assessed by FRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of patients will be divided in three groups. A first group will be constituted of&#xD;
      20 volunteer patients coming for abdominal MRI with no known hepatic disease, in order to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of FRM. A second group will be constituted of 60 patients with&#xD;
      resectable HCC eligible for surgery. This group will enable to evaluate the tumoral&#xD;
      environment invasion. Third group will be constituted of 50 patients with HCC eligible for&#xD;
      transplant with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment as pending&#xD;
      treatment before transplant. This groups will enable to evaluate the efficiency of TACE&#xD;
      through the necrosis percentage in treated HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients will occur during 24 months for a total study duration of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have MRI as usual care. FRM is performed during MRI with the use of a&#xD;
      specific medical device and therefore corresponds to an additional procedure of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients in group 2 and 3 will be asked to participate to an ancillary study&#xD;
      consisting in circulating tumoral cells (CTC) measurement. If they accept, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected just before the MRI in order to evaluate the correlation between CTC and&#xD;
      micro-vascular invasion.&#xD;

      FORCE project aims to measure actives forces of malignant tumor by FRM. Two main forces are&#xD;

        1. micro-vascular invasion assessed by pathological examination of surgical pieces (gold&#xD;
           standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. interstitial force and traction force at the cell/tumor interface assessed by FRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of nodular necrosis in HCC as a marker of a therapeutic response assessed by&#xD;
           pathological examination of explant liver (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. interstitial force and traction force at the cell/tumor interface assessed by FRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of patients will be divided in three groups (see below). Inclusion of patients&#xD;
      will occur during 24 months for a total study duration of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients in group 2 and 3 will be asked to participate to an ancillary study&#xD;
      consisting in circulating tumoral cells (CTC) measurement. If they accept, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected just before the MRI in order to evaluate the correlation between CTC and&#xD;
      micro-vascular invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will be constituted of 20 volunteer patients coming for abdominal MRI with no&#xD;
           known hepatic disease, in order to determine the feasibility of FRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will be constituted of 60 patients with resectable HCC eligible for surgery.&#xD;
           This group will enable to evaluate the tumoral environment invasion. Patients of this&#xD;
           group will be selected during multidisciplinary medical meetings. If they accept to&#xD;
           participate to the ancillary study, a blood sample will be collected (2 tubes of 6 mL&#xD;
           and 10 mL respectively) just before the MRI, an exam always performed before hepatic&#xD;
           resection with a 5-minute- additional sequence to measure FRM. As soon as the surgery is&#xD;
           performed, surgery pieces will be analysed by anatomopathology laboratory in order to&#xD;
           assess, notably, presence of mirco-vascular invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will be constituted of 50 patients with HCC eligible for transplant with&#xD;
           transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment as pending treatment before&#xD;
           transplant. This groups will enable to evaluate the efficiency of TACE through the&#xD;
           necrosis percentage in treated HCC. Patients of this group will be selected during&#xD;
           multidisciplinary medical meetings. If TACE was already performed at inclusion and if&#xD;
           patient accepts to participate to the ancillary study, a blood sample will be collected&#xD;
           (2 tubes of 6 mL and 10 mL respectively) just before the MRI, an exam always performed&#xD;
           before hepatic transplant with a 5-minute- additional sequence to measure FRM. As soon&#xD;
           as the transplant is performed, surgery pieces (whole patient liver) will be analysed by&#xD;
           anatomopathology laboratory in order to assess, notably, presence of necrosis on HCC&#xD;
           nodules previously treated by TACE. If TACE was not performed at inclusion, TACE will be&#xD;
           planified as usually. Data from TACE will be collected in the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
           After TACE, same exams will be performed as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have MRI as usual care. FRM is performed during MRI with the use of a&#xD;
      specific medical device and therefore corresponds to an additional procedure of the research.&#xD;
