      The investigators' objective is to evaluate whether any of the various peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      catheter dressing strategies currently employed by the Boston Children's Hospital Regional&#xD;
      Anesthesia Service has any differential impact on specific outcome endpoints such as regional&#xD;
      block catheter dislodgement, catheter occlusion, catheter leakage, skin irritation, and skin&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generally speaking, the goals of affixing and dressing a peripheral nerve block (PNB)&#xD;
      catheter include preservation of the position and integrity of the catheter, the integrity of&#xD;
      the skin, and avoidance of infection. In order to accomplish this, nerve block catheters at&#xD;
      Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) are affixed to a patient's skin and dressed in a number of&#xD;
      ways, usually based on provider preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just as care providers routinely employ several combinations of tape, occlusive dressings and&#xD;
      skin preparations to secure and protect intravenous catheters (all thought to be&#xD;
      standard-of-care based on their frequency of use), so do the members of the regional service&#xD;
      dress PNB catheters with various combinations of catheter anchors, Dermabond, Mastisol, and&#xD;
      Tegaderms. The exact combinations are based on physician preference and/or habit, though all&#xD;
      dressing schemes generally employ at minimum a standard catheter anchor (provided by the&#xD;
      catheter manufacturer) and a Tegaderm, frequently with the addition of either Mastisol or&#xD;
      Dermabond or both in combination. The four possible combinations in current use are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Catheter anchor and Tegaderm only; 2. catheter anchor, Mastisol and Tegaderm; 3. catheter&#xD;
      anchor, Dermabond and Tegaderm; 4. catheter anchor, Mastisol, Dermabond and Tegaderm&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no formal record is kept of dressing type and/or components, there is no accurate way of&#xD;
      quantifying the frequencies of these dressing types being employed much less whether certain&#xD;
      dressing strategies historically have been more effective than others maintaining the&#xD;
      integrity of the catheter and surrounding skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These variations in routine practice suggest that there is not agreement about the benefits&#xD;
      of adding either Mastisol or Dermabond (or both) to a dressing scheme, especially given their&#xD;
      potential liabilities which include skin irritation (Mastisol, anecdotal at BCH), expense&#xD;
      (Dermabond, approximately $20/use) and time (a couple of minutes drying time for each of&#xD;
      these added elements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mastisol is a waterproof, clear liquid adhesive that has largely replaced tincture of benzoin&#xD;
      as part of occlusive dressings (for nerve block catheters, IVs, arterial and central lines)&#xD;
      as it is reported to have a significantly lower risk for skin irritation (1). As such,&#xD;
      Mastisol has essentially become a standard of care for skin fixation and dressing of numerous&#xD;
      catheter types. Papers in both the adult and pediatric regional anesthesia literature cite&#xD;
      the use of Mastisol as a routine component of catheter fixation and dressing as well (2-4).&#xD;
      However, there is little data in the literature evaluating the efficaciousness of Mastisol&#xD;
      insofar as reducing catheter leakage or dislodgement and hence justifying its continued use&#xD;
      as a part of catheter dressings. One study on healthy adults demonstrated differential forces&#xD;
      required to dislodge a taped IV catheter with or without Mastisol (64 ± 1 vs. 46 ± 2 Newtons)&#xD;
      however there is no data about catheter dislodgement rates over time in a clinical setting&#xD;
      (5). One case report in the pediatric literature proposes a theoretical benefit of Mastisol&#xD;
      use insofar as preventing regional anesthesia catheter dislodgement, but it too provides no&#xD;
      clinical data (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermabond is a cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive that forms a strong bond across apposed wound&#xD;
      edges, allowing normal healing to occur below and serving as a barrier to bacterial&#xD;
      infiltration of the wound. It has been marketed to replace sutures that are 5-0 or smaller in&#xD;
      diameter for incisional or laceration repair. This adhesive has been shown to save time&#xD;
      during wound repair, to provide a flexible water-resistant protective coating and to&#xD;
      eliminate the need for suture removal. Like Mastisol, Dermabond has become a commonplace&#xD;
      addition to PNB catheter dressings for securement and puncture/insertion site closure both at&#xD;
      BCH and nationally. And again, like Mastisol, there is little available data regarding&#xD;
      whether Dermabond use as a part of the dressing scheme makes any difference insofar as&#xD;
      catheter dislodgment or prevention of infection. A case series of three patients has been&#xD;
      reported as recently as 2003 that described inclusion of Dermabond as a technique offering a&#xD;
      simple, alternative method to secure a catheter for a prolonged period of time yet offered no&#xD;
      qualitative or quantitative outcomes data (7). Other, more invasive, methods to fasten&#xD;
      catheters have been advocated as well, such as suturing, retrograde subcutaneous tunneling&#xD;
      (8), and cutaneous sutures (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers at BCH and elsewhere do not so much disagree as to what is the correct dressing for&#xD;
      a nerve block catheter might be as they simply do not have relevant data to guide their&#xD;
      decision-making. The physicians at BCH and at other institutions are using that method they&#xD;
      believe is best by incorporating their own personal experiences as well as those of other&#xD;
      clinicians. All agree that the primary goals, or benefits, of a good dressing system would be&#xD;
      effective catheter stabilization, prevention of catheter occlusion or leakage, keeping the&#xD;
      site clean and dry, and avoidance of infection. To-date, however, nerve block catheter&#xD;
      dressings have not been studied in any rigorous way that might evaluate the various&#xD;
      techniques for such outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is scant literature available on this topic generally, despite a dressing's presumed&#xD;
      importance in maintaining the appropriate position of the nerve block catheter and tip for&#xD;
      maximal efficacy. The literature, if it can be called that, is largely comprised of numerous&#xD;
      YouTube videos describing dressing and securing methodologies for nerve catheters (10);&#xD;
      however none have been reported as having been evaluated in any rigorous prospective or&#xD;
      retrospective analysis. (Reference to this general category of YouTube videos is made here as&#xD;
      they essentially are a source of, and reflect, the standard of care and as such indicate the&#xD;
      relative lack of rigorous evaluation of catheter securing techniques currently available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators wish to study whether the addition of Mastisol, Dermabond or both&#xD;
      to PNB catheter dressings here at BCH has any influence on outcomes such as catheter&#xD;
      dislodgment or function, skin integrity, and avoidance of infection. As such, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a prospective, randomized study of equivalence of dressing type with&#xD;
      the hypothesis that there is no more than a 10% difference in the rate of catheter&#xD;
      dislodgement (the primary endpoint) between the 4 commonly used dressing schemes for PNB&#xD;
      catheters at BCH.&#xD;
