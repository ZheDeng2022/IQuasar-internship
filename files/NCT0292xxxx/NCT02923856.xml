  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the resistant rate of the Helicobacter pylori to some common antibiotics was rising，the&#xD;
      eradication rate of the Helicobacter pylori with the standard triple therapy failed to exceed&#xD;
      70% in China，and had to drop out of the first-line treatment recommendations. However, with&#xD;
      the increase of treatment time, patients burden, adverse reactions of antibiotics or proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor (PPI) will also increase. Resistance to clarithromycin is the major cause of&#xD;
      the failure to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. But, in terms of population, there are still&#xD;
      more than 70% of the patients with clarithromycin sensitive. Under the guidance with&#xD;
      susceptibility test，7-day standard triple therapy could be used. In this study, investigators&#xD;
      will select the patients with infection of H. pylori and with clarithromycin sensitive.&#xD;
      Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with triple therapy based on accurate susceptibility&#xD;
      testing of clarithromycin will be studied. The treatment time will be assigned into 7 days,10&#xD;
      days and 14 days groups. Then, investigators will perform a sequencing for failed treatment&#xD;
      patients in groups, such as drug resistance gene mutation, phenotype and genotype. Finally,&#xD;
      investigators will compare the differences between the patients with triple therapy and&#xD;
      traditional quadruple therapy.The incidence of adverse effects in the eradicate treatment&#xD;
      will reduce at least 10% and avoid patients' unnecessary economic losses at least 400RMB per&#xD;
      person.&#xD;
