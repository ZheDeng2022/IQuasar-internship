  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the non-inferiority of oral flucloxacillin&#xD;
      alone compared with a combination of oral flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin for the&#xD;
      emergency department directed outpatient treatment of cellulitis, wound infections and&#xD;
      abscesses, recently renamed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as acute bacterial skin&#xD;
      and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Half of the trial participants will receive&#xD;
      flucloxacillin and placebo in combination, and the remaining half will be treated will&#xD;
      flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a secondary objective the trial aims to measure adherence and persistence of trial&#xD;
      patients with outpatient antibiotic therapy. In addition a within-trial evaluation of the&#xD;
      cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the use of oral flucloxacillin&#xD;
      compared with combination therapy from the perspective of the health-care payer (direct&#xD;
      costs) the patient and government. Finally the study will externally validate the Extremity&#xD;
      Soft Tissue Infection-score, a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaire designed&#xD;
      to quantify the impact of cellulitis, wound infections and abscesses on patient HRQL in&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is obvious clinical equipoise between the use of oral flucloxacillin alone or combined&#xD;
      with phenoxymethylpenicillin for the emergency department treatment of cellulitis, wound&#xD;
      infections and abscesses as evidenced by current disparate prescribing practice and hospital&#xD;
      guidelines. Feasibility studies for the planned trial have shown that 45-50% of emergency&#xD;
      department patients with these infections in Ireland are discharged on oral antibiotics which&#xD;
      is consistent with findings in other jurisdictions. Despite the significant healthcare and&#xD;
      economic costs associated with cellulitis, there is a paucity of scientific evidence&#xD;
      concerning the appropriate antibiotic treatment for these conditions. Additionally, &quot;less&#xD;
      severe&quot; infections tend to be over-treated and severe infections under-treated, indicating&#xD;
      unjustifiable levels of antibiotic misuse, insufficient knowledge of therapeutics and a lack&#xD;
      of evidence to risk-stratify patients with cellulitis to different treatments.The planned&#xD;
      trial is therefore likely to be definitive due to the current clinical equipoise between the&#xD;
      use of both penicillins for the emergency department outpatient treatment of this group of&#xD;
      infections&#xD;

This is a clinically-determined response to treatment based on the judgment of the trained member of the study team.
