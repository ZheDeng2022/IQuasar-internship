      The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to ixazomib and evaluation of the&#xD;
      long-term safety profile of ixazomib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. This study will look at the long term&#xD;
      safety profile of ixazomib in participants who have previously received and tolerated&#xD;
      ixazomib in a Millennium-sponsored clinical study, and in the investigator's opinion and&#xD;
      confirmed by the Millennium medical monitor, may benefit from continued ixazomib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 250 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive ixazomib at same dose and schedule that they were receiving in&#xD;
      the parent study until they experience disease progression, clinical deterioration in the&#xD;
      investigator's judgment, experience an unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, pursue an&#xD;
      alternative therapy, meet other study-specified reasons for discontinuation of study drug, or&#xD;
      until ixazomib is available to the participant through commercial channels, including&#xD;
      reimbursement for the participant's indication, whichever is sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, rollover study will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is up to 7 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a&#xD;
      final visit after 30 days of last dose of ixazomib for a safety assessment.&#xD;

    <description>SAE means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: a) results in death; b) is life-threatening (refers to an Adverse Event [AE] in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); c) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; d) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; f) is a medically important event. This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related&#xD;
             procedure not part of standard medical care. Participants should consent and enter the&#xD;
             study within a maximum of 8 weeks of their last dose of ixazomib in the parent study&#xD;
             or as agreed by the Millennium clinician/designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously treated with ixazomib (excluding comparator or placebo participants not on&#xD;
             current treatment with ixazomib) in a Millennium sponsored study. Participants will be&#xD;
             eligible to enter the rollover study when:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The parent study is closed or planned to be closed; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The participant is on ixazomib monotherapy or on a drug combination with another&#xD;
                  medication, established while in his/her parent study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. In the opinion of the investigator and confirmed by the Millennium medical&#xD;
                  monitor, the participant may continue to benefit from treatment with ixazomib&#xD;
                  (eg, response to therapy or stable disease without evidence of disease&#xD;
                  progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participant meets any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation in the parent&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
