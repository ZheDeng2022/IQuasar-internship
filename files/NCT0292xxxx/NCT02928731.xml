      The aim of this study is to explore the impact of cancer and therapy-related symptoms on&#xD;
      Mainland Chinese children's physical and psychological well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to WHO, the annual cancer death has increased to 13 million a year . The cancer&#xD;
      incidence of children has also been growing. As the advancement of diagnostic procedure and&#xD;
      treatment, the chance of survival has risen considerably over the past decades. The mortality&#xD;
      rate of childhood cancer in mainland China has also dramatically decreased during the recent&#xD;
      decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the survivors experience low quality of life. When undergoing diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures and treatments, children often suffer from multiple symptoms concurrently, such as&#xD;
      nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, pain, and feeling drowsy. These physical symptoms may&#xD;
      have long-lasting effects as the treatments last longer. The increase in severity, duration&#xD;
      and frequency of physical symptoms may negatively affect recovery of patients in terms of&#xD;
      their functional status and positivity, subsequently leading to sadness and anger .&#xD;
      Therefore, children will be anxious and stressful when they have cancer. There is&#xD;
      considerably evidence to show that children who experience more symptoms have higher levels&#xD;
      of depressiveness as well as lower level of physical and psychological functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a matter of fact, studies have found that coping strategies may affect the quality of&#xD;
      life. When going through these therapies-related symptoms, children with cancer will feel&#xD;
      helpless and have extreme reactions. They may adopt different types of coping strategies,&#xD;
      such as screaming, refusing to have treatments or seeking comfort from parents. Some of the&#xD;
      strategies may reduce the psychological pressure temporarily, while some other coping&#xD;
      strategies can minimize physical pain. All of these may have their impact on quality of life&#xD;
      in different degrees. Therefore, recognizing the effect of different coping strategies on&#xD;
      both therapy-related symptoms and quality of life is a crucial step to design appropriate&#xD;
      interventions that help cancer children to ease treatment related symptoms, improve their&#xD;
      quality of life and promote their psychological well-being. On the other hand, a review of&#xD;
      the literature has revealed that physical activity is beneficial to cancer patients in terms&#xD;
      of their QoL as well as symptom management. Indeed, promoting regular physical activity has&#xD;
      been incorporated to rehabilitation guideline for childhood cancer survivors in recent years,&#xD;
      so as to enhance both their physical and functional well-beings, as well as, their&#xD;
      psychological and emotional well-beings. In fact, the result of a cross-sectional study did&#xD;
      show that there is a positive correlation between physical activity level and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life . Another study conducted in western country also demonstrated that physical&#xD;
      activity level is related to severity of fatigue and health-related quality of life of cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the fact that regular physical activity is beneficial to cancer patients in&#xD;
      terms of their psychological health, many children with cancer are recommend not to engage in&#xD;
      regular physical activity. They are often advised to take more rest so as to avoid&#xD;
      cancer-related or treatment-related fatigue. Given that, it seems also important for us, as&#xD;
      health care professionals to examine the physical activity of children hospitalized with&#xD;
      cancer before we will be able to design appropriate interventions to promote the adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance of regular physical activity, with an ultimate goal to enhance their QoL and&#xD;
      psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is compelling evidence to support that therapy-related symptoms, coping&#xD;
      strategies and physical activity may have a significant impact on children's quality of life,&#xD;
      all of these studies were conducted in western countries, in which, it is hard to reflect the&#xD;
      phenomenon in China. On the other hand, notwithstanding the fact that there were several&#xD;
      studies conducted in Hong Kong to examine relationship between therapy-related symptoms,&#xD;
      coping strategies, physical activity and QoL in cancer children, cultural discrepancies&#xD;
      between Hong Kong and China have made applying this finding to be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study will explore explore the Impact of Cancer and Therapy-related symptoms on Mainland&#xD;
      Chinese Children's Physical and Psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mainland Chinese hospitalized Children with cancer in the wards of 3 tertiary public&#xD;
      hospitals in Beijing will be invited to participate in the study. The pediatric oncology&#xD;
      units of these three hospitals will be similar in nature and setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospitalized children with cancer, who met the inclusion criteria for the study, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. The inclusion criteria are: (1) all children should be ages 9-16&#xD;
      years, (2) they should be able to speak and read Chinese, (3) they should have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with cancer for at least 2 months and be currently undergoing active treatment, and (4) they&#xD;
      should aware of their diseases (cancer). We excluded children with cognitive and learning&#xD;
      problems identified from their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the impact of therapy-related symptoms on children's quality of life and physical&#xD;
      activity level, a group of healthy children having similar standard of living in Mainland&#xD;
      China will be invited to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria are: (1) all&#xD;
      children should be ages 9-16 years, (2) they should be able to speak and read Chinese, and&#xD;
      (3) they should not have cancer or any other chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval of the study will be obtained from the hospital ethics committees in Mainland China&#xD;
      and the University of Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the research student will check the eligibility of cancer children by screening&#xD;
      their medical records. The research student will then approach the eligible children who are&#xD;
      hospitalized in the wards of the pediatric oncology unit. Written consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from their parents after they are told about the details of this study. They will be given an&#xD;
      option to participate or refuse their child's involvement in the study. In addition, the&#xD;
      children who agree to participate will be also invited to put their names on a special child&#xD;
      assent form. Both of them will be assured that their participation is totally voluntary and&#xD;
      they are allowed to withdraw from the study at any time. After obtaining the participants'&#xD;
      demographics from the parents, the children will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires&#xD;
      which consists of the Chinese version of Pediatric Quality of life Inventory, Chinese&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong: Physical Activity Rating for Children and Youth and Coping Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist. About 20 of them will also be selected at random to have a one-to-one, 20 to 30&#xD;
      minutes, semi-structured interview, and all the interviews will be tape-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another group of healthy children will be recruited by similar procedures in the community&#xD;
      and they will be asked to respond to the same set of questionnaires except the Coping&#xD;
      Behavior Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent t-test and chi-square will be used to assess the factors. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to calculate the mean scores and standard deviation of different&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be analyzed and reported followed by the seven-step analytical&#xD;
      procedure of Colaizzi.&#xD;

    <description>The Coping strategies of the participants will be measured by the Coping Behavior Checklist for Chinese Children. It started with the question&quot; supposing you were faced with a very stressful event, such as having to go to hospital for surgery, what would you do?&quot; And followed by 8 items. Items 1, 2 and 8 (problem-focused strategies) are scored from 0 to 2 (0 = 'Hardly ever', 1 = 'Sometimes', 2 = 'Often'). Items 3, 4, 5, 6,and 7 (emotional-focused strategy) are scored from 2 to 0 (0 = 'Often', 1 = 'Sometimes', 2 = 'Hardly ever'). The total possible scores range from 0 to 10, and scores of 0 to 3, 4 to 6 and 7 to 10 are interpreted as corresponding to emotional-focused, mixed-focused and problem-focused responses, respectively.Participants will be asked to respond to the Coping Behavior Checklist for Chinese Children at baseline.</description>
