  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop evidence that can inform hearing health care best&#xD;
      practices for adults between the ages of 65-75, and determine what level of involvement by&#xD;
      the primary care practitioner (PCP) is required to inform and encourage adults age 65-75 to&#xD;
      follow through with routine hearing screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also aims to evaluate the accuracy of assessment of medical conditions for which&#xD;
      the FDA requires physician evaluation and management prior to hearing aid fitting, and&#xD;
      determine which medical conditions should require medical evaluation prior to hearing aid&#xD;
      fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study should provide information to implement changes in health care&#xD;
      policy to facilitate accessible and affordable hearing health care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss is the third-most common chronic condition affecting older adults in&#xD;
      the US (data from Healthy People 2020 US Dept of Health and Human Services). This study aims&#xD;
      to improve the understanding of attitudes, barriers and facilitators needed to improve&#xD;
      hearing health care delivery. Two study cohorts of study participants between the ages of 65&#xD;
      - 75 are proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort of participants include healthy adults being seen by a primary care provider&#xD;
      (PCP) for a routine appointment. Each participating primary care practice is assigned to one&#xD;
      of three different telephone hearing screening strategies that include progressive levels of&#xD;
      PCP time and guidance to complete telephone-based hearing screening. Those who fail a&#xD;
      telephone hearing screening go on to a medical referral study and receive (1) diagnostic&#xD;
      audiological testing and (2) determination of the reliability and validity of identification&#xD;
      of conditions that should require medical referral prior to hearing aid provision (called FDA&#xD;
      'Red Flag' conditions, including conditions such as sudden hearing loss, cerumen impaction,&#xD;
      conductive hearing loss, dizziness, external deformity, ear drainage). We will evaluate the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects in Groups 1 and 2 who dial the phone number and complete the telephone&#xD;
      hearing test at or within two months of their PCP visit, relative to Group 3, and the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects in all groups who: a) schedule and b) complete the visit for&#xD;
      diagnostic audiological testing, and subsequently, c) complete a plan for appropriate hearing&#xD;
      loss intervention, if indicated, within four months of initial hearing screening. Enrollment&#xD;
      in this cohort is complete. 955 subjects were screened for eligibility. Of those, 660&#xD;
      patients were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort includes adults who are being seen for a routine appointment for a&#xD;
      complaint of hearing loss at one of several participating Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT)&#xD;
      practices in the CHEER network. Information about Red Flag conditions will be obtained from&#xD;
      the patient, audiologist, and ENT provider. This information, along with Red Flag data from&#xD;
      the PCP Cohort, will be used to evaluate the accuracy of assessment of medical conditions for&#xD;
      which the FDA requires physician evaluation and management prior to hearing aid fitting, and&#xD;
      determine which medical conditions should require medical evaluation prior to hearing aid&#xD;
      fitting. Enrollment in this cohort is ongoing. The anticipated enrollment goal is 500&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The data will be deposited into the Duke Research Data Repository (RDR), an openly accessible preservation archive maintained by the Duke University Libraries. The RDR will assign appropriate metadata (Dublin Core) for discoverability and provide a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for persistent access and unique identification of the data. The data will be preserved in the RDR for the long-term according to RDR policies and procedures. When the data are transferred to the RDR, data curators will review deposits to help ensure they are complete and in a structure and format that supports long-term preservation, access, and reuse. The RDR provides for automated backup of all data, which provides an added layer of protection and security for the data.</ipd_description>
