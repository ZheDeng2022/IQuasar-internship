  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a serious public health issue, affecting approximately 30% of adults.&#xD;
      Hypertension greatly contributes to the risk for heart disease and stroke, both among the top&#xD;
      three leading causes of death in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. While most treated&#xD;
      individuals with hypertension are controlled on medication, diet and exercise, an estimated&#xD;
      12% are resistant to conventional medical intervention. Alternative effective treatments are&#xD;
      still needed for this hypertensive patient population to mitigate the risk and incidence of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This original Investigational Device Application is for a study intended to confirm the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of bilateral subcutaneous median nerve stimulation using the eCoin system&#xD;
      to treat resistant hypertension. The eCoin device delivers electrical stimulation pulses to&#xD;
      the median nerve from a small coin sized device placed under the skin of the distal anterior&#xD;
      forearm. The implant delivers a weekly 30 minute treatment based on previous studies showing&#xD;
      a long lasting and cumulative effect. The safety and efficacy of eCoin therapy has previously&#xD;
      been demonstrated in a multinational, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study in New&#xD;
      Zealand, Taiwan and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, 1:1 randomized sham-controlled study&#xD;
      of the safety and effectiveness of eCoin median nerve neuromodulation in subjects with&#xD;
      drug-treatment resistant hypertension. The eCoin neuromodulation device will be implanted&#xD;
      subcutaneously in the right and left forearms of patients with uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
      despite treatment with 3 or more antihypertensive agents. After a 4 week implant healing&#xD;
      period, subjects will be 1:1 randomized into either a treatment or control group. One half of&#xD;
      the subjects have their devices activated (treatment) and the other half undergo a sham&#xD;
      activation (control) to maintain participant blinding to their treatment allocation. During&#xD;
      the six months post-randomization, the eCoin is ON in the treatment group and OFF in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
