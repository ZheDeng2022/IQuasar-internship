      This study aims to investigate the omega 3 lipid profile in pregnant women at term and their&#xD;
      fetuses compared to non pregnant women , in normal western diet adding no supplementation&#xD;

      DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid ) is a long chain omega-3 fatty acid important for brain and eye&#xD;
      development and function throughout life. It also supports heart health. DHA is the most&#xD;
      abundant omega-3 in the brain and retina and is naturally found in breast milk. EPA&#xD;
      (Eicosapentaenoic Acid ) is a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid important for overall health.&#xD;
      However, unlike DHA, the body does not store EPA in significant quantities in the brain or&#xD;
      retina (DHA is found in every cell throughout the body, EPA is not). These Omega 3 fatty&#xD;
      acids are considered essential due to the inability of the human body to create them and the&#xD;
      need to consume them from nutritional source. Food that is considered rich in omega 3 fatty&#xD;
      acids are fat fish and green vegetables. Omega-3 fatty acids are &quot;good fats,&quot; and are among&#xD;
      the most important nutrients lacking in Western diets today. The average person in developed&#xD;
      countries consumes less than 100 mg of DHA daily. With increasing awareness of the importance&#xD;
      of DHA, many people realize that they need to make a change to their diet by adding DHA-rich&#xD;
      foods or supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA) is a shorter-chain omega-3 that serves as a source of energy and&#xD;
      as a building block for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA). This precursor for&#xD;
      omega 3 fatty acid is abundant in falx seeds. The mother and the fetus has the metabolic&#xD;
      mechanism that enables them to transform ALA into EPA,DHA endogenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women during pregnancy are predisposed to a reduction in unsaturated long chain fatty acid&#xD;
      (polyunsaturated Fatty Acid = PUFA) from the omega 3 group . Lately, a new hypothesis&#xD;
      claiming that a reduced level of this essential acids expose the fetus later in his adult&#xD;
      life to a spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. New publication on animal models&#xD;
      showed higher rates of obesity, insulin resistance diabetes and cardiovascular damage on mice&#xD;
      exposed short chain fatty acids compared to those treated with enriched ALA diet&#xD;
      supplementation. Different nutritional and gynecological health organization around the world&#xD;
      including the FDA, recommend incorporating omega 3 fatty acids supplementation to daily diet&#xD;
      and specifically in pregnant women in order to raise their blood levels for the developing&#xD;
      fetus. However, normal fatty acid profile of the omega 3 group in mother and fetus haven't&#xD;
      been described yet . Furthermore, the total effect and future benefit to fetus haven't been&#xD;
      thoroughly studied and is based mainly on presumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to learn the typical omega 3 fatty acid profile at women near&#xD;
      delivery and their fetuses and to compare it to women in productive years that are not&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women close to term visiting the obstetrical triage and fitting inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      offered to participate in the study. Demographic medical and obstetrical information will be&#xD;
      collected from medical files after giving signed informed consent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample ( one blood tube that will include 5 cc of blood ) will be taken while insertion&#xD;
      of intravenous line in the delivery room, and another blood sample will be taken from the&#xD;
      umbilical vein after delivery and separation of the fetus from the umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women for control group - healthy non pregnant women in fertility years, will be recruited&#xD;
      from the gynecological clinic . Similarly to the study group, one of the study researchers&#xD;
      will collect one tube for blood sampling ( equal to 5 cc of blood ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be sent for profile analysis of omega 3 fatty acids.&#xD;
