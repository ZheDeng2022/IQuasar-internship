    <textblock>
      Combining TMS and EEG, this study investigates a personalized therapeutic non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation protocol in patients with major depression, whereby the timing of the TMS pulses&#xD;
      is synchronized with the instantaneous phase of ongoing brain oscillations in order to&#xD;
      modulate the inter-hemispheric left and right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortical brain&#xD;
      network.&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder is a severe psychiatric illness with a lifetime prevalence of about&#xD;
      8-16%. Many patients fail to achieve complete remission of symptoms under antidepressant&#xD;
      medication, with about 10% of patients being chronically resistant to several&#xD;
      psychopharmacological treatments. Development of alternative non-pharmacological treatments&#xD;
      is therefore essential to improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers therapeutic potential in this&#xD;
      context. Current protocols apply high-frequency rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) to reverse the increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and cortical&#xD;
      hypo-excitability in patients with depression. However, translation of rTMS therapy into&#xD;
      routine clinical practice has been limited due to low efficacy and high inter-individual&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to optimize rTMS stimulation protocols for MDD by deterministically coupling&#xD;
      the timing of TMS to the ongoing oscillatory neural activity in the underlying cortex as&#xD;
      measured in real-time with high-density surface EEG. It is hypothesized that alpha&#xD;
      phase-locked rTMS of the left DLPFC reverses increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and&#xD;
      cortical hypo-excitability more efficiently than current open-loop rTMS protocols used in the&#xD;
      treatment of MDD.&#xD;
