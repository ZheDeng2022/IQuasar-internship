    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two experimental drugs as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for Bladder Cancer that recurred after treatment with standard therapy, or Bladder&#xD;
      Cancer that got worse while on treatment with standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following interventions will be involved in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-701&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved B-701 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for Bladder Cancer but it has been approved for other&#xD;
      uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that B-701 in combination with Pembrolizumab will be given to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, Investigators are...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing the effectiveness and safety of the combination of two experimental drugs (B-701&#xD;
           and Pembrolizumab);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning about the good and/or bad effects the drugs have on participants and their&#xD;
           cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administering B-701 and Pembrolizumab, which are antibodies (proteins that bind to other&#xD;
           molecules), because...&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B-701 binds to a protein receptor called FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor&#xD;
                3). FGFR3 has been found to be present (expressed) or changed (mutated) on the&#xD;
                surface of in many types of cancer cells. Targeting FGFR3 may inhibit cancer&#xD;
                growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pembrolizumab binds to a protein cell surface receptor called PD-1, which is found&#xD;
                on certain types of lymphocytes and which are also involved in many types of&#xD;
                cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating participants with Pembrolizumab, which is approved by the FDA for the treatment&#xD;
           of Metastatic Melanoma, a Cancer of the skin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting blood and tissue samples and other related medical information to learn more&#xD;
           about the development of cancer and predictors of response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And hoping to learn how the combination of study drugs work in the treatment of cancer&#xD;
           to help develop new treatments.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Pembrolizumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Pembrolizumab is an mAb that binds to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic (T4b, any N; or any T,&#xD;
             N2-3) urothelial bladder cancer or transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) arising in&#xD;
             another location of the urinary tract, including urethra, ureter, and renal pelvis.&#xD;
             The diagnosis must be histologically or cytologically confirmed. Mixed histologies are&#xD;
             permitted as long as TCC is the major component (i.e. &gt; 50% of the pathologic&#xD;
             specimen). Pure or predominant squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas are not&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed after or refractory to one or two prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced or&#xD;

             chemotherapy, as long as the subject has not progressed within 12 months of the last&#xD;
             dose. However, a regimen of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy will be counted as&#xD;
             first-line chemotherapy if the patient progressed within 12 months of the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;

                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
                  (SGOT)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)&#xD;
                  ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  EXCEPTION: Subjects with documented liver metastases: AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 ×&#xD;
                  institutional ULN&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule (such&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the subject before study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of B-701 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab may potentially cause fetal harm, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential (defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized&#xD;
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medications. If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or&#xD;
             be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the&#xD;
             study and through 4 months after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or&#xD;
             radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to&#xD;
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving, or have received, any other investigational drugs or&#xD;
             devices within the 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who received major surgery must be recovered adequately from the toxicity&#xD;
             and/or complications from the interventions prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic&#xD;
             steroid therapy (&gt;5 mg prednisone or its equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, or&#xD;
             untreated/active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or&#xD;
             corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Individuals with a history of treated CNS&#xD;
             metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiographic demonstration of stability upon the completion of CNS directed&#xD;
                  therapy and no evidence of interim progression (for at least 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
                  first dose of study drug) between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the&#xD;
                  screening radiographic procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The screening CNS radiographic procedure is ≥ 8 weeks since completion of&#xD;
                  radiotherapy and ≥ 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids and&#xD;
                  anticonvulsants Note: These exceptions do not include carcinomatous meningitis&#xD;
                  which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of allergic reactions attributed to monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             therapy (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (&gt;5&#xD;
             mg of prednisone or its equivalent) in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease&#xD;
             modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy&#xD;
             (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
        are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from&#xD;
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of prohibited therapies, including&#xD;
             any cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or biologic agent (approved or&#xD;
             investigational) for the treatment of TCC are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. All wounds must be fully healed on Cycle 1, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of other malignancy which could affect compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol or interpretation of results. Individuals with a history of curatively&#xD;
             treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the&#xD;
             cervix are allowed. Participants with a malignancy that has been treated with curative&#xD;
             intent will also be allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment&#xD;
             for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risks with B-701 are unknown&#xD;
             and pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with B-701 and&#xD;
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate birth control throughout the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive (or known history of HIV&#xD;
             seropositive status) participants are ineligible because these underlying diseases&#xD;
             will confound interpretation of important safety assessments, e.g. liver function&#xD;
             tests, increased potential for reactivation or exacerbation of viral infections. Such&#xD;
             individuals may be taking or require other drugs, and may be at higher risk of&#xD;
             opportunistic infections and adverse effects. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV&#xD;
             serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical&#xD;
             trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection&#xD;
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of&#xD;
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the&#xD;
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who weigh &gt; 110 kg will be ineligible due to study drug limitations&#xD;
