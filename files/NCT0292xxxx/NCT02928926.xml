      Cerebral autoregulation is an important mechanism whereby cerebral perfusion is normally&#xD;
      maintained at a constant level, over a relatively wide blood pressure range. It can be&#xD;
      assessed noninvasively by the use of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD). This means using ultrasound&#xD;
      probes over both sides of the head to measure changes in blood flow in one of the main brain&#xD;
      arteries (the middle cerebral artery) in response to beat to beat changes in blood pressure&#xD;
      dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). It is established that dCA is impaired following&#xD;
      moderate to severe stroke, acting as a key role in the development of secondary brain damage&#xD;
      related to brain swelling and further damage related to low blood flow. The administration of&#xD;
      clotbusting therapy (thrombolysis), one of the main approved treatments of acute ischaemic&#xD;
      stroke (AIS), results in recanalization of the blocked artery in over approximately 50%&#xD;
      patients. However, due to its clot dissolving property, it may increase the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      in the body, especially in the brain, leading to greater disability or even death. To date,&#xD;
      there has been very little information regarding the natural history and prognostic&#xD;
      significance of impaired Cerebral Autoregulation during and following reperfusion, especially&#xD;
      those who receive thrombolysis. This research will use the noninvasive technique of Trans&#xD;
      Cranial Doppler (TCD) to see how blood flow changes in AIS patient at the initiation and&#xD;
      completion of thrombolysis, and during acute, subacute and chronic phase post stroke onset,&#xD;
      compared with those AIS patient who did not receive thrombolysis. This study will provide&#xD;
      important data regarding perithrombolysis blood pressure management, an important and common&#xD;
      clinical dilemma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK alone, approximate 100,000 people suffer a stroke each year. Improved management of&#xD;
      stroke patients not only reduces morbidity and mortality, but also reduces the cost of long&#xD;
      term social care. The brain has control systems (i.e. cerebral autoregulation) to maintain&#xD;
      blood flow to the brain, over a relatively wide blood pressure range. Cerebral Autoregulation&#xD;
      can be described as static, reflecting the integrity of such mechanisms over time, or&#xD;
      dynamic, occurring in response to sudden fluctuations in perfusion pressure. When blood&#xD;
      pressure drops, small arteries increase in size to restore flow levels, and when blood&#xD;
      pressure rises, they narrow to protect the most delicate blood vessels. it is known that&#xD;
      sudden decompensated blood pressure changes can occur after stroke, this could result in&#xD;
      brain bleeding and swelling where there is a reduced blood flow to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the clotbusting agent (Alteplase), the main effective treatment used in the&#xD;
      acute stroke can improve blood flow in already blocked arteries in 50% of patients. However,&#xD;
      as it is a powerful drug that dissolves clots, there is a risk that it may cause bleeding&#xD;
      (haemorrhage) in the body. This is most serious when it occurs in the brain, either in the&#xD;
      region of the stroke or another part of the brain, which if serious, could lead to greater&#xD;
      disability or even death. To date, there has been little information regarding the natural&#xD;
      history and prognostic significance of impaired cerebral autoregulation during and following&#xD;
      restoration of brain blood flow (reperfusion), especially those who received clotbusting&#xD;
      agent (Alteplase). There are also conflicting findings between animal and human models. There&#xD;
      is evidence from an animal study that restoration of blood flow in postischaemic brain&#xD;
      arteries may result in generation of free oxygen radicals, leading to further cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation impairment. Furthermore, there is evidence from animal models that clotbusting&#xD;
      agent (Alteplase) may exhibit additional blood vessel toxic effect and therefore, further&#xD;
      impair cerebral autoregulation. However, such findings could not be reproduced in the human&#xD;
      settings. To date, there is only one small study looking at cerebral autoregulation in 14&#xD;
      acute ischaemic stroke patients 8 days after clotbusting treatment, there have not been&#xD;
      studies to assess blood flow regulation at the initiation and completion of the clotbusting&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral autoregulation can be assessed noninvasively by the use of Trans Cranial Doppler&#xD;
      (TCD). This means using ultrasound probes over both sides of the head to measure changes in&#xD;
      blood flow in one of the main brain arteries (the middle cerebral artery) in response to beat&#xD;
      to beat changes dynamic cerebral autoregulation. However, the use of TCD may be limited by&#xD;
      the absence of brain window and/or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the acute&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke patients. Therefore, it is important to consider alternative sites to the&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery to assess brain blood flow regulation, and our group has previously&#xD;
      researched the use of the main neck artery (the internal carotid artery) site. In a healthy&#xD;
      control population, brain blood flow regulation index (autoregulation index) estimated from&#xD;
      the internal carotid artery is not statistically different from the middle cerebral artery.&#xD;
      However, such comparisons have not been made in the acute ischaemic stroke population. This&#xD;
      research will use noninvasive technique of Trans Cranial Doppler to look at blood flow&#xD;
      regulation in the brain (cerebral autoregulation) in clotbusting therapy (thrombolysis)&#xD;
      treated acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients at the initiation and completion of&#xD;
      thrombolysis, and during acute, subacute and chronic phase post stroke onset, compared to&#xD;
      those AIS patients who have similar age, sex and blood pressure but not treated with&#xD;
      thrombolysis. This study will provide important data regarding peri-thrombolysis blood&#xD;
      pressure management, an important and common clinical dilemma.&#xD;
