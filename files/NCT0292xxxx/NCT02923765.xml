  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke rehabilitation of hemiplegics primarily lies in motor control and training of&#xD;
      activities of daily life. Whole body aerobics is much less emphasized. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness of even ambulatory hemiparetics is only half compared with healthy&#xD;
      people, which is prone to deconditioning. The present study aims to understand the efficacy&#xD;
      of aerobic training in addition to the usual neuro-rehabilitation, including aerobic fitness,&#xD;
      daily activities dependency, anti-inflammation and anti-thrombosis. This is a prospective and&#xD;
      randomized design. The subjects will be recruited from the hospitalized patients in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation ward of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo. 120 hemiplegic patients due to&#xD;
      stroke will be enrolled and randomized into two groups: combined training (CT) and usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Participants in CT will receive aerobics at moderate intensity in addition to&#xD;
      the usual rehabilitation. The program has 35 minutes/session, 5 sessions/week and 4-5 weeks&#xD;
      in total. A constant-power semi-recumbent stepper will be employed as the training modality.&#xD;
      It uses bilateral reciprocal movement of the arm coupled with the opposite leg, which allows&#xD;
      for a push and pull motion. Additional 20 healthy participants will also be recruited as the&#xD;
      healthy control. Assessment before and after training includes: (I) graded cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test using constant-load stepper. (II) Functional Independence Measure. (III)&#xD;
      coagulation system assessment, using Thrombin generation assay and Ceveron alpha (Technoclone&#xD;
      GmbH, Vienna, Austria) : Von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen&#xD;
      activator inhibitor-1, D-dimer, factor VIII, etc. [the 1st year]; (IV) monocyte-platelet&#xD;
      aggregation and its subtypes, using flow cytometry [the 2nd year]. ( V) systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, platelet activation and prognostic biomarker：C-reactive protein, soluble&#xD;
      P-selectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine, Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2, etc [the&#xD;
      3rd year]. Statistical analysis will use ANOVA with post-hoc, two-way repeated measure ANOVA,&#xD;
      etc. The investigation will start after approval and end in 2019, July. We hope this&#xD;
      investigation will establish a more comprehensive rehabilitation program for clinical&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, there are 220,00 stroke survivors and each year, 10,000 new suffers causing&#xD;
      impairment in daily activities. This is the leading cause of disability and consumes 4.5&#xD;
      billions of National Health Insurance yearly. More than half of them become hemi-paretics and&#xD;
      hemi-plegics. Stroke leads to the adverse combination of reduced functional capacity and&#xD;
      increased energy demands to perform routine activities Thereby, physiologic fitness reserve&#xD;
      is diminished. Aerobic fitness is low in stroke survivors. Among ambulatory patients&#xD;
      suffering from hemiparetic stroke, the VO2peak is approximately half that of age-matched&#xD;
      individuals , a level that is near the minimum range required for activities of daily life.&#xD;
      It may limit their ability to perform everyday activities and cause further complications,&#xD;
      such as cardiopulmonary de-conditioning, muscular atrophy, joint stiffness, or even learned&#xD;
      nonuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients are discharged from neurorehabilitation focusing on motor control and ADL&#xD;
      (activity of daily life ) training, while aerobic fitness training is neglected, especially&#xD;
      in non-ambulatory patients. Randomized exercise training studies using a wide variety of&#xD;
      modalities and protocols have demonstrated an 8~23% improvement in VO2peak after 2-6 months&#xD;
      of training . However, most research recruit patients with hemiparesis who have&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate gait impairment . No specific training protocols has been adequately studied&#xD;
      or can be suggested for hemiplegic patients. It is difficult for them to partake in aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, like walking or biking. There is a need to develop a new aerobic exercise module&#xD;
      suitable for the patients, especially for those with ambulation difficulty resulted from&#xD;
      severe paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current investigation, a semi-recumbent stepper with constant power design will be&#xD;
      adopted as training modality. It accommodates motor function deficits by providing trunk and&#xD;
      distal limb support . In addition, semi- recumbent stepper uses bilateral reciprocal movement&#xD;
      of the arm coupled with the opposite leg, which allows for a push and pull motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic fitness training has been proposed as a beneficial approach for people with stroke.&#xD;
      Taking part in fitness training could have a range of other benefits important to people with&#xD;
      stroke such as improving cognitive function, improving mood, and quality of life, and it&#xD;
      could reduce the risk of recurrent stroke . In the present investigation, the outcome&#xD;
      measurement will not only include cardiopulmonary fitness and the degree of daily activity&#xD;
      dependency, but also prognostic biomarkers, thrombotic and inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well-documented that exercise training has an anti-thrombotic effect . Increased&#xD;
      physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with a reduced risk of&#xD;
      fatality from cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, increased studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      regular moderate-intensity physical activity is associated with health benefits, even when&#xD;
      aerobic fitness (e.g., maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) remains unchanged . For sedentary&#xD;
      persons at risk for cardiovascular disease, adopting a moderately active lifestyle can induce&#xD;
      important health benefits, such as reducing prothrombotic factors and lipid peroxidation ,&#xD;
      increasing fibrinolytic activity and high-density lipoprotein levels , etc. One of the&#xD;
      present investigation aims to understand whether 20~25 sessions of aerobic training at&#xD;
      moderate intensity will induce these favorable adaptations that could contribute to decreased&#xD;
      risk for ischemic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study. Eighty stroke sufferers with unilateral&#xD;
      weakness will be enrolled in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo. They will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups: combined training (CT) and usual rehabilitation (UR). Participants in the CT&#xD;
      group will receive supervised aerobic training at moderate intensity in addition to usual&#xD;
      neuro-rehabilitation, in which motor control and task-oriented ADL training are the major&#xD;
      contents. Patients in the UR will undergo usual neuro-rehabilitation only. The aim of the&#xD;
      present research is to evaluate the efficacy of an aerobic training program at moderate&#xD;
      intensity for a total of 20~25 sessions using a semi-recumbent stepper with constant power&#xD;
      design. Pre- and post-training measurement includes (I) cardiopulmonary fitness, (II) daily&#xD;
      activities dependency, (III) coagulation and fibrinolysis profile. [the 1st year] (IV)&#xD;
      monocyte subsets and its interaction with platelets [the 2nd year]. (V) Systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, platelet activation and prognostic biomarker：C-reactive protein, soluble&#xD;
      P-selectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine, Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2, etc. [the&#xD;
      3rd year]. Venous blood will be sampled two times before and after rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully, this clinical investigation will establish the model of incorporating aerobics in&#xD;
      the hemiplegic patients following stroke, and its efficacy for clinical application.&#xD;
