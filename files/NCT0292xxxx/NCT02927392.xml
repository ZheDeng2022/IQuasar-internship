  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiological relevance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans is largely unknown. The&#xD;
      investigators have shown that suppressing ovarian function in premenopausal women reduces&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure (REE), and this is prevented by adding back estradiol (E2). The&#xD;
      investigators preliminary data suggest that this may be due, in part, to reduced brown&#xD;
      adipose tissue (BAT) activity. The overarching hypothesis is that BAT activity in humans is&#xD;
      modulated by E2. To determine if natural declines in endogenous E2 contribute to changes in&#xD;
      BAT activity, we will compare BAT activity in pre-and post-menopausal women. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore whether suppression of ovarian hormones in pre-menopausal&#xD;
      women impairs BAT activity. BAT activity will be quantified using dynamic positron emission&#xD;
      topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging combined with 11C-acetate tracers. We will&#xD;
      assess the thermogenic response of BAT by measuring cold-induced changes in REE, shivering,&#xD;
      and skin and core temperature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to perform studies to measure resting metabolic rate and activity&#xD;
      of brown adipose tissue or brown fat. Brown fat is different from regular &quot;white fat&quot; in that&#xD;
      it produces heat and burns calories. The investigators will measure how active brown fat is&#xD;
      at normal room temperature and after participants have been exposed to cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 5-6 hours. It will consist of measurements made in warm temperatures and&#xD;
      then after a period of cold exposure. For the cold exposure part of the study, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to wear a cooling suit for 3 hrs. Skin temperature is normally about 90º&#xD;
      Fahrenheit. The cooling suit will adjust the water temperature until your skin temperature is&#xD;
      about 82º Fahrenheit. The suit will cover the entire body except for the face, hands, and&#xD;
      feet. Participants may feel cold while wearing the suit and you may shiver some, but based on&#xD;
      past studies, any shivering should be minor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the cooling suit is turned on, body scans will be performed using a&#xD;
      procedure called positron emission tomography (PET). These scans do not use radiation. Before&#xD;
      the PET scans, the investigators will infuse radioactive tracer into an arm. These tracers&#xD;
      have a low dose of radiation and will show us where the brown fat is and how active it is.&#xD;
      One PET scan will be performed at room temperature, and the second scan will be performed&#xD;
      after the cooling suit has been worn for 3 hours. Two additional scans using computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) will be performed at end of the study. CT scans are like an x-ray, and use&#xD;
      radiation. The radiation dose in the CT scan is much higher than the tracers. When the CT&#xD;
      scans are combined with the PET scans, we can separate brown fat from white fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 pre-menopausal women will be asked to volunteer for a follow up study. For 5 months,&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women in this study will receive monthly injections that contain a study drug&#xD;
      (leuprolide) that reduces estrogen to postmenopausal levels. This drug is approved by the FDA&#xD;
      to reduce estrogen for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, but is not&#xD;
      approved for use in healthy women. In this study, the drug is being used to decrease hormones&#xD;
      to determine if this reduces brown fat activity. 6 months after the first injection, these&#xD;
      women will be asked to repeat the PET/CT studies.&#xD;
