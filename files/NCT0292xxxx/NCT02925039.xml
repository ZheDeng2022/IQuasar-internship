  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is a key functional movement critical to independent living.&#xD;
      This movement is physically demanding to conduct, especially in older adults, and in the&#xD;
      presence of physical impairments associated with a range of conditions, such as stroke,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, Parkinson disease and hip arthroplasty. A limited capacity to perform this&#xD;
      movement increases the risk of falls, dependency and increased support for personal care and&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Restoring independence in this movement is, therefore, considered a priority&#xD;
      for physical rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit-to-stand capacity can be regained through participating in rehabilitation exercises.&#xD;
      Providing feedback on performance of this movement could enhance the training. Thus, it is an&#xD;
      essential aspect of physical therapy. Healthcare providers are required to meet the needs of&#xD;
      an increasingly frail population as well as meeting national, evidence-based, guidelines for&#xD;
      improving outcomes in conditions such as stroke which includes an increase in the practice&#xD;
      repetition of functional movements. Reliance on rehabilitation staff to provide practice,&#xD;
      however, places a limit on practice volume, potentially restricting outcomes. Using&#xD;
      technology to enhance safe, repetitive practice of this movement with minimal supervision&#xD;
      from skilled professionals would be beneficial to patients and rehabilitation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a STS training&#xD;
      system that enhances movement feedback to patients undergoing rehabilitation. A secondary aim&#xD;
      is to gather data on the effectiveness of the system compared to conventional rehabilitation.&#xD;
      This information will inform a statistically powered phase 2 trial.&#xD;

      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot randomised controlled study to test the acceptability and feasibility of a&#xD;
      sit-to-stand (STS) training system and gather preliminary data on its effectiveness.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to an experimental group where participants will&#xD;
      receive sit to stand training enhanced by the feedback system or a control group where&#xD;
      participants will receive the usual sit to stand training as provided by the treating&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with physical impairments that affect their capacity to perform the STS movement and&#xD;
      who are about to start active rehabilitation will be identified by the clinical team on the&#xD;
      ward. If individuals identified in this way indicate to the clinical team that they are&#xD;
      willing to talk to the researcher about the study a mutually convenient time will be arranged&#xD;
      for the researcher to speak individually to the patient about the study. An information sheet&#xD;
      will be left with the patient and they will be encouraged to read this and speak to family&#xD;
      and friends about their possible participation. No less than 48 hours after the information&#xD;
      sheet is provided, the researcher will make contact with the patient to discuss their&#xD;
      participation and take written consent if agreed. This recruitment process and their&#xD;
      participation in the study will not interfere with discharge planning during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealed opaque envelopes contained randomly generated codes for treatment allocations will be&#xD;
      given to a member of the clinical team. Once informed consent has been provided, the envelope&#xD;
      will be opened randomising participants into two groups: 1) A control group who will conduct&#xD;
      conventional sit-to-stand training and 2) An experimental group who will conduct augmented&#xD;
      STS training using the feedback system. Twenty participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      each group. Participants allocated to either group will be attached with a physical activity&#xD;
      monitor (ActivePAL sensor,PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow) by the researcher onto the&#xD;
      unaffected or dominant side of the thigh. Full instructions will be provided on its use. The&#xD;
      monitor is small and lightweight (&lt;15 grams) but capable of detecting and storing information&#xD;
      on movement and position (e.g. duration of sitting, standing and the number of STS execution&#xD;
      24 hours aday for 28 days).Data to record from medical notes: Participants' background&#xD;
      information (i.e. gender, age, height, weight, reasons for admission and number and type of&#xD;
      co-morbidities) will be noted.Pre-assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be asked to carry out the following baseline measurements by&#xD;
      the researcher: 1)Timed performance of up to five repetitions of the sit to stand movement&#xD;
      (FTSTST), if able; 2) Abbreviated Mental Test -4 with a inclusion score of 4 or higher&#xD;
      (AMT-4); 3) Tinetti Gait and Balance Assessment (TGBA); 4) Elderly Mobility Scale Test&#xD;
      (EMST). These assessments are already being used by the clinical team. Training with the&#xD;
      system:The rehabilitation staff will supervise all training sessions as per normal practice.&#xD;
      The researcher will provide technical support for all the sessions. The participant will be&#xD;
      asked to sit on an adjustable chair with armrests. The height of the chair to be adjusted by&#xD;
      the researcher for individual needs. A loose vest with a pouch pocket fitted near the chest&#xD;
      region will be worn by the participant. Help will be provided by the researcher if needed. An&#xD;
      inertial sensor (Spatial 3/3/3, Phidgets Inc, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) will be placed into&#xD;
      the pocket and connected by a USB (Universal Serial Bus) cable to a laptop computer. The&#xD;
      participant will then be asked to place both feet on a portable balance plate (BP5046, Bertec&#xD;
      Inc, Columbus, OH, USA), which is also attached to the laptop via the USB. The system&#xD;
      provides a virtual reality environment that simulates user getting on and off a bus seat. The&#xD;
      participant can observe their real-time movement as an avatar on a computerised image&#xD;
      (projected on a wall by a projector). Real-time feedback on performance (balance, strength&#xD;
      and/or coordination), verbally and visually, will be provided throughout training. The game&#xD;
      can be personalised to suit different needs based on the participant's real-time performance.&#xD;
      Training should be two to three times a week based on advice on current practice. During the&#xD;
      study, the researcher will check with the ward staff that the activity monitor (ActivePAL) is&#xD;
      still attached to the participant's thigh and that they are free of skin irritation. The&#xD;
      researcher will also change the monitor after seven days so that the skin can be fully&#xD;
      inspected and cleaned if necessary. After the study, the monitor will be completely removed&#xD;
      by the researcher. The captured anonymised physical activity data will be downloaded to an&#xD;
      encrypted folder on a computer and used exclusively for this study. It will then be&#xD;
      transferred to a secured computer at the University of Strathclyde for safe storage.&#xD;
      Post-assessment: The researcher will carry out a repeat of the baseline measurements at the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following information will be recorded by the researcher on acceptability&#xD;
      and feasibility: 1) Number of sessions attended as a proportion of a total number of the&#xD;
      session available; 2)Adverse incidents, type and number; 3) acceptability of the system by a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview with the clinical team and participants. The anonymised data will&#xD;
      be analysed to address three questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the system feasible to use with older people undergoing inpatient rehabilitation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the system feasible to use in a clinical environment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can the system improve sit-to-stand performance compared to conventional training?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is the system acceptable from the point of view of users (patients and rehabilitation&#xD;
           staff)?&#xD;
