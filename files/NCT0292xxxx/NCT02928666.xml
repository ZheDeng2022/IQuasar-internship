      Introduction: in the course of the research, the investigators will develop a&#xD;
      decision-support system (comorbidity-DSS) consisting (1) a knowledge base (KB) consisting of&#xD;
      (a) computer-interpretable clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes and 2 other diseases from:&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, hypertension, and osteoarthritis; and (b) an&#xD;
      ontology of relevant general medical knowledge that could complement (a) in order to propose&#xD;
      non conflicting treatment options not mentioned in the clinical practice guidelines; and (2)&#xD;
      an algorithm that matches the KB with a patient's data set to identify the guidelines-based&#xD;
      recommendations applicable for the patient and their interactions and which proposes ways to&#xD;
      mitigate conflicting interactions (e.g., suggesting to select intervention A.2 (instead of&#xD;
      A.1) from guideline A and intervention B.3 (instead of B.1) from guideline B together with an&#xD;
      action B' mentioned in the general medical knowledge, because these interventions are not&#xD;
      conflicting yet A.3 fulfills the same goals as intervention A.1 and intervention B.3 + B'&#xD;
      together fulfill the same goal as B.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research purpose: Assessing the correctness and completeness of detection of&#xD;
      recommendation-interaction and generation of conflict-free recommendations by a&#xD;
      comorbidity-DSS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: How will the usage of the comorbidity-DSS affect the completeness and&#xD;
      correctness of clinicians regarding (a) detection of interactions between recommendations&#xD;
      originating from different clinical guidelines applicable for patients with comorbidities and&#xD;
      (b) identification of interventions that fulfill the guidelines' goals and are not&#xD;
      conflicting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In consultation with 3 expert clinicians, the investigators will create a database of&#xD;
           patient scenarios. The investigators will obtain deidentified extracts from medical&#xD;
           records of 6-12 typical patients who have type 2 diabetes and at least one of the&#xD;
           following comorbidities: obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, hypertension, and&#xD;
           osteoarthritis will be obtained. The data obtained will include relevant observations,&#xD;
           medications, and procedures regarding these patients. Relevancy will be determined from&#xD;
           the clinical practice guidelines for the above-mentioned diseases, which specify which&#xD;
           data should be collected from such patients. The data will not include information that&#xD;
           could identify the patient, such as date of birth, name, identification number, street&#xD;
           address, telephone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient cases will be assembled into a database of scenarios, decomposed into&#xD;
           several steps, each step taking place at a different point along the clinical&#xD;
           guideline's timeline and being composed of several decision-points regarding goals of&#xD;
           the clinical guidelines. In total, there would be 60 decision points across all patient&#xD;
           scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation of the KB and creation of a gold standard. The three experienced clinicians&#xD;
           will validate the KB and will also create a gold standard set of interactions between&#xD;
           recommendations for the decision points of the patient scenarios as well as a set of&#xD;
           recommendations that fulfill the clinical guidelines' goals for these decision points&#xD;
           that are conflict-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruiting study participants. The investigators will send invitations to 50&#xD;
           clinicians/medical students in order to recruit at least 30 participants for our&#xD;
           experiment. The participants will be asked to solve (detect interactions and propose non&#xD;
           conflicting interventions) six scenarios. Anticipated time for solving the cases: 3&#xD;
           hours + 1 hour of introduction and signing consent documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Crossover study design will be used to compare the effect of using the comorbidity-DSS&#xD;
           for detection of recommendations interactions and on generation of correct&#xD;
           non-conflicting recommendations. Each participant will be given 6 scenarios: 3 will be&#xD;
           solved with the aid of the system and 3 without it. Each scenario will be presented to&#xD;
           the clinicians as a series of single steps. In DSS-mode the clinicians will be presented&#xD;
           with the output of the comorbidity-DSS for each step, including the list of interactions&#xD;
           between recommendations originating in the different clinical guidelines and the set of&#xD;
           non-conflicting recommendations that fulfill the goals of the relevant decision&#xD;
           point/goal. They will need to say for each interaction and for each non-conflicting&#xD;
           recommendation whether they accept or reject it, possibly adding some free text; in the&#xD;
           non-DSS mode, the clinicians will need to provide their set of detected interactions and&#xD;
           proposed non-conflicting recommendations after each step, in free text.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. While the gold standard interactions and recommendations would have been created ahead&#xD;
           of time by the three clinicians from RAMBAM in step 1, it is possible that the&#xD;
           comorbidity-DSS or that the study participants will identify additional interactions and&#xD;
           non-conflicting recommendations. The three clinicians will review these as well and&#xD;
           could potentially revise the gold standard to include a richer set of interactions and&#xD;
           of non-conflicting recommendations for each set. Based on the revised gold standard,&#xD;
           completeness and correctness of the interactions detected and the non-conflicting&#xD;
           recommendations generated by the participant will be calculated, while using the&#xD;
           comorbidity-DSS vs. without it for the different steps (decisions/goals). The overall&#xD;
           completeness and correctness are percentages, and thus range from 0 to 1, relative to&#xD;
           the extended gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical analysis will be done as follows. Assuming that total completeness and&#xD;
           correctness are two dependent variables, as they are bounded variables between zero and&#xD;
           1. Thus, a beta regression model with a logit link function will be used for the mean&#xD;
           response model; a log link function will be fitted for the precision model. This model&#xD;
           is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its&#xD;
           mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown&#xD;
           coefficients and a link function. The full model shall include three factors: (1) DSS&#xD;
           mode (DSS and Non-DSS), (2) Level of training (e.g., 1st year resident, experienced&#xD;
           resident, specialist), and (3) Scenario (as different scenarios will be used). The&#xD;
           pseudo R2 value (squared correlation of linear predictor and link-transformed response)&#xD;
           will be used to measure the overall goodness of fit of the model. A backward elimination&#xD;
           algorithm will be used to assess what are the important factors. Unlike the total&#xD;
           completeness measure, which was computed for the overall set of decision-points per&#xD;
           scenario per clinician, the investigators will also analyze the completeness measure for&#xD;
           each decision-point (e.g., &quot;order lab test&quot;), increasing resolution and looking at the&#xD;
           clinician's guideline-based action per decision; therefore, the measured variable is&#xD;
           binary, and a logistic regression with a logit link function will be used. As in the&#xD;
           previous case, the full model will include three factors; a backward elimination&#xD;
           algorithm will be used to reach the final model.&#xD;
