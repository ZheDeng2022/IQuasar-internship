      DetermInants of Antimicrobial use aNd de-escalAtion in critical care (DIANA study), is a&#xD;
      multicenter, international, prospective, observational cohort study, aiming to describe the&#xD;
      rate of de-escalation as well as the associated outcome and the empirical antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      for infections at the intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the consensus regarding spectrum and timing of antibiotic therapy, antimicrobial use&#xD;
      varies across ICUs; indeed there are important variations in choice, dosing, method of&#xD;
      administration, duration of antimicrobial therapy and de-escalation of empirical therapy.&#xD;
      DetermInants of Antimicrobial use aNd de-escalAtion in critical care (DIANA study), is a&#xD;
      multicenter, international, prospective, observational cohort study, aiming to describe the&#xD;
      rate of de-escalation as well as the associated outcome and the empirical antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      for infections at the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the explorative nature of this study the required number of patients was not&#xD;
      calculated. The investigators aim to include 2000 patients in whom empirical antibiotics are&#xD;
      started. With an estimated de-escalation rate of 35%, an estimation to include 700 patients&#xD;
      in whom de-escalation is performed is made which would allow for a suitable multivariable&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participating center center data will be collected as detailed in an electronic&#xD;
      Center Report Form. This will be completed only once per center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participating center data on 4 elements will be collected: ICU-related data,&#xD;
      microbiology laboratory practices, definition of de-escalation as used in the participating&#xD;
      center and local de-escalation practices, background resistance levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study in which patients will be included in the&#xD;
      participating centers during a 2-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient included in the study, data will be collected in an electronic Case Report&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each included patient data on 4 elements will be collected: patient data (demographics,&#xD;
      underlying and co-morbid conditions, patient characteristics on different time points),&#xD;
      infection data (clinical and microbiological), treatment data (antimicrobial therapy and&#xD;
      source control) and outcome data (28 day follow up period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      National coordinators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Coordinators will be appointed by the Steering Committee and will have a key role in&#xD;
      the conduction of the study in the individual countries as leaders of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee approval may vary from country to country. The national coordinator is&#xD;
      responsible for obtaining ethics committee approval if this is required on a national level&#xD;
      (or any procedure similar to this). Informed consent will be obtained from the subject or&#xD;
      nominated representative (where applicable). As this is an observational study some countries&#xD;
      and sites may waive the need for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data will be collected anonymously and will be entered in an electronic data&#xD;
      capturing system. Data provided by the local investigators are primarily the property of the&#xD;
      ICU that collected the data. Local investigators shall have access to their data after they&#xD;
      have been entered in the central database.The servers of the system are hosted at True; True&#xD;
      has been certified by the Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) according to the&#xD;
      international information security norm ISO 27001:2013. True provides its services in&#xD;
      accordance with the NEN7510 norm for information security in healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local investigators may be contacted for queries in case of outliers, excessive missing&#xD;
      values and other reasons deemed relevant by the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by the primary investigators using a statistical&#xD;
      software program and assisted by expert statisticians when necessary.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
