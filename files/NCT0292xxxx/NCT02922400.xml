      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and feasibility of a battery&#xD;
      of neuropsychological measures evaluating social cognition and behavior in young adults&#xD;
      diagnosed with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, or traumatic brain injury (TBI). It&#xD;
      also investigates functional differences in regions of the brain associated with social&#xD;
      cognition and differences in cognitive processing. Additionally, this study implements a&#xD;
      virtual reality intervention to strengthen social cognition skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of the study is to create a comprehensive social cognitive battery and virtual&#xD;
      reality therapy that will be useful in determining and treating social deficits in young&#xD;
      adults. With such developments, young adults with social cognition impairment may be provided&#xD;
      a way to thoroughly evaluate and treat their deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for eligibility by research staff. Individuals that have met&#xD;
      all enrollment criteria and have provided written consent will be entered into the study.&#xD;
      Once written consent has been obtained, participants will enter into the assessment phase of&#xD;
      the study, followed by the treatment phase. Both neuropsychological social-cognitive testing&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures will be administered prior and&#xD;
      following the treatment phase of the study. The treatment phase will entail use of a&#xD;
      virtual-reality platform in which to train and practice social interaction skills.&#xD;
      Participants will be reimbursed for the pre- and post- assessment portions only. No&#xD;
      compensation will be provided for completing the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first scheduled assessment visits will assess the efficacy and feasibility of a battery&#xD;
      of standardized measures as well as measures that are being developed specifically for use&#xD;
      with this population, assessing mainly social skills and face processing. The pre-training&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment visit is estimated to take up to 4 hours to complete, however&#xD;
      can take longer due to each individual's processing style and social-cognitive abilities.&#xD;
      Participants will be scheduled for appointments to conduct both the neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing and be given the option to complete an fMRI assessment. The pre-training fMRI&#xD;
      assessment visit is estimated to take 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have completed the pre-training assessment, they will enter into the&#xD;
      treatment phase of the study and participate in the Virtual Reality Social Cognition&#xD;
      Training. Participants will be seen 1-2 times a week for up to six weeks. Session length may&#xD;
      range in time from 1 hour to 2 hours each week. Each visit will consist of the participant&#xD;
      and clinician engaging in a semi-structured live conversation over a virtual-reality&#xD;
      platform. Both the participant and the clinician will talk and interact within the virtual&#xD;
      environment through a digital character, an avatar. Each conversation will be set-up,&#xD;
      initiated, and conducted by coach and/or confederate clinicians that have been trained to&#xD;
      administer the treatment. The confederate clinician will be able to change his/her likeness&#xD;
      and voice (through voice modulation software) so as to play the role of the conversation&#xD;
      partner with the participant. Live feedback and coaching will be provided by the coach&#xD;
      clinician to build social reasoning and thinking skills. Each session will center around a&#xD;
      specific social objective (e.g., initiating conversation, conducting a job interview,&#xD;
      confronting a friend, going on a blind date) while allowing practicing of specific social&#xD;
      strategies. Social strategies will be presented in a hierarchical manner, increasing in&#xD;
      complexity throughout the training, to strengthen awareness of and application of social&#xD;
      reasoning and thinking skills. Strategies practiced include: 1)recognizing other's social&#xD;
      intentions, 2)social response, and 3)self-assertion and social problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the treatment phase, participants will complete post-assessment&#xD;
      measures that include neuropsychological social cognitive assessments and an fMRI imaging&#xD;
      assessment. The post-neuropsychological assessment visit is estimated to take up to 3 hours&#xD;
      to complete where as the post- fMRI visit is estimated to take 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.&#xD;
