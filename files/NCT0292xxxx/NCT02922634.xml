      This project is designed as a prospective, single-center observational study. The cohort will&#xD;
      consist of 229 consenting subjects ≥ 70 years of age who present to the Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital Weiner Center for Preoperative Evaluation (CPE) prior to elective spine surgery.&#xD;
      These ages are chosen as significant clinical data demonstrate increased cognitive impairment&#xD;
      in community dwelling elders. Eligibility criteria include: patients ≥ 70 years of age with&#xD;
      an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of I-III&#xD;
      presenting for elective spine surgery. Exclusion criteria will include planned Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU) admission postoperatively, history of stroke or brain tumor, uncorrected vision or&#xD;
      hearing impairment (unable to see pictures or read or hear instructions); limited use of the&#xD;
      dominant hand (limited ability to draw); and or inability to speak, read, or understand&#xD;
      English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be introduced to the study through a flyer provided to them in their surgeon's&#xD;
      office. A study team member will speak with those favorably predisposed to participate to&#xD;
      determine if they satisfy eligibility criteria. After obtaining consent, study staff will&#xD;
      gain information about the patient's age and years of education. Study staff will administer&#xD;
      Health and functional status activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of&#xD;
      daily living (IADLs), respectively, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment&#xD;
      Scale [WHODAS]) will be administered to all surgical patients. The World Health Organization&#xD;
      Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 is an alternative to the 36-Item Rand Health Survey&#xD;
      Short-Form (SF36) to measure physical health and disability. In addition, all patients will&#xD;
      be asked if they've had a fall within the last 6 months, whether they've been evaluated for a&#xD;
      change in memory or thinking, who accompanied them to their appointment, their employment&#xD;
      status and their living situation (alone, institutionalized, living with family members) in a&#xD;
      patient survey. The study staff will administer the MiniCog, a simple cognitive screening&#xD;
      tool that takes just 2-4 min to complete and has little or no education, language, or race&#xD;
      bias. In addition, the Animal Fluency test will be administered, which is a short cognitive&#xD;
      screen that takes one minute to complete. Frailty will be measured using the Frail Scale.&#xD;
      Other measures of cognitive impairment will be obtained by study staff through: documentation&#xD;
      on the patient's standard preoperative form, patient or informant report of diagnosis or&#xD;
      evaluation for cognitive impairment or memory concerns, and systematic medical record review.&#xD;
      Each enrolled patient will receive a business card listing the investigators' contact&#xD;
      information and be advised to expect a follow up telephone up to 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery to verify data elements and reassess functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium will be assessed prospectively once per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 if the&#xD;
      patient remains hospitalized, by a trained study team member using the Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method [CAM]. For patients that are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) postoperatively, the&#xD;
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) will be administered prospectively twice&#xD;
      per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 if the patient remains hospitalized by a trained&#xD;
      study team member (Attachment-CAM-ICU). Delirium is most common on postoperative days 1-3 and&#xD;
      the CAM is a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical patients. For functional status,&#xD;
      the WHODAS will be administered 6-12 months postoperatively either by personnel in the&#xD;
      surgeon's office as part of routine follow up or by study staff or by telephone. We will also&#xD;
      collect information on secondary outcomes including discharge to place other than home&#xD;
      (rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility), hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day reoperation&#xD;
      or readmission rate, and 30-day mortality. These outcomes are recorded in the medical record,&#xD;
      the BWH Balanced Scorecard, an electronic database of all hospitalized patients that&#xD;
      tabulates 31 elements of the hospital event, or the Brigham and Women's Hospital BWH Research&#xD;
      Patient Database Enhanced Query. Data will also be confirmed by a follow up telephone&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;

    <measure>Delirium by Age</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 days post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The median ages of patients who did or did not develop post-operative delirium as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a short diagnostic interview for CAM-defined delirium. Delirium is defined as the sudden change in someone's thinking ability that can have devastating consequences and can be very easily missed due to its frequent subtlety. The 4 CAM features assessed by the CAM include: acute onset or fluctuation, inattention, disorganized thinking, or altered level of consciousness.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 3 days post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with a metabolic equivalent of task (METS) score &lt; 4 who did or did not develop post-operative delirium as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method. The METS score is a ratio of the working metabolic rate relative to the resting metabolic rate and is one way to describe the intensity of an exercise or activity. This was assessed by the preoperative or surgical study staff. A score of &lt; 3 is for light intesity activities, 3-6 for moderate intensity activities, and ≥ 6 for vigorous intensity activities.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 3 days post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Median mini-cog score of patients who did or did not develop post-operative delirium as assessed by the confusion assessment method. The Mini-Cog is a brief cognitive screening test for visuospatial representation, recall, and executive function. The test involves that includes recalling three words (banana, sunrise, and chair) and a clock drawing. The Mini-Cog has a scale from 0 to 5, a with higher scores suggesting better cognitive performance. One point is designated for each of 3 words recalled and up to two points for the clock drawing component.</description>

    <description>Surgical invasiveness for patients who did or did not develop post-operative delirium as assessed by the confusion assessment method. The levels of invasiveness were categorized clinically as the following: Tier 1 for microdiscectomy, Tier 2 for lumbar laminectomy, anterior cervical, minimally invasive, foraminotomy, facetectomy, Tier 3 for lumbar fusion, trauma, and post-cervical, and Tier 4 for tumor, infection, deformity, and anterior and posterior cervical. Higher tiers indicate greater levels of invasiveness. Since there were very few patients with an invasiveness of 1 or 4 they were placed into two groups, with invasiveness levels I and 2 or 3 and 4.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Between April 17, 2017 and October 9, 2018, study staff members recruited patients ≥ 70 yr of age scheduled for elective spine surgery at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and were expected to have an inpatient admission after their procedure. We selected this patient population because spine surgery is the third most common surgical procedure in older persons18 and our previous work showed that nearly 20% of this surgical demographic develops delirium postoperatively.</recruitment_details>

          <description>The Mini-Cog is a brief cognitive screening test for visuospatial representation, recall, and executive function. The test involves that includes recalling three words (banana, sunrise, and chair) and a clock drawing. The Mini-Cog has a scale from 0 to 5, and a score of ≥ 3 indicates better cognitive outcomes. One point is designated for each of 3 words recalled and up to two points for the clock drawing component.</description>

          <title>Surgical Invasiveness</title>
          <description>Surgical invasiveness on a 4 point scale. The stages were categorized clinically as the following: Tier 1 for microdiscectomy, Tier 2 for lumbar laminectomy, anterior cervical, minimally invasive, foraminotomy, facetectomy, Tier 3 for lumbar fusion, trauma, and post-cervical, and Tier 4 for tumor, infection, deformity, and anterior and posterior cervical. Higher tiers indicate greater levels of invasiveness. Since there were very few patients with an invasiveness of 1 or 4 they were placed into two groups, with invasiveness levels I and 2 or 3 and 4.</description>

        <description>The median ages of patients who did or did not develop post-operative delirium as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a short diagnostic interview for CAM-defined delirium. Delirium is defined as the sudden change in someone's thinking ability that can have devastating consequences and can be very easily missed due to its frequent subtlety. The 4 CAM features assessed by the CAM include: acute onset or fluctuation, inattention, disorganized thinking, or altered level of consciousness.</description>

The Mini-Cog is a brief cognitive screening test for visuospatial representation, recall, and executive function. The test involves that includes recalling three words (banana, sunrise, and chair) and a clock drawing. The Mini-Cog has a scale from 0 to 5, a with higher scores suggesting better cognitive performance. One point is designated for each of 3 words recalled and up to two points for the clock drawing component.</description>

The levels of invasiveness were categorized clinically as the following: Tier 1 for microdiscectomy, Tier 2 for lumbar laminectomy, anterior cervical, minimally invasive, foraminotomy, facetectomy, Tier 3 for lumbar fusion, trauma, and post-cervical, and Tier 4 for tumor, infection, deformity, and anterior and posterior cervical. Higher tiers indicate greater levels of invasiveness. Since there were very few patients with an invasiveness of 1 or 4 they were placed into two groups, with invasiveness levels I and 2 or 3 and 4.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Thirty percent of eligible patients declined participation in this study leading to potential selection bias based on the type of person who chooses to participate in such a study. There is also the possibility that we underestimated the prevalence of post-operative delirium because we only assessed patients for delirium once a day for 3 days post-op and by systematic chart review.</limitations_and_caveats>
