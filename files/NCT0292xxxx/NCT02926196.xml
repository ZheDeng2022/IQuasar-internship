      Phase III randomized trial of the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab as adjuvant or&#xD;
      post-neoadjuvant treatment for high-risk triple negative breast cancer patients. The overall&#xD;
      protocol-defined patient population will include the following two strata of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum A - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery&#xD;
           of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum B - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery of the primary tumor and (if indicated)&#xD;
           further adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

             HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH non-amplified), as defined by the local pathology&#xD;
             laboratory. In case of discordance between the pre-treatment diagnostic core-biopsy&#xD;
             and the surgical sample, the receptor assessment performed on the surgical sample has&#xD;
             to be considered for inclusion criteria evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequately excised: patients should have undergone adequate tumor excision after&#xD;
             preoperative chemotherapy, which means surgical removal of all clinically evident&#xD;
             disease in the breast and lymph nodes.&#xD;

             ii. In case of positive results from a fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or&#xD;
             sentinel node biopsy performed prior to preoperative therapy, additional surgical&#xD;
             evaluation of the axilla following preoperative therapy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. If sentinel node biopsy performed before preoperative therapy was negative, no&#xD;
             additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is required after preoperative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iv. Sentinel node after preoperative therapy is allowed if no evidence of axillary&#xD;
             node involvement was documented by ultrasonography at diagnosis. If sentinel node&#xD;
             biopsy after preoperative therapy is negative, no further additional surgical&#xD;
             evaluation of the axilla is required. If sentinel node biopsy performed after&#xD;
             preoperative therapy is positive, additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is&#xD;

             at least 7 unstained tumor slides (tumor sample from the diagnostic core-biopsy&#xD;
             obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy). In case only 7 unstained slides from the&#xD;
             bioptic sample will be available, the investigator must ensure that the sample&#xD;
             contains tumor tissue by performing an hematoxylin and eosin staining.&#xD;
