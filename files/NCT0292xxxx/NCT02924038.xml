  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, two arm neoadjuvant vaccine study in human leukocyte antigen-A2&#xD;
      positive (HLA-A2+) adults with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II glioma, for which&#xD;
      surgical resection of the tumor is clinically indicated. Co-primary objectives are to&#xD;
      determine: 1) the safety of the novel combination of subcutaneously administered IMA950&#xD;
      peptides and poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) and i.v. administered CDX-1127 (Varlilumab) in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant approach; and 2) whether addition of i.v. CDX-1127 (Varlilumab) increases the&#xD;
      response rate and magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against the IMA950 peptides in&#xD;
      post-vaccine peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples obtained from participating&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Low-grade gliomas (LGG), the most common of which are pilocytic astrocytomas, diffuse&#xD;
      astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas are a diverse family of central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      neoplasms that occur in children and adults. Based on data from the American Cancer Society&#xD;
      and Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBRTUS), approximately 1,800 LGG were&#xD;
      diagnosed in 2006, thus representing approximately 10% of newly diagnosed primary brain&#xD;
      tumors in the United States. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I) are the most common brain&#xD;
      tumor in children 5 to 19 years of age. Diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas are all&#xD;
      considered WHO grade II low grade gliomas (LGG) and are more common in adults. Pilocytic&#xD;
      astrocytomas are generally well circumscribed histologically and radiographically and&#xD;
      amenable to cure with gross total resection. In contrast, the diffuse astrocytomas and&#xD;
      oligodendrogliomas are more infiltrative and less amenable to complete resection. From a&#xD;
      molecular genetics standpoint, the most common alterations in LGG are IDH1 mutations and&#xD;
      mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53, located on chromosome 17, the gene product of&#xD;
      which is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell death&#xD;
      (apoptosis), and transcription. Additionally, several molecular factors are of favorable&#xD;
      prognostic significance, particularly the presence of 1p/19q co-deletion and isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO grade II LGGs are at risk to undergo malignant transformation into more aggressive and&#xD;
      lethal WHO grade III or IV high-grade glioma (HGG). Even with a combination of available&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy [RT], chemotherapy), the invasive&#xD;
      growth and resistance to therapy exhibited by these tumors results in recurrence and death in&#xD;
      most patients. Although postoperative RT in LGG significantly improves 5-year&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), it does not prolong overall survival (OS) compared with&#xD;
      delayed RT given at the time of progression. Early results from a randomized trial of&#xD;
      radiation therapy plus procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy for&#xD;
      supratentorial adult LGG (RTOG 9802) demonstrated improved PFS in patients receiving PCV plus&#xD;
      RT compared RT alone. Nonetheless, PCV is considerably toxic and currently not widely used&#xD;
      for management of glioma patients. Although chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) is currently&#xD;
      being investigated in LGG patients, it is unknown whether it confers improved OS in these&#xD;
      patients. Further, our recent study has indicated that 6 of 10 LGG cases treated with TMZ&#xD;
      progressed to HGG with markedly increased exome mutations and, more worrisome, driver&#xD;
      mutations in the RB and AKT-mTOR pathways, with predominant C&gt;T/G&gt;A transitions at CpC and&#xD;
      CpT dinucleotides, strongly suggesting a signature of TMZ-induced mutagenesis; this study&#xD;
      also showed that in 43% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial tumor were&#xD;
      undetected at recurrence, while IDH mutations were the only type of mutations that persisted&#xD;
      in the initial and recurrent tumors. These data suggests the possibility that treatment of&#xD;
      LGG patients with TMZ may enhance oncogenic mutations and genetic elusiveness of LGG,&#xD;
      therefore calling for development of safer and effective therapeutic modalities such as&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, LGG are considered a premalignant condition for HGG, such that novel&#xD;
      interventions to prevent malignant transformation need to be evaluated in patients with LGG.&#xD;
      Immunotherapeutic modalities, such as vaccines, may offer a safe and effective option for&#xD;
      these patients due to the slower growth rate of LGG (in contrast with HGG), which should&#xD;
      allow sufficient time for multiple immunizations and hence high levels of anti-glioma&#xD;
      immunity. Because patients with LGGs are generally not as immuno-compromised as patients with&#xD;
      HGG, they may also exhibit greater immunological response to and benefit from the vaccines.&#xD;
      Further, the generally mild toxicity of vaccines may improve quality of life compared with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or RT.&#xD;

             &gt;=60 ml/min/1.73 m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be free of systemic infection. Subjects with active infections (whether or not&#xD;
             they require antibiotic therapy) may be eligible after complete resolution of the&#xD;
             infection. Subjects on antibiotic therapy must be off antibiotics for at least 7 days&#xD;
             before beginning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device (IUD),&#xD;
             surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) for the duration&#xD;
             of the vaccination period. Sexually active males must agree to use barrier&#xD;
             contraceptive for the duration of the vaccination period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (ex.&#xD;
             Hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and&#xD;
             for the duration of study participation (until one month after the last vaccine) since&#xD;
             the effects of the current regimen on the developing human fetus are unknown. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must sign an informed consent document indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study, which includes an authorization for the release&#xD;
             of their protected health information&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of gliomatosis cerebri, cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of T1 Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions (on MRI) suggestive of high-grade&#xD;
             glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological diagnosis for the resected tumor demonstrates transformation to higher&#xD;
             grade (i.e. WHO grade III or IV) gliomas. If a patient is diagnosed as HGG upon&#xD;
             resection after receiving the pre-surgical treatment, the patient will be withdrawn&#xD;
             from the study and considered for therapeutic options for HGG (trials for HGG or&#xD;
             standard of care). The tumor tissue of such a case would be brought to the lab before&#xD;
             the pathological diagnosis is made; and thus would be processed before the lab is&#xD;
             informed of the final HGG diagnosis. Because HGG tissue may still reflect the vaccine&#xD;
             effects, we will evaluate the tumor tissue to help us develop future approaches for&#xD;
             HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IMA950 and poly-ICLC are drugs&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with IMA950 plus poly-ICLC (IMA950-poly-ICLC hereafter)&#xD;
             vaccine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IMA950-&#xD;
             poly-ICLC vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (e.g. active or chronic hepatitis B and C), symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or current status of immune system abnormalities such as hyperimmunity (e.g.,&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases) that needed to be treated by systemic therapy, such as&#xD;
             immuno-suppressants and hypoimmunity (e.g., myelodysplastic disorders, marrow&#xD;
             failures, AIDS, transplant immunosuppression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any isolated laboratory abnormality suggestive of a serious autoimmune disease (e.g.&#xD;
             hypothyroidism): Antinuclear antibody, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free&#xD;
             thyroxine (FT4), rheumatoid factor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that could potentially alter immune function (AIDS, multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             diabetes, renal failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or dexamethasone &gt; 4mg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following concurrent treatment or medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  interferon (e.g. Intron-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  allergy desensitization injections&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  growth factors (e.g. Procrit, Aranesp, Neulasta)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any investigational therapeutic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior cancer diagnosis except the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
