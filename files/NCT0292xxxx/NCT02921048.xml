  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study recruits healthy individuals who have been routinely taking high&#xD;
      amount (at least 3 g/wk) of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid&#xD;
      (DHA), and those who don't, and examines the efficacy of dietary EPA and DHA in ameliorating&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary effects of exposure to ambient air pollution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To examine the relationship between blood levels of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and cardiopulmonary responses to environmental air&#xD;
      pollution in healthy adults. EPA and DHA are two important omega-3 fatty acids that are&#xD;
      mainly found in seafoods and fish oils and associated with beneficial effects to human&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Healthy 35-55 year-old male and female subjects will be screened for their&#xD;
      dietary intake of EPA and DHA. Qualified volunteers will be divided into two groups, group 1:&#xD;
      individuals voluntarily taking at least 3 g/wk of EPA and DHA from dietary sources including&#xD;
      fish oil supplements and ocean fish/shellfish consumption for a period of at least 6 months&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the study; group 2: individuals who have consumed no more than 1&#xD;
      serving size (4-6 oz)/month of ocean fish/shellfish, or no more than 1 pill/month of fish oil&#xD;
      supplement during the 6 month period preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (Methods): In this observational panel study, subjects will come to the U.S. EPA&#xD;
      Human Studies Facility for up to 5 sessions, each consisting of 2 consecutive visit days. The&#xD;
      following endpoints will be collected: blood pressure, heart rate variability measurements,&#xD;
      blood biomarkers, endothelial cell function, retinal venule and arteriole diameter, and lung&#xD;
      function. Air pollution exposure will be assessed using area-specific air quality data&#xD;
      derived from local air monitoring stations interfaced with activity monitoring and GPS&#xD;
      tracked location for each subject.&#xD;
