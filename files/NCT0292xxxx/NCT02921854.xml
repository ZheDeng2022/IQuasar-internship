    <textblock>
      In this exploratory study, the investigators will investigate if markers (molecular and&#xD;
      immunological) of ICD or anti-tumor immunity (exosomal or molecular) can be detected in the&#xD;
      serum of patients after high-dose radiotherapy alone or concurrent cisplatin-doublet therapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy. For each patient: withdraw blood at three times during treatment for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main aim of anticancer therapies is to exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. It&#xD;
      recently emerged that some anticancer therapeutic modalities are capable of inducing a cell&#xD;
      death subroutine called immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can mediate specific, sustained&#xD;
      anticancer immunity. These observations have marked the beginning of intense research into&#xD;
      immunoadjuvant or anticancer immunity inducing &quot;side-effects&quot; associated with anticancer&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, in humans, no ICD-associated predictive biomarkers have been identified, which&#xD;
      hampers the development of immunological strategies. No published data about human biomarkers&#xD;
      for ICD is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, ICD has been found to be associated with the spatiotemporally defined emission of&#xD;
      danger signals such as surface exposed calreticulin (CRT) or heat shock protein 90 (HSP90),&#xD;
      secreted ATP and released TLR4 agonists like HMGB1 or HSP70. Moreover, recently it has&#xD;
      emerged that ICD may also be associated with a &quot;viral response-like chemokine signature&#xD;
      (VCS)&quot; capable of acting as both 'find me' signal (for granulocytic myeloid cells) and 'keep&#xD;
      away' signal (for immature monocytic myeloid cells) - further details of this paradigm are&#xD;
      under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the presence of these molecular determinants of ICD can be used to monitor the host&#xD;
      immune status and as a predictive biomarker. Examples include: danger signals as surrogate&#xD;
      positive biomarkers (HMGB1, HSP70 and autoantibodies against CRT/HSP90); viral-response like&#xD;
      chemokine signature as direct positive biomarkers (IFN1A, IFN1B and CXCL10&gt;CCL2&gt;CXCL1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of determinants of ICD can be confirmed through the strategy of following&#xD;
      biomarkers (in non-hematological cancers):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer cell-associated pro-tumorigenic cytokines/factors IL1A, IL10, IL6, TGF-B, VEGFA,&#xD;
           VEFGC, IDO enzyme, CXCL12, IL8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune cell-associated pro-tumorigenic cytokines/chemokines/factors IL10, IDO enzyme,&#xD;
           TGF-B, IL4, IL5, IL13, TNF, M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL26, CXCl5, CCL7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  danger signals as surrogate positive biomarkers HMGB1, HSP70 and autoantibodies against&#xD;
           CRT/HSP90&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer cell-associated viral response-like chemokine signature IFN-a, IFN-b, CXCL9,&#xD;
           CXCL10, CXCL1 and CCL2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune cell-associated anti-tumorigenic cytokines or chemokines as positive biomarkers&#xD;
           IL1B, IL12p70, IL15, IFNG, IL22, IL23, IL17A, IL2, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL13, CCL8, CCL19,&#xD;
           CXCL11,CCL12, CCL17, CCL23, CCL22, CCL13, CCL24, CCL1, CCL26, CXCL2, CXCL16 Moreover,&#xD;
           the investigators will also investigate serum-associated exosomes as possible biomarkers&#xD;
           of an efficient antitumor response. Compared to certain soluble biomarkers (which are&#xD;
           accessible and thus more susceptible to extracellular proteases), exosomal biomarkers&#xD;
           can exhibit a longer half-life than their soluble equivalents, due to the &quot;protection&quot;&#xD;
           provided by their encompassing lipid membrane. Therefore, the investigators are also&#xD;
           interested in exploiting exosomes as a source of antitumor response information and as&#xD;
           novel biomarkers of therapeutic success (those mentioned above and others under&#xD;
           investigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy has been established through various robust lines of in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      evaluation to be capable of inducing ICD and anticancer immune responses. As an exploratory&#xD;
      analysis, we will integrate lipidomics into the workflow. This has already been done in&#xD;
      multiple disease settings and NSCLC has already proven to change lipid content in a&#xD;
      quantifiable manner. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      certain biomarkers of ICD that were identified in vitro or ex vivo are detectable in patient&#xD;
      sera following radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Radiotherapy alone or concurrent&#xD;
      cisplatin-doublet and radiotherapy will be investigated. The investigator will conduct this&#xD;
      pilot study to gather initial data to build upon in future clinical trials, as there is no in&#xD;
      vivo data available on this topic. Results will be published and used for future grant&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
