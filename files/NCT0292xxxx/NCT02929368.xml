  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, has now been successfully in use for&#xD;
      many years, especially in the chemotherapeutic treatment of oncologic patients or in&#xD;
      parenertal nutrition. The implantation of PICC lines is mostly performed under x-ray&#xD;
      (fluoroscopy). The aim of the clinical study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of the&#xD;
      SHERLOCK-Systems eliminating the confirmatory chest x-ray exposure. Additionally, the&#xD;
      SHERLOCK-System immediately confirms the PICC tip position even at the bedside of the&#xD;
      patient, thus, saving costs and time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, are clinically used for many years in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients, whereby the implantation occurs under x-ray/fluoroscopy. Female&#xD;
      and male patients of legal age that have the medical indication for Power-PICC-Line catheter&#xD;
      implantation can be screened for the study. These medical indications include the necessity&#xD;
      of chemotherapy in the course of an oncological treatment or parenteral nutrition. The study&#xD;
      objective is to test the efficacy and safety of the SHERLOCK system, evaluated by a&#xD;
      monocentric, randomized-controlled study. The advantage for the participating patients lies&#xD;
      in a reduced radiation exposure due to the discontinued final chest x-ray examination&#xD;
      (fluoroscopy). Furthermore, the SHERLOCK system can be deployed directly on ward, at the&#xD;
      patient's bedside leading to a cost and time saving. Recruited in- and outpatients (of legal&#xD;
      age) with indication for Power-PICC-Line catheter implantation will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two arms (fluoroscopy or SHERLOCK). Depending on randomization, the Power-PICC&#xD;
      implantation occurs either under fluoroscopy or with the SHERLOCK system. All related&#xD;
      substances, measures or procedures are performed according to the clinical routine. The&#xD;
      medical device is a fully integrated magnetic tracking and ECG-based peripherally inserted&#xD;
      central catheter (PICC) tip confirmation technology applied on patients with normal sinus&#xD;
      rhythm and placed through a peripheral vein. The Sherlock system is CE-certified since&#xD;
      December 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The referral of patients with indication to PICC-Line implantation at the institute of&#xD;
      diagnostic and interventional radiology occurs through different departments of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Jena. The patients are registered for radiological treatment and checked&#xD;
      again by a radiologist if a PICC-Line implantation is indicated. If this is the case, the&#xD;
      radiologist conducts an informed consent discussion with the patient about possible&#xD;
      complications and risks during intervention and informs him also about a possible study.&#xD;
      After signature of the written informed consent, the patient is included. On the intervention&#xD;
      day, the patient is randomly assigned to one of the two study arms through RandomTool&#xD;
      (Sherlock vs. fluoroscopy). According to randomization group, the PICC catheter is implanted&#xD;
      (duration: 30 minutes) and eventually a chest x-ray (fluoroscopy) is performed to assess&#xD;
      safety and efficacy.The intervention time from puncture to catheter placement is documented.&#xD;
      After intervention, the patient is transferred back to the ward or sent home in&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable conditions. The examination of the puncture site before discharge is&#xD;
      performed by a ward physician or by the family doctor. 24 h after PICC-Line implantation, the&#xD;
      treating physician is contacted and questioned about possible complications (catheter&#xD;
      occlusion, haematoma, infection of the puncture site, arm vein thrombosis, pain, etc.), that&#xD;
      are then thoroughly documented.&#xD;
