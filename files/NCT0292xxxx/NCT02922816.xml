  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant patients are at increased risk of colonization and infection with Multidrug&#xD;
      Resistant Organisms (MDROs) due to medications that modify their immune systems, increased&#xD;
      healthcare and antibiotic exposure, and surgical manipulation of mucosa. In this study,&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients who have infections with resistant bacteria will be given a Fecal&#xD;
      Microbiota Transplant (FMT), also known as a fecal transplant, after they receive antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. This study will see if FMT will eliminate the resistant bacteria so that the&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients do not have to use last resort antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 pilot study is to obtain preliminary safety data for FMT in renal transplant&#xD;
      patients to support the rationale for a subsequent clinical trial, not to establish efficacy&#xD;
      or toxicity. This trial is designed to test the safety of FMT, identify clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      assess feasibility, and refine the target population in participants with MDRO colonization&#xD;
      and intestinal dysbiosis. Data from this study should provide directions for the design of&#xD;
      future clinical trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants who meet key eligibility criteria [adults who have undergone renal&#xD;
      transplantation and have a history of infection with the Target Multidrug Resistant Organisms&#xD;
      (MDRO)] will be approached for consideration of study participation. For this study, Target&#xD;
      MDRO colonization is defined as a positive bacterial culture of either carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Extended Spectrum&#xD;
      Beta-Lactamases (ESBL), and/or multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas from stool or perirectal&#xD;
      swab sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 20 trial participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms: the control&#xD;
      arm [not receiving Allogeneic Human Stool in Glycerol (10%; AHSG) via Fecal Microbiota&#xD;
      Transplant (FMT)] and the experimental arm (receiving AHSG via FMT). Participants in the&#xD;
      control arm participants can crossover to receive the treatment after completing a study&#xD;
      cycle without FMT. Each cycle lasts 6 weeks and participants will complete a maximum of 2&#xD;
      treatment cycles; participants randomized to the experimental arm will complete a maximum of&#xD;
      two cycles and those randomized to the control arm will complete up to three cycles. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the final cycle, all trial participants will be followed for just over 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the trial participants, there will also be one stool donor participant. The&#xD;
      consented, screened, and eligible stool donor will be identified from an established group of&#xD;
      stool donors and will undergo screening procedures that are specific to this study. This&#xD;
      individual will donate human stool for the preparation of the AHSG (known as the&#xD;
      investigational new drug (IND) product for this study). Upon processing of AHSG, the stool&#xD;
      donor will enter the Follow-Up Period and remain available for communication to the study&#xD;
      team (if necessary) until the Study Completion Date. However, no scheduled study assessments&#xD;
      are required of the stool donor.&#xD;
