      comparison to no glasses, on the following aspects in computer-related office work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any enhancement on visual performance of basic visual function, including visual acuity,&#xD;
           contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any enhancement on visual performance of typical office work, including reading,&#xD;
           word-spelling check, number searching, or target identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in objective viewing comfort measured with viewing distance, blink&#xD;
           frequency, post-viewing pupil size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in subjective viewing comfort reflected on the questionnaire of viewing&#xD;
           symptom survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in viewing comfort and visual performance with increased environmental&#xD;
           ventilation or under strong glare.&#xD;

      &lt;Introduction&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performing near work, one must focus at (accommodate) and point toward (converge) at a&#xD;
      closer distance, and constantly re-focus the eyes in order to see small text and images with&#xD;
      clarity. Sustaining such efforts can lead to eye fatigue and eye strain, among a host of&#xD;
      vision problems. Most visual tasks on a screen also demand heightened visual concentration&#xD;
      and this decreases blink rate. Combined with working in a heated or air-conditioned office&#xD;
      environment, which leads to over-evaporation of tear film and lipid deficiency, irritation&#xD;
      and dryness to the surface of the cornea are expected. Disruptive glare from excessive screen&#xD;
      reflection and ambient lighting also deteriorates the image quality and heaps on viewing&#xD;
      discomfort. With extensive screen viewing also exacerbate discomfort in people with existing&#xD;
      vision problems like eye muscle imbalance, astigmatism, farsightedness and presbyopia. Since&#xD;
      technology is almost unavoidable to modern life, preventions should be taken to lessen the&#xD;
      total toll on the eyes and visual system. Gunnar computer glasses address the above issues by&#xD;
      providing mild yellow tint anti-reflection coating aimed to shield the harmful blue light and&#xD;
      lessen strong glare. The glasses also have a small amount of magnification (+0.5 D) to&#xD;
      enhance acuity. The curved frame is designed to retain moisture and reduce dry eye symptoms.&#xD;
      All these special characters are devised to enhance visual performance and minimize eye&#xD;
      fatigue and visual discomfort in digital viewing. The current study aimed to validate the&#xD;
      aforementioned benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gunnar over-the counter (OTC) computer glasses adopt yellow lenses to cut off the active&#xD;
      short wavelength and lessen the bright glare, which often induces the detrimental effect&#xD;
      caused by excessive illumination or intense scattered reflection. While the general benefit&#xD;
      of glare reduction is well received, the benefit on visual performance has been inconclusive.&#xD;
      Some studies reported significant enhancement in contrast sensitivity, but some failed to see&#xD;
      any improvement on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, even with color distortion.&#xD;
      Without argument, tinted lenses reduce the transmittance of the visible spectrum and change&#xD;
      the visible color to a certain degree. However, there has been report that a reduction of the&#xD;
      retinal illumination level does not necessarily lead to reduced brightness; instead, the&#xD;
      visual system automatically adjusts for the illumination discounting, possibly with the help&#xD;
      of increased pupil size. In addition, with the decrement of blue lights arriving to the eyes,&#xD;
      both scattered reflection and chromatic aberration are reduced. Together, it is reasonable to&#xD;
      believe that the visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and chromatic discrimination will not&#xD;
      suffer and may, instead, benefit from the filter of yellow lenses. These basic visual&#xD;
      functions may, in turn, lead to enhancement in general visual performance such as routine&#xD;
      office work. These will be tested in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study tested if Gunnar's OTC computer glasses provide any advantages, in&#xD;
      comparison to no glasses, on the following aspects in computer-related office work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any enhancement on visual performance of basic visual function, including visual acuity,&#xD;
           contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any enhancement on visual performance of typical office work, including reading,&#xD;
           word-spelling check, number searching, or target identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in preventing from dry eye by measuring the humidity outside and inside the&#xD;
           frame (only in the visit with Gunnar glasses) and the tear film break-up time after&#xD;
           viewing for a prolonged period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in objective viewing comfort measured with viewing distance, blink&#xD;
           frequency, post-viewing pupil size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in subjective viewing comfort reflected on the questionnaire of viewing&#xD;
           symptom survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in viewing comfort and visual performance with increased environmental&#xD;
           ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in viewing comfort and visual performance with increased environmental under&#xD;
           strong glare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any benefit in life quality from daily wearing (e.g., viewing comfort, sleep quality or&#xD;
           quantity due to the amount of stimulation from blue light)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their willingness to purchase (select) the tested Gunnar OTC glasses, and the price&#xD;
           willing to pay for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Study design&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four subjects, age 18 to 42, were planned to be recruited. This sample size is based&#xD;
      on a priori power analysis with 80% and a medium effect size at alpha equal to 0.05. Subjects&#xD;
      will be stratified into 4 age groups. About equal number (8Â±1) of subjects should have been&#xD;
      recruited for each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18-23 yr old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-29 yr old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-35 yr old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  36-42 yr old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject was scheduled for 3 visits: Visit 1 for screening and consenting, visit 2 for&#xD;
      lab test after treatment 1, and visit 3 for lab test after treatment 2. Between visits was a&#xD;
      adaptation period for the assigned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1, when a subject first joins the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain informed consent and screening measurements (VA, contrast sensitivity, tear film&#xD;
           break-up time as dry eye measurement, Dry eye questionnaire (OSDI), viewing symptom&#xD;
           survey (VSS), history of dry eye and computer work behavior).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the visit, half of the subjects were given a pair of Gunnar OTC glasses&#xD;
           for adaptation for 3 - 7 days; the other half were given no treatment. All subjects were&#xD;
           told to work in front of computer for at least 4 hour a day, with the assigned glasses&#xD;
           if given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Starting on Day 1, for 3 to 7 days, subject was asked to work in front of computers for at&#xD;
      least 4 hours each day with assigned treatment 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Lab test for treatment 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On a day between day 4 and day 8 convenient to the subject, subject came to the lab with&#xD;
           the assigned glasses condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline measurements will be taken, followed by a few visual tasks under 3 viewing&#xD;
           conditions. Subject was asked to fill out the VSS, given a break, before tested on&#xD;
           another round of tasks under a different viewing condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total testing time is about 70 minutes for each condition and about 4 hours to&#xD;
           complete the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lab testing procedure is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of visit 2, treatment was alternated for another 3-7 days of adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation 2 with treatment 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Starting on the day of Visit 2 after the test, subject adapt to the second treatment (with&#xD;
      Gunnar glasses or without any glasses) for another 3 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Lab test for treatment 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same procedure of Visit 2 was repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject was asked to rate their preference of wearing the Gunnar Glasses over no-glasses&#xD;
           when performing computer tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this visit, the study was completed for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of lab testing procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study adopted a crossover design. Each subject went through three viewing conditions&#xD;
           (control, bright light, strong ventilating) based on a Latin Square order.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the control condition, the subject will perform all tasks under regular office&#xD;
                lighting (500 lux) and the default lab ventilation condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In the bright light condition, the ambient light will be increased to 1500 lux.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In the strong ventilation condition, a ceiling fan will be positioned on top of the&#xD;
                subject at the ceiling light location to increase the air flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Visual performance tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline measurements (10 min): Upon arrival, subject was asked to fill out VSS and&#xD;
           OSDI. Measurements of dry eye condition, pupil size, accommodation status, and blink&#xD;
           rate were taken as baseline for the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Under viewing condition 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual tasks (60 minutes): Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color perception,&#xD;
                visual search of numbers among a number matrix, low-contrast target search, text&#xD;
                reading, and spelling check were performed by a fixed order.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Post-task measurements of dry eye measure (Tear break up time), pupil size,&#xD;
                accommodation, and blink rate as well as VSS were taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Break time of 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat the above procedures for the other two viewing conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total time for one lab visit was about 4 hours.&#xD;
