  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to participate in this study because you have a complex wound that&#xD;
      requires treatment with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). NPWT is a therapeutic&#xD;
      technique which involves the placement of a wound vacuum at the site of the wound. The wound&#xD;
      vacuum delivers a negative pressure at the wound site through a dressing. Any fluid collected&#xD;
      during this process is collected through a foam (sponge) underneath the dressing. This&#xD;
      therapy helps to draw the edges of the wound together, while removing infectious material, to&#xD;
      help promote healthy tissue growth and speed up wound healing. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if placing polypropylene suture (a material normally used to close wounds)&#xD;
      between the wound and the NPWT foam would decrease pain upon removal of the sponge while&#xD;
      allowing adequate healing of the wound.&#xD;

      If you decide to participate in the study you will be asked to sign this informed consent&#xD;
      form prior to beginning any study activities. If you agree to participate the study&#xD;
      procedures are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants enrolled in this study will receive NPWT in combination with&#xD;
           polypropylene suture being laid out over half of the wound. Enrollment in this study is&#xD;
           not considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  You will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to what side of the wound the suture&#xD;
                will be placed on. Randomization means the study team has no say in what side the&#xD;
                suture goes on. Your information is put into a computer and the computer picks what&#xD;
                side to place the suture. The polypropylene suture will be placed over half of your&#xD;
                wound. There is an equal chance for the polypropylene suture to be placed on the&#xD;
                right or left side. The other half of your wound will not have the polypropylene&#xD;
                suture in place and will act as the control (comparison) group in this study. The&#xD;
                use of the study polypropylene suture is not considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wound vacuum will be placed over the entire wound and will be left in place for no&#xD;
           more than 3 days as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After no more than 3 days at a time during the healing process, the nurses will remove&#xD;
           the wound vacuum, dressings, suture, and the sponge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One blinded (they are not told which side of the wound the suture is placed on) study&#xD;
           physician will come look at your wound. This study physicians will determine if further&#xD;
           NPWT, with or without the study polypropylene suture, is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete a pain rating questionnaire (rating scale 0-10) in&#xD;
           relation to both sides of your wound when the wound vacuum has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If further NPWT is needed without the use of the study polypropylene suture, you will be&#xD;
           withdrawn from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If discharged with NPWT you will not continue receive polypropylene suture placement and&#xD;
           that would be end of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If further NPWT is needed with the use of negative pressure wound therapy, the&#xD;
           polypropylene suture and the sponge will be placed and the process will continue as&#xD;
           noted above until your wound is healed or you are withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information from your medical records will be collected throughout this study. You will&#xD;
           also be asked questions about your medical and surgical history as well as what&#xD;
           medications you are currently taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your demographics will be collected including your age, date of birth, race, sex,&#xD;
           height, weight, and ethnicity.&#xD;
