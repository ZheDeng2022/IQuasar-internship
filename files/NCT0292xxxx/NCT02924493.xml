  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with endometriosis experience extra genital and abdominal symptoms as a major&#xD;
      part of their problem. This includes gastrointestinal dysfunction with pain, urinary symptoms&#xD;
      compatible with interstitial cystitis and gastrointestinal symptoms resembling the irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Such problems may be secondary to changes in autonomous neuronal&#xD;
      structure and function elicited by the endometriotic elements, which may cause a &quot;visceral&#xD;
      syndrome&quot; with the above mentioned symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that dietary treatment will improve the experience of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and quality of life in patients with endometriosis-related&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this first randomized, placebo controlled pilot study&#xD;
      investigating patients with both endometriosis and IBS, is to test the application of a low&#xD;
      FODMAP diet and a placebo diet for endometriosis-related IBS-like symptoms in order to&#xD;
      stablish a platform for a randomized controlled study. Thus, the primary aim of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to investigate the applicability of a placebo diet in patients with endometriosis&#xD;
      and to investigate the compliance in both intervention group and control group. In addition,&#xD;
      the aim is to investigate whether the participants find the diet manageable and whether they&#xD;
      are able to identify the placebo diet.&#xD;

    <description>This group will follow a exclusion diet called low FODMAP diet, which is a diet with restriction of fermentable carbohydrates. The patients will be guided on how to avoid some foods and how to include others. The patients will follow the diet for four weeks.</description>

    <description>This group will follow a placebo diet, which is designed to imitate the low FODMAP diet by restricting specific foods. However, it is randomly selected foods that will be excluded in this diet, so that it works only as a control diet. The patients in this group will also be guided how to follow the diet for four weeks.</description>

    <description>The participants follow the diet in 4 weeks. They have been provided with some foods (bread, pasta, cereal products), but will by the rest themselves. They have been provided with lists of foods to include and foods to avoid. They have also been provided with suggestions to a 4 week meal plan, based in their individual need for energy.</description>
