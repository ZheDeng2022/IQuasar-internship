      Inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care is associated with Development of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistant strains. As part of a quality improvement program carried out in primary care in&#xD;
      Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, a cluster randomized control trial was performed.&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to assess whether the use of continuous evidence-based feedback&#xD;
      about management of respiratory tract infections could decrease use of antibiotics in Acute&#xD;
      bronchitis, common cold and acute otitis media.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics is one of the most important reasons for&#xD;
      development of resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key strategies to curb the development of antibiotic resistance is to promote&#xD;
      intervention at primary care level as more than 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by general&#xD;
      practitioners - especially in patients suffering from respiratory tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main bacteria causing respiratory tract infections are S. pneumoniae y Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae. The first one is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80% of respiratory tract infections have a viral cause, are harmless and&#xD;
      self-limiting and in most cases patients recover without specific treatment. Antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment is superfluous and in some cases even harmful because of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections caused by resistant bacteria leads to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      and social collateral damage. Therefore, in 2013 the World Economic Forum pointed out&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance as one of the three most important threats to economic and social&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organisation (WHO) launched in 20121 a global strategy to hold back&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance. According to this strategy &quot;the battle against infectious diseases&#xD;
      is far from being over. Not only do they continue to cause a large number of infections and&#xD;
      deaths, particularly in developing countries, but the emergence and spread of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance is now also threatening to undermine our ability to treat infections and save&#xD;
      lives&quot;. The WHO has proposed a number of initiatives against the emergence of resistant&#xD;
      bacteria, including interventions to promote proper use of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAPPY AUDIT II (HA-II) - PART OF THE SOLUTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAPPY AUDIT - II is the second phase of HAPPY AUDIT - I, which was a project funded by the&#xD;
      European Union to promote appropriate use of antibiotics in 6 countries with a very&#xD;
      heterogeneous pattern of consumption of antibiotics and prevalence of resistant strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      440 general practitioners registered data in winter 2008 and 2009. Inappropriate antibiotic&#xD;
      use was reduced by 10% and in pathologies such as acute bronchitis, there was a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in use of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Argentina, 48 general practitioners participated in the whole process and reached a 30%&#xD;
      reduction of unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis,&#xD;
      sinusitis and pharyngitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive experience of the first phase has shown the importance and the potential to&#xD;
      spread the project to other provinces of Argentina and other South American countries. Our&#xD;
      prior knowledge will be used in the HAPPY AUDIT II SOUTH AMERICA to plan interventions for&#xD;
      patients and GPs through the methodology APO (Audit Project Odense) which is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. self-reflection of physicians and group discussion on their prescription patterns,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patient education,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development of a multi-faceted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the project is to promote the rational use of antibiotics. This will&#xD;
      be achieved through the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preparation of intervention materials for patients and professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of APO cycles in 4 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initial registration of GPs and use of antibiotics for their RTI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analysis of the results of the first registration to identify quality problems in&#xD;
           prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Development of a multifaceted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Implementation of a cluster randomized control trial to assess the effect of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Final registration to evaluate the effect of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 GPs will participate: Argentina 80 physicians, Bolivia 30 physicians, Paraguay 40&#xD;
      physicians and Uruguay 30 physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the APO methodology, which based on a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach seeks&#xD;
      to change practice behaviour among GPs. The GPs voluntarily participate and set their own&#xD;
      quality criteria in order to improve the quality of their own service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APO method includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial registration of GPs own activities (3 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention (online evidence-based reminders during final registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final registration and evaluation (3 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      February - May 2014 - coordinators and researchers first meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
      June - August 2014 - First audit registration during 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      October 2014 - Coordinators and researchers second meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
      March 2015 - Meeting with General Practitioners from all provinces and/ or countries. This&#xD;
      meeting will be divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Discussion of the results from the first registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discussion about the use of quality indicators to decrease inappropriate use of&#xD;
           antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      June - August 2015 - Second registration, intervention (online weekly feedback on&#xD;
      evidence-based management of respiratory tract infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
      November 2016 - Assessment of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      April 2017 - Publication of results&#xD;
