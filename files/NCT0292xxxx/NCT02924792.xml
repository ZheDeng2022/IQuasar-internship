      In this study the impact of two CE marked and FDA approved sternal needles in comparison to&#xD;
      intravenous access on the flow-rate of autologous reinfusion of whole blood and the possible&#xD;
      hemolysis of red cells post-transfusion in a population of healthy military officers is&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraosseous (IO) access is an old technique for achieving entrance to the systemic&#xD;
      circulation, which has gained resurgence in the last 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether due to trauma or disease, vascular collapse may delay or preclude even experienced&#xD;
      medical providers from obtaining standard intravenous (IV) access. Access to the vascular&#xD;
      system of the critically ill or injured adult or pediatric patient is essential for&#xD;
      resuscitation, and flow rates close up to what can be obtained by using intravenous access is&#xD;
      preferable in patient needing immediate fluid boluses for shock resuscitation. Intraosseous&#xD;
      access takes advantage of the vascularity of cancellous bone, the spongy bone inside the&#xD;
      hard, and access to the highly vascular intramedullary space of bones provides a direct link&#xD;
      to central circulation. In addition to using long bones, the sternum is used for intraosseous&#xD;
      access and has gained increased use especially in combat casualty care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in a recent publication, the intraosseous route used for transfusion of blood&#xD;
      components is questioned. Based on theoretical models for flow rates through porous media and&#xD;
      personal clinical observations the authors conclude that the maximum flow rates attainable&#xD;
      for transfusion of blood via intraosseous route are inadequate for successful resuscitation.&#xD;
      They also fear that additional pressure needed to obtain adequate flow rate may cause&#xD;
      hemolysis of red blood cells. Further they postulate that as the bone mineral density reaches&#xD;
      a peak occurring in the early 20s, and that a small increase in bone density may cause&#xD;
      exponential decrease in intrinsic permeability, there could be a 10-fold decrease in&#xD;
      permeability in military age causalities compared to the elderly. The critical points&#xD;
      highlighted in this review are in great contrast to recent experience with the use of sternal&#xD;
      and humeral I.O's in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study investigates the impact of two CE marked and FDA approved sternal&#xD;
      needles in comparison to intravenous access on the flow-rate of autologous reinfusion of&#xD;
      whole blood and the possible hemolysis of red cells post-transfusion in a population of&#xD;
      healthy military officers. We also investigate the technical success rate of sternal IO&#xD;
      Access between two CE marked and FDA approved sternal Devices. As a supplementary&#xD;
      investigation we seek to investigate the anatomic changes as shown by Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging in individuals who have received multiple intraosseous sternal needles With&#xD;
      autologous reinfusion of whole blood.&#xD;
