    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of COPD among individuals aged 35 - 59&#xD;
      years based results of spirometry before and after bronchodilator, presence of structural&#xD;
      changes in lungs (emphysema, inflammatory changes and thickening of the walls of the large&#xD;
      and small airways)detected by computer tomography as well as the symptoms of COPD. The study&#xD;
      has three study groups: smokers of conventional cigarettes; those who had quit smoking 1 - 5&#xD;
      years ago, and those who haven't smoked cigarettes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.&#xD;
      An estimated 0.5 million individuals in Kazakhstan may be affected by COPD, and the number of&#xD;
      affected individuals and of deaths from COPD are expected to increase as the population ages.&#xD;
      A better understanding of the epidemiology, causes, and social and other determinants of the&#xD;
      disease is needed in order to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although COPD is traditionally defined by airflow obstruction in a spirometry test,&#xD;
      smoking-associated effects on the lungs related to COPD also include emphysema, gas trapping,&#xD;
      and chronic bronchitis. Symptoms such as productive cough, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance&#xD;
      may be dismissed as normal aging, especially in older former smokers. Information is sparse&#xD;
      about effects of smoking on individuals not diagnosed as having COPD (based on spirometry),&#xD;
      and data from high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning in these individuals are&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is strongly associated with smoking, but not all smokers will develop COPD. Cigarette&#xD;
      smoking continues to be a common addiction in Kazakhstan despite efforts to reduce its&#xD;
      prevalence. The study objectives are to assess true prevalence of COPD based on pulmonary&#xD;
      function assessment and structural changes (emphysema and large and small airway inflammation&#xD;
      with thickening) identified by high-resolution computer tomography (CT-scan) in addition to&#xD;
      standard spirometric criteria and symptoms of dyspnea, exercise limitations, and chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis. Such comprehensive approach will allow for objective comparisons of (1) current&#xD;
      smokers of conventional cigarettes - 500 participants, (2) those subjects who quit smoking&#xD;
      within the past 1 - 5 years - 200 participants, and (3) those subjects who never smoked&#xD;
      cigarettes - 200 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using high resolution CT in addition to spirometry and other types of lung function&#xD;
      assessment will help to determine COPD prevalence among non-smokers, smokers of conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes and those who quit smoking. COPD prevalence will be defined based on abnormal&#xD;
      respiratory function assessed by standard spirometric tests and by using COPD assessment test&#xD;
      (CAT) questionnaire, 6-minute walk test and a high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT)&#xD;
      scan of the chest of those patients with preserved pulmonary functions but with clinical&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-sectional study is retrospective in a sense, as it will allow to collect historical&#xD;
      data on smoking, smoking cessation, address socio-demographic and other differentials of&#xD;
      smoking. The investigators will also address the relationship of liver disease with COPD.&#xD;
      This will be determined based on presence of hepatitis B and C tests (antigens and&#xD;
      antibodies), liver enzyme levels and concentration of alpha-1-antitripsine, which is related&#xD;
      to the development of COPD. Current or former smokers who had a concomitant diagnosis of&#xD;
      asthma will not be excluded in the cross-sectional study. Instead, historical data on whether&#xD;
      the participant had been diagnosed with asthma will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-sectional study has several study groups based on the exposure (smoking behavior)&#xD;
      status. Combinations of paired associations are as follows: smokers vs. never-smokers;&#xD;
      smokers vs. ex-smokers; never-smokers vs. ex-smokers. Therefore, it bears some feature of a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study, specifically; it provides an opportunity to make comparisons&#xD;
      between the groups. While calculating the required sample size, the investigators considered&#xD;
      this opportunity as the most important one. In addition to calculating prevalence ratio of&#xD;
      COPD for exposure statuses, the cross-sectional study will allow for assessment of prevalence&#xD;
      of these conditions and other characteristics in different study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry (FEV / FVC), bronchodilation test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COPD assessment test (CAT) questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scan of the chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking status and history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occupational exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure to indoor biofuel pollution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-reported comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing for: blood cholesterol level, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL&#xD;
           (low-density lipoproteins), triglycerides, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, glucose,&#xD;
           Hepatitis B and C IgM and IgG antigens and antibodies, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and&#xD;
           alpha-1-antitrypsine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit subjects by using the following mechanisms, namely, through&#xD;
      social media, a network of medical referral sites (polyclinics and ambulatory centers), and&#xD;
      from large corporations, i.e. with more than 500 employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about current smoking behavior and very detailed historic information on smoking&#xD;
      behavior will be used to for adjustments during the data analysis phase.&#xD;
