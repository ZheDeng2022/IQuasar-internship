      The investigators propose the Delivery Optimization for Antiretroviral Therapy Study - The DO&#xD;
      ART Study - a prospective randomized study of strategies to optimize community-based ART&#xD;
      initiation, monitoring and resupply among HIV-positive persons in South Africa and Uganda.&#xD;
      The investigators will work closely with community members, stakeholders, local providers,&#xD;
      and the local Department of Health (DoH) to integrate the community-based ART delivery with&#xD;
      HIV clinics, pharmacies and labs. Following community sensitization, participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through community-based HTC and HIV clinics. HIV-positive persons not engaged in&#xD;
      care will receive point-of-care CD4 testing to determine ART eligibility. HIV-positive&#xD;
      persons who are eligible for ART by national guidelines will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      ART delivery arms: (i) Home ART initiation and mobile van ART monitoring and resupply, (ii)&#xD;
      Hybrid model with clinic ART initiation and mobile van ART monitoring and resupply, and (iii)&#xD;
      Clinic ART initiation, monitoring and resupply - the current standard of care (SOC)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has tremendous potential to prevent HIV-associated morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and transmission. With reliable ART supply and monitoring, the life expectancy of&#xD;
      HIV-positive persons in southern Africa is comparable to that of HIV-negative persons.&#xD;
      However, HIV-associated mortality continues to be high among HIV-positive persons not&#xD;
      diagnosed and not engaged in care. Of the 35 million persons worldwide who meet WHO (World&#xD;
      Health Organization) guidelines for ART, only 15 million are on ART. For already burdened&#xD;
      health care systems faced with more than doubling of persons on ART, effective and efficient&#xD;
      ART initiation and monitoring strategies are needed. First line ART regimens are once daily&#xD;
      oral regimens and well-tolerated, which increases the simplicity of ART delivery in general,&#xD;
      including community-based ART delivery a feasible alternative to clinic-based delivery. A&#xD;
      priority for optimization of ART delivery is to directly compare and evaluate the impact and&#xD;
      cost of community-based ART initiation and resupply to clinic delivery of ART in high&#xD;
      prevalence settings in Africa, in order to expand capacity to provide ART coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have extensive experience with community-based strategies for HIV testing&#xD;
      and linkage to care. In a series of studies, the investigators have demonstrated that&#xD;
      community-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) results in &gt;90% knowledge of serostatus and&#xD;
      similarly high linkage rates for HIV-positive persons to HIV care. However, the investigators&#xD;
      observed bottlenecks within HIV clinics that resulted in delays in ART initiation,&#xD;
      particularly for those with higher CD4 counts; only 59% of HIV-positive ART eligible persons&#xD;
      were virally suppressed at 12 months, far below the UNAIDS target of 80%. Those findings&#xD;
      suggest that community-based strategies for ART initiation and maintenance could address&#xD;
      clinic inefficiencies and patient opportunity costs and barriers to optimize ART delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      South Africa and Uganda plan to provide decentralized services, including community health&#xD;
      workers, CHWs, (known as community health extension workers, CHEWs, in Uganda) conducting HTC&#xD;
      and linkage to care and local pharmacy pick-up locations for medication, to meet the&#xD;
      challenge of scaling up ART. The investigators proposed Delivery Optimization for&#xD;
      Antiretroviral Therapy (The DO ART Study). A rigorous evaluation of an innovative,&#xD;
      decentralized ART optimization strategy to safely and cost-effectively deliver ART and&#xD;
      monitor viral suppression among HIV-positive persons in South Africa and Uganda. Using a&#xD;
      prospective individually-randomized design, the investigators will compare home ART&#xD;
      initiation and local mobile van ART resupply to clinic centered care among HIV-positive&#xD;
      persons in South Africa and Uganda. Following community sensitization, participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through community-based HTC and HIV clinics. HIV-positive persons who are eligible&#xD;
      for ART by national guidelines will be randomized to one of three ART delivery arms: (i) Home&#xD;
      ART initiation and mobile van ART monitoring and resupply, (ii) A hybrid model of clinic ART&#xD;
      initiation with mobile van ART monitoring and resupply, and (iii) Clinic ART initiation,&#xD;
      monitoring and resupply - the standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary outcomes are 1) the proportion of HIV-positive persons who initiate ART and&#xD;
      achieve viral suppression and 2) cost per HIV-positive person with suppressed HIV viral load&#xD;
      at 12 months. The secondary outcomes are safety, social harms, acceptability, the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of community-based ART delivery, and understanding qualitatively the&#xD;
      drivers of engagement in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that community-based ART initiation will be acceptable,&#xD;
      efficient and improve outcomes, specifically with prompter ART initiation and a higher&#xD;
      proportion of HIV-positive persons achieving viral suppression, compared to the standard&#xD;
      clinic ART delivery model. Decentralizing HIV care for asymptomatic individuals will expand&#xD;
      the overall capacity of the health system to provide care for HIV-positive persons using the&#xD;
      existing clinical infrastructure.&#xD;
