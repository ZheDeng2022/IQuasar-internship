    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib citrate, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone work&#xD;
      in treating patients with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal&#xD;
      gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone lower the body's immune response and are used&#xD;
      with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving ixazomib citrate,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone may work better in treating patients with POEMS syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Normalization of VEGF after 3 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Toxicity and safety of the combination of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib), lenalidomide, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hematologic response after 3 cycles of therapy. III. Hematologic response rates and/or&#xD;
      VEGF response at 12 months. IV. Overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Improvement of peripheral neuropathy (Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale [ONLS],&#xD;
      Modified Neurological Impairment Score for POEMS [mNIS+7POEMS], and performance score),&#xD;
      ascites/effusions, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after 3 cycles&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Improvement of peripheral neuropathy (ONLS, mNIS+7POEMS, and performance score),&#xD;
      ascites/effusions, DLCO, and positron emission tomography (PET)-scan (if abnormal at&#xD;
      baseline) at 12 months (both groups) and at 24 and 36 months (group 2 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Time to VEGF response, hematologic response, and clinical response. IV. Time to VEGF&#xD;
      progression, hematologic progression, and clinical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Doses delivered will be tabulated to establish tolerance of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe changes in bone biomarkers with treatment of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide PO&#xD;
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo standard of care autologous stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (ASCT) after completing 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO, lenalidomide PO QD, and dexamethasone PO as&#xD;
      in Group I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 36 months.&#xD;
