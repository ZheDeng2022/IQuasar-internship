      Study population : 90 Participants. 60 with T1DM , and 30 healthy controls. T1DM patients&#xD;
      will be recruited by research publication in diabetes mellitus forums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit: informed consent signing. Medical history data, vital signs, physical exam&#xD;
      and neurocognitive testing. Capillary glucose prior to testing &gt; 70 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 - combined simultaneous EEG , continuous glucose monitor system (CGMS) assessment,&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing, and sleep quality assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized for 30 hours in the continuous-EEG unit at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Neurology Department, Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center. Continuous simultaneous EEG and CGMS&#xD;
      monitoring, and two separate sessions of neurocognitive assessments at glucose &gt; 240 mg/dl&#xD;
      and at glucose &lt; 180 mg/dl, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive assessment will be performed after lunch on day 1, and after lunch on day 2.&#xD;
      Day 1, regular insulin dose before lunch, and a cognitive assessment which will be performed&#xD;
      with glucose level &gt; 70 mg/dl and below 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, with no regular insulin dose before lunch and the same cognitive test will be&#xD;
      performed with glucose level &gt; 240 mg/dl During the 30 hours the participants will be&#xD;
      connected to continuous EEG recording, sleep monitoring and CGMS. The study participants and&#xD;
      research team will be blinded to the EEG and CGMS readings while recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be able to convey their daily activities in their room. They will have&#xD;
      their regular diet and regular daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will measure at least 4 blood glucose measurements by prick tests, insulin&#xD;
      management by multiple daily injections or pump therapy and meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants will measure twice daily as required for CGMS calibration. The&#xD;
      participants will stay connected to the CGMS for additional 4 days at their home setting for&#xD;
      complete sleep quality assessment by sleep diary and actigraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first night in hospital is to assess the association between actigraph and EEG and CGMS&#xD;
      variability. The 4 nights at home are for assessment of CGMS, quality of life and actigraph&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (healthy) will perform only one session of neurocognitive studies on day 1,&#xD;
      after lunch with no insulin injection and will be discharged after 24 hours, with the CGMS&#xD;
      and actigraph&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An inter-disciplinary repeated measures case control design study is proposed, whereby novel&#xD;
      methods of brain imaging, brain electrophysiological activity, neuropsychological tests will&#xD;
      be examined in concert with the children's dynamic changes in glucose levels. This will be&#xD;
      compared to healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Participants with T1DM and healthy siblings will be recruited by research&#xD;
      publication in diabetes mellitus forums, and through the Pediatric Endocrinology Association.&#xD;
      It will include mainly participants from the Pediatric Diabetes Mellitus Clinics at Assaf&#xD;
      Harofeh; however, every child who complies with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Families living in areas with high access to medical care. Age: 12-18&#xD;
      years old having diagnosed with T1DM for longer than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions: head injuries, epileptic episodes, psychiatric medications, lack of Hebrew&#xD;
      abilities, disagreement to keep with all study requests, history of more than one episode of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemic event in the past, including loss of consciousness or more than one&#xD;
      episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) . Patients with significant renal or liver function&#xD;
      abnormalities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar exclusion criteria for healthy control population. All parents will sign informed&#xD;
      consent and children will assent, according to Ethics committee regulations, prior to&#xD;
      beginning study sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design includes 3 sessions, which will be performed during a period of 2 -12 weeks,&#xD;
      according to participants' convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data acquired in each session will be analyzed both within groups and among groups in&#xD;
      order to evaluate possible descriptive variables to performance differences among diabetic&#xD;
      patients in addition to the expected differences between healthy and diabetic adolescents,&#xD;
      and the expected difference between T1DM patients with variable glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 - baseline visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing parents' informed consent and participant assent. Medical history intake by the study&#xD;
      physician including physical exam. Data regarding age of diagnosis, DKA at diagnosis, history&#xD;
      of serious hypoglycemic or DKA events, management profile, annual average HbA1c, systems&#xD;
      review, chronic medical diseases, medications will be provided from parents, patients and&#xD;
      summary letters and from clinical care charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination will be performed including blood pressure, pulse, weight, height, BMI,&#xD;
      pubertal stage, injection sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specialized psychological neurocognitive team will perform neurocognitive studies to one of&#xD;
      the parents and participants. Tests will be performed in a clinic setting in order to provide&#xD;
      a baseline cognitive and lingual ability to continue in the next study sessions. Capillary&#xD;
      glucose assessment will be performed prior to testing to ensure glucose &gt; 70 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurocognitive studies will include an extensive battery of cognitive assessments,&#xD;
      including tasks that were specifically designed for the purposes of the current project&#xD;
      [Estimation Time task, Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Emotional Stroop for eating&#xD;
      disorders (EST-ED) and New objects memory task]. Tasks will be performed in part by computer&#xD;
      provided tasks and partly by hand written tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 - combined simultaneous EEG and CGMS assessment visit, and sleep quality&#xD;
      assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized for 30 hours in the continuous-EEG unit at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Neurology Department, Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center, where they will undergo 30 hr. continuous&#xD;
      simultaneous EEG and CGMS monitoring, and two separate sessions of neurocognitive assessments&#xD;
      at glucose &gt; 240 mg/dl and at glucose &lt; 180 mg/dl, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will arrive to the EEG unit after breakfast on day 1. They will be connected to both&#xD;
      systems and accuracy assessment will be performed before lunchtime of day 1. They will remain&#xD;
      in unit, attached to both systems until afternoon on day 2, a total of 30 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive assessment will be performed after lunch on day 1, and after lunch on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, they will receive their regular insulin dose before lunch, and a cognitive&#xD;
      assessment which will be performed with glucose level &gt; 70 mg/dl and below 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, they will not receive their regular insulin dose before lunch, and the same&#xD;
      cognitive test will be performed with glucose level &gt; 240 mg/dl. An episode of food intake&#xD;
      without a bolus of insulin occurs unfortunately very often among adolescents in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurocognitive assessment performed at this session will include working memory,&#xD;
      selective attention and inhibitory control tasks: Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL) ,&#xD;
      selective attention, cognitive flexibility and and inhibitory control (cognitive and&#xD;
      emotional Stroop tasks) , word fluency test , visual memory and executive functions (ROCF) ;&#xD;
      visuospatial short-term working memory ; auditory verbal learning ; Towers of Hanoi, a&#xD;
      computerized task based on Tower of London (TOL). number storage capacity of working memory&#xD;
      as well as tests of executive (WISC-IV) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 30 hours the participants will be connected to continuous EEG recording, sleep&#xD;
      monitoring and CGMS. The study participants and research team will be blinded to the EEG&#xD;
      readings while recorded. The study team and participants will not be blinded to the CGMS&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be able to convey their daily activities in their room, while monitored by&#xD;
      continuous EEG. They will have their regular diet and regular daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will carry on with their regular daily routine of at least 4 blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements by prick tests, insulin management by multiple daily injections or pump therapy&#xD;
      and meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from group 3 will measure glucose by prick test only twice daily as required for&#xD;
      CGMS calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 5 consecutive nights, including the night in hospital, the participants will be&#xD;
      assessed for sleep quality by sleep diary and actigraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first night in hospital is to assess the association between actigraph and EEG and CGMS&#xD;
      variability. The 4 nights at home are for assessment of CGMS, quality of life and actigraph&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3 - brain imaging :&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scans including T1, T2, DTI and vascular MRI. All subjects will undergo anatomic (T1, T2)&#xD;
      scans, DTI scans, and vascular scan. The session length will be of 20 -30 minutes max. The&#xD;
      procedure will be performed with no sedation administration , no contrast material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of measures used in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive and psychosocial questionnaire and tasks based Continuous EEG monitoring This&#xD;
      is a non-invasive method of examination, recording electrical cerebral brain activity&#xD;
      (electroencephalographic reading) for continuous prolonged periods of hours and days, without&#xD;
      causing inconvenience to the subjects. Results are of high resolution and reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be connected to a standard digital acquisition EEG machine (Bio-logic&#xD;
      Systems corp, Electro-Cap International Inc, Illinois) by 19 scalp electrodes applied&#xD;
      according to the 10-20 system and one cardiac electrode for simultaneous electrocardiographic&#xD;
      (ECG) assessment. The EEG acquisition will be performed at sampling rate of 256 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG data from all subjects will be exported to the Matlab environment. Matlab is a&#xD;
      computing language permitting more efficient analysis of data that are computationally&#xD;
      intensive (The Mathworks Inc, MA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral analysis of the EEG signal will be performed by fast Fourier Transform (FFT - using&#xD;
      MATLAB function) for each patient on 2 seconds epochs of recording, taken at 5 minutes&#xD;
      intervals (to fit the frequency of CGMS measurements), with a resolution of 0.5 Hz. The&#xD;
      frequency bands will be divided to delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz),&#xD;
      beta (13.5-29.5 Hz), low gamma (30-47.5 Hz) and high gamma (52.5-80 Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have 3 electrodes connected to chest to see consecutive ECG&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring by - CGMS The CGMS (Minimed Inc., Sylmar. Calif) is a portable&#xD;
      device allowing continuous measurements of interstitial glucose concentration (IGC) by a&#xD;
      disposable subcutaneous catheter, operated by a cable and monitor system. The system measures&#xD;
      glucose values every 10 seconds and stores an average value every 5 minutes, providing 288&#xD;
      measures per day [26]. The system reports values in the range between 40-400 mg/dl (glucose&#xD;
      values lower than 40 mg/dl are reported as 40 mg/dl and values above 400 mg/dl are reported&#xD;
      as 400 mg/dl). The median correlation of the device to capillary glucose is 0.92, with 75% of&#xD;
      the correlation values above 0.75, 96.3% of the reference values in the range of &gt;216 mg/dl&#xD;
      are accurate. Calibration and verification of IGC will be performed prior to all meals and at&#xD;
      bedtime, according to capillary measured glucose levels by finger taps, using a conventional&#xD;
      glucometer. Data will be downloaded by using CGMS solutions software, transformed to Excel&#xD;
      datasheet, and analyzed by a Pediatric Endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) The PSQI is a well-validated 19-item self-report&#xD;
      measure of sleep quality in adults over the previous month. The PSQI provides a global score&#xD;
      of sleep quality and seven sub scale scores. A total score of ≥ 5 has been recommended as&#xD;
      clinically significant in terms of poor sleep quality. The PSQI has demonstrated good&#xD;
      validity and reliability (Cronbach's α &gt; 0.8). Participants will complete the PSQI during&#xD;
      session 2, during day 1, prior to wearing the actigraph. The questionnaire is attached in&#xD;
      appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy An Actigraph (Micro-mini-Motion logger, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, New&#xD;
      York , USA) is a wrist-watch sized motion detector that has been shown to be highly valid and&#xD;
      reliable for differentiating sleep from wakefulness, as well as recording total sleep time&#xD;
      (r=97 compared to polysomnography). Participants will wear an actigraph for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      nights on their nondominant wrist. Sleep patterns will be estimated using the validated Sadeh&#xD;
      scoring algorithm developed for adolescents. Actigraph sleep measures included: (a) sleep&#xD;
      onset/ bedtime; (b) sleep offset/wake time, (c) time in bed (minutes from sleep onset to&#xD;
      sleep offset), (d) actual sleep time (number of sleep minutes between sleep onset and sleep&#xD;
      offset), (e) sleep efficiency (actual sleep time divided by time in bed, expressed as a&#xD;
      percent), (f) longest sleep period (longest consecutive period scored as sleep without any&#xD;
      identified awakening), (g) median number of nighttime wakings (at least 5 consecutive&#xD;
      minutes), and (h) median length of nighttime waking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Diary During the nights participants will wear the actigraph at home, they will be&#xD;
      asked to rate every day their previous nights' sleep using a very short questionnaire.&#xD;
