      Aim: To describe 1) The use of TNF blockers monotherapy in early arthritis in daily clinical&#xD;
      practice in France 2) To evaluate symptomatic, structural efficacy, and retention rate over 5&#xD;
      years of TNF blockers monotherapy 3) To evaluate predictive factors for TNF blocker response&#xD;
      monotherapy Type of study: Observational cohort study using cross-section and longitudinal&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the project methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: All patients in the ESPOIR cohort (multicentre French cohort study of early&#xD;
           RA).A sub-analysis will be conducted among patients satisfying the ACR-EULAR 2010&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collected: Patient characteristics, Clinical data regarding RA and related&#xD;
           pathologies, Characteristics of treatments received The analysis will be conducted using&#xD;
           data collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Frequency of use of TNF blockers monotherapy: we will calculate the % of patients&#xD;
                initiating TNF blockers monotherapy (Kaplan-Meier method), and we will describe the&#xD;
                type of TNF blocker, the route of administration, the dosage, and the place of the&#xD;
                TNF blockers monotherapy in the treatment strategy during the first 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identification of potential predictive factors for initiation of TNF blockers&#xD;
                monotherapy: a survival curve (Kaplan-Meier) will be performed. The baseline&#xD;
                characteristics of the patients with regard to the initiation of TNF blocker&#xD;
                monotherapy during the first 5 years of the disease will be compared by univariate&#xD;
                analysis and Log-rank test will be performed in all variables. A stepwise&#xD;
                multivariate analysis (Cox analysis) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Therapeutical effect: we will calculate the retention rate over time, and will&#xD;
                compare the changes in different variables in the group of patients who have&#xD;
                received TNF blockers monotherapy matched (using a propensity score) to 1,2 or 3&#xD;
                patients who have received TNF blockers in combination with synthetic DMARDs. We&#xD;
                will assess and compare DAS28 and HAQ at short term (after at least 8 weeks of&#xD;
                treatment) and long term (last available visit) in groups. The structural efficacy&#xD;
                was evaluated by the radiographic progression at last available visit. We will&#xD;
                identically estimate the drug effect depending on the TNF blocker used, by&#xD;
                calculating the retention rate and comparing DAS28 at short term and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Identification of predictive factors for TNF blocker monotherapy response: To&#xD;
                evaluate the impact of baseline demographics and disease conditions on the DAS28&#xD;
                and HAQ response during the first 5 years will be compared by univariate and&#xD;
                multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase knowledge on the use of TNF blocker monotherapy, its efficacy and retention rate,&#xD;
      and on predictive factors for TNF blocker monotherapy response in early RA patients.&#xD;
