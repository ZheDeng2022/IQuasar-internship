    <textblock>
      Double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation&#xD;
      for 12 weeks with BRM4 in HIV-infected participants with inadequate immune reconstitution.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: HIV infected persons have greater levels of inflammation and immune activation&#xD;
      compared to the general population and are at greater risk of developing coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) and other inflammation-associated co-morbidities. Intervention with BRM4&#xD;
      (Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation) in this population with impaired immune&#xD;
      reconstitution may improve inflammation by a variety of mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation with BRM4, is a nutritional supplement&#xD;
      marketed in the US. It is composed of dietary fiber obtained from a denatured hemicellulose&#xD;
      that is obtained by reacting rice bran hemicellulose with multiple carbohydrate hydrolyzing&#xD;
      enzymes from Shiitake mushrooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate if 12 weeks of supplementation with&#xD;
      arabinoxylan rice bran can safely reduce markers of inflammation during ART-suppressed HIV&#xD;
      infection and thus potentially reduce the potential to develop end-organ disease in this&#xD;
      group of at-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: HIV-infected participants (≥18 years of age) who have been on stable ART&#xD;
      for at least 24 weeks prior to study entry, and have impaired immune reconstitution defined&#xD;
      as a CD4+ T-cell count 100-350 cells/mm3 prior to study entry, with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50&#xD;
      copies/mL. In order to assure 24 evaluable subjects, the investigators will enroll 28&#xD;
      subjects total (assuming 15% lost to follow-up rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study arms: At entry participants will be randomized to one of the following&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: BRM4 two 500mg capsules thrice daily p.o. for 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Placebo for Biobran two capsules thrice daily p.o. for 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: Primary - changes in sCD14 levels after 12 weeks of intervention. Secondary&#xD;
      - week 12 changes in other inflammatory markers, microbial translocation, T-cell counts, and&#xD;
      metabolic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Participants will not be followed after study completion, unless follow-up is&#xD;
      necessary for an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: A total sample of 24 evaluable subjects (12 per arm) is needed to detect a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference of 0.07 log10 in sCD14 levels between treatment vs. placebo&#xD;
      arms with 90% power and a 0.05 two-sided type I error rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for analysis: For the primary analysis, changes in sCD14 (and other biomarkers) from&#xD;
      baseline to week 12 will be compared between the treatment arm and the placebo arm by a&#xD;
      two-sided, two-sample t-test.&#xD;
