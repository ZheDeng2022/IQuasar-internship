  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare with a non-inferiority randomised study the&#xD;
      new laryngeal tube (Intubating Laryngeal Tube Single-Disposable - iLTS-D) to the&#xD;
      well-established Intubating Larygeal Mask Airway (ILMA/ Fastrach) for the success rate and&#xD;
      time for intubation under fiberoptic control. Secondary purposes are success rates and times&#xD;
      for ventilation for both devices and finally success rate of gastric tube placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia or for some life-threatening conditions (unconsciousness,&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency), tracheal intubation may be mandatory. Tracheal intubation&#xD;
      consists of inserting a tube inside the trachea through the glottis, therefore allowing&#xD;
      patients' ventilation and airway protection. However, in some cases, intubation can be&#xD;
      difficult with standard method (e.g. direct laryngoscopy) and visualisation of the glottis&#xD;
      may be impossible. In those cases, alternative devices may be successful (e.g.&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopy, fiberscopy). In cases of failure of alternative devices, prioritization to&#xD;
      patients' ventilation is mandatory and supra-glottic devices like laryngeal masks and tubes&#xD;
      are designed to allow an adequate ventilation. These devices are present in all difficult&#xD;
      intubations algorithms and represent a mandatory alternative. For some specific models,&#xD;
      tracheal intubation is possible through some of the supra-glottic devices. It's the case for&#xD;
      the ILMA, which remains, despite the fact being more than 20 years old, the Gold Standard.&#xD;
      Until now, no other supra-glottic device equals the ILMA concerning blind intubation, which&#xD;
      is often necessary in emergency situations or outside the operating room (e.g.&#xD;
      out-of-hospital care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design and 2016 market release of a new laryngeal tube which equally allows intubation&#xD;
      through the device (iLTS-D) and has a gastric access potentially challenges the supremacy of&#xD;
      the ILMA. The first two studies concerning the iLTS-D have shown encouraging results. A first&#xD;
      study made on manikins showed a similar success rate and time for intubation for the ILMA and&#xD;
      iLTS-D, while the insertion of the LTS-D being easier and quicker than the ILMA. A second one&#xD;
      has demonstrated a success intubation through the iLTS-D in 29 patients of 30 without any&#xD;
      difficult intubation criteria with 2 attempts under fiberoptic control. Concerning&#xD;
      ventilation, the iLTS-D doesn't differ of the already well-known LTS-D.&#xD;
