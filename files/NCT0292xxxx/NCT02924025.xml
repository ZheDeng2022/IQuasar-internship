      The aim of the study is to examine if motivational interviewing can have a positive effect on&#xD;
      weight loss over a 6 month period. By losing weight, the investigators assume the patients&#xD;
      will have a positive effect on quality of life, and also that weight loss will help to&#xD;
      regulate the factors that are present with polycystic ovary syndrom (PCOS); such as menstrual&#xD;
      disorders and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed as normal with blood samples and other tests such as scans of&#xD;
      the ovaries and measurement of height and weight at the beginning of the study and after six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there will be a small hair sample taken from the neck at the first consultation&#xD;
      and after 6 months. This is done to measure the stress hormone cortisol in the body over the&#xD;
      duration of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group receive individual motivational interviews by a nurse every 14 days for a&#xD;
      period of six months. After half a year, tests are repeated to see if there are significant&#xD;
      differences between the groups.&#xD;

      Main Hypothesis: Overweight women with PCOS receiving motivational interviewing lose at least&#xD;
      1.5 kg more than the control group during the 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: weight loss leads to positive changes in biochemical parameters, quality of life,&#xD;
      and the stress levels assessed by cortisol levels in hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project began on october 1, 2014 at Odense University Hospital, gynecological and&#xD;
      obstetric department. Women referred to the gynecology outpatient clinic for examination of&#xD;
      PCOS was examined in the gynecological clinic at the appointment. The women who subsequently&#xD;
      are diagnosed with PCOS and have a BMI&gt; 30 kg/m2, who said yes to participation in the trial&#xD;
      was randomized to motivational interviews or normal course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: questionnaires and hair samples in both randomized groups. The investigators&#xD;
      take about 150 strands of hair of 3 cm length twice in the experiment. Attendance for&#xD;
      Biochemistry and objective examinations like the usual procedures for patients with PCOS, ie.&#xD;
      this is performed whether the patient is involved in the trial or not. There will be two&#xD;
      blood counts during the experiment, one at the start and one at 6 months. Blood sampling is&#xD;
      carried out whether the patient is involved in the trial or not. Parameters measured at&#xD;
      baseline and after 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study program as usual (all patients with PCOS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anamneses of menstruation, fertility, use of oral contraceptives, medicine and disease&#xD;
           ect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometry: height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference. Blood&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemistry: fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, Lutropin hormone (LH), folicle&#xD;
           stimulation hormone (FSH), estradiol, free and total testosterone,dehydroepiandrosteron&#xD;
           (DHEAS),sex hormon binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone&#xD;
           (TSH), 17-OH-progesterone, lipid profile, hemoglobin, 25-OH vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gynecological assessment: Ultrasound scanning of the uterus and ovaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires; SF-36, VAS score, major depression score (MDI), the world health&#xD;
           organization WHO-five well-being index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hair sample for the detection of cortisol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical course:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First examination in the clinic: If the patient meets the inclusion criteria an in-depth&#xD;
      information about the trial is given. If the patient wants to participate, the patient is&#xD;
      issued a written statement of consent and is pre booked an appointment with a nurse At the&#xD;
      first visit to the nurse: the consent form is signed, if wish for participation in the study&#xD;
      is maintained the patient is randomized. The patient fill out questionnaires and a hair&#xD;
      sample is taken. All patients are provided with information on weight loss from the Health&#xD;
      Protection Agency advice about diet and exercise as above. Patients who are randomized to&#xD;
      motivational interviews starts a course of interviews. Participant data is imported into a&#xD;
      spreadsheet for later determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: appointments of interview are scheduled individually, but should be around one&#xD;
      interview every 14 days of about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months, all patients are examined again as mentioned above as part of the usual&#xD;
      control of PCOS.&#xD;
