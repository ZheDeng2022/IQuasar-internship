  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial expansion is to offer patients, who are not enrolled into the Phase I/II&#xD;
      trial, a chance of treatment, to provide the experience in this gene therapy, and to increase&#xD;
      the dose slightly.&#xD;

      AAV2-hAADC will be made by a GMP laboratory. An MRI will be performed to define the brain&#xD;
      structure, and then metal nails will be fixed on the skull and a CT will be performed. The&#xD;
      two images will be confined and the direction and depth of infusion will be determined.&#xD;
      During the surgery, a stereotactic device will be implanted on both sides of the brain on a&#xD;
      bur hole. Each putamen will be injected for two times. If there is no complication from the&#xD;
      surgery, the patients will enter the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, subjects for high dose (2.37x1011 vg) will be enrolled via sequential enrollment&#xD;
      with an observation for 2 months or even longer. Only after a subject passing peak&#xD;
      dyskinesia, which is indicated by a reduced drug dose required for alleviation of dyskinesia,&#xD;
      or improved food intake, and being verified by Safety Committee, treatment for the next&#xD;
      patient with high dose can be proceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2, in order to be compared with Phase I/II (n=10), 4 patients will be treated in&#xD;
      Cohort 2 and all of them will use the high dose (2.37x1011 vg). Patients older than 3 (no&#xD;
      more than 2 patients) years of age will be enrolled via sequential enrollment with an&#xD;
      observation for 2 months or longer. Only after a subject passing peak dyskinesia, which is&#xD;
      indicated by a reduced drug dose required for alleviation of dyskinesia, or improved food&#xD;
      intake, which has been verified by the Safety Committee can the treatment at a high dose&#xD;
      begin in the next patient older than 3.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. With a confirmed diagnosis of AADC, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis to show&#xD;
             reduced levels of neurotransmitter metabolites, HVA and 5-HIAA, and higher L-Dopa, or&#xD;
