  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals are to change the paradigm for development of mechanism targeted&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in neurodevelopmental disorders and provide a definitive test of the mGluR&#xD;
      theory in humans by determining whether AFQ056, an mGluR5 negative modulator, can enhance&#xD;
      neural plasticity in the form of language learning during an intensive language intervention&#xD;
      in very young children with fragile X syndrome. This trial therefore will use an innovative&#xD;
      but exploratory new trial design to develop a different way to examine efficacy of an agent&#xD;
      with substantial support as a drug targeting CNS plasticity in preclinical models of a&#xD;
      developmental disorder. If the design is successful, this trial can serve as a model for&#xD;
      future trials of mechanistically-targeted treatments operating on neural plasticity in other&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will use a double blind placebo-controlled parallel-group flexible-dose forced&#xD;
      titration design in which 100 subjects with FXS, age 32 months to 6 years of age will enter a&#xD;
      12-month blinded treatment phase during which they are randomized 1:1 to AFQ056 or placebo&#xD;
      followed by an 8-month (open label) extension phase in which all participants will be treated&#xD;
      with active drug. The flexible dose design will mimic practice, take into account&#xD;
      differential responsiveness and the known inter-child variability in drug levels with AFQ056,&#xD;
      and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective.&#xD;

    <measure>Language - Weighted Child Intentional Communication Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted Communication Score is coded from a 15 minute semi-structured examiner/child play session and reflects child initiated communication that involves the child's use of gestures, eye contact, vocalizations, and/or words and word combinations to communicate a message to a listener. The Weighted Communication Score coded from a standardized play session has been used in cohorts with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been able to measure change in language skills with age and change in language skills in response to an intervention. Goal is to demonstrate greater improvement in language learning in young children with FXS treated with AFQ056 in combination with an intensive standardized parent-implemented language intervention, relative to those treated with the language intervention and placebo, after 6 months of intervention, as a marker of drug effect on neural plasticity, the core problem in the disorder</description>

    <description>12 month treatment phase during which subjects are randomized to AFQ056. The initial dose of AFQ056 will be 25 mg BID. If the subject has no side effects the dose will be titrated (mandatory titration if no side effects) to the next level, 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID and 100 mg BID in order. A flexible dose design will mimic practice, and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective. The dose can be adjusted weekly through week 7. After 7 weeks the dose will be fixed, and at the 2 month visit all subjects will initiate the language intervention, remaining on a stable AFQ056/placebo dose for the next 6 months.</description>

&#xD;
          4. Parent or legal guardian is available and able to communicate well with the&#xD;
             investigator, comply with study requirements and provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Note**The Parent or legal guardian who will be signing consent form, should be the&#xD;
             individual administering the language intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. English is the primary language spoken in the home and the subject's first language is&#xD;
             English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Meet criteria indicating evidence of intentional communication based on parent&#xD;
             interview via a communication eligibility screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Note** On the Eligibility Screening Tool - Communication, the child must have at&#xD;
             time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Section 1: Answer of YES; the child uses at least 5 spoken words to label items&#xD;
                  on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Section 2: At least 3 YES answers to items 1-10 if child does not have at least 5&#xD;
                  spoken words.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Produces 3 or more intentional acts of communication on the structured portion of the&#xD;
             Weighted Communication play sample at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Note: subjects are permitted to use augmentative communication devices throughout&#xD;
             the study if the device is the subject's primary form of communication and the device&#xD;
             has been prescribed for the subject by an SLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Stable behavioral and other therapy regimen for 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Note: Patients will be allowed to continue their standard of care therapies&#xD;
             throughout the trial but these will not be changed during the placebo lead in or&#xD;
             placebo controlled portion of the trial, outside of the standard changes occurring&#xD;
             from school schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Stable dosing of all concurrent psychotropic medications except stimulants for at&#xD;
             least 60 days prior to screening. Due to the very short half-life of stimulants&#xD;
             (specifically methylphenidate and amphetamine variants), a stable regimen of these&#xD;
             medications is required for 2 weeks only.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note** Medications impacting GABA, glutamate and/or mGluR5 pathway receptors are&#xD;
                  exclusionary and not permitted during study participation. Additionally,&#xD;
                  stimulant regimens may include combinations of short- and long-acting forms and&#xD;
                  may be taken with different timing or dosing on different days of the week (e.g.&#xD;
                  Doses may be skipped on weekends or days off school and extra doses may be given&#xD;
                  some days for therapy sessions later in the day). The intent is to keep the doses&#xD;
                  and regimen being used at the time of screening consistent during the trial even&#xD;
                  if there is some variation in how the medication is taken on different days.Use&#xD;
                  of CBD oil or hemp based substances legal for sale over the internet are allowed&#xD;
                  provided that the dosing regimen has been consistent for at least 60 days prior&#xD;
                  to screening and will remain the same throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of medications impacting GABA, glutamate and/or mGluR5 pathway receptors or&#xD;
             transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note** Treatment with acamprosate, amantadine, budipine, carbetocin, cycloserine,&#xD;
                  dextromethorphan, felbamate, ketamine, lithium, minocycline, memantine, oxytocin,&#xD;

               -  Note** Lithium taken as a dietary supplement is permitted if the dose is less&#xD;
                  than 5mg/day. A 5mg/day dose is the recommended dietary intake level, and&#xD;
                  therefore is not considered to be therapeutic. Lithium dosage must remain the&#xD;
                  same throughout the duration of the trial and documented in the concomitant&#xD;
                  medication log.&#xD;
