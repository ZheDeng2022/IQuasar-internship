    <textblock>
      This study compares the potential immunogenicity of two filgrastims, the proposed biosimilar&#xD;
      Filgrastim Hospira (US) and the US-approved Neupogen reference product. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      doses of one of the two filgrastims by injection of 5 micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg). Subjects&#xD;
      will receive 5 consecutive daily doses in Period 1 (Days 1-5) and a single dose on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Period 2. Pre-dose and serial post-dose assessments of immunogenicity will be conducted each&#xD;
      of the two study periods. In addition, safety assessments will be conducted throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
