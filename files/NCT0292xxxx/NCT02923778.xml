    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of talimogene laherparepvec and radiation&#xD;
      therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma that can be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays, photons. electrons, or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving talimogene laherparepvec and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the pathologic complete necrosis rate (the number of patients with &gt;= 95%&#xD;
      necrosis divided by the number of evaluable patients) following preoperative treatment with&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with radiation in patients with localized&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma including a pre-planned interim safety analysis to assess post-surgical&#xD;
      wound complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the toxicity of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with radiation&#xD;
      in localized soft tissue sarcomas, during neo-adjuvant treatment and post-surgical resection&#xD;
      wound complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the rate of radiologic response, prior to surgery, and extent of surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate time to surgery, time to progression, time to recurrence, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the clinical outcomes within three distinct histologic subtypes:&#xD;
      liposarcoma (excluding myxoid liposarcoma), leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the percentage of tumor necrosis in treated tumors. III. To assess if the&#xD;
      combination of preoperative talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) with radiation will increase the&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1 in soft tissue sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the impact of preoperative talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) with radiation on&#xD;
      the tumor infiltrating and circulating immune cells in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) or via intralesional injection&#xD;
      at weeks 1, 4, 6 and 8. Beginning 1 week after the start of talimogene laherparepvec,&#xD;
      patients undergo radiation therapy on Monday-Friday of weeks 2-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then every year for up to 5 years.&#xD;
