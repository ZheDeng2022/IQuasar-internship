    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs* prescribed for treatment of&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic&#xD;
      or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved&#xD;
      targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses.&#xD;
      Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable&#xD;
      performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been&#xD;
      performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable&#xD;
      molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will&#xD;
      be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The&#xD;
      choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a&#xD;
      knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The&#xD;
      protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future&#xD;
      genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol&#xD;
      will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free&#xD;
      and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor&#xD;
      characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and&#xD;
      physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options&#xD;
      have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their&#xD;
      patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while&#xD;
      legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label&#xD;
      treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the&#xD;
      research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to&#xD;
      repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment&#xD;
      strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan&#xD;
      diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is&#xD;
      a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on&#xD;
      broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of&#xD;
      available resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Envisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are&#xD;
      treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in&#xD;
      which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor&#xD;
      type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is&#xD;
      an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and&#xD;
      broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based&#xD;
      on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have&#xD;
      exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable&#xD;
      molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help&#xD;
      physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable&#xD;
      insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be&#xD;
      performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the&#xD;
      Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP&#xD;
      and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label,&#xD;
      providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to&#xD;
      targeted therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult (age &gt;18 years) patient with a histologically-proven locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who is no&#xD;
             longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment or for whom no such treatment&#xD;
             is available or indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * For GBM patients: Histologically confirmed recurrent or de novo glioblastoma&#xD;
             (primary), with unequivocal first progression after radiotherapy and&#xD;
             concurrent/adjuvant chemotherapy, at least 3 months after the concomitant part of the&#xD;
             chemo-radiotherapy, and with stable or decreasing dosage of steroids for at least 7&#xD;
             days prior to the baseline MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, specific&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the drug-specific study manual will take&#xD;
             precedence:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l&#xD;

                  with known hepatic metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;

          4. Patients must have objectively evaluable or measurable disease (by physical or&#xD;
             radiographic examination, according to RECIST v1.1 for patients with solid tumors, or&#xD;
             according to IMWG, Lugano, RANO or GCIG criteria, resp., for patients with multiple&#xD;
             myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, glioblastoma or ovarian cancer in case of CA125-based&#xD;
             evaluation (please refer to appendices for further details) [16, 17].&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Results must be available from a tumor genomic or protein expression test. Eligible&#xD;
             tests may include any of the following technologies: fluorescence in situ&#xD;
             hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), comparative genomic&#xD;
             hybridization (CGH), next generation sequencing (NGS) or immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
             The test may have been performed on the primary tumor or a metastatic deposit, in a&#xD;
             diagnostic laboratory or within the context of another CPCT study, and must reveal a&#xD;
             potentially actionable variant as defined in Section 5. The test results (full&#xD;
             pathology or molecular diagnostics report) must be uploaded in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a tumor profile for which single agent treatment with one of the&#xD;
             EMA approved targeted anti-cancer drugs included in this study has potential clinical&#xD;
             benefit based on preclinical data or clinical information (see section 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A new (obtained ≤2 months before inclusion, and without any type of anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy within those ≤2 months ) fresh frozen tumor biopsy specimen for extensive&#xD;
             biomarker testing is mandatory before the start of treatment with a targeted agent&#xD;
             included in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *For GBM patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             The mandatory fresh frozen tumor biopsy sample can be obtained through&#xD;
             standard-of-care surgical procedures (i.e., performed at progression, for&#xD;
             cytoreduction, to proof progressive disease, or to reduce mass effect on the&#xD;
             surrounding brain tissue). Thus, surgical procedures are standard-of-care and not part&#xD;
             of trial participation. Fresh frozen tumor tissue must have been obtained ≤2 months&#xD;
             before inclusion, and without any type of anti-cancer therapy within those ≤2 months.&#xD;
             After surgical procedures, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence. ii. A post-surgery MRI should be&#xD;
             available within 48 hours following surgery, and must show residual and measurable&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed free of drainage&#xD;
             or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at the time of study&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral&#xD;
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing foetus, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and for four months following completion of study therapy. Male patients should avoid&#xD;
             impregnating a female partner. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e.&#xD;
             post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier&#xD;
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ongoing toxicity &gt; grade 2, other than alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or&#xD;
             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for&#xD;
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol&#xD;
             acetate, bisphosphonates). These medications must have been started ≥ 1 week prior to&#xD;
             enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known active progressive brain metastases. Patients with previously&#xD;
             treated brain metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a&#xD;
             seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3&#xD;
             months prior to registration. All patients with previously treated brain metastases&#xD;
             must be stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid&#xD;
             treatment prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Additional exclusion criteria specific for glioblastoma patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who require anti-convulsant therapy must be taking non-enzyme inducing&#xD;
                  antiepileptic drugs (non-EIAED). EIAED are prohibited. Patients previously on&#xD;
                  EIAED must be switched to non-EIAED at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No radiotherapy within the three months prior to the diagnosis of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No radiotherapy with a dose over 65 Gy, stereotactic radiosurgery or&#xD;
                  brachytherapy unless the recurrence is histologically proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with clinically significant preexisting cardiac conditions, including&#xD;
             uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with stroke (including TIA) or acute myocardial infarction within 3 months&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not&#xD;
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, or&#xD;
             severe psychiatric illness/social situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For each drug included in this protocol, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (based&#xD;
        on the Package Insert or manufacturers recommendations) may also apply. These can be found&#xD;
        in the supplemental information about each agent included in the drug-specific study&#xD;
        manuals. Drug-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will take precedence over the&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above.&#xD;
