  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part open label phase 1 study designed to determine the safety profile, MTD,&#xD;
      PK and tumor and biomarker response after IT or IV administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS, or combined IT followed by IV VSV-IFNβ-NIS, with or without IV avelumab every&#xD;
      two weeks, in patients with refractory advanced/metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three parts: a single ascending dose escalation of IT VSV-IFNβ-NIS&#xD;
      monotherapy, a monotherapy IV regimen selection phase and an expansion phase, designed to&#xD;
      explore the safety and efficacy of the chosen monotherapy regimen alone or in combination&#xD;
      with avelumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Monotherapy will also be&#xD;
      explored in patients with pheochromocytoma and NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are required to have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, and in the&#xD;
      IT-containing arms this lesion should be amenable for a one-time IT injection of&#xD;
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS. At least one patient per IT cohort is required to have at least 2 measurable&#xD;
      lesions per RECIST 1.1, one for a one-time IT injection of VSV-IFNβ-NIS and one to be used as&#xD;
      a control. Priority enrollment in the IT-containing arms will be granted to patients with 2&#xD;
      measurable lesions per RECIST 1.1. At least one patient per dose level should have metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. In order to fulfil these requirements, at least 3 or 4 patients will be&#xD;
      required per escalation dose cohort. Other tumor types of particular interest based on prior&#xD;
      experience with VSV or oncolytic viruses include malignant melanoma and endometrial cancer.&#xD;
      When more than one cohort is open simultaneously, slot assignment will be determined by the&#xD;
      sponsor in consultation with the PIs.&#xD;
