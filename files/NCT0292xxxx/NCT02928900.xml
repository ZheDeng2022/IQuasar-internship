    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing&#xD;
      standardized patient actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health care&#xD;
      workers who serve HIV-infected adolescents and youth in Kenya, resulting in increased&#xD;
      engagement in HIV care. The effect of the intervention on retention in care will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial at 24 HIV care and treatment facilities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and youth have the highest HIV incidence rates compared to any other age strata.&#xD;
      Inadequate provision of accessible and acceptable HIV testing, counseling, and treatment&#xD;
      services has been cited as a barrier to uptake of and retention in HIV care in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;SPEED&quot; study aims to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing&#xD;
      Standardized Patient (SP) actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health&#xD;
      care workers (HCWs) who work with adolescents and youth (ages 10-24), resulting in increased&#xD;
      engagement in HIV care in Kenya. This intervention includes a series of role plays between&#xD;
      HCW participants and professional Kenyan actors, followed by feedback and debriefing&#xD;
      sessions. The hypothesis is that SP encounters will increase HCW confidence and capacity to&#xD;
      facilitate HIV status disclosure and provide supportive interactions with HIV-infected youth,&#xD;
      which will in turn increase uptake and improve retention in HIV services among adolescents&#xD;
      and youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot phase (Aim 1) will consist of developing patient case scripts specific to&#xD;
      adolescent HIV-related care and counseling needs and establishing HCW competency scores. To&#xD;
      evaluate the intervention, a cluster randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in 24 HIV care and treatment facilities to assess the impact of SP encounters on&#xD;
      the proportion of adolescents and youth patients retained in care at HIV treatment facilities&#xD;
      in Kenya (Aim 2). Finally, the cost effectiveness and cost utility of the SP intervention&#xD;
      will be determined (Aim 3). The estimated study duration is five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes from Aim 1 are final scripts and pass/fail scores for use in SP&#xD;
      encounters. The primary outcome for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Aim 2) is&#xD;
      retention in care among HIV-positive adolescents and youth, based on electronic medical&#xD;
      records data. Secondary outcomes will include satisfaction (patients and HCWs), HCW&#xD;
      competency in youth- friendly counseling, antiretroviral therapy adherence, and viral&#xD;
      suppression. For the cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses (Aim 3), the cost per&#xD;
      additional HIV-infected adolescent/youth retained in care and the cost per additional life&#xD;
      year saved and disability-adjusted life averted will be estimated.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is change in retention in HIV care between the intervention and control periods, where retention is defined as return for first follow-up visit within 3 months among newly enrolled adolescent clients OR follow-up visit after 're-engagement visit' (after lost-to-follow-up for &gt;90 days since last visit, with no record of death or transfer).</description>
