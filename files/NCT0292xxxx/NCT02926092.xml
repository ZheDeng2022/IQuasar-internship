             confirmed by genetic testing (mutations will include P23H, T17M, and R135W).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has at least 1 eye that meets all 3 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A measurable EZ area as determined by an evaluation of EZ limits on sdOCT scan,&#xD;
                  with a horizontal EZ width of greater than 3 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. BCVA of greater than or equal to 35 letters as measured by the Early Treatment&#xD;
                  Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS; equivalent to 20/200 on a Snellen chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. A kinetic VF of greater than 10 degrees diameter in the horizontal meridian with&#xD;
                  a spot size of III&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has the ability to comply with the clinical protocol, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation in both eyes to&#xD;
             permit adequate visual assessments in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has agreed to abstain from any protocol-prohibited medication(s) during&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is medically stable in the opinion of the investigator and able to fulfill&#xD;
             the protocol requirements, including the ability to complete the assessments, without&#xD;
             placing an undue burden on the subject/subject's family.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject and/or subject's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) has&#xD;
             voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC)-approved&#xD;
             informed consent and assent form(s), as applicable, after all relevant aspects of the&#xD;
             study have been explained and discussed with the subject and/or the subject's&#xD;
             parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject, subject's parent(s), or legally authorized guardian(s) is able to&#xD;
