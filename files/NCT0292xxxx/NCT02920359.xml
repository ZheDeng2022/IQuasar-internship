  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of the generation of biological samples (in urine) positive to leuprorelin&#xD;
      acetate for doping control by new developed methods, and establish the analytical parameters&#xD;
      that reveal the administration of Leuprorelin acetate in healthy volunteers with these&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male volunteers aged from 18 to 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A health profile devoid of organic or physiological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should&#xD;
             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted&#xD;
             if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are&#xD;
             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not&#xD;
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be&#xD;
             justified in writing specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body mass index (BMI=weigh/height2) will range between 19 and 25 Kg/m2 and weight&#xD;
             between 50 and 100 kg. BMI between 25 and 27 kg/m2 can be included by principal&#xD;
             investigator criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non compliance of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active&#xD;
             substance, similar nonapeptides or any excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergy or adverse reactions to any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects for which the drug involved in the study is counter indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or clinical evidence of gastrointestinal, liver, renal or other disorders&#xD;
             which may lead to suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism&#xD;
             or excretion, or that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History or clinical evidence of alcoholism, drug abuse, or regular use of psychoactive&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have been volunteer in another study with drugs in the last 3 months prior to start&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have taken part in studies with blood donation in the last 2 months prior to start&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the six months prior to start&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A prior history of or presence of significant cardiovascular, neurological,&#xD;
             haematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine,&#xD;
             immunologic or renal disease that, in the investigator's opinion, considering the&#xD;
             current state of the art, they are clinically significant, are life-threatening for&#xD;
             the subjects and could interfere with the product assessment. Especially seizures or a&#xD;
             history of epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions, except for vitamins,&#xD;
             herbal remedies or dietary supplements if, in the investigator's opinion, considering&#xD;
             the current state of the art, they are not clinically significant, are not&#xD;
             life-threatening for the subjects and do not interfere with the product assessment.&#xD;
             The treatment with single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the&#xD;
             week prior to the study sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is&#xD;
             calculated that it has been cleared completely the day of the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day in the last 3 months prior to start this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Taking more than 40 g of alcohol per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Drinking more than 5 cups per day of coffee, tea, coke, stimulants or equivalent, or&#xD;
             drinks containing xanthines, in the 3 months prior to start this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures&#xD;
             requested to be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B, C or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects with anormal values of testosterone or prostate-specific antigen according to&#xD;
             age normal values.&#xD;
