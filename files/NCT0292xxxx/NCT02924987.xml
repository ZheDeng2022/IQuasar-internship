  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter randomized trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intravitreal&#xD;
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents for the treatment of diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema. The results are generally good in the short term, with approximately 75% of&#xD;
      patients maintaining or improving vision after initiation of treatment. Despite this&#xD;
      favorable outcome, the observation of persistent fluid is not infrequent during treatment,&#xD;
      even in patients undergoing monthly treatment sessions. Persistent fluid was observed on&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 70.9% of patients receiving bevacizumab monthly and in&#xD;
      79% of those receiving bevacizumab as needed at the end of the first year in the Comparison&#xD;
      of diabetic macular edema. Treatment Trials. It is possible that resolution of this fluid,&#xD;
      especially when it is centrally located (i.e., foveal), might result in better visual&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug with higher VEGF-binding affinity may help patients with persistent fluid despite&#xD;
      treatment with bevacizumab. Aflibercept is a new intravitreal VEGF antagonist approved on 28&#xD;
      November 2014 by the Health Canada for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the antibody-based VEGF binding strategy used by bevacizumab, aflibercept&#xD;
      incorporates the second binding domain of the VEGFR-1 receptor and the third domain of the&#xD;
      VEGFR-2 receptor. By fusing these extracellular protein sequences to the Fc segment of a&#xD;
      human IgG backbone, developers have created a chimeric protein with a very high VEGF binding&#xD;
      affinity. Aflibercept binds all isomers of the VEGF-A family like bevacizumab, but it also&#xD;
      binds VEGF-B and placental growth factors 1 and 2,1,2 which have been both implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and of age-related macular degeneration. In addition,&#xD;
      because of the increased trough binding activity and the stronger binding affinity,&#xD;
      aflibercept should be efficacious in neutralizing VEGF more effectively and for longer&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;

      In this study patients recruitment, clinical care and follow-up will be conducted by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Flavio Rezende: Principal-Investigator and Dr Radwan Ajlan: Co-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Purpose: To evaluate the visual acuity outcomes and macular changes at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
           of intravitreal aflibercept (2.0 mg) in eyes with persistent center involved diabetic&#xD;
           macular edema despite intravitreal bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overall Goal of Study: The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of aflibercept&#xD;
           on macular edema in patients with diabetic macular edema resistant to bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific objectives: To evaluate the visual acuity outcomes and macular changes after 6&#xD;
           and 12 months of intravitreal aflibercept (2.0 mg) in eyes with persistent foveal fluid&#xD;
           secondary to diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold standard therapy with&#xD;
           intravitreal bevacizumab. More specifically, to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in central subfield thickness (CST) from baseline, 6 month after&#xD;
                switching to aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in CST from baseline, 12 months after switching to aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline, 6 months after&#xD;
                switching to aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in BCVA from baseline, 12 months after switching to aflibercept&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design: Phase 4 open label clinical trial. Intravitreal injection of 0.05 mL (2mg)&#xD;
           of aflibercept will be injected. The intravitreal between the first 5 treatments&#xD;
           sessions is 4 weeks, and the intravitreal for the following treatment sessions up to&#xD;
           week 52 is 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects: 40 patients seen in the retinal clinic of the Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont&#xD;
           with foveal fluid secondary to diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold&#xD;
           standard therapy with intravitreal bevacizumab will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eyes to be included in the series must have had at least six consecutive monthly&#xD;
             intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and&#xD;
             presented tomographic signals suggestive of foveal fluid on spectral-domain optical&#xD;
             coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 4 weeks after the last treatment session. The interval&#xD;
             between each of the last 3 consecutive bevacizumab treatments and the interval between&#xD;
             the last bevacizumab and the SD-OCT imaging not exceeding 37 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent foveal fluid is defined as the observation of hypo-reflective spaces on OCT&#xD;
             at the fovea (fovea centralis), which measures approximately 1.5 mm (1500 μm) or one&#xD;
             disc diameter in size centered at the macular umbo. Tomographic changes will be&#xD;
             measured by SD-OCT using the macular thickness maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCVA must be better than 20/800. Only 1 eye from each patient will be included in the&#xD;
             study. If both eyes are affected, the better seeing eye will be included, since no&#xD;
             previous meaningful difference was found in patients with 20/40 or better when treated&#xD;
             with bevacizumab or aflibercept.3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular media opacity that might interfere with visual acuity, assessment of&#xD;
             toxicity, or photographic fundus documentation of the macular area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known coagulation abnormalities, stroke, or recurrent use of anticoagulative&#xD;
             medication other than aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, or planning for pregnancy during the study time frame or the following 3&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients actively undergoing other ocular treatment options such as topical&#xD;
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, topical steroids, or intravitreal&#xD;
             steroids injections will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
