    <textblock>
      Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), also known as restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common&#xD;
      neurological sensorimotor disorder that typically impairs sleep and quality of life, likely&#xD;
      consequent to a central dopaminergic dysfunction associated to brain iron deficiency.&#xD;
      Periodic limb movements (PLMS) in sleep are present in 80% of patients with WED. PLMS are&#xD;
      often associated with micro-arousals that contribute to sleep fragmentation and repeated&#xD;
      increases of blood pressure and heart rate throughout the night, thus representing an&#xD;
      increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willis-Ekbom disease affects people with higher cardiovascular risk factors, such as advanced&#xD;
      age, obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. However, previous observational,&#xD;
      cross-sectional or longitudinal population-based studies on the association between RLS and&#xD;
      CVD and hypertension showed controversial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the pathophysiology of RLS is yet to be elucidated and is likely multifactorial, one&#xD;
      theory involves a reduction in dopaminergic outflow to the preganglionic sympathetic neurons&#xD;
      in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Dopamine inhibits preganglionic sympathetic neurons,&#xD;
      therefore a reduction in dopamine may in turn increase sympathetic outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this notion, the investigators hypothesize an increase of sympathetic autonomic&#xD;
      activity in Willis-Ekbom disease responsible for the recurrent increase in blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate during sleep, which may play a role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the autonomic nervous activity in patients with WED&#xD;
      compared to healthy volunteers controls. The investigators will measure primarily the cardiac&#xD;
      sympathetic activity by the 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy and&#xD;
      secondarily the sympathetic nerve activity by the plasmatic pro inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
      urinary catecholamine levels and the circadian variation of blood pressure and heart rate as&#xD;
      assessed by the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.&#xD;
