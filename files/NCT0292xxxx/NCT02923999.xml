      Study disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014 it was estimated that 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV and since&#xD;
      the beginning of the epidemic, about 36 million have died of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many research strategies underway to try to reduce the devastating effects of this&#xD;
      disease and to prevent onward transmission, and it is likely that a range of these used&#xD;
      simultaneously will be required to bring the epidemic under control. These include the&#xD;
      development of a vaccine, microbicide, antiviral treatment and agents used in prevention.&#xD;
      Amongst these, a HIV neutralising antibody that is safe when infused intravenously could play&#xD;
      an important role either in post exposure, or when HIV is driving an aggressive disease and&#xD;
      there is a need to lower the viral load abruptly or when mothers present in labour with high&#xD;
      viral loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical advancement of monoclonal antibodies has been hampered by the inability to&#xD;
      manufacture the specific recombinant proteins with a system that would be scalable for the&#xD;
      global market. There is also a valid perception that even if manufacturing was possible, it&#xD;
      would be at a totally unaffordable cost. Thus, neutralising monoclonal antibodies such as&#xD;
      MAbs b12 have only reached efficacy studies in rhesus macaques. In the case of monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies it is generally believed that a cocktail of at least 3 antibodies would be&#xD;
      necessary to avoid viral escape, thereby potentially tripling the cost of a product, as&#xD;
      compared with a conventional single monoclonal antibody therapeutic. It is clear that in&#xD;
      order to progress these promising anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies, new methods of manufacture&#xD;
      need to be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      P2G12 is a human IgG1 class monoclonal antibody (MAb) which has been expressed in tobacco&#xD;
      plants (referred to as &quot;P2G12&quot; to indicate plant origin). The parent molecule (&quot;2G12&quot;) is one&#xD;
      of a handful of MAbs with potent neutralising activity against HIV and has been produced by&#xD;
      CHO cell fermentation (referred to as &quot;C2G12&quot; to indicate CHO-cell origin). A number of&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that passively infused monoclonal antibodies can protect against an&#xD;
      intravenous challenge by the infectious SHIV reagent in rhesus macaques. Furthermore, HIV&#xD;
      neutralising MAbs can affect transmission and subsequent disease course after vaginal&#xD;
      SHIV-challenge in macaques In studies in humans, the MAb C2G12 was safe after repeated&#xD;
      intravenous infusions to asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals . Similarly, another MAb&#xD;
      4E10 was safe after intravenous infusions, alone and in combination with other MAbs including&#xD;
      C2G12, to HIV-1-infected individuals These studies prepared the way for the introduction of&#xD;
      these MAbs for human immunoprophylaxis against HIV infection and indeed new generation&#xD;
      anti-HIV MAbs are currently being advanced in prophylactic and therapeutic children and adult&#xD;
      clinical trials with children and adults With respect to the MAb 2G12, in a number of human&#xD;
      clinical trials, 4 to 16 infusions of C2G12 were given in doses ranging from 0.5g to 1g alone&#xD;
      or in combination with other MAbs. The safety results from these studies were reassuring with&#xD;
      minimal adverse drug reactions observed. Those that were reported were of myalgia and&#xD;
      arthralgia. In a recently conducted study, P2G12 was safe to use when administered&#xD;
      intravaginally at a concentration of 7, 14 and 28mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical toxicity studies of IV use (bolus) of P2G12 were completed on rats at doses of 7&#xD;
      and 35mg/kg (equivalent to 490mg and 2.45g for a 70Kg human respectively). No adverse events&#xD;
      were observed up to 14 days post-administration, no safety concerns were raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase 1, randomised, single blinded dose escalation study in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. There will be three groups of 6 volunteers receiving increasing doses of the MAb.&#xD;
      0.125g dose group , the 0.25g dose group and the 0.5g dose group The volunteers will be&#xD;
      followed up for 3 months post dose when safety and immunogenicity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any study specific procedures, each suitable participant will be given written&#xD;
      information about the planned procedures and schedule. Each volunteer will be provided&#xD;
      sufficient time to consider participation in the study. Any questions about the study will be&#xD;
      answered by trained personnel. If the volunteers are still willing and interested they will&#xD;
      be asked to sign the informed consent form (ICF). Participants will be advised that they are&#xD;
      under no obligation to enter the trial and that they can withdraw at any time during the&#xD;
      trial, without having to give a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed ICF along with a copy of the most recent approved Patient Information&#xD;
      Sheet (PIS) will be given to the study participant. An original signed &amp; dated consent form&#xD;
      will be retained in the medical notes (if available) or trial notes where medical notes are&#xD;
      unavailable and a copy will be placed in the ISF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure informed consent, volunteers will go through the following processes in detail with&#xD;
      a member of the study team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-HIV risk assessment and discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safe sex counselling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That it is unknown whether or not the study vaccine will protect against HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The level of care that will be made available to them should they be found to be HIV&#xD;
           infected at any time during their participation in the study, including the screening&#xD;
           period&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. That they, or their partner should continue to use a reliable form of contraception for&#xD;
           14 days prior to the immunisation period and for 4 months afterwards&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. That they should continue to use condoms with sexual partners whose HIV status is not&#xD;
           known&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Risk assessment and discussion of intravenous infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ICF has been collected, assessments and investigations will be undertaken according to&#xD;
      the visit schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to make a minimum of 8 scheduled outpatient visits over the&#xD;
      course of 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent at the screening visit, demographics, medical history, information&#xD;
      about contraceptive practices and concomitant medication will be collected and safe sex&#xD;
      consultation will take place. Height, weight and temperature will be recorded and full&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed, vital signs and ECG will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected and the following will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb, total WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT and glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serology for HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen), HCV (hepatitis C antibody) and&#xD;
           HIV-1/HIV-2 (4th generation HIV antibody/antigen test) Urinalysis using a dipstick for&#xD;
           protein, ketones, blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites and urine test to exclude&#xD;
           pregnancy will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the assessments taken place prior to administration of the IMP will be considered&#xD;
      as baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood for serum will be collected for immunogenicity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical report will be requested from the volunteer's GP to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as the medical report is received and all required test results are available, this&#xD;
      will be reviewed and eligibility signed off by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then be invited to receive the IMP on a mutually agreeable date&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple randomisation schedule for each dose cohort will be generated using the web service.&#xD;
      Infusion will be administered intravenously using an infusion pump. Participants will be&#xD;
      blind to dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given a study specific 24hrs emergency contact card with out of hours&#xD;
      contact details in case of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P2G12 4mg/ml in sodium Chloride 0.9% w/v represented as sodium chloride 0.9% w/v to be&#xD;
      administered over a total infusion period of 30 minutes. P2G12 infusions are clear solutions,&#xD;
      this will allow single blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusions will be delivered over 30 minutes with continuous monitoring throughout this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure no IMP remains in the line the investigators will flush it with 50ml of sodium&#xD;
      chloride 0.9% w/v upon completion. Volunteers will be observed for 6 hours post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored during the infusion and vital signs will be recorded. Vital&#xD;
      signs will be evaluated using a study specific Early Warning Score system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a medical emergency (e.g. anaphylaxis) infusion will be stopped immediately and&#xD;
      action will be taken in accordance with national guidance from the UK Resuscitation Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a delay of at least 4 hours between volunteer doses and escalation to the&#xD;
      higher dose will not occur until 2 week safety data of the lower dose cohort has been&#xD;
      reviewed by the trial management group. The maximum number of participants receiving IMP&#xD;
      infusion per day will be two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum will be collected for immunogenicity at screening, time 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 6, 24 and&#xD;
      48 hours, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks and weekly for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 0 is defined as start of infusion. Adverse events will be assessed during the enrolment&#xD;
      visit following the infusion and at every visit thereafter. Routine laboratory safety&#xD;
      parameters and urine will be collected at screening, immediately post infusion and during the&#xD;
      follow up period. ECG and vital signs will be monitored throughout the study, Volunteers will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a diary card up to 2 weeks post-injection. Clear instruction will be&#xD;
      provided during the immunisation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional visits and assessments may be required to evaluate an adverse event, and/or&#xD;
      identify a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral to an independent specialist with the appropriate expertise will be arranged if&#xD;
      there is uncertainty about the causal relationship to the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded directly onto the participant's medical notes or where these do not&#xD;
      exist in the participant's trial notes and the CRFs in the most logical order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety information will be collected and reported as per GCP, casualty assessment of all&#xD;
      adverse events in relation to the IMP will also take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.&#xD;
