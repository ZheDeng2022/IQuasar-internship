  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal Vitamin D dosing to obtain adequate serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      (25OHD) is controversial. The optimal dose and dosing interval is unknown, and the tendency&#xD;
      over the last few years is to give higher, less frequent doses. Disease-specific dosing is of&#xD;
      interest, and there may be optimal serum concentration targets based on disease process. The&#xD;
      best evidence so far is for optimal bone health, where most experts agree that 25OHD serum&#xD;
      concentration should be above 30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is mounting evidence that Vitamin D therapy will reduce inflammatory response and&#xD;
      macrophage activation. The optimal dosing needed to decrease the inflammatory response is&#xD;
      unclear, although our recent mouse model has demonstrated that a onetime high dose is&#xD;
      effective. The investigators therefore hypothesize that a one-time high dose of&#xD;
      cholecalciferol will be effective in suppression of macrophage production of tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNFa) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The purpose of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to assess the optimum dosage for the most macrophage suppression.&#xD;

      3.4.1 Study Medication (Vitamin D/Placebo): Patients will be blocked randomized into one of&#xD;
      four groups using a balanced assignment. The target number of patients is 20, with five&#xD;
      patients who have successfully completed all assessments in each group. Groups will be closed&#xD;
      to enrollment once their target is reached. The recruitment will continue until every group&#xD;
      has reached its target. The investigative pharmacy will prepare each dosage according to the&#xD;
      randomization and will hold the key to the dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and investigators will be blinded to those receiving cholecalciferol which comes&#xD;
      in 50,000 I.U. dose capsules and those receiving a placebo. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 4 doses as outlined below. All participants will receive the same number of capsules.&#xD;
      Five participants will be in each group and will be dosed according to the following dosing&#xD;
      schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Dosing Schema&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholecalciferol Dosage Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: 0 Cholecalciferol Capsules 4 Placebo Capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      50,000 I.U.: 1 Cholecalciferol Capsules 3 Placebo Capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      100,000 I.U.: 2 Cholecalciferol Capsules 2 Placebo Capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      200,000 I.U.: 4 Cholecalciferol Capsules 0 Placebo Capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2. Skin Thickness Measurement:All testing sites will be evaluated for redness. Skin&#xD;
      thickness will also be measured using a micrometer before and after UV exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.3. MED/Sunburn Test: This procedure involves exposing eight 6mm areas of skin over&#xD;
      increasing doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR), while the rest of the body is draped.&#xD;
      SSR is delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp, which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from&#xD;
      290-400 nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The minimal erythema dose (MED) will be&#xD;
      determined approximately 24 hours after initial exposure by using a chromameter that records&#xD;
      the values of redness associated with each exposed 1cm area. The overall differences in MED&#xD;
      between the subjects will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.4. UVR Exposure: This procedure involves exposing four 6mm areas of skin over increasing&#xD;
      doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR), while the rest of the body is draped. SSR is&#xD;
      delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp, which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from 290-400&#xD;
      nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The sites to be exposed will be dosed as follows: 1&#xD;
      MED, 2 MED, 3 MED, 3 MED. Two sites will be exposed for this study, one before study&#xD;
      medication dosing and one after study medication dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.5. Blood Draw: samples will be taken by venipuncture to provide samples for analysis of&#xD;
      serum 25OHD and macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum 25OHD and 1,25(OH): Up to 6ml blood will be drawn to measure 25OHD and sent to&#xD;
           Heartland Assays, LLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Banked Serum:Up to 30ml of blood serum will be collected and stored in the Dermatology&#xD;
           research lab and will then be analyzed with the Macrophage Harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macrophage Harvest: One-time collection up to 180ml whole blood will be processed and&#xD;
           purified to isolate peripheral blood macrophages in the Dermatology research lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.6. Punch Biopsy (Tissue Sample): A punch biopsy is the removal of a small (pencil&#xD;
      eraser-sized) circle of skin using a cookie cutter-like instrument. This procedure involves&#xD;
      numbing the designated area of skin with lidocaine and the removal of a circle of skin. Prior&#xD;
      to obtaining the punch biopsy, the skin will be injected with lidocaine, a painkiller similar&#xD;
      to that used by dentists. Although the lidocaine can tingle or hurt briefly during the&#xD;
      numbing process, volunteers should not feel any pain while the punch biopsy is being&#xD;
      obtained. The circle is then closed using one to five fine stitches per site, which prevents&#xD;
      bleeding, speeds healing, and improves the appearance. The stitches are removed 10-14 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.7. Photographs: Photographs of the testing sites will be taken through-out this protocol.&#xD;
      In the event that a photograph is taken of the subject's face or any other identifiable&#xD;
      feature, the subject's identity may become known.&#xD;

           4. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS - MINIMIZED&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1. Study Medication (Vitamin D/Placebo): Vitamin D is well tolerated and often used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. It is freely available as an over the counter supplement. There are few&#xD;
      side effects to oral vitamin D, with the most severe being hypercalcemia with prolonged use&#xD;
      of a high dose. Vitamin D toxicity can occur when the active form is given (1,25&#xD;
      dihydroxyvitamin D) or with prolonged exposure to high dose vitamin D3. Both young and old&#xD;
      adults have taken one time high dose vitamin D3 safely. It is possible that an allergic&#xD;
      reaction could occur to the medication and participants will be asked to report and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Skin Thickness Measurement: there are no known risks to evaluating or measuring the&#xD;
      skin's thickness with a micrometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) and Ultraviolet Light Exposure (UVR): The risks associated&#xD;
      with this procedure are minimal, as only the testing sites will be exposed. The consequences&#xD;
      of being exposed to UV light are short-term, and primarily involve mild redness at the&#xD;
      exposure site followed by minor itching and dryness of the skin several days later. The&#xD;
      degree of the sunburn is typically mild to moderate and the UV dose used is not enough to&#xD;
      cause blistering of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Blood Draw: Risks from a blood draw may include the occurrence of discomfort and/or&#xD;
      bruise at the site of puncture and, less likely, the formation of a small clot, swelling of&#xD;
      the vein, or bleeding from the puncture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. Punch Biopsy (Tissue Sample): Punch biopsies pose minimal risk, and volunteers are&#xD;
      instructed as to the proper care of the biopsy site. Lidocaine may cause a tingling or&#xD;
      burning sensation when injected into the skin. Potential problems localized to the biopsy&#xD;
      site include bleeding or oozing, discomfort, or infection. The biopsy site will heal with a&#xD;
      small, flat scar, which may be red for several months. The scar may also turn lighter or&#xD;
      darker than the surrounding skin after some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6. Photographs: There are no known risks to taking photographs. In the event a photograph&#xD;
      is taken of the subject's face or any other identifying feature, the patient's identity may&#xD;
      be known.&#xD;
