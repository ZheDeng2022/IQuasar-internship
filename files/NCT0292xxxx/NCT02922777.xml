  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with an estimated&#xD;
      incidence of 1.6 million cases resulting in 1.4 million deaths in annually. Non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80-85% of cases, and adenocarcinoma is the most common&#xD;
      histology.2 The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced or metastatic disease that&#xD;
      is not amenable to surgical resection. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has reached a&#xD;
      therapeutic plateau with a median overall survival (OS) of 7.4 to 9.9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein&#xD;
      kinase receptor that is over-expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has been&#xD;
      identified as a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC).&#xD;
