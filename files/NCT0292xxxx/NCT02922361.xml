      This project will use data from a large network-model health maintenance organization that&#xD;
      operates Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (CareMore) and fee-for-service Medicare data to (1)&#xD;
      better understand the characteristics of high-need, high-cost MA enrollees patients and (2)&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a care management program focused on high-need high-cost MA enrollees&#xD;
      with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;

      There will be two aims. Aim 1 will describe and categorize high-need, high-cost populations.&#xD;
      The investigators will use CareMore inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims from years&#xD;
      2010-2014. The investigators will construct mortality and readmission risk category and they&#xD;
      will utilize traditional claims-based risk models developed on out of sample data to&#xD;
      categorize patient risk level. For the high health expenditure category, they will examine&#xD;
      inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data to identify groups of patients who drive&#xD;
      disproportionate health spending. Finally, for utilization the investigators will use claims&#xD;
      and outpatient visit data (to the extent any electronic health record (EHR) data becomes&#xD;
      available) to identify patients with disproportionate visit intensity. The approach to&#xD;
      describe patients within these groups will be to categorize patients into deciles and utilize&#xD;
      multivariate regression models to identify demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, and&#xD;
      geographic characteristics associated with presence in a top decile along each metric. For&#xD;
      example, the investigators will describe individual and clusters of diagnoses that are&#xD;
      associated with high spending. They will also examine patients who meet multiple criteria and&#xD;
      describe associated characteristics. Aim 2 will examine the impact of CareMore's end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD) care model. They will use CareMore inpatient, outpatient, skilled&#xD;
      nursing facilities (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), other facilities,&#xD;
      pharmacy, and post-acute care claims and Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS)&#xD;
      Fee-For-Service (FFS) data from matched geographies. They will also attempt to obtain the&#xD;
      healthcare effectiveness data information set (HEDIS) data from health plan at patient and&#xD;
      physician level, CMS stars measure data, available electronic medical record (EMR) data, and&#xD;
      physician characteristics data to the extent CareMore can provide. They will perform a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of claims data. The investigators will use a primary comparison group&#xD;
      of ESRD patients in Medicare FFS, particularly in localities where no ESRD special need plans&#xD;
      (SNP) is offered to mitigate some effects of selection. The team will also explore a second&#xD;
      comparison group of CareMore traditional MA plan enrollees who develop ESRD. They will first&#xD;
      examine patient, physician, and plan or site characteristics associated with variation in&#xD;
      utilization of the specialized services including enhanced nutritional counseling,&#xD;
      personalized care plans, dialysis treatment evaluation, and supplemental medical evaluations&#xD;
      -- using logistic regression. Second, they will perform a descriptive analysis of the&#xD;
      association between use of these services and cost and quality outcomes.&#xD;
