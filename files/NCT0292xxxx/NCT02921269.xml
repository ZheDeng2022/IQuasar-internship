  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab and bevacizumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with cervical cancer that has come back, remains despite treatment, or has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and bevacizumab, may shrink&#xD;
      tumor cell and interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity (proportion of patients with objective response by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1] criteria) of&#xD;
      atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the duration of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE&#xD;
      v.5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as measured&#xD;
      by objective response, by PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells measured by&#xD;
      semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as measured&#xD;
      by objective response, by intratumoral and peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality and&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocyte proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
