  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of the timing of a moderate-fat meal&#xD;
      on the single dose pharmacokinetics of entinostat and to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of entinostat under fed and fasting conditions in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage food effect (timing of the meal) study. A total of 48 subjects will be&#xD;
      dosed if Stage 2 is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If preliminary results in Stage 1 indicate that the timing of a meal exhibits significant&#xD;
      effect on the bioavailability of entinostat, then Stage 2 will be conducted which will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a meal either before or after dosing of entinostat on entinostat&#xD;
      PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
