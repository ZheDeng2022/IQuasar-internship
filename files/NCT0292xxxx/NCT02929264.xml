        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understands the study procedures and is willing and able to give informed consent for&#xD;
             participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male, right-handed, aged 18 to 55 years of age at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index &gt;18 and ≤30 kg/m2 at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged to be in good health based on medical history, physical examination, vital sign&#xD;
             measurements, and laboratory safety tests (see appendix A for interpretation of&#xD;
             laboratory findings) obtained at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant abnormality of ECG performed on the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is a non-smoker and has not used nicotine or nicotine-containing products for at least&#xD;
             3 months.&#xD;

             trial requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner to be notified of participation in&#xD;
             the trial and to confirm the eligibility of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to tolerate MRI scanning at the first visit. Responds to topical capsaicin by&#xD;
             attaining a pain score of at least 4/10, assessed on the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A current acute pain condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of a chronic pain condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anesthesia during the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of a clinically significant psychiatric disorder (including severe&#xD;
             affective disorder, anxiety disorders, psychotic tendencies and drug-induced&#xD;
             psychoses). Subjects who have had situational depression in the past may be enrolled&#xD;
             at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A first-degree family history of schizophrenia, major affective disorder, or other&#xD;

             at the time of the first visit, or is expected to have potential for mental&#xD;
             incapacitation during the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the&#xD;
             results of the study or pose an additional risk to the participant by virtue of their&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An estimated creatinine clearance of ≤80ml/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation.&#xD;
             An actual creatinine clearance, as measured using a 24-hour urine collection, may be&#xD;
             used in place of, or in conjunction with the Cockcraft-Gault calculation. Subjects&#xD;
             with an actual or calculated creatinine clearance that is in the range of 72-79 mL/min&#xD;
             (i.e., within 10% of 80 mL/min) may be enrolled in the study at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of stroke, chronic seizures, or major neurological disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, hematological, hepatic,&#xD;
             immunological, renal, respiratory, or genitourinary abnormalities or diseases.&#xD;
             Participants with history of uncomplicated kidney stones (defined as spontaneous&#xD;
             passage and no recurrence in the last 5 years) or childhood asthma may be enrolled in&#xD;
             the trial at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of clinically significant neoplastic disease, with the exception of&#xD;
             adequately treated localized or in situ non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (e.g. food, drug, latex&#xD;
             allergy), or has had an anaphylactic reaction or significant intolerability to&#xD;
             prescription or non-prescription drugs (including capsaicin and marijuana or other&#xD;
             cannabis-containing drugs) or food.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had major surgery or have donated or lost 1 unit (approximately&#xD;
             500ml) of blood within 4 weeks prior to the first visit.&#xD;
