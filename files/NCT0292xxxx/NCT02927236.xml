      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More effective treatments for people with cocaine use disorder are needed. Researchers want&#xD;
      to understand the parts of the brain involved in the disorder. Transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) stimulates parts of the brain. A form of TMS called intermittent&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) may help reduce cocaine use. Researchers want to learn how the&#xD;
      brain might change with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if iTBS can reduce cocaine use. Also, to learn how cocaine changes the heart and the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-60 who do or do not have cocaine use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol breath tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot study, 10 participants with cocaine use disorder will have 10 treatment days&#xD;
      over 2 weeks. Half will be inpatient and half will be outpatient. They will have 2 follow-up&#xD;
      visits. Treatment includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  iTBS: A coil is placed on the head. A brief electrical current passes through the coil.&#xD;
           They view cocaine-related images during each session. Sessions are videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the main study, participants will be randomly assigned to have either real or&#xD;
                fake iTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants with cocaine use disorder will join an incentive program to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will have 39 visits over 6 months. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRIs at 5 visits: Participants lie on a table that slides into a cylinder that takes&#xD;
           pictures of the brain. They respond to images while in the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  iTBS at 10 visits (5 days a week for 2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted throughout the study to discuss iTBS treatment and drug use.&#xD;

      Objectives: Illicit drug use affects tens of millions of Americans and costs nearly $200&#xD;
      billion annually in health care costs and lost productivity. Cocaine dependence accounts for&#xD;
      25% of reported lifetime drug dependence though few successfully abstain with treatment. For&#xD;
      efforts toward positive long-term outcomes, it is imperative to identify risk factors of poor&#xD;
      outcomes, specialized treatments, neural mechanisms that change with treatment, and&#xD;
      predictive measures of treatment outcomes. Substance abusers are known to have dysregulation&#xD;
      in cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control, and intrinsic network connectivity.&#xD;
      Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has proven effective at reducing drug craving in&#xD;
      nicotine, alcohol, and cocaine users. Here, intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a&#xD;
      type of NIBS, delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is implemented to&#xD;
      modulate substance abuse related circuit dysregulations and assess the relationship of&#xD;
      iTBS-induced changes in circuitry to ongoing cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Recruitment from the Baltimore, Maryland area will take place for this&#xD;
      protocol. For the Pilot, 20 cocaine dependent (CD) individuals will be recruited. For the&#xD;
      Expanded Feasibility Study, 50 healthy adults (HC) and 100 CD individuals will be recruited.&#xD;
      All of the HC group will receive both active- and sham-iTBS in a within-subject crossover&#xD;
      design. Half of the CD group will receive active-iTBS and half will receive sham-iTBS. The&#xD;
      Expanded Feasibility Study groups will be matched on demographic measures (e.g., age, IQ,&#xD;
      sex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The Pilot is designed to be a tolerability pilot where iTBS parameters are assessed&#xD;
      in CD participants. The first half of the Pilot participants will be inpatient (for initial&#xD;
      close observations) and the second half will be outpatient (closely reflecting the Expanded&#xD;
      Feasibility Study). Throughout the Pilot, clinical measures will be collected and&#xD;
      participants closely monitored. The general outline for the Expanded Feasibility Study is to&#xD;
      characterize the treatment cohort (vs. HC) and assess effectiveness of iTBS over the left&#xD;
      dlPFC in altering task and resting brain activity. The iTBS intervention consists of 30&#xD;
      sessions over a 2-3week (10 treatment days) period as an add-on to a treatment-as-usual,&#xD;
      contingency management. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural measures&#xD;
      of cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control, and intrinsic network connectivity&#xD;
      will be collected to identify differences between CD and HC participants at baseline. In CD&#xD;
      participants, neural measures along with cocaine use will be tracked longitudinally to assess&#xD;
      neuroplastic changes, along with safety monitoring. Contingency management will continue for&#xD;
      13 weeks and a 3-month follow-up will be scheduled. The Expanded Feasibility Study includes&#xD;
      39 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: Two main comparisons are of interest. First, baseline differences in&#xD;
      neural measures between CD and HC participants will be identified. CD participants are&#xD;
      expected to show dysregulations in these functions, relative to HC participants. Second,&#xD;
      neural plasticity related to these functions due to iTBS treatment and reduction in cocaine&#xD;
      use will be measured. The active-iTBS intervention is expected to be effective in reducing&#xD;
      cocaine use, relative to the sham-iTBS intervention. Normalization of circuit dysregulation&#xD;
      is hypothesized to be associated with reduction of cocaine use. Overall, the current protocol&#xD;
      is designed to test whether iTBS to left dlPFC is efficacious in altering brain circuitry&#xD;
      related to chronic cocaine use.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - TOLERABILITY PILOT:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Be able to give valid informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Be 18 - 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Justification: Many neural processes change with age, and these changes&#xD;
                       could introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Screening tool: Self-report. Government-issued forms of identification (e.g.&#xD;
                       driver s license, birth certificate)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       3 .Right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Justification: Differences in hemispheric dominance could confound iTBS&#xD;
                       administration and MRI measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Screening tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Be in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: Many illnesses may alter neural functioning as well as fMRI&#xD;
                  signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tools: Medical Assessment, Medical History and Physical Examination.&#xD;
                  Medical assessments include: Vital Signs, EKG, oral HIV test, height/weight&#xD;
                  measurements, urinalysis, and blood sample. Tests on the blood sample include&#xD;
                  CBC, complete metabolic profile, TSH, ESR, syphilis test, and HIV (if needed to&#xD;
                  confirm a positive salivary test for HIV). The following individual laboratory&#xD;
                  results will independently disqualify individuals: Cholesterol &gt;250 mg/dl,&#xD;
                  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl, WBC &lt; 2400/microliter, LFTs &gt; 3 X upper normal limit, HCG&#xD;
                  positive, Casual serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl, Urine protein &gt; 1+, HIV positive.&#xD;
                  (Serum glucose over 140 mg/dl will be followed up with a fasting serum glucose&#xD;
                  assessment. Those with fasting glucose below 100 mg/dl may be considered for the&#xD;
                  protocol. Others will be rejected and referred for work-up.) Liver function will&#xD;
                  be evaluated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase&#xD;
                  (ALT). A greater than 3 x upper normal limit for AST or ALT will disqualify&#xD;
                  individuals. MAI reserves the right to exclude at less extreme lab values if&#xD;
                  clinical judgment warrants exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Absence of a specific learning disability, ADHD or cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: Participants must be able to perform a cognitively challenging&#xD;
                  task to a high standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale with follow up clinical interview,&#xD;
                  Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), History of placement in&#xD;
                  special education classes for a learning problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for current moderate to severe substance&#xD;
                  (i.e., cocaine) use disorder, without a period of continuous abstinence lasting a&#xD;
                  one-month period over the last year, other than in a controlled environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: cocaine use disorder, in regular users, is the focus of this&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: Potential diagnoses will be evaluated by a counselor using any&#xD;
                  one or more of the following: Drug Use Survey, SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire,&#xD;
                  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I), Addiction Severity&#xD;
                  Index, and Brief Cocaine Cessation Motivation Assessment. The interviewer will&#xD;
                  supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5 substance use disorders. The&#xD;
                  MAI may be consulted in this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - TOLERABILITY PILOT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of any neurological disorder that would increase seizure risk from iTBS such&#xD;
             as stroke, brain lesions, previous neurosurgery, any history of seizure or fainting&#xD;
             episode of unknown cause, or head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness, lasting&#xD;
             over 30 minutes or with sequela lasting longer than one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: Stroke, vascular lesions or head trauma can lower the seizure&#xD;
                  threshold, and are therefore contra-indications for iTBS. Fainting episodes or&#xD;
                  syncope of unknown cause could indicate an undiagnosed condition associated with&#xD;
                  seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: TMS safety Screen, Medical History and clinical MRI/MRA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current DSM-5 moderate-severe substance use disorder on a substance other than&#xD;
             cocaine, nicotine, marijuana, or opiates (provided they are currently stable on&#xD;
             Suboxone) or meeting withdrawal criteria for alcohol or a&#xD;
             sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic, or tolerance criteria in an individual using 3 or more&#xD;
             days/week, regardless of diagnosis. Individuals will be considered stable on&#xD;
&#xD;
             Suboxone if they have been on a stable dose for at least 2-weeks prior to consenting&#xD;
             to 17-DA-N002 and have provided at least 3 urine specimens negative for illicit&#xD;
             opioids over the same 2-week period (10 business days) with at least one test&#xD;
             collected within two business days of the start of the period, one collected within&#xD;
             three business days of the end of the period and one collected at&#xD;
&#xD;
             least two days from either of the other two specimens. Urine results may be gathered&#xD;
             at NIDA as part of screening or be provided by the Suboxone prescriber. Communication&#xD;
             between the Suboxone provider and the MAI (or covering Staff Clinician) will be&#xD;
             ongoing to establish continued illicit opioid abstinence between participant clearance&#xD;
             and consent to 17-DA-N002. Individuals must be receiving their Suboxone as take-home&#xD;
             doses from an external (i.e., non-NIDA-IRP) provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: While use of multiple substances is the norm and some use will be&#xD;
                  allowed, the focus of the current protocol is on cocaine. However, participants&#xD;
                  with tolerance or withdrawal symptoms to alcohol or a&#xD;
                  sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic will be at increased risk of a seizure from iTBS and&#xD;
                  will therefore be excluded. Individuals receiving Suboxone and struggling with&#xD;
                  cocaine use are an ecologically valid population in the greater Baltimore area&#xD;
                  and do not increase risk of seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: Drug Use Survey and SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire or&#xD;
                  M.I.N.I). The interviewer will supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5&#xD;
                  substance use disorders. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated with a&#xD;
                  clinical interview with a counselor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. First-degree family history of any neurological disorder with a potentially hereditary&#xD;
             basis, including migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ustification: Neurological disorders can lower the seizure threshold, and are&#xD;
                  therefore contra-indications for iTBS. First-degree family history of certain&#xD;
                  neurological disorders with a hereditary component increases the risk of the&#xD;
                  participant having an undiagnosed condition that is associated with lowered&#xD;
                  seizure threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: TMS safety screening, Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cardiac pacemakers, neural stimulators, implantable defibrillator, implanted&#xD;
             medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease, with&#xD;
             intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or&#xD;
             electrodes) or any other metal object in the body that precludes iTBS administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: Certain metal in the body is a contra-indication for iTBS&#xD;
                  administration, as this method involves exposure to a relatively strong static&#xD;
                  magnetic field that can move magnetic material not securely bound and rapidly&#xD;
                  alternating magnetic fields that can generate heat and current in metal contained&#xD;
                  in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: Medical History, TMS safety screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: individuals with noise-induced hearing problems may be&#xD;
                  particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by iTBS equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tools: TMS safety screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current use (any use in the past 4 weeks, daily use for more than a week within past 6&#xD;
             months) of any investigational drug or of any medications with psychotropic (e.g.,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines), anti or pro-convulsive action, or anti-coagulants. This will be&#xD;
             determined at the discretion of the MAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: The use of certain medications or drugs can lower seizure&#xD;
                  threshold during use or withdrawal and is therefore contra-indicated for iTBS.&#xD;
                  Such medications may also alter neural functioning independent of the individual&#xD;
                  s drug use or the effects of the iTBS and thus add more variability to our data.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tools: MRI safety screening questionnaire, Medical history, Medical&#xD;
                  Assessments: Urine toxicology analyzes for presence of a broad range of&#xD;
                  prescription and nonprescription drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy population with no&#xD;
                  psychiatric disorders other than substance use disorders. In participants with&#xD;
                  bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania, there is a small chance that iTBS can&#xD;
                  trigger (hypo)manic symptoms. As some degree of depressive symptoms is common in&#xD;
                  cocaine dependence and may result from the drug use, mild unipolar depression&#xD;
                  will not be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire or M.I.N.I. Potential&#xD;
                  diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counselor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             stroke or transient ischemic attack, mitral valve prolapse, or any heart condition&#xD;
             currently under medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justifications: the risk of iTBS for individuals with a heart condition is&#xD;
                  unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: physical assessment (EKG), medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or lactating women or women with reproductive potential who engage in&#xD;
             heterosexual sex that may lead to pregnancy and not using a medically acceptable form&#xD;
             of contraception (such as birth control pills, condoms, or a diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: it is unknown whether iTBS poses a risk to fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests, and clinical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in any NIBS session (excluding the current protocol) less than two weeks&#xD;
             ago. No NIBS exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Justification: in order to avoid possible carry-over effects from previous&#xD;
                  exposure to NIBS prior to participation in the proposed intervention, we will not&#xD;
                  enroll participants who have received any NIBS in the two weeks preceding&#xD;
                  enrollment or treatment with NIBS modality with the last 6 months preceding&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Screening tool: TMS safety screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION - CLINICAL TRIAL (PHASE II):&#xD;
&#xD;
        The same inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used as in the Pilot with the exception&#xD;
        of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. CD participants, and not HC participants, will meet current DSM-5 criteria for current&#xD;
             moderate to severe substance (i.e., cocaine) use disorder and currently seeking&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Justification: cocaine use disorder is the focus of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Screening tool: Drug Use Survey and SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire or M.I.N.I. The&#xD;
             interviewer will supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM- 5 substance use&#xD;
             disorders. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counselor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment seeking CD participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Justification: The population of interest is CD dependent individuals motivated to&#xD;
             reduce or eliminate their cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Screening tools: Addiction Severity Index and Brief Cocaine Cessation Motivation&#xD;
             Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. HC participants will not currently meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate to severe&#xD;
             substance use disorder (excluding nicotine), and in the past, will not meet DSM-5&#xD;
             criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder for cannabis or alcohol in the&#xD;
             past 5 years or ever for other illicit substances. HC will not meet current withdrawal&#xD;
             criteria for alcohol or sedative/hypnotics/anxiolytics, or tolerance criteria in an&#xD;
             individual using 3 or more days/week. Urine toxicology positive for any illicit&#xD;
             substance inconsistent with history given will also be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Justification: The population of interest is a healthy control population with no&#xD;
             substance use disorder. Current use of illicit substances or alcohol could impact on&#xD;
             seizure threshold and is therefore contra-indicated for iTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire (or similar tool for assessment of&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders). The interviewer will supplement SCID with questions to assess&#xD;
             for DSM-5 substance use disorders. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a&#xD;
             counsellor, Drug Use Survey (DUS), Substance Use Disorder Evaluation, Medical&#xD;
             Assessments: urine qualitative drug screen is performed for cocaine, THC, benzo,&#xD;
             morphine/opiates, MDMA, amphetamine /methamphetamine, methadone, buprenorphine, PCP,&#xD;
             and oxycodone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in any NIBS session less than two weeks prior to admission (inclusing&#xD;
             Pilot participants of this protocol who completed fewer than 5 iTBS treatment days but&#xD;
             excluding ongoing participation in the Clinical Trial of the current protocol). No&#xD;
             NIBS exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Justification: in order to avoid possible carry-over effects from previous exposure to&#xD;
             NIBS prior to participation in the proposed intervention, we will not enroll&#xD;
             participants who have received any NIBS in the two weeks preceding enrollment or&#xD;
             treatment with NIBS modality with the last 6 months preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Screening tool: TMS safety screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Cardiac pacemakers, neural stimulators, implantable defibrillator, implanted&#xD;
&#xD;
             medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease, with&#xD;
             intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or&#xD;
             electrodes) or any other metal object in the body that precludes iTBS administration&#xD;
             and MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Justification: Certain metal in the body is a contra-indication for iTBS&#xD;
             administration and MRI scanning, as this method involves exposure to a relatively&#xD;
             strong static magnetic field that can move magnetic material not securely bound and&#xD;
             rapidly alternating magnetic fields that can generate heat and current in metal&#xD;
             contained in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Screening tool: MRI and TMS Safety screening questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - TMS:&#xD;
