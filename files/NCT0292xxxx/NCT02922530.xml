  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research proposal is to develop an adjunct to standard treatments&#xD;
      that 'correct' disrupted neural circuitry in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Directly&#xD;
      treating these core deficits via targeted behavioral training should slow the progression of&#xD;
      PD, assure greater resilience against future decline, and improve the quality of life of many&#xD;
      living with PD. The purpose of this exploratory research study is to determine the benefits,&#xD;
      if any, of the mobile device-based treatment described above in individuals with PD.&#xD;
