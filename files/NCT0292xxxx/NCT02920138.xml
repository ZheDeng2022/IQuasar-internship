      Background: Study was designed to determine the effect of zero (ZEEP) and 5 mmHg positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (5PEEP) on cerebral oximeter levels in morbid obese patients whose&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Second outcome is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      intraabdominal pressure changes on cerebral oxygen values in LSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:18-65 yo, ASA2-3 status, 60 morbid obese patients which planned SLG under general&#xD;
      anesthesia were included.Two patient in Group 5 PEEP were excluded because of the&#xD;
      haemodynamic instability during procedure. Patients were divided into 2 groups which was&#xD;
      ventilated with no PEEP (Group ZEEP)(n=30) and 5 cmH2O PEEP levels (Group5 PEEP)(n=28). All&#xD;
      patients were use right hand dominant. Near infrared spectroscopy probes were applied to both&#xD;
      frontal cerebral area of all patiens and measured rSO2 values. IAP were measured&#xD;
      transvesically in all groups. Datas were recorded as basal, after induction of anesthesia, 5&#xD;
      minute before insufflation(5BI), 5 minute after insufflation(5BA), 15, 30, 45, 60 minute&#xD;
      after induction, 5 minute before desufflation(5BD) and 5 minute after desufflation(5AD) time&#xD;
      periods. Invasive arterial pressures, cerebral oxymeter values, 5 lead electrocardiography,&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation, end tidal carbondioxide, peak inspiratory pressures, intra&#xD;
      abdominal pressure, were recorded time periods in all groups. Arterial blood sample analysed&#xD;
      on 5BI,5AI, 5AD periods.&#xD;

      60 morbidly obese patients which planned sleeve gastrectomy procedures under general&#xD;
      anestesia (ASA 2-3 status) were included in this study. Patients were devided into 2 groups&#xD;
      which was ventilated with no positive end expiratory pressure (Group 5PEEP n=30), and 5 cmH2O&#xD;
      positive and expiratory pressure (Group ZEEP n=30). All the patients were right hand&#xD;
      dominate.Two patient in Group 5 PEEP were excluded because of the haemodynamic instability&#xD;
      during procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Documented coronary or periferally arteryel disease, unregulated diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, history of smoking, symptoms of bowel or urinary bladder obstruction, preoperative&#xD;
      systolic pressure grater than 170 mmHg, diastolic arterial pressure grater than 90mmHg,&#xD;
      pregnancy, anemia (haematocrit levels under %30), and symptoms of increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure, significant stenosis of the carotid arteries. In all anesthetised patients were&#xD;
      monitorised with 3 leads electrocardiography(ECG), pulse oxymetry (sPO2),invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure(IBP), end-tidal carbondioxide (EtCO2),intraabdominal pressure levels (IAP)with&#xD;
      intravesical urinary catheter, peak inspiratuar pressure (PIP), laparoscopic pressure (LP),&#xD;
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation(rSO2) continuously. rSO2 values were measured with near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique by cerebral oximeter (INVOS 4100, Somanetics,&#xD;
      Covidien) measurements recorded as basal values; after induction; before 15 minute of&#xD;
      insufflation; after 15 minute of insufflation; 30, 45, 60 after induction; before 15 minute&#xD;
      of desufflation; after 15 minute of desufflation. Arterial blood samples were collected and&#xD;
      performed before 15 minute of insufflation; after 15 minute of insufflation; after 15 minute&#xD;
      of desufflation. Partial oxygen pressure(PaO2), partial carbondioxide pressure( PaCO2),&#xD;
      peripheric oxygen saturation (SaO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), aside- base status (pH), haematocrit&#xD;
      (Htc) haemoglobin(Hb) levels were recorded and evaluated those three time periods which&#xD;
      explained above. Cerebral oximeter was placed skin of the patients forehead after clean&#xD;
      special skin-prep pad. The skin sensors were applied on the right and left sides of the&#xD;
      forehead. The medial margin of the sensor was at the midline of the forehead and lateral&#xD;
      margin 2 cm above the eyebrows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia a 20 gauge intraarterial cannula was placed in to left radial&#xD;
      artery and recorded 5 minute periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic procedures and measured parameters were administered same ways except of PEEP&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were received midazolam 2mg intravenously (IV) about five minute before&#xD;
      induction. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl( 1-3 mcgr/kg), propofol (2-3mg/kg),&#xD;
      rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg). After intubation anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3 %&#xD;
      volume (to improve MAC 1 levels for sevoflorane). Remifentanyl was given continuously during&#xD;
      surgery at a rate of 0.05-2 mcg/kg/min) (IV). Rocuronium was administered at a rate of 30 min&#xD;
      time intervals during the anesthesia. Sugammadex was administered at the end of the surgery&#xD;
      for reversing the neuromuscular blockage. Tramadol 1mg/kg, 40 mg meperidine and paracetamol&#xD;
      1g were administered for postoperative analgesia after trochars were removed. The&#xD;
      concentration of volatile anesthetic was monitored with GE anesthesia machine. Patients were&#xD;
      ventilated 6 lt/dk gas flow (50% oxygen with 50% air mixture). 6-8 ml/kg tidal volume,&#xD;
      inspiration/ expiration rate 1/2 was maintained. Respiratory rate was 8-12 breaths. EtCO2 was&#xD;
      kept within the range 35-45 mmHg. 5mmHg PEEP was administered in Group 5 PEEP, no PEEP was&#xD;
      administered Group ZEEP. Fluid balance and blood replacement was maintained with %0.09 NaCl&#xD;
      and ringer or colloid(Voluven Fresenius Kabi, Graz, Austria) solution IV. Body temperature&#xD;
      was maintained normothermic by upper body forced air and warming pads. Laparoscopic pressure&#xD;
      was maintained at below 14mmHg throughout the operation. Intraabdominal pressure was measured&#xD;
      in mililitres of mercury through a Foley bladder catheter with 3 stopcocks connected to&#xD;
      infusion set and pressure transducer. IT connected to the electronic monitor of anesthesia&#xD;
      machine. (Datex -Ohmeda S/5 Compact, GE Healthcare, Finland) . After clamping the tube 100 ml&#xD;
      Saline solution was injected in to the bladder. The transducer was replaced and zeroed to the&#xD;
      urinary bladder level whenever the position changes throughout the procedure. Oscillation&#xD;
      test was performed before started the IAP measurements. This measurements was performed into&#xD;
      two position: basal, after induction, before insuflation, after insuflation, before&#xD;
      desuflation, after desuflation values were measured in supine position; 30min, 45 min, 60min&#xD;
      measurements in 30 degree reverse trendelenburg position (head of the bed elevated to 30&#xD;
      degree). Intraabdominal hypertension was defined as an IAP of 12 mmHg or higher, according to&#xD;
      the consensus definations of the World Society for The Abdominal Compartment Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After end of the operation all the anesthetic agents stopped and 4 mg/kg sugammadex was&#xD;
      performed IV.&#xD;
