    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the efficacy of two types of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)&#xD;
      in lower limb motor function recovery in stroke patients. The intervention will be tDCS&#xD;
      (transcraniel direct current stimulation) or rTMS (repetitive transcraniel magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation) plus conventional gait training for 10 days over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When combined with conventional gait training, NIBS could improve the walking ability of&#xD;
           stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NIBS will modulate cortex activity of the brain area representing the lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effects of NIBS might be related to some genetic factors. 45 subjects will be&#xD;
           randomly divided into 3 groups, receiving tDCS plus conventional gait training, or rTMS&#xD;
           plus conventional gait training, or sham tDCS plus conventional gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures include clinical functional assessment, brain activity assessed by TMS&#xD;
      measurement and MRI, genetic factor measurement. All these will be done at pre, immediate&#xD;
      after intervention and 4 weeks after intervention.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory randomized trial on 45 subacute stroke subjects with gait impairment&#xD;
      following a single anterior circulation subcortical stroke 3-6 months prior to recruitment,&#xD;
      with comfortable walking speed of 0.2 to 0.4 m/s (which generally describes those who require&#xD;
      1 person assistance to supervision for ambulation - Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC) 3&#xD;
      (Kollen, et al. 2006). Exclusion criteria include a history of seizures, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
      condition or psychiatric history, neglect, aphasia, or any cognitive or behavioural&#xD;
      impairment causing inability to comply with instructions, cranial surgeries, pacemakers and&#xD;
      other implants which preclude the use of NIBS. Subjects on psychoactive medications (eg.&#xD;
      antiepileptics, antipsychotic and antidepressant medications) will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. The diagnosis for subjects' eligibility to join the study will be determined by&#xD;
      subjects' self-report (to obtain medical history), medical records (to verify subjects'&#xD;
      self-report) as well as assessment by the research staff in the screening session (including&#xD;
      FMA and 10 meter walk test, ). Subjects should have completed inpatient rehabilitation and&#xD;
      should not be undergoing any other interventions targeting lower limb recovery during the&#xD;
      study. Subjects are allowed to continue with outpatient rehabilitation (generally not more&#xD;
      than twice a week) and home exercise program after the active intervention phase of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 subjects with stroke will be recruited and randomized into 3 groups by a randomization&#xD;
      stratification approach with a computer-generated random sequence. Group 1 to receive&#xD;
      facilitatory 2 mA anodal tDCS for 20min to the affected M1 motor cortical representation of&#xD;
      the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) together with conventional post-stroke functional mobility&#xD;
      training; Group 2 to receive 2000 pulses of 10 Hz facilitatory rTMS to the affected motor&#xD;
      cortex with conventional therapy; Group 3 to receive sham stimulation with conventional&#xD;
      therapy. All groups will receive 2 weeks (10 days) of tDCS, rTMS or sham stimulation combined&#xD;
      with daily standardized post-stroke conventional training in functional mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS A research staff supervised by a physician will apply the tDCS to the subject. Direct&#xD;
      current will be transferred by a saline-soaked pair of surface sponge electrode (35cm2) and&#xD;
      delivered by a battery-operated, constant current stimulator with a maximum output of 10mA,&#xD;
      through a non-metallic conductor rubber electrode. Stimulation will be conducted at the&#xD;
      intensity of 2 mA and last for 20 minutes. The anode will be placed over the affected primary&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) of cortical representation of the tibialis anterior muscle (TA), while the&#xD;
      cathode will be used as reference electrode and placed over the forehead of the unaffected&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham stimulation The same stimulation parameters as tDCS treatment will be employed for the&#xD;
      sham stimulation. However, the current will be applied for 30 seconds only, to give subjects&#xD;
      the sensation of the stimulation. This method of sham stimulation has also been validated&#xD;
      (Gandiga et al., 2006). Current intensity will be increased and decreased gradually to&#xD;
      decrease perception rTMS A research staff supervised by a physician will apply the&#xD;
      intervention of rTMS to the subject. For all TMS procedures, patients will be seated&#xD;
      comfortably and instructed to remain as still as they can. The height of the chair will be&#xD;
      adjusted so that both the knees and ankles are flexed at 90 degree and the two feet rest on&#xD;
      the floor. A tight swim cap will be worn by the subject. The vertex will be marked on the&#xD;
      cap. Points that are 1 cm lateral and/or 1cm posterior/anterior are marked on the cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 10 Hz rTMS using Magstim Rapid2, with the double cone coil placed over&#xD;
      the &quot;hot spot&quot; of the affected M1. The stimulation intensity will set as 90% of RMT (or 80%&#xD;
      AMT, if RMT is not available), and a total of 2000 pulses will be delivered for one treatment&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be obtained before, after the 2-week intervention and 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention, and will include 1) clinical measures (FAC, gait analysis, 10 meter walk&#xD;
      test, 6 minute walk test, timed up and go), 2) cortical excitability measures using TMS&#xD;
      (changes in resting motor threshold (RMT), or active motor threshold (AMT) of the affected&#xD;
      and unaffected TA and short-interval cortical inhibition/facilitation (SICI/SICF), measured&#xD;
      according to the technique of Rossini et al. (1994)), 3) MRI measures including diffusion&#xD;
      tensor tractography (DTT), resting state protocols and GABA scan. 4) Genotyping and blood&#xD;
      level of BDNF. 5) Psychological and cognitive assessment including Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (BDI), Fatigue Severity Scale, forward and backward digit span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures (10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, timed up-and-go test, gait&#xD;
      analysis) A research staff supervised by a physical therapist will perform the functional&#xD;
      assessment to the subject at the National University Hospital. The functional assessment&#xD;
      consists of a 10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test and a timed up-and-go test performed in&#xD;
      a randomized order. The tester will not provide any assistance as the patient makes their way&#xD;
      around the track, however, the tester will shadow the patient so as to attend to any problems&#xD;
      should there be a need to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 meter walk test will be performed in a quiet indoor track of 14 meters long. Subject&#xD;
      should walk at his comfortable pace as usual. The test will be repeated 3 times and the&#xD;
      average of the duration to finish the 10 meter walk and total steps will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-minute walking test will be performed in an indoor track marked at 5-metre intervals.&#xD;
      Subject should walk at his comfortable pace as usual. The distance over 6 minutes will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timed up-and-go test will involve the subject getting off a standard armchair from a&#xD;
      seated position, walking 3 meters from the chair, turning back and walking to the chair and&#xD;
      seating back down. Subject should walk at his comfortable pace as usual. The test will be&#xD;
      repeated 3 times and the duration the subject takes to perform the whole task will be&#xD;
      recorded and averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, timed up-and-go test altogether will take around 30&#xD;
      minutes, including set-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait analysis will be performed using the Tekscan walkway system. Subjects will be required&#xD;
      to walk on a mat at their comfort speed and the process might be video-recorded for future&#xD;
      analyzing the quality of subjects' movement (face will not be captured and consent will be&#xD;
      obtained in advance). Gait parameters including step and stride parameters, symmetry scores,&#xD;
      velocity, and cadence temporal will be collected and recorded while the subject is walk along&#xD;
      the walkway. The whole procedure will last up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS A research staff supervised by a physician will apply the TMS measurement of the cortical&#xD;
      excitability and intracortical inhibition/facilitation to the subject. For all TMS&#xD;
      procedures, patients will be seated comfortably and instructed to remain as still as they&#xD;
      can. The height of the chair will be adjusted so that both the knees and ankles are flexed at&#xD;
      90 degree and the two feet rest on the floor. A tight swim cap will be worn by the subject.&#xD;
      The vertex will be marked on the cap. Points that are 1 cm lateral and/or 1cm&#xD;
      posterior/anterior are marked on the cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single pulse TMS-Resting motor threshold (RMT) measurement Singe pulse TMS was delivered&#xD;
      using Magstim Bistim² stimulator via a double cone coil. The double cone coil was oriented to&#xD;
      induce a posterior-anterior current flow in cortex. The coil was placed on the cap with the&#xD;
      intersection of the two embedded coils located over the marked point. The coil position was&#xD;
      maintained manually by an assistant. Surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes are attached&#xD;
      to the TA for EMG recording. The &quot;hot spot&quot; of the motor evoked potential (MEP) from TA is&#xD;
      identified first from one of the marked points for both left and right side. This spot was&#xD;
      marked on the elastic cap and used for all recordings on that side. The lowest intensity&#xD;
      needed to elicit a MEP response of at least 50µV amplitude and that has been elicited in 50%&#xD;
      of 8 successive trials will be recorded as RMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single pulse TMS-Active motor threshold (AMT) The measurement of AMT is similar with RMT&#xD;
      measurement. Except that subject's feet were constrained by flexible weights placed over the&#xD;
      dorsum of each foot to ensure isometric activation. The subject was given real time feedback&#xD;
      of EMG on an oscilloscope to match a target contraction corresponding to 20% maximal&#xD;
      voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) for TA. The lowest intensity needed to elicit a MEP&#xD;
      response of at least 100µV amplitude at the &quot;hot spot&quot; and that has been elicited in 50% of 8&#xD;
      successive trials will be recorded as AMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired-pulse TMS- intracortical inhibition/facilitation measurement A first subthreshold&#xD;
      conditioning stimulus (80% of RMT) will be applied, followed by a second suprathreshold&#xD;
      stimulus (120% of RMT) with a variable interstimulus interval (ISI). The following ISIs - 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 ms will be used. The percentage of change for each ISI before and&#xD;
      after TMS will be calculated from the MEPs and will therefore provide a measure of change in&#xD;
      intracortical facilitation and inhibition. Both single- and paired-pulse paradigms will be&#xD;
      performed on the affected and unaffected hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan (resting MRI, DTI scan [diffusion tensor Imaging], GABA scan) MRI scan will be&#xD;
      performed at CIRC, NUS by the staff of CIRC. Prior to the scan, all subjects will be briefed&#xD;
      of the test procedure and safety aspects. All participants will be scanned on a 3-T GE&#xD;
      scanner using a standard radiofrequency head coil. Head motion was minimized by foam padding&#xD;
      and forehead-restraining straps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological and cognitive assessment A research staff will conduct Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI), Fatigue Severity Scale, forward and backward digit span. Digit Span is&#xD;
      neuropsychological test widely used to assess executive abilities following stroke and is&#xD;
      sensitive to brain damage (Tamez et al., 2011). The Beck's Depression Inventory will be used&#xD;
      to screen for major depression. As tDCS has been investigated for use in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression and cognitive impairment, we added the digit span to control for confounding&#xD;
      effect of cognitive improvement in this study.For subjects who screen positive for major&#xD;
      depression or suicidal ideation, the investigator performing the screening will inform a&#xD;
      physician investigator who will assess and make the necessary referral for psychiatric&#xD;
      assessment and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood BDNF level measurement and Genotyping of BDNF Blood will be taken by a trained research&#xD;
      staff/research nurse and analyzed at Neuroscience Laboratory, located at the Translational&#xD;
      Medicine Centre, Yong Loo Lin School using in-house and commercial assays. 10-20 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be taken each time via venipuncture for three times, at before intervention, after and 4&#xD;
      weeks after intervention, respectively, that is, at the same time point of other outcome&#xD;
      measurement. In total, 30-60 ml of blood will be collected for each subject for the whole&#xD;
      research study. 10ml of blood will be taken from 5 healthy subjects as controls which is&#xD;
      needed by the BDNF analysis protocol. To minimize the laboratory error during the test&#xD;
      procedure, each blood sample will be processed first to extract plasma and plasma will be&#xD;
      stored at -80°C at Tissue Repository, NUH, until all blood samples are collected. All plasma&#xD;
      samples will be analysed together after the last collection of blood from the last subject.&#xD;
      Any blood specimens obtained during the study will be stored and analyzed only for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study for a period not exceeding 5 years and will be destroyed after&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
