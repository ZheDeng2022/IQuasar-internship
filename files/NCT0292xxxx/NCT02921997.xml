      This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted,&#xD;
      prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18&#xD;
      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an&#xD;
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine given with and without&#xD;
      AS03 adjuvant, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v&#xD;
      virus vaccine. The primary objectives are (1) assessing the serum anti-HA&#xD;
      hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without&#xD;
      adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9&#xD;
      vaccine with or without AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v antigen at Day 29 (approximately one&#xD;
      month after the study vaccination with A/H3N2v), and (2) identifying differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29 (following the first study vaccination with&#xD;
      A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03) and on Days 30, 32, and 36 (following the second study&#xD;
      vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03), compared to baseline assessments&#xD;
      performed prior to each study vaccination (Days -7, 1, and 29).&#xD;

      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an&#xD;
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi&#xD;
      Pasteur given with and without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and an&#xD;
      intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine&#xD;
      manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. The primary objectives are (1) assessing the serum anti-HA&#xD;

      treatment arms at post vaccination points, (2) assess the neutralizing antibody responses to&#xD;
      influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after&#xD;

      antigen at Day 29 (approximately one month after the study vaccination with A/H3N2v vaccine),&#xD;
      and (3) identify differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8&#xD;
      following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v vaccine compared to baseline&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for&#xD;
             all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are in good health*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated&#xD;
             based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical&#xD;
             diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days,&#xD;
             that would affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of&#xD;
             study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the&#xD;
             last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or&#xD;
             frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition&#xD;
             in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of&#xD;
             health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons,&#xD;
             as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this&#xD;
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a&#xD;
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional&#xD;
             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not&#xD;
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes&#xD;
             subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no&#xD;
             deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a&#xD;
             medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with&#xD;
             the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled&#xD;
             medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.4 degrees F.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mm Hg, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour.&#xD;

         10. Women of childbearing potential* must use an acceptable contraception method** from 30&#xD;
             days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination.&#xD;

             Essure (R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with&#xD;
             documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and&#xD;
             still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Includes, but is not limited to, non-male sexual relationships abstinence from&#xD;
             sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized&#xD;
             partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving&#xD;

             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess&#xD;
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal&#xD;
