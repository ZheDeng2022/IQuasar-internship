  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of SRX246 on fear and anxiety based on fear-potentiated startle in&#xD;
      humans. Additionally, the effects of the compound on emotion recognition will be explored.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a double-blind, cross-over design in which each subject will receive&#xD;
      placebo and SRX246 for 5-7 days before testing (given in counter-balanced order). The study&#xD;
      will examine the effect of the drug on the potentiation of startle using a well-established&#xD;
      paradigm that involves anticipation of no-shock, predictable shock, and unpredictable shock.&#xD;
      Drug effects on emotion recognition will also be explored.&#xD;
