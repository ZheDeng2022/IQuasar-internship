  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects of paclitaxel and bevacizumab with or&#xD;
      without emactuzumab and how well they work in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube,&#xD;
      or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back after treatment with platinum chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as emactuzumab, block tumor growth in different ways by targeting&#xD;
      certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that&#xD;
      tumors need to grow. Giving emactuzumab with paclitaxel and bevacizumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of administration of paclitaxel, bevacizumab and emactuzumab over 4&#xD;
      weeks. (Part 1) II. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with stable&#xD;
      disease following Part 2A randomized to paclitaxel plus bevacizumab or to paclitaxel,&#xD;
      bevacizumab plus emactuzumab. (Part 2B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of the treatment arms. II. Objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and CA-125&#xD;
      response criteria (&quot;responders&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Objective response rate by RECIST only (&quot;RECIST responders&quot;). IV. Objective response&#xD;
      rate by CA-125 response criteria only (&quot;CA-125 responders&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Biological progression-free interval (PFIbio) by serum CA-125 assessed according to the&#xD;
      Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Overall survival (OS). VII. Safety and tolerability. VIII. To characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab and emactuzumab when administered in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the utility of surrogate biomarkers and the anti-tumor response to therapy with&#xD;
      the combination treatment of bevacizumab and emactuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess tumor alterations by serial non-invasive imaging macrophage-specific imaging,&#xD;
      ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) for cellularity, and DCE (dynamic contrast enhanced) for&#xD;
      vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. Patients with stable&#xD;
      disease are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and bevacizumab as in Arm I. Patients also receive&#xD;
      emactuzumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

             treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment-related complications&#xD;
