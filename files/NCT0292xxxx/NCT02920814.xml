    <textblock>
      The aims of this project are to determine the effectiveness of a time intensive form of&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for Specific Phobia of Vomiting (SPOV). Current research&#xD;
      shows that this brief format can be effective in other specific phobias e.g. insects and&#xD;
      animals. However, to date limited research has been conducted on the effectiveness of time&#xD;
      intensive forms of CBT for SPOV. A single case experimental design will be used to analyse&#xD;
      specific and idiosyncratic outcome measures in 6-8 cases of SPOV, referred to the Centre for&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT) for treatment. Specifically, the project will explore&#xD;
      the effectiveness of CBT delivered in a time-intensive format and imagery rescripting&#xD;
      elements of the treatment. This initial study will provide important information about which&#xD;
      elements of CBT are most effective at reducing targeted symptoms and whether symptom&#xD;
      reduction can be achieved in a shorter number of sessions. It represents a crucial step&#xD;
      before this format of CBT can be more rigorously evaluated and compared to other treatment&#xD;
      approaches by Randomised Controlled Trial.&#xD;

      Design A single case experimental design (ABACADA) will be used. A, B, C etc represents&#xD;
      points of intervention and clinical contact with participants when standardised outcome&#xD;
      measures will be administered by the treating clinician at each session. Phases A1, A2, A3&#xD;
      represent time between contact during which participants will undertake daily monitoring of&#xD;
      idiosyncratic symptoms on Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) e.g. degree of avoidance, degree of&#xD;
      worry, degree of nausea etc, so change between phases across time can be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to differing lengths of baseline phase (initial&#xD;
      clinical assessment to first clinical session) with 4 potential arms (7, 10, 14, or 17 days).&#xD;
      The first three clinical sessions (formulation, imagery rescripting and planning of intensive&#xD;
      days) will take place weekly and last up to 1.5 hours. The two intensive days will last up to&#xD;
      4 hours each and take place shortly after the planning session and within a few days of each&#xD;
      other. Three additional follow up sessions will be offered within 10 days of the intensive&#xD;
      days (2 within one week, and the final session one week after). Follow up data will be&#xD;
      collected by phone or post 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants will be recruited from consecutive referrals to CADAT for treatment&#xD;
      of SPOV. Clients will have a diagnosis of SPOV as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as their main presenting problem. They will be drawn from&#xD;
      the CADAT waiting list, and if necessary from Improving Access to Psychological Therapy&#xD;
      (IAPT) services at Southwark, Lambeth and Lewisham. These cases will be picked up by and&#xD;
      treated at CADAT by qualified clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are expected to be involved in the study for up to 8 weeks for the treatment&#xD;
      phase, and 12 months for follow up data to be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Consultant Psychiatrist for the team at the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and&#xD;
      Trauma will identify potential participants from the waiting list at CADAT who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria to take part in the study. Potential participants will then be asked if&#xD;
      they would like to participate at the initial clinical assessment. They will be provided with&#xD;
      an information sheet and the opportunity to ask questions before making a decision and giving&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size It is estimated that 6-8 cases will be sufficient for a single case experimental&#xD;
      design to demonstrate proof of concept. This is based on previous studies using a similar&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Patients identified from the CADAT waiting list and who meet the study criteria&#xD;
      will be asked at assessment if they would like to participate in the study. Those who are&#xD;
      interested in taking part will be given an information sheet, and the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions before making a decision on their participation. They will then be asked to provide&#xD;
      informed written consent by signing a consent form before continuing with the study&#xD;
      procedure. Clinicians will remind all participants of their right to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time, which will not affect their care or right to treatment as usual. Participants&#xD;
      will then receive the time intensive form of CBT for their SPOV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure therapist adherence to the time intensive format of the treatment, a separate&#xD;
      treatment protocol has been provided as part of Standard Operating Procedures. This protocol&#xD;
      is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment and signing of consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1: Re-baseline &amp; Formulation (including a conversation about early memory of&#xD;
           vomiting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 2: Imagery Rescripting of early memory of vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 3: Planning for Intensive Days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensive Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensive Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 short clinical follow up sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised outcome measures will be collected at baseline, intervention and follow up&#xD;
      phases. Participants will also be asked to collect daily idiosyncratic measures in between&#xD;
      the intervention phases. Participants will be randomly allocated to differing lengths of&#xD;
      baseline to the time of the intervention with 4 potential arms (7 days, 10 days 14 days or 17&#xD;
      days). This will be done using a simple spreadsheet by a Research Assistant at CADAT. The&#xD;
      baseline discussion around the memory of vomiting, imagery re-scripting and treatment&#xD;
      planning will consist of 1-1.5 hour sessions. Time intensive treatment will consist of two&#xD;
      sessions over 2 days (4 hours each). Three additional follow up sessions will be&#xD;
      administered, 2 within 1 week of the intensive days and a third 1 week after the second&#xD;
      follow up session. The same standardised outcome measures will be collected at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months by phone or post.&#xD;

    <measure>Specific Phobia of Vomiting Inventory (SPOVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item self-report measure that focuses on cognitive processes, safety seeking and avoidance behaviours (Veale et al, 2013). The total score ranges from 0 to 56. The scale has a two-factor structure, with one factor of 7 items characterized by avoidance (e.g. &quot;I have been trying to avoid or control any thoughts or images about vomiting&quot;) and a second factor of 7 items comprised of threat monitoring (e.g. &quot;I have been focused on whether I feel ill and could vomit rather than on my surroundings&quot;). Cronbach's α is .91.</description>

    <measure>Emetophobia Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>13-item self-report questionnaire that has good reliability and validity against a behavioural avoidance test (Boschen &amp; Riddel, unpublished observations). The range is 13-65. The EmetQ has 3 factors. Factor 1 had 6 items focused on avoidance of travel, movement, or locations. Factor II was comprised of 3 items, which centred on themes of dangerousness of exposure to vomit stimuli. Factor III consisted of 4 items that focus on avoidance of others who may vomit. Cronbach's α is 0.82.</description>
