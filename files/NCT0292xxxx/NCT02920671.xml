  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are recruiting adults (men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive) with a&#xD;
      confirmed genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Investigators are also recruiting both&#xD;
      obese and normal-weight healthy volunteers (men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive)&#xD;
      without a family history of mitochondrial disease to compare to affected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves non-invasive MRI methods and glucose tests to focus on the relationship&#xD;
      between mitochondrial disease, obesity, and the risk of diabetes. All study visit procedures&#xD;
      will be completed within 2 days, which includes an overnight stay at the Hospital of the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania. There are no study medications or sedations, and participants&#xD;
      will be continually monitored during minimally-invasive procedures (e.g., blood draws).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be able to receive compensation. Furthermore, it may be possible to&#xD;
      provide reimbursement for travel, lodging, and meals for individuals with mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope that this research will contribute to the current knowledge of&#xD;
      mitochondrial disease and that it will improve diagnostic and treatment approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although obesity is a significant public health problem, why obesity leads to diabetes in&#xD;
      some individuals but not others is poorly understood. Mitochondrial impairment, particularly&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle with its high energy requirement, has been implicated in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of obesity-related insulin resistance. In addition, individuals with genetic disorders&#xD;
      affecting mitochondrial function are at increased risk of diabetes. The proposed studies will&#xD;
      investigate the association between skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity&#xD;
      (OXPHOS), which is a dimension of mitochondrial function, and glucose and lipid homeostasis&#xD;
      in (i) individuals with genetic disorders of muscle mitochondrial function as compared to&#xD;
      (ii) non-obese adults and (iii) otherwise healthy obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a single 2-day, 1-night study visit, investigators will use innovative, non-invasive&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging-based methods of estimating skeletal muscle oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation capacity, including post-exercise chemical exchange saturation transfer&#xD;
      (CrCEST) recovery and 31-Phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and muscle&#xD;
      lipid content, including 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 3-point Dixon&#xD;
      techniques, in conjunction with a tracer-enhanced oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT*) to&#xD;
      measure overall insulin sensitivity and the selective effect of insulin on glucose disposal&#xD;
      (Rd). The percentage suppression of endogenous glucose production by the oral glucose load (%&#xD;
      suppression of Ra of endogenous glucose) will also be assessed. Infusion of a glycerol tracer&#xD;
      permits assessment of lipolysis in both the fasting state, and also after the oral glucose&#xD;
      load, such that the percentage suppression of lipolysis by the oral glucose load can also be&#xD;
      calculated (% suppression of Ra of glycerol). In addition, the insulin and c-peptide minimal&#xD;
      models will also be used to model pancreatic Î²-cell responsiveness to the oral glucose load&#xD;
      and hepatic insulin extraction.&#xD;

        week, or vigorous physical activity for 20 minutes 3 days per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For obese participants:&#xD;
