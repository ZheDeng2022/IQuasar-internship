      Radiographic evaluation of the amount of bone height gain and clinical evaluation of the&#xD;
      possibility of developing complications after transcrestal sinus floor elevation using drills&#xD;
      and the conventional osteotome technique.&#xD;

      Short implants (&lt; 10 mm) are one of the options used to overcome low vertical bone height in&#xD;
      the maxilla. However, short implants have faced many challenges as smaller implant surface;&#xD;
      therefore less bone-to-implant contact after osseointegration with force distribution on a&#xD;
      reduced surface after loading. This leads to more crestal bone resorption with more threads&#xD;
      exposure decreasing the long term implant success Another treatment option is placing&#xD;
      implants in specific anatomical areas, such as the pterygoid region or the zygoma .Many&#xD;
      complications are reported as postoperative sinusitis, temporary paresthesia, epistaxis,&#xD;
      facial, periorbital hematoma, orbital penetration and prosthetic difficulties due to the&#xD;
      implants palatal emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical augmentation with bone grafts is another treatment option. However, it has many&#xD;
      drawbacks as the unpredictable graft resorption, low bone to implant contact, higher&#xD;
      possibility of wound dehiscence, as well as compromised implant position leading to&#xD;
      undesirable prosthetic restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the problems of the previously mentioned procedures, elevation of the sinus&#xD;
      membrane techniques were proposed, it can be performed either through a lateral window , or&#xD;
      via a crestal access depending on the remaining bone height (RBH). If the RBH is around 6-9&#xD;
      mm, the crestal approach is indicated. If the RBH is less than 5 mm, a lateral approach&#xD;
      should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the crestal approach, it could be performed by the conventional osteotome technique.&#xD;
      However, it is a visually restrictive technique which may lead to sinus perforation as well&#xD;
      as it can cause some complications as headache and paroxysmal positional vertigo (Saker e&#xD;
      Ogle, 2005; Pe√±arrocha-Diago et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the disadvantages of the conventional osteotome technique, various kits have been&#xD;
      developed for transcrestal sinus floor elevations using specially designed drills.&#xD;
