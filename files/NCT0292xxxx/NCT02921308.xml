      Health Issue: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common&#xD;
      complication of being born premature. Damage to the still developing lung stops the normal&#xD;
      formation of the alveoli. Young adults with a history of BPD have lower lung function, early&#xD;
      heart disease, and increased risk of death, compared to those without BPD. Recently, it has&#xD;
      been reported that they may also develop a type of lung disease typically seen in older&#xD;
      adults with a longstanding history of smoking. The severity of lung disease is usually&#xD;
      measured using pulmonary function tests (PFT), but these tests may be normal, even in the&#xD;
      presence of important changes in the fine structure of the lung. Such structural changes may&#xD;
      be early markers of future lung disease and can be detected using lung magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). Unlike other ways of imaging the lungs, MRI does not expose people to harmful&#xD;
      X-rays. To date, no studies have been done to examine the fine structure of the lung of&#xD;
      school-aged children who had a history of BPD, to determine whether there are signs of lung&#xD;
      disease that might not otherwise be obvious. This is important because once armed with this&#xD;
      information, preventive measures can be taken to avoid worsening of lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: 1) In 7-9 year-old children born extremely premature, lung MRI will be compared&#xD;
      between those with and without BPD. The Investigators expect to observe more severe&#xD;
      structural lung abnormalities in children with BPD, compared to those without BPD; 2) The&#xD;
      Investigators will test to see if children with more severe MRI abnormalities also have worse&#xD;
      lung function, and/or more symptoms of breathing problems. The Investigators expect to&#xD;
      observe more PFT abnormalities in children with BPD than in those without and that these will&#xD;
      match up with lung fine structure abnormalities identified on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will work be undertaken? Children 7-9 years old who were born extremely prematurely will&#xD;
      be recruited to participate in this study. Participants will be identified from Neonatal&#xD;
      Follow-up clinics they attended. The Investigators will enroll 20 children with BPD and 20&#xD;
      without BPD. Participants will have lung MR images taken, during which they need to lie still&#xD;
      for a few minutes. PFT will also be performed, during which they will blow into a machine.&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires about breathing problems, their living&#xD;
      conditions (environment) and any doctor visits or hospital stays. Medical charts will be&#xD;
      reviewed for information about their birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique/Innovative Aspects: This will be the first study using MRI as an innovative way to&#xD;
      visualize and measure fine structure of the lung in children born prematurely with and&#xD;
      without BPD. These findings may be early markers of lung disease, which would identify&#xD;
      children who have, or are at risk of developing lung disease later in life, for whom the&#xD;
      Investigators may be able to offer treatments now and/or prevent worsening of lung disease.&#xD;

      Knowledge to Date: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common pulmonary complication&#xD;
      of prematurity, occurs in 41% of infants born before 28 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined as a need for oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age,2 BPD results in longterm&#xD;
      morbidity in children and adults, including reduced lung function, early cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and premature death The reported severity of such impairments varies, as studies have&#xD;
      been conducted on small numbers of children with differing degrees of prematurity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is unclear what markers are most sensitive to predict long-term respiratory&#xD;
      compromise. While functional measures have been studied, micro-structural differences, that&#xD;
      may be quantified using pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have not been evaluated&#xD;
      in this population, and may provide earlier quantitative markers of future respiratory&#xD;
      disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent advances in the&#xD;
      clinical care of preterm infants have permitted survival of ever more premature infants, in&#xD;
      whom alveolar development is incomplete, representing a new, relatively unstudied and growing&#xD;
      cohort with a new form of BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This BPD is associated with arrested alveolar growth and development, with reduction in&#xD;
      alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume. Yet, little is known about the&#xD;
      trajectory of associated lung changes through childhood. Traditional measures of pulmonary&#xD;
      function are lower in school aged children with history of BPD than in those preterm-born&#xD;
      without BPD, but they may still be within normal reference ranges. There is, however,&#xD;
      evidence that pulmonary function declines more steeply between age 8-18 years in those with&#xD;
      BPD and that lower infant lung function predicts lower adult lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is particularly concerning since there is increasing recognition that preterm born&#xD;
      adults have a significant burden of early lung disease. Emphysema has been reported in young&#xD;
      adults with a history of prematurity less extreme than the prematurity seen today. X-ray&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) imaging detects pulmonary abnormalities in 98%, with emphysema in&#xD;
      47% of this less premature cohort as young adults. Not all of those with CT abnormalities,&#xD;
      however, have impaired pulmonary function tests (PFTs), thus highlighting the limitations of&#xD;
      conventional PFTs to detect disease. In childhood, PFTs, while very powerful indicators of&#xD;
      global lung health, may be relatively insensitive to detect early pulmonary structural&#xD;
      changes and regional lung abnormalities. Pulmonary dysfunction may not cause symptoms at rest&#xD;
      or correlate with PFTs in childhood, but may become apparent with exercise, infection, or&#xD;
      aging. Structural changes in the lung parenchyma may already be present in childhood and may&#xD;
      be earlier markers of current and future respiratory disease than conventional PFT. Such&#xD;
      changes may be detected with pulmonary MRI of the lung, as has been shown in COPD and in&#xD;
      pilot work in BPD MRI has significant advantages over CT, including lack of exposure to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation and high resolution of fine tissue structure. Recent advances in pulmonary&#xD;
      MRI, including ultra-short echo time pulse sequences, generate pulmonary images with enhanced&#xD;
      parenchymal signal intensity which rival CT images for visualization of lung parenchyma and&#xD;
      vasculature. MRI is emerging as a research tool and may ultimately replace CT for pediatric&#xD;
      thoracic imaging tasks and serial evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the Investigators knowledge, conventional and ultra-short echo time 1H MRI studies of&#xD;
      children with histories of prematurity and BPD have not been performed to quantify&#xD;
      microstructural pulmonary abnormalities. The Investigators therefore propose a study to&#xD;
      compare pulmonary micro-structural (MRI) and functional (PFT) abnormalities in premature&#xD;
      children with and without history of BPD. The investigators hypothesize that pulmonary tissue&#xD;
      destruction and/or emphysematous changes will be evident on MRI and will be worse in&#xD;
      ex-premature infants with a history of BPD than in those without history of BPD. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that MRI will be more sensitive to detect lung changes than PFT,&#xD;
      but that MRI changes will correlate with PFT abnormalities. Ultimately, this information will&#xD;
      form the basis of future longitudinal studies to evaluate progression of pulmonary disease&#xD;
      and assess effects of new treatment strategies in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions Amongst 7-9 year old children with a history of prematurity (&lt; 28 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation), comparing those with and without a history of BPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there measureable differences in pulmonary micro-structure, quantified using MRI&#xD;
           signal intensity (primary question)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the association between pulmonary micro-structural measurements quantified using&#xD;
           pulmonary MRI and pulmonary function outcomes (secondary questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. airflow limitation, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),&#xD;
                FEV1/FVC, mid-expiratory flows (FEF25-75)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. lung volumes and gas trapping , as measured by total lung capacity (TLC), residual&#xD;
                volume (RV) and RV/TLC ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), a marker of pulmonary alveolar volume&#xD;
                and pulmonary diffusing capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. respiratory symptoms, social and environmental exposure history and healthcare&#xD;
                utilization, assessed by validated questionnaire (ATS-DLD-78-a) Methods Study&#xD;
                Setting: This cross-sectional study will be carried out at three Canadian tertiary&#xD;
                care pediatric centres (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario,&#xD;
                The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario and Centre Hospitalier&#xD;
                Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec). Ethics approval will be&#xD;
                obtained at all participating sites. Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used&#xD;
                to describe the two groups. The primary analysis will be a comparison of signal&#xD;
                intensity between children with a history of BPD and those without, adjusting for&#xD;
                exposure to earlier (24-26 weeks) or later (27-28 weeks) gestational age, using a&#xD;
                two-way analysis of variance. Secondary analyses will examine the association&#xD;
                between MRI signal intensity and PFT, as well as signal intensity and respiratory&#xD;
                symptoms from the ATS-DLD-78-c questionnaire, using Spearman correlations.&#xD;
                Exploratory analyses will also examine the association between PFT and respiratory&#xD;
                symptoms, as well as parental smoking exposure, the relationship of obstetrical and&#xD;
                neonatal historical factors to signal intensity, PFT, and respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: Imaging Feasibility: The MRI pulse sequence that is the foundation for this&#xD;
      study was previously developed and validated at 3T on a GE scanner by Dr. Parraga, who serves&#xD;
      as Co-Principal Investigator of this proposed research.42 The MR acquisitions will be enabled&#xD;
      using MR infrastructure at all 3 sites and 32 channel cardiac coils. Proof-of-concept for the&#xD;
      presence of extensive emphysema is provided for a 25 year old with a history of prematurity&#xD;
      and BPD, with significant MRI-evidence of widespread alveolar and acinar duct abnormalities&#xD;
      that are consistent with emphysema Recruitment Feasibility: Each year, approximately 400&#xD;
      infants born &lt; 28 weeks' gestation attend neonatal clinic follow-up visits at 18 months of&#xD;
      age, at the three participating centres. As there are already established databases of these&#xD;
      children at each site, identification of those eligible for study participation will be&#xD;
      easily achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At CHU Sainte-Justine, approximately 80 children aged 5-7 years are seen annually and from a&#xD;
      previous study recruiting at 5 years, participation rate was 60%, further supporting&#xD;
      feasibility for this study. Anticipated Results and Conclusions The Investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that there will be significantly more severe pulmonary micro-structural abnormalities, as&#xD;
      evidenced by lower pulmonary mean signal intensity, in 7-9 year olds born at less than 28&#xD;
      weeks' gestation, with a history of BPD, as compared to children born at less than 28 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation without BPD. The investigators expect that mean MRI-derived signal intensity will&#xD;
      correlate significantly with PFT measurements, as well as with the presence of chronic&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and increased healthcare utilization. This is the first study using&#xD;
      innovative MRI techniques in relation to functional testing that will help characterize&#xD;
      regional pulmonary tissue destruction and/or emphysematous changes present in children with a&#xD;
      history of extreme prematurity, with and without BPD. In particular, MRI measurements may be&#xD;
      more sensitive markers of early lung disease than PFT or respiratory symptoms. Since these&#xD;
      children may only manifest signs of respiratory impairment in the presence of stressors,&#xD;
      knowledge of these MRI changes may prompt earlier or more aggressive respiratory support and&#xD;
      treatment to prevent respiratory compromise. Ultimately, there may be opportunity in future&#xD;
      to intervene with additional treatments that may halt progression to adult lung disease. This&#xD;
      is particularly important, given the increasing body of evidence for early COPD-like disease&#xD;
      in this group. This work may identify a BPD-COPD overlap syndrome, with unique&#xD;
      pathophysiology and potentially differential response to treatments from traditional COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Challenges: Children will be recruited for this study from neonatal follow-up&#xD;
      clinic databases that capture all of those graduating from the neonatal nursery and surviving&#xD;
      to 18 months. It is possible that some families may have since relocated or have been lost to&#xD;
      follow-up and/or that those willing to participate in a research study at age 7-9 years will&#xD;
      differ from those not willing/able to participate. Further, by studying children able to&#xD;
      perform PFT and to cooperate for MRI, the investigators will exclude those with significant&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental delay, who may also have more severe lung disease. As these are the main&#xD;
      study outcomes, however, this will be necessary. Inclusion of children with a history of BPD&#xD;
      ensures that those at the more severe end of the spectrum of early pulmonary complications,&#xD;
      who are expected to have more severe lung disease, are studied. Exercise testing is another&#xD;
      methodology to assess pulmonary and cardiovascular function. It is beyond the feasibility and&#xD;
      budget ($200 per test) for this study and also requires coordination tasks that may be&#xD;
      challenging for some participants. Nonetheless, it is an important consideration for future&#xD;
      work. There are few precedents for pulmonary MRI in children, particularly in those with&#xD;
      prematurity and BPD. Traditionally, MRI has been considered suboptimal in comparison to CT&#xD;
      for lung parenchyma imaging, due to the low tissue density and loss of signal from magnetic&#xD;
      field inhomogeneity at the air lung interfaces. Novel ultra-short echo time (UTE) pulse&#xD;
      sequences, however, permit greater signal from the pulmonary parenchyma, which makes MRI a&#xD;
      viable strategy to assess emphysematous changes in this population, without exposure to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. In the neonatal intensive care unit, MRI has shown signal decreases&#xD;
      suggestive of alveolar simplification (emphysema) in those with severe BPD. It is possible&#xD;
      that children with a history of extreme prematurity without BPD will also have some degree of&#xD;
      pulmonary parenchymal change on MRI, although it is still expected that abnormalities will be&#xD;
      more severe in those with a history of BPD. This study is, however, powered to detect smaller&#xD;
      differences in signal intensity between groups than observed in adult COPD studies. The&#xD;
      investigators are not using a healthy term control group because the purpose of this research&#xD;
      is to assess radiological and functional biomarkers that will help clinicians and researchers&#xD;
      identify among preterm born children those at greater risk of long-lasting pulmonary problems&#xD;
      who would benefit the most from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The ever growing population of extremely preterm born individuals, representing&#xD;
      approximately 27,000 Canadians less than 18 years old, of whom approximately 40% have BPD, is&#xD;
      at risk of development of early COPD-like emphysematous changes. Thus, neonatal conditions&#xD;
      may be at the origin of a substantial and disproportionately high burden of adult lung&#xD;
      disease, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Prematurity and BPD, in&#xD;
      addition to smoking, is one of the strongest predictors of obstructive airways disease in&#xD;
      later life. In order to promote lung health and reduce the global burden of chronic lung&#xD;
      disease, it is necessary to understand the trajectory of lung growth, development and decline&#xD;
      across the lifespan in this at-risk population. Use of novel imaging strategies, more&#xD;
      sensitive than PFT or respiratory symptoms to quantify early changes in the lung, provides&#xD;
      new knowledge about the natural history of BPD in this population. Furthermore, MRI changes&#xD;
      can quantify improvement associated with therapeutic interventions and can be safely serially&#xD;
      evaluated across the lifespan. This is particularly important and exciting, given new&#xD;
      therapies on the horizon to treat BPD, including stem cell treatments.&#xD;

    <description>The HAES questionnaire will be administered at baseline to assess the level of physical activity of the child. This validated questionnaire has been used in many clinical populations of children(149;150) and captures both the duration and intensity of physical activity.(151;152) Information is completed on one typical weekday and one weekend day. The questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.</description>

        Children born pre-term at less than 28 weeks' gestation, currently aged 7-9 years, with and&#xD;
        without BPD will be included. BPD will be defined as need for oxygen at 36 weeks'&#xD;
        postmenstrual age,2 which includes those with moderate-severe disease.47 Children 7-9 years&#xD;
        of age were selected in order to include the youngest age at which pulmonary function,&#xD;
        including lung volumes and single breath pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide,&#xD;
        can routinely be reliably measured using methods that require subject cooperation.&#xD;
