  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary tumour of the liver and is the&#xD;
      third cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Depending on the stage of the disease, the&#xD;
      treatment options are surgery, liver transplantation, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, scientific research has focused on small molecules called microRNAs which are&#xD;
      produced by human cells and can be released in the blood. They have a role in cell&#xD;
      proliferation and are found to be dysregulated in different types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that microRNAs have a role in the development of HCC but it is unknown if&#xD;
      these molecules can be used as markers for diagnosis and survival in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, microRNAs miR-221 and miR-222 are dysregulated in the tumoral tissues in about&#xD;
      80% of patients with HCC. This can be assessed on tissues from liver biopsies or surgical&#xD;
      specimens, both invasive approaches. Only few studies showed the presence of microRNAs in the&#xD;
      blood of patients with HCC but it is unknown if there is a correlation between tumoral tissue&#xD;
      expression and circulating levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if these two microRNAs are expressed not only in the&#xD;
      tumoral tissues but also in the blood from cancer patients, and in different amounts compared&#xD;
      to circulating levels in healthy individuals. A correlation between tumoral tissue and blood&#xD;
      levels will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this evaluation show a strong correlation and reliability of circulating microRNAs in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and follow up of HCC, future clinical trials targeting these microRNAs and&#xD;
      their related pathways might benefit from this being adopted as conventional practice instead&#xD;
      of the need of assessing tissue levels from liver biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will bring preliminary results as a first step for future&#xD;
      analysis on a larger cohort of patients.&#xD;

      1. Background &amp; Rationale Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer&#xD;
           worldwide, and is the third cause of cancer-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surgical resection remains the best curative treatment option for patients with clinical&#xD;
           Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A disease and it has shown benefits even in&#xD;
           the more advanced stage B with multifocal disease or limited vascular invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite curative treatments offering a 5-year survival rate of 50-70%, recurrence rates&#xD;
           at 5 years after surgery are as high as 70%. Therefore, more efforts are needed in order&#xD;
           to identify prognostic factors for recurrence and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs molecules, which act as key regulators of&#xD;
           cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and embryonic development, finely tuning&#xD;
           gene expression at post-transcriptional level. They act as oncogenes or tumor&#xD;
           suppressors depending on the target genes. In HCC, it has been reported the upregulation&#xD;
           or downregulation of a few cluster of microRNAs, with a subsequent activation of&#xD;
           molecular networks such as b-catenin, Ras, TGF-b, JAK/STAT and creation of a highly&#xD;
           controlled feedback mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Their involvement in carcinogenesis represents an important area of investigation for&#xD;
           the development of their clinical applications: diagnostics, monitoring and&#xD;
           therapeutics. MicroRNA profiles can distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue,&#xD;
           identify tissue of origin and also discriminate different subtypes or specific oncogenic&#xD;
           abnormalities. Indeed, microRNA mis-expression patterns are more accurate in identifying&#xD;
           the origin of tumours that are otherwise difficult to be determined, suggesting that&#xD;
           tumours more clearly maintain a unique tissue microRNA expression profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MicroRNAs could also be useful as early diagnosis biomarkers for patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In liver tumorigenesis, the role of miR-221 and miR-222 has not been completely&#xD;
           elucidated. Previous studies showed that miR-221 was upregulated in 83% of HCC tumoral&#xD;
           samples when compared with matched cirrhotic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increased expression of serum miR-221 was found in HCC patients compared to healthy&#xD;
           normal controls, which was associated with the presence of other poor prognostic factors&#xD;
           and with poorer outcomes after liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The extraction of microRNAs from liver samples is limited by the ability to resecting&#xD;
           the tumour or the possibility to perform a liver biopsy in each patient. On the&#xD;
           contrary, a blood sample is easy to be collected and stored for analysis. At present, it&#xD;
           has not been clearly established a correlation between the expression of miR-221 and&#xD;
           miR-222 in the liver tissue (tumoral and non tumoral) and the circulating miR-221 and&#xD;
           miR-222 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The confirmation of this correlation, would allow identifying a cutoff of circulating&#xD;
           levels which could be used as a surrogate marker in order to include HCC patients in&#xD;
           phase 3 trials without the need for a liver biopsy, which is often contraindicated for&#xD;
           clinical reasons and according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a pilot study to evaluate the correlation between the overexpression of miR-221&#xD;
           and miR-222 in paired tumoral/non tumoral liver tissue and blood samples in patients&#xD;
           with HCC and to identify a cutoff for the circulating levels to use as a surrogate&#xD;
           marker in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study therefore aims to evaluate if miR-221 and miR-222 expression in the blood&#xD;
           correlates with tissue expression and if the circulating levels could be used as a&#xD;
           surrogate of overexpression in the tumoral liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should this evaluation show a strong correlation and reliability of circulating miRNAs,&#xD;
           in the diagnosis and follow up of HCC, future clinical trials targeting these miRNAs and&#xD;
           their related pathways might benefit from this being adopted as conventional practice&#xD;
           instead of the need of assessing tissue levels from liver biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of&#xD;
           Helsinki, the principles of GCP and all (if any) applicable regulatory requirements are&#xD;
           essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NHS Grampian Biorepository will provide the anonymised samples to be used for this&#xD;
           study. NHS Grampian Biorepository already has ethical approval in place for these types&#xD;
           of studies. Research and Development approval will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods Blood samples from patients with HCC and from age-matched healthy controls,&#xD;
           stored in the National bio-repository Scotland, will be tested for circulating miR-221&#xD;
           and miR-222 expression by the means of Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain&#xD;
           Reaction (RT-qPCR). Similarly, levels of miR-221 and miR-222 will be assessed in paired&#xD;
           cancer and healthy liver tissue form patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample analysis will take place in the Institute for Health and Wellbeing Research&#xD;
           laboratory at Robert Gordon University (RGU) - Aberdeen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results from the analysis of samples and quantification of microRNAs via RT-qPCR will be&#xD;
           carried out by the chief investigator along with the research team in the laboratory&#xD;
           facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Samples will be analysed to assess miR-221 and miR-222 overexpression between tumoral&#xD;
           and non tumoral liver tissue and to assess the correlation between this and circulating&#xD;
           miR-221 and miR-222. Circulating levels will be compared to results from age-matched&#xD;
           healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The custodian of the data generated by the study will be the Chief Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Samples will be stored in the laboratory facilities at RGU and only the chief&#xD;
           investigator and the research team will have access to.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data generated by the study will be collected in a spreadsheet which will be bespoke and&#xD;
           held on the intranet with access restricted only to the CI and the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anonymised data on computer files will be stored on password-protected databases&#xD;
           accessible only to the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All written files will be stored in locked filling cabinets within a secure store at&#xD;
           Robert Gordon University with the exception of consents which are stored by NHS Grampian&#xD;
           Biorepository.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The University of Aberdeen and NHS Grampian monitoring procedures will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the research the samples will be stored by research team pending ethical&#xD;
           approval for use in another project, whereas the data generated by the study will be&#xD;
           stored on password-protected databases accessible only to the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consent Process NHS Grampian Biorepository seek informed consent by patients for&#xD;
           collection of tissue samples and blood through a dedicated research nurse and the use of&#xD;
           a patient information sheet and a consent form which are part of the NHS Grampian&#xD;
           Biorepository documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A consent will be obtained for all the samples used in this study according to the&#xD;
           Biorepository consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Trial Flowchart&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Five frozen paired hepatic tumoral and non tumoral tissue and five frozen plasma&#xD;
                samples obtained from patients with HCC and stored in the National Bio-Repository&#xD;
                Scotland (HCC Group, HCC). Five voluntary age-matched healthy controls will be&#xD;
                recruited to relate the expression of circulating miRNAs (Plasma Control Group,&#xD;
                PCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Paired frozen HCC tissue specimens and their adjacent non-cancerous normal liver&#xD;
                will be collected in RNA Stabilisation tubes and stored at -80C until further&#xD;
                analysis and miRNAs extraction as per protocol. The average size of the specimen&#xD;
                will be 2 by 10 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples collected from both HCC Group and PCG (8-10ml, into BD Vacutainer&#xD;
                K3-EDTA blood collection tubes) will be collected. All samples will be sent to&#xD;
                Bio-Repository for further processing and then analysis and miRNAs extraction as&#xD;
                per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The results of miRNAs extraction from paired HCC/non-cancerous tissues will be&#xD;
                compared and from HCC Group plasma will be compared to the matched plasma of&#xD;
                controls (PCG Group).&#xD;
