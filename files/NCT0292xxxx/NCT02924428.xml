  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of facial acne vulgaris treatment using&#xD;
      the Venus Versa Diamondpolar applicator in combination with the Venus Versa AC dual&#xD;
      applicator using two intense pulsed light wavelength bands.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, open-label study utilizing before-after study design. Up to 20&#xD;
      healthy subjects, age 18 - 55 years with acne vulgaris who wish to improve their skin&#xD;
      appearance will be randomized to receive either Diamondpolar applicator (radio frequency and&#xD;
      pulsed magnetic field) treatment followed by AC Dual applicator (intense pulsed light)&#xD;
      treatment or AC Dual applicator (intense pulsed light) treatment alone using the Venus Versa&#xD;
      system. Duration of subject participation will be approximately 10 weeks (4 weekly treatments&#xD;
      with a follow-up visit scheduled 6 weeks after the last treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AC Dual applicator (IPL) is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris by using a blue&#xD;
      light (415 nm) to target porphyrins produced by the P. acne bacteria, destroying the bacteria&#xD;
      and uses the red light (630 nm) to help reduce inflammation, inhibit sebum production and&#xD;
      improve healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of the Diamondpolar applicator (RF and PEMF) treatment is thought to target the&#xD;
      sebaceous gland, causing it to shrink and decrease sebum output&#xD;

    <description>Treatment will be considered successful if the appearance improves by at least 2 points on the 5-point Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS) at 6 weeks post treatment as compared to baseline where 0 = No evidence of facial acne vulgaris, 1 (minimal) = Few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present, 2 (mild) = Several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present, 3 (Moderate) = Many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed, 4 (Severe) = Significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. Lower number represents an improvement in acne vulgaris.</description>
