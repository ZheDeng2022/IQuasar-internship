      Main objective: To compare the level of physical activity (PAL) at 12 months in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) between those who&#xD;
      completed a health education program and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients. Subjects older than 35 years; diagnosis of moderate to very severe COPD (FEV1&#xD;
      &lt;80% predicted), established at least 3 months; current or former smoker with an accumulated&#xD;
      consumption &gt;10 packs x year; and hospital admission for COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Randomized, parallel and open-label clinical trial, controlled with conventional&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: During hospitalization, selected patients will receive conventional treatment.&#xD;
      At discharge, they will be randomized (1:1) to control group [treatment and follow-up&#xD;
      according to conventional clinical practice] or intervention group [in addition to&#xD;
      conventional treatment and follow-up, the patients will be referred to a nursing consultation&#xD;
      for perform two health education sessions, at 15 and 30 days after hospital discharge].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements. At 15 days and 12 months after discharge, the following determinations will be&#xD;
      made: anthropometric characteristics; clinical evaluation (smoking history, date of COPD&#xD;
      diagnosis, comorbidities, current medication; health care utilization; moderate or severe&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations); questionnaires (mMRC, Charlson, COPD-specific co-morbidity test (COTE),&#xD;
      COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and LCADL), spirometry and six-minutes walking test; and&#xD;
      evaluation of daily physical activity using an accelerometer.&#xD;

      Objectives: To compare the level of physical activity (PAL) at 12 months in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-very severe COPD between those who completed a health education program and those&#xD;
      who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1) To compare the average of steps per day at 12 months in patients&#xD;
      with moderate-very severe COPD between the intervention group (conventional treatment plus&#xD;
      health education program) and the control group (conventional treatment); 2) to compare the&#xD;
      daily minutes of moderate to high intensity at 12 months between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups; 3) to compare the daily energy expenditure higher than 3 metabolic equivalents (METs)&#xD;
      at 12 months between the intervention and control groups; 4) to compare the distribution&#xD;
      profile of the daily physical activity (very sedentary, sedentary, moderately active) at 12&#xD;
      months between the intervention and control groups; 5) to evaluate the long-term effect of&#xD;
      the health education program on the health-related quality of life of patients with moderate&#xD;
      to very severe COPD; 6) to analyze the effect of the health education program on the risk and&#xD;
      powered rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations; 7) to assess the relationship between&#xD;
      the change of the PAL and the modification of the health-related quality of life and the&#xD;
      number of moderate or severe exacerbations; and 8) to identify the determinants of a&#xD;
      clinically relevant increase of the PAL (&gt; 0.14 units) in patients with moderate to very&#xD;
      severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS I. Study subjects. Patient selection will be held consecutively in the Department of&#xD;
      Pneumology, University Hospital La Paz-Cantoblanco-Carlos III, according to the following&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: subjects older than 35 years; diagnosis of moderate to very severe&#xD;
           COPD (FEV1 &lt;80% predicted), according to the GesEPOC criteria [Arch Bronconeumol 2012;48&#xD;
           (Suppl 1):2-58], established at least 3 months; current or former smoker with an&#xD;
           accumulated consumption &gt;10 packs x year; and hospital admission for COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: osteoarticular, neuromuscular or cognitive limitation that prevents&#xD;
           ambulation; previous diagnosis of active neoplastic disease; institutionalized patients;&#xD;
           alcohol consumption &gt;60 g/day; patient belonging to another health sector in the&#xD;
           Community of Madrid or other community; participation in another study within 6 months&#xD;
           prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must sign informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee of University&#xD;
      Hospital La Paz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Design. Randomized, parallel and open-label clinical trial, controlled with conventional&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Protocol and intervention. During hospitalization, selected patients will receive&#xD;
      conventional treatment. At discharge, they will be randomized (1:1) to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group. Treatment and follow-up according to conventional clinical practice&#xD;
           (GesEPOC guidelines), including recommendations on healthy habits and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group. In addition to conventional treatment and follow-up, the patients&#xD;
           will be referred to a nursing consultation for perform two health education sessions, at&#xD;
           15 and 30 days after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first session will last about 90 minutes and will consist of four stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic formation. The manual &quot;Controlling the COPD&quot;, published by the Spanish Society of&#xD;
           Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) will be handed to participants. The nurse will&#xD;
           individually review the following aspects: basic lung anatomy and physiology, COPD&#xD;
           concept, importance of tobacco, diagnostic tests for COPD (spirometry, blood gases,&#xD;
           sputum cultures, simple radiology, laboratory, walking test), and how COPD is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care in COPD: diet, breathing exercises, physical exercise (walking, cycle, treadmill&#xD;
           ...), lifestyle (clothing, hygiene, preening, exercise, rest, sexuality, social&#xD;
           relations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of conventional treatment: inhalers, oxygen therapy and medications;&#xD;
           integration of treatment, and adhesion; smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Action Plan: the patient and the nurse will establish a target about the activities that&#xD;
           the patient must perform as well as their frequency and duration, according to WHO&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session will last approximately 15 minutes and it will be scheduled a month later.&#xD;
      Current situation of the patient and the changes from the previous session will be assessed;&#xD;
      compliance with the physical activity plan and the deviation causes will be analyzed; the&#xD;
      weaknesses of the patient will be strengthened (training, incentives); skills in the&#xD;
      management of inhalers, oxygen, and breathing exercises will be tested; and a new physical&#xD;
      activity plan will be maintained or intensified (WHO guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no therapeutic restrictions for the patients included in the study, which will be&#xD;
      treated by their usual pulmonologist and other health professionals according to their&#xD;
      clinical judgment. Therefore, no limitation is posed to change the usual treatment (including&#xD;
      the prescription of oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation) or to schedule follow-up&#xD;
      visits performed by the regular doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Sample size. Considering a mean PAL value of 1.55 ± 0.265 in patients with moderate-severe&#xD;
      COPD and an increase of 0.14 units as clinically relevant, since it is associated with a&#xD;
      mortality reduction [Chest 2011;140:331-42], to detect a difference ≥0.14 units, by contrast&#xD;
      bilateral hypothesis (with alpha risk=0.05, beta risk=0.20 and drop-out rate=10%), it is&#xD;
      estimated to will be necessary to randomize 64 patients to each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measurements. At 15 days and 12 months after discharge, the following determinations&#xD;
      will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric characteristics (sex, age, weight, height, BMI and BSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical evaluation: Smoking history (cigarettes/day, packs-year), date of COPD&#xD;
           diagnosis, comorbidities, current medication; visits to primary care physician or&#xD;
           pulmonologist (scheduled and unscheduled) and emergency room (date and cause),&#xD;
           hospitalizations (date and cause) and periods off work (date and cause); number and date&#xD;
           of moderate (prescription of antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids) or severe&#xD;
           (hospitalization or stay in the emergency department &gt;24 hours) exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questionnaires: mMRC dyspnea scale, Charlson and COTE comorbidity indices, CAT and&#xD;
           LCADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Spirometry and six-minutes walking test, according current guidelines [Arch Bronconeumol&#xD;
           2013; 49: 388-401; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002; 166: 111-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of daily physical activity. It will be made using a Sense Wear accelerometer&#xD;
           (Body Media), that it will be placed on the no dominant arm for 7 consecutive days. The&#xD;
           physical activity level (PAL) will be recorded. Depending on this parameter, the&#xD;
           subjects will be classified as very sedentary (PAL &lt;1.40), sedentary (PAL 1.40 to 1.69)&#xD;
           or moderately active (PAL&gt; 1.70). The mean of steps per day, minutes per day of moderate&#xD;
           to high intensity (&gt;3 METs) and daily energy expenditure &gt;3 METs will be also&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Statistical analysis. T-Student, Mann-Whitney and chi-square test for between-groups&#xD;
      comparisons. Relationship analysis using Pearson correlation and multivariate regression&#xD;
      models. Intention-to-treat evaluation of the main objective with imputation of missing data&#xD;
      by a regression model. The effect of the intervention will be evaluated by the difference of&#xD;
      change for each variable between the two groups using general linear models. The crude effect&#xD;
      (only adjusted for baseline values) and the adjusted effect for several confounders (sex,&#xD;
      age, BMI, smoking, treatment and FEV1%) will be determined.&#xD;
