    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for ALK-positive or&#xD;
      ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following drug will be involved in this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lorlatinib&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The FDA (the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Lorlatinib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this study will receive Lorlatinib. Lorlatinib targets the abnormal ALK&#xD;
      or ROS1 proteins in NSCLC cells. Lorlatinib has been tested in other research studies and&#xD;
      results show that the medicine may help to control the growth of NSCLC even after it has&#xD;
      spread to the CNS. The CNS is a term used to refer to the brain and spinal cord, including&#xD;
      the lining of the brain and spinal cord which is called the meninges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether lorlatinib is&#xD;
      effective in controlling the growth of cancer cells after they have spread to the CNS.&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is to determine why the cancer cells that have spread to the&#xD;
      participant CNS have continued to grow despite treatment with other drugs. For this reason,&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected as part of this study to assess the DNA released by the&#xD;
      participants cancer cells into their blood when the cells travel to other sites in their&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28&#xD;
             days before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;

                  least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment&#xD;
                  period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom&#xD;

                  last dose of study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this&#xD;
                  same period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for&#xD;
                  the duration of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
