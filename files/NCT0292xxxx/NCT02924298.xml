  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity in the US has increased from 23.2% to&#xD;
      32.9%. This epidemic is fueling the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) epidemic. This likely is the&#xD;
      major challenge facing the nephrology community in the next decade and beyond. This pilot&#xD;
      study is designed to test the feasibility of the Sit Less, Interact, Move More (SLIMM)&#xD;
      intervention and to determine its preliminary impact on light physical activity (PA) levels.&#xD;
      Increasing light PA may have significant impact on both obesity and slowing the progression&#xD;
      of CDK.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one-third of U.S. adults (35.7%) are obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2). In&#xD;
      2008, medical costs associated with obesity were estimated at $147 billion. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there is a graded association of BMI and the risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Indeed,&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of CKD in the US population is partly explained by increasing BMI.&#xD;
      Hence, as a public health policy, it is imperative that obesity be targeted in order to&#xD;
      decrease the morbidity, mortality and the healthcare costs burden associated with CKD and&#xD;
      ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical inactivity plays a major role in obesity. Volitional exercise (VE), which includes&#xD;
      moderate to vigorous physical activities (MVPA) such as sports and fitness-related&#xD;
      activities, and non-volitional exercise, which includes low to light intensity physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) such as activities of daily living, fidgeting, spontaneous muscle contraction,&#xD;
      and maintaining posture in non-recumbent positions, represent two different ends of the PA&#xD;
      spectrum. The current national recommendations are focused on MVPA (30 minutes of moderate PA&#xD;
      five times a week or 25 minutes of vigorous activities three times a week). However, the&#xD;
      relative importance of low and light activities and MVPA has not been established. As&#xD;
      described in the preliminary data, the analyses of objectively measured PA in National Health&#xD;
      And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that a larger amount of light intensity PA&#xD;
      is strongly associated with lower odds of proteinuria, lower odds of CKD and a lower hazard&#xD;
      of death at any given level of MVPA. Furthermore, there appears to be a threshold effect for&#xD;
      MVPA with mortality that plateaus at about half of the currently recommended levels of MVPA.&#xD;
      Since physical function in the CKD population is low, 30 minutes of moderate PA five times a&#xD;
      week or 25 minutes of vigorous activities three times a week might induce fatigue and&#xD;
      paradoxically reduce light intensity PA. On the other hand, a lower target of MVPA might&#xD;
      improve adherence with MVPA as well as not decrease light PA. This pilot intervention study&#xD;
      will test the efficacy, feasibility and tolerability of the SLIMM intervention. The results&#xD;
      of this intervention will be later used to determine if targeting obesity via the SLIMM&#xD;
      intervention will slow kidney disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot intervention study that will examine the feasibility of and adherence to the&#xD;
      SLIMM intervention to increase levels of light physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit: Baseline PA data will be collected by accelerometer in the week following the&#xD;
      screening visit. Participants will be instructed on the importance of physical activity, the&#xD;
      recommendations of 150 min/wk of moderate PA, or 75 min/wk of vigorous PA, and be provided&#xD;
      with examples of physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLIMM Intervention: The goal of the SLIMM intervention is to increase the time spent on light&#xD;
      activities (Light physical activity is defined as 500-2019 counts/minute). This intervention&#xD;
      will only be completed by individuals in the CKD and non-CKD groups. At week 6 of the&#xD;
      intervention participants will be instructed to perform 5 minutes of light activity for each&#xD;
      25 minutes of sitting time. At week 12, participants will be instructed to further increase&#xD;
      their light activity to a goal of 10 minutes for each 20 minute of sitting time. Thus, the&#xD;
      goal is to replace total sedentary time by increase in light activities by 15% in 6 weeks and&#xD;
      33% by the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo standardized training on the SLIMM intervention by trained&#xD;
      study personnel at the 6 week visit. Participants will initially be asked to perform 5&#xD;
      minutes of light activity for every 25 minutes spent seated. At the week 12 visit,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to further increase their activity, by performing 10 minutes of&#xD;
      light activity for every 20 minutes spent seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training will be provided in one to one sessions and reinforced at the following visits.&#xD;
      Accelerometry data and paper PA diary data collected during the week before the baseline&#xD;
      visit will be reviewed with the participant to provide feedback and used for devising a&#xD;
      customized plan on increasing light activity. Examples of how to increase light activities&#xD;
      within their natural, free-living environment will be provided. For instance, if the majority&#xD;
      of their day is spent working at a desk, they will be encouraged to stand and/or walk for 5&#xD;
      minutes for every 25 minutes spent sedentary during weeks 6-12, and 10 minutes of light&#xD;
      activity for every 20 minutes spent sedentary for weeks 12-18. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      stand and/or walk during commercial breaks when they are watching television.&#xD;
