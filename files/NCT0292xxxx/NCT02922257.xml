      This study will investigate the potential for FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) (and other gene&#xD;
      expression markers, for example pentraxin 3 [PTX-3], serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1&#xD;
      [SGK1], and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK3b]) to be developed as a biomarker for use&#xD;
      in diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, assessment of effectiveness of medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment, and detection of relapse of endogenous Cushing's syndrome after surgery.&#xD;

      This study will investigate the potential for FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) (and other gene&#xD;
      expression markers, for example pentraxin 3 [PTX-3], serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1&#xD;
      [SGK1], and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK3b]) to be developed as a biomarker for use&#xD;
      in diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, assessment of effectiveness of medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment, and detection of relapse of endogenous Cushing's syndrome after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that FKBP5 levels are elevated in patients with Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome, and these levels decrease after successful surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized specimen collection study with pre- and post-surgery follow-up&#xD;
      periods. This study will be performed in patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone&#xD;
      (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome scheduled for curative surgery and followed until relapse&#xD;
      of endogenous Cushing's syndrome or up to 3 years post-surgery. No study medication will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
