  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)&#xD;
      agonist SD-101 when given together with ibrutinib and radiation therapy and to see how well&#xD;
      they work in treating patients with Low Grade Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, or&#xD;
      Mantle Cell Lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or no longer responds&#xD;
      to treatment. Immunostimulants such as TLR9 agonist SD-101 may increase the ability of the&#xD;
      immune system to fight infection and disease. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving TLR9 agonist SD-101 with ibrutinib and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may induce an immune response and prolong anti-tumor response.&#xD;
