      In the present sham-controlled study, the investigators examine whether tDCS could be used to&#xD;
      enhance language abilities (e.g., picture naming) in individuals with primary progressive&#xD;
      aphasia (PPA) primarily characterized by difficulties with speech production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by insidious&#xD;
      irreversible loss of language abilities. Prior studies suggest that transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) directed toward language areas of the brain may help to ameliorate&#xD;
      symptoms of PPA. In the current study, the investigators are examining whether tDCS could be&#xD;
      used to enhance language abilities (e.g., picture naming) in individuals with PPA variants&#xD;
      primarily characterized by difficulties with speech production (non-fluent and logopenic).&#xD;
      Participants are being recruited from the Penn Frontotemporal Dementia Center to receive 10&#xD;
      days of both real and sham tDCS (counter-balanced, full-crossover design; participants are&#xD;
      na√Øve to stimulation condition). A battery of language tests are being administered at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately post-tDCS (real and sham), and six weeks and twelve weeks following&#xD;
      stimulation. Real tDCS may improve language performance in some individuals with PPA.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators expect that tDCS will be more effective in people whose&#xD;
      baseline performance is worse based on previous research. Severity of deficits at baseline&#xD;
      may be an important factor in predicting which patients will respond positively to&#xD;
      language-targeted tDCS therapies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Difference in WAB-AQ from Baseline at 0-weeks Post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was administered at baseline and immediately post-tDCS (real; sham) following the termination of the tDCS session on the same day (0 week). We computed WAB-Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ), a measure of overall aphasia severity with higher scores indicating better language performance. The WAB assesses the following language domains in subtests: fluency, comprehension, repetition, and naming. We examined change in WAB-AQ and each of the sub-tests from baseline. Difference scores were computed by subtracting the post-intervention score (0 weeks) from baseline for each study arm to assess the impact of real/active vs sham tDCS on severity and each sub-test. Scale title: WAB-AQ; scale values: 0-100; higher scores=better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Difference in WAB Naming Subtest from Baseline at 0-weeks Post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>WAB-naming subtest used common objects as stimuli. Participants were required to name the objects. Three-point maximum score could be earned for each stimulus and a total of 60-points could be earned on this task; points were deducted if the response was incorrect and required a cue or if the response included a paraphasia.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment period: 10/2017-11/2019. Patients with Primary Progressive Aphasia will be recruited from the clinical practices of Drs. H. Branch Coslett, Roy Hamilton, and Murray Grossman at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Additional recruitment measures involve flyers posted around the University of Pennsylvania campus and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania grounds, as well as online FTD/PPA support groups and in-person support groups around the Philadelphia area.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>16 participants were enrolled in the study. Subjects were enrolled if they were native English speakers, right handed, and received a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Note that one participant was diagnosed as having PPA at the time of enrollment; however, it was later learned that this was a misdiagnosis and their data were not analyzed. Baseline Characteristics reported for N=13. The washout period between treatment arms was 12 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The WAB-AQ is a weighted average of all subtest scores relating to spoken language, measuring language ability. It is a sum of all subtest scores from the first part of the WAB (Spontaneous speech, Auditory verbal comprehension, Repetition, Naming and word finding). We report the total average score and standard deviation. The total range is 0-100 (higher scores indicating better performance).</description>

        <title>Aphasia Severity (WAB-AQ): Effects of Active tDCS (Baseline vs. 0 Weeks Immediately Following Stimulation)</title>
        <description>The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was administered at baseline and immediately post-tDCS (real; sham) following the termination of the tDCS session on the same day (0 week). We computed WAB-Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ), a measure of overall aphasia severity with higher scores indicating better language performance. The WAB assesses the following language domains in subtests: fluency, comprehension, repetition, and naming. We examined change in WAB-AQ and each of the sub-tests from baseline. Difference scores were computed by subtracting the post-intervention score (0 weeks) from baseline for each study arm to assess the impact of real/active vs sham tDCS on severity and each sub-test. Scale title: WAB-AQ; scale values: 0-100; higher scores=better outcome.</description>
