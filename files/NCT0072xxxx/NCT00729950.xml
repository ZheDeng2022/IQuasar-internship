  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, pharmacokinetic study of MDX-010 in up to 90&#xD;
      evaluable subjects with surgically unresectable malignant melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group A: Six to 12 subjects will be treated with transfectoma-derived MDX-010 at 2.8 or 5&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose, or with hybridoma-derived MDX-010 at 3 mg/kg/dose administered on Days 1, 57, and&#xD;
      85. The 2.8, 3, and 5 mg/kg dosage cohorts may be initiated concurrently. Additionally, 6&#xD;
      subjects per cohort will receive single doses of transfectoma-derived MDX-010 at 7.5, 10, 15,&#xD;
      and 20 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation from the 5 mg/kg cohort to the 7.5 mg/kg cohort will depend on the safety&#xD;
      profile following a single dose of 5 mg/kg. Once all subjects are enrolled in the 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      cohort and 4 weeks have elapsed since the sixth subject in the cohort has received the first&#xD;
      infusion, dose escalation to the 7.5 mg/kg cohort may occur if ≤1 DLT has occurred in the 5&#xD;
      mg/kg cohort. Dose escalation to the 10 mg/kg cohort may occur 4 weeks after the sixth&#xD;
      subject in the 7.5 mg/kg/dose cohort has received the first infusion (with ≤1 DLT). Dose&#xD;
      escalation to the 15 and 20 mg/kg cohorts may occur 4 weeks after the sixth subject in the&#xD;
      previous cohort has received the first infusion (with ≤1 DLT). Up to six additional subjects&#xD;
      may be enrolled in the MTD dose cohort or in the 20 mg/kg dose cohort if MTD is not attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: If single-dose administration of MDX-010 at 10 mg/kg is well tolerated (≤1 DLT in&#xD;
      the cohort in Group A), then an additional 12 to 20 subjects will be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      with MDX-010 at 10 mg/kg/dose administered on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who respond to therapy will be followed until disease progression or a maximum of&#xD;
      approximately 1 year. Subjects with a response of SD ≥ 3 months, PR, or CR to their initial&#xD;
      treatment cycle who subsequently relapse may be eligible for retreatment with the same&#xD;
      regimen or an alternate regimen considered to be more effective at the time of retreatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have read, understood, and provided written informed consent and&#xD;
