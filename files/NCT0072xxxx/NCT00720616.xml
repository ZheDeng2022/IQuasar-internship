      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose growth hormone (GH), through its generation of free 'bioavailable' insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factor (IGF)-I, can improve insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile of subjects&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism of how low dose GH treatment affects&#xD;
      the body's sensitivity to insulin actions and whether this low GH dose can affect the body's&#xD;
      handling of steroid hormone levels (cortisol clearance) and fat deposition in subjects with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Subjects that satisfy the criteria of metabolic syndrome (central obesity,&#xD;
      treated or untreated high blood pressure, high cholesterol and impaired fasting glucose&#xD;
      levels) will be invited to participate in this study. The subjects will be assessed at the&#xD;
      initial visit to ascertain their suitability before further participation in the study. If&#xD;
      eligible, an equal number of men and women will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      receive either daily low dose GH or placebo injections first for 12 weeks, before exchanging&#xD;
      over for another 12 weeks of treatment after a 4-week washout period. Before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment, the subjects will be assessed at frequently with blood tests, scans and fat&#xD;
      biopsies. During the study, the subjects will be studied 4 times at the Oregon Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research Institute (OCTRI). At the first, second and final visit, testing will&#xD;
      include scans to measure the amount of whole body fat and fat in the stomach area, muscle,&#xD;
      and liver; blood tests to measure levels of cortisol, and fat tissue (taken from a biopsy)&#xD;
      analysis to measure the density of insulin-like growth factor-I (a hormone stimulated by&#xD;
      growth hormone in the body) in fat; whereas blood tests to examine how well insulin works in&#xD;
      the body (insulin sensitivity) will be collected at all visits of the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study. Thirty&#xD;
      subjects will be screened for eligibility initially, and the first 12 eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Six subjects will be randomized to receive the low GH dose (0.1 mg/day)&#xD;
      treatment and 6 subjects to receive Placebo treatment for 12 weeks, exchanging their&#xD;
      treatment for a further 12 weeks after a 4-week washout period. The study drugs will be&#xD;
      stored at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Research Pharmacy and following&#xD;
      randomization, the subjects will be taught by either the Principal Investigator or one of our&#xD;
      Endocrine Nurses to self-administer the injections using Norditropin/Placebo vials and&#xD;
      insulin syringes into the abdomen at 2200h. Randomization for treatment assignment will be&#xD;
      performed by an investigator not directly involved in the patients' recruitment, treatment&#xD;
      and follow-up care. The randomization process will be performed by computerized pre-assigned&#xD;
      random codes by blocks, stratified by age and examined for possible differences in body mass&#xD;
      index. During their in-patient stay at the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research&#xD;
      Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU, subjects will only be allowed to eat the food provided to them by&#xD;
      the OCTRI.&#xD;
