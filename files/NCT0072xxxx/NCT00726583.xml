        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor and has&#xD;
             failed or is intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom standard therapy does not&#xD;
             exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinued prior chemotherapy or other investigational agents for at least three&#xD;
             weeks prior to receiving the first dose of study drug (six weeks for mitomycin C,&#xD;
             nitrosureas,vaccines,or antibody therapy)and recovered from the toxic effects of the&#xD;
             prior treatment (recovered to baseline or ≤grade 1 per Common Toxicity Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events (CTCAE)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinued any radiation therapy for at least four weeks and have recovered from all&#xD;
             radiation-related toxicities (recovered to baseline or ≤CTCAE grade 1) prior to&#xD;
             receiving the first dose of study drug. Palliative radiation of 10 fractions or less&#xD;
             is permitted and a four week interval is not necessary (also allowed during therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic function as defined by the following: WBC count &gt;3,000 cells/μL;&#xD;
             platelets &gt;100,000/μL; hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL (may be transfused to this level); ANC &gt;1500&#xD;
             cells/μL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function as defined by the following: bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL; aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransaminase (AST/SGOT) &amp; alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;2.5 x ULN or &lt;5 x&#xD;
             ULN if due to metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine level &lt;1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active infection at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diabetes or fasting blood glucose&gt;160 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious concomitant systemic disorders that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would place the patient at excessive or unacceptable risk of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within the four weeks prior to the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant central nervous system (CNS) or psychiatric disorder(s) that preclude the&#xD;
             ability of the patient to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected brain metastases that have not received adequate therapy or for&#xD;
             which the patient requires treatment with steroids or anticonvulsants. In the case of&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases, a minimum four week interval between completion&#xD;
             of radiation therapy and registration on study with radiologic evidence of stable or&#xD;
             responding brain metastases is required. In the setting of previous CNS&#xD;
             metastasectomy, adequate (minimum four week) recovery from surgery and/or radiation&#xD;
             therapy should be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leptomeningeal brain metastases should be excluded regardless of whether the&#xD;
             metastases have been treated or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seizures, non-healing wounds, or arterial thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable atrial or ventricular arrhythmias requiring control by medication; any&#xD;
             cardiac ischemic event experienced within the preceding six months; prior history of&#xD;
             congestive heart failure requiring therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant (confirmed by serum β-HCG within 10 days prior to the start&#xD;
             of study treatment if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total gastrectomy, partial bowel obstruction or any gastrointestinal condition that&#xD;
             may interfere with absorption of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that could jeopardize the safety of the patient and compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
