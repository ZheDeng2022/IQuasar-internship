      The purpose of this program is to provide expanded access to plerixafor for patients with&#xD;
      NHL, HD, or MM who are to receive treatment with an autologous peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

      The Expanded Access Program (EAP)(protocol number MOZ00607) is an open label study intended&#xD;
      to provide access to plerixafor for patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease,&#xD;
      or Multiple Myeloma who are to receive treatment with an autologous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. Patients who have previously failed stem cell mobilization attempts or who have&#xD;
      previously received an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant are not eligible to&#xD;
      enroll in this program. The standard of care regimen for stem cell mobilization includes a&#xD;
      growth factor, G-CSF, to increase peripheral blood stem cells. Plerixafor is given on the&#xD;
      evening prior to doses of standard treatment with G-CSF. The combination of G-CSF and&#xD;
      plerixafor has the potential to increase the number of circulating stem cells. The stem cells&#xD;
      develop into specialized white blood cells and platelets that are necessary for immune system&#xD;
      function and normal blood clotting. The stem cells are removed by a process called apheresis,&#xD;
      in which blood is drawn from the patient, the stem cells are separated from the plasma, and&#xD;
      the plasma is returned to the patient. The separated stem cells are frozen, similar to the&#xD;
      blood banking process. The patient then receives chemotherapy according to the institutional&#xD;
      standard. After chemotherapy, stem cell transplant is intended to replenish cells in the bone&#xD;
      marrow that may be destroyed by chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, and total bilirubin less than 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;

             interval of at least 2 half-lives should be considered) with the exception of the&#xD;
