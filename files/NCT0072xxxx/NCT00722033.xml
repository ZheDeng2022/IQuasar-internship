  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight infants has increased dramatically their survival. Survival without&#xD;
      neurologic disturbance varies a lot between centers.There is evidence that fluctuations in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow influences the appearance of intraventricular hemorrhage and itself&#xD;
      implies a detrimental neurologic developing.The electroencephalography is the result of&#xD;
      electric base membrane activity on rest, and it's influenced by the blood flow either. The&#xD;
      Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography is a novel tool, that is capable to be&#xD;
      continuously used at the patient bed and is easily to be read by the trained clinician.The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that common procedures as Surfactant instilation, Indomethacin and Aminophyline&#xD;
      infusion as the appearance of apneas alters the aEEG register. It is a prospective study that&#xD;
      tries to recruit 10 &lt; 30 weeks of gestational age with aprofen consent to monitorize the aEEG&#xD;
      since birth to the seventh day of live.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The survival of extreme premature babies ( &lt; 1000 grams) has improved in the last years. The&#xD;
      neonatal networks have realized of these results and of the interventions associated with&#xD;
      better forecast in the managing of certain punctual problems. Also they have informed that&#xD;
      differences exist in the results obtained among the centers credited for the managing of this&#xD;
      type of patients. One of the challenges of the current Neonatology is the survival without&#xD;
      sequels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of principal worry the neurological sequels in the extreme premature babies. These can&#xD;
      go from severe alterations up to minimal disorders. The managing of the critical patient&#xD;
      includes the strict and continuous monitoring of the vital signs. The cerebral function is of&#xD;
      evaluation limited in the acute period of these patients. The electroencephalography is the&#xD;
      expression of the membrane potential in rest neuronal. One has seen that the changes in&#xD;
      cerebral flow affect the electrical sign emitted by this one. There have been reported that&#xD;
      some conditions that in the neonatal period are associated with alterations of cerebral flow.&#xD;
      This way there is described, that the application of surfactant is associated with&#xD;
      fluctuations of the cerebral flow, the arterial unbalanced ductus, Indomethacin's injection&#xD;
      in less than 30 minutes, episodes of severe hypoxemia , Methylxanthines's injection,etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some years there is used the Monitoring of Amplitude-Integrated Electroencephalography to&#xD;
      term newborn.It corresponds to the Electroencephalography sign obtained in C3 and C4 location&#xD;
      of the standard electroencephalography, amplification of the sign, filtered to 2-15Hz,&#xD;
      submitted to a semilogarithmic compression of the extent rectified by a constant of time of&#xD;
      0,5 seconds and compressed. This gives origin to different patterns, possible to interpret&#xD;
      for the clinician in real time. The use of this tool in premature babies is still&#xD;
      experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is tried to evaluate if common procedures theorically associated with alteration of the&#xD;
      cerebral flow, in extreme premature babies affect the Amplitude- Integrated&#xD;
      Electroencephalography record. It will measure up if changes happen to relation to the&#xD;
      application of Surfactant, Indomethacin in 3 rate of application and Aminophyline's infusion.&#xD;
      The effect of desaturation will measure up, bradycardias and apneas in the extent of voltage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this they will be monitored in continuous form from the birth to 10 premature babies &lt;30&#xD;
      weeks of gestational age for 7 days, previous obtaining of informed consent. Protocols will&#xD;
      be applied:quality of sign and specifics according to the raised aims. The analysis will be&#xD;
      done by means of programs EEG Viewer and Chart Analyzer.The analysis of the bosses of aEEG&#xD;
      and of his variations will be realized manually, applying the Burdjalov and Spitzer score.&#xD;
      The periods before, during and after the administration of Surfactant, Indomethacin and&#xD;
      Aminophyline were selected . In case of apneas, bradycardias and desaturation it will be&#xD;
      compared 1 minute before with the properly such episode. These episodes will be transfer to&#xD;
      an Excel schedule for his numerical analysis. This will allow the obtaining of averages and&#xD;
      standard diversion of the extent of voltage of every episode and it's going to be calculated&#xD;
      if there is any difference before and after each episode. The same is going to be done for&#xD;
      Surfactant (5 minutes before and after), Indometacin(30 minutes before and during the 3 rates&#xD;
      of infusion) and Aminophyline(15 minutes before and after) The level of statistics&#xD;
      significance for all the test will be p &lt; 0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One expects to achieve ideal quality of sign &gt; 75 % of the registered time. One tries to&#xD;
      evaluate 12 Surfactant applications, 35 of Indomethacin, 60 of Aminophyline and 100&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory events. One expects to find differences in the Extent of voltage in&#xD;
      relation to desaturations, bradycardias and apneas.&#xD;
