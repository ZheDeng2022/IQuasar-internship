    <textblock>
      The simultaneous activation of adrenergic and vasopressin receptors, in conjunction with a&#xD;
      potential steroid-mediated enhancement of the vascular reactivity to epinephrine may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects in patients with cardiac arrest. This hypothesis is supported by the&#xD;
      single-center results of NCT 00411879. The investigators intend to either refute or provide&#xD;
      definitive evidence supporting this hypothesis (and its generalizability) by conducting the&#xD;
      present multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of in hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale Inhospital cardiac arrest still constitutes an important clinical&#xD;
      problem with survival to discharge ranging within 0-42% (most common range = 15-20%) (1).&#xD;
      Survival after witnessed, pulseless ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT) that is&#xD;
      responsive to one or two direct current countershock(s) may exceed 30%. However, survival&#xD;
      after inhospital asystole, pulseless electrical activity, or refractory VF/VT (defined as not&#xD;
      responsive to two countershocks) may be substantially lower (i.e., 5-10%) (2). As in&#xD;
      nonsurvivors, both endogenous vasopressin and adrenocorticotrophin are reduced compared to&#xD;
      survivors (3,4), the investigators hypothesize that the addition of exogenous vasopressin&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (5) and of steroids during and after CPR may&#xD;
      increase the rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and improve post-arrest&#xD;
      survival. This hypothesis is supported by the single-center results of NCT 00411879. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators intend to either refute or provide definitive evidence supporting this&#xD;
      hypothesis (and its generalizability) by conducting the present multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial of inhospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Adult in-patients with cardiac arrest not responsive to two direct current&#xD;
      countershocks (when applicable), or asystole, or pulseless electrical activity are randomized&#xD;
      to receive either arginine vasopressin (20 IU/CPR cycle for the first 5 CPR-cycles in&#xD;
      non-VF/VT and from the second to sixth CPR-cycle in VF/VT) plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR-cycle)&#xD;
      plus methylprednisolone (single dose = 40 mg during the first and second CPR-cycle in&#xD;
      non-VF/VT and VF/VT, respectively) or normal saline-placebo plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR-cycle)&#xD;
      plus normal saline-placebo during the first 5 or second to sixth CPR-cycles. Further&#xD;
      CPR-vasopressor treatment includes epinephrine (1 mg/CPR-cycle) for both groups. Apart from&#xD;
      the initial, combined drug administration in the study group, CPR is conducted in full&#xD;
      concordance with the 2005 Guidelines for Advanced Life Support (5). Following ROSC and in the&#xD;
      presence of postresuscitation shock (defined as inability to maintain mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      &gt; 70 mm Hg without using exogenous catecholamines at infusion rates conferring vasopressor&#xD;
      and/or inotropic activity), study group patients receive stress-dose hydrocortisone (300&#xD;
      mg/day for a maximum of 7 days and then gradual taper), whereas controls receive saline&#xD;
      placebo. Patients with pre-arrest history and clinical features, and/or electrocardiographic,&#xD;
      biochemical, and echocardiographic evidence of acute myocardial infarction receive the&#xD;
      stress-dose hydrocortisone (study-group) or the saline-placebo (control-group) for a maximum&#xD;
      of 3 days, followed by gradual taper.1 This time-limit has been chosen to prevent any&#xD;
      potential retardation of infarct healing by glucocorticoid treatment (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ROSC, control group patients may receive stress dose steroid treatment if&#xD;
      prescribed by the attending physician for indications such as septic shock or known&#xD;
      adrenocortical insufficiency. This holds also for study group patients during the follow-up&#xD;
      period. Any steroid prescription by attending physicians cancels any concomitant&#xD;
      investigational interventions regarding steroid supplementation and results in patient&#xD;
      exclusion, unless the prescribed corticosteroid regimen is in full concordance with the&#xD;
      above-described, protocolized one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators involved in CPR drug administration are blinded to the use (or no-use) of&#xD;
      vasopressin and methylprednisolone, and do not coordinate the CPR procedures. For the study&#xD;
      group, steroid treatment is determined by the hospital pharmacies, which are also aware of&#xD;
      the computer-based patient randomization and encoding, and prepare the study drugs for CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up and data recording is conducted by associates who are unaware of CPR drug&#xD;
      regimens. Daily follow-up to day 60 post-arrest includes physiological variables, medication&#xD;
      and other treatment interventions, results of laboratory and diagnostic studies (including&#xD;
      serum interleukins for days 1-10), and determination of the sequential organ dysfunction&#xD;
      assessment (SOFA) score. For the first 10 days post-randomization, monitored/recorded&#xD;
      physiological variables include hemodynamics (arterial and central venous pressure, and heart&#xD;
      rate), gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, body temperature, urinary output and fluid&#xD;
      balance. Patient neurological status will be assessed with the Glasgow Coma Score. Additional&#xD;
      follow-up data will include hospital/intensive care unit (ICU)-related morbidity, length of&#xD;
      ICU/hospital stay, and cerebral performance/residual disabilities (7) at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in previous cardiac arrest trials, the requirement of informed consent for the drug&#xD;
      combination during CPR has been waived. However, informed consent is actually requested for&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment of postresuscitation shock. Furthermore, the patients' families are&#xD;
      always informed about the trial after the resuscitation procedures. Any next-of-kin objection&#xD;
      regarding the trial will result in patient exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Technique Randomization will be conducted in blocks of four with the use of the&#xD;
      Research Randomizer (www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-specified subgroup analyses included the effect of study center, and data from patient&#xD;
      subgroups defined according to the need for &gt;5mg or =&lt;5 mg of epinephrine during CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post hoc analyses included within-group control group comparisons according to the actual use&#xD;
      or no use of stress dose hydrocortisone (300 mg /day for a maximum of 7 days followed by&#xD;
      gradual taper) by attending physicians. Also, patients without &quot;crossover&quot; of the control&#xD;
      group were compared to patients of the VSE group. Lastly, following a relative suggestion by&#xD;
      the Data Monitoring Committee, we attempted to determine the 1 year survival with good&#xD;
      neurological recovery; for this purpose, survivors of both groups (and/or their families)&#xD;
      were contacted / interviewed through telephone communication; this was followed by in-person&#xD;
      interview/examination of the survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of three years from the last patient data collection on the primary&#xD;
      outcomes, the study data will be maintained in de-identified electronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In concordance with a suggestion of a recent Editorial (Intensive Care Med (2014)&#xD;
      40:743-745), the Original and (its minor revision to) the Final Form of the Study Protocol&#xD;
      detailing the Pre-specified Study Planning (which explains the reason for any prior changes&#xD;
      in the current registration data) can be found at the bottom of the following webpage:&#xD;
