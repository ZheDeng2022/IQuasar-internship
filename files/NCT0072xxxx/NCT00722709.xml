      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this research group is to improve the recovery of patients after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. The specific aim of this study is to conduct a randomized, double blinded,&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate the effect of intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia application&#xD;
      on postoperative pain and post-operative fatigue. This will be conducted in the setting of an&#xD;
      enhanced recovery after surgery program (ERAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers and opaque envelope method.&#xD;
      In the treatment arm patients will receive 10ml 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50mls with 0.9%&#xD;
      saline soon after the creation of the laparotomy . In the placebo arm, 50mls of 0.9% normal&#xD;
      saline will be used in a similar fashion. At closure, two small 2mm catheter belonging to the&#xD;
      On-Q pain buster system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity. This will be attached to a&#xD;
      pump which will contain either a 0.2% ropivacaine solution or 0.9% saline placebo running at&#xD;
      4mls/hr for 68 hours. All members involved in patient care (with the exception of one nurse)&#xD;
      will be blinded to the above. After 68 hours the pump will be stopped and the catheter will&#xD;
      be removed. Assessment of postoperative pain will be performed by visual analogue scale, and&#xD;
      fatigue assessment will be done using the Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale (ICFS) at&#xD;
      various intervals post-operatively. Blood tests for inflammatory markers including glucose,&#xD;
      cortisol, CRP, albumin and several cytokines as well as local anaesthetic levels will be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance to health:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method of analgesia administration has not been investigated in open major colonic&#xD;
      surgery. This trial has wide reaching implications, with the potential to improve pain and&#xD;
      thus recovery after abdominal surgery.&#xD;

      Scientific Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative fatigue (POF) is a common phenomenon following abdominal surgery and is&#xD;
      currently under investigation at the department of surgery, Middlemore hospital, Auckland.&#xD;
      POF in patients undergoing major abdominal procedures is very common. It has been reported&#xD;
      that 92% of patients who have undergone abdominal surgery report increased fatigue reports&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure, dropping to about 10% in 3 months. POF comprises of&#xD;
      unpleasant symptoms that impact on the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It can create difficulties in performing activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The symptoms of POF include tiredness, lack of energy and sense of debilitating muscle&#xD;
           weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. POF is thought to be associated with poor physical, psychological and functional&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The aetiology of POF is thought to be multi-factorial. Biological, psychological and&#xD;
           social factors all contribute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological aspect of POF can be divided into the physiological stress response to the&#xD;
      trauma of surgery, postoperative nutritional deficits and the loss of previous cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness subsequently after surgery. Various methods have been investigated over the last two&#xD;
      decades to address and &quot;dampen&quot; the physiological response in order to enhance postoperative&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two possible ways of communication between the periphery and the brain. One is the&#xD;
      hormonal route and the other is the neural route. The later route is projected via paracrine&#xD;
      action of local cytokines on the afferent nerve endings 5. In the abdominal cavity, there are&#xD;
      two types of afferent endings 6. These are the vagal afferents and spinal afferents. Vagal&#xD;
      and spinal afferent fibres transmit sensory information from the GI tract to the CNS.&#xD;
      Afferents from the vagus nerve conduct neuronal messages from the intra-peritoneal cavity to&#xD;
      the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal afferents have cell bodies in nodose ganglia and enter via the brainstem. In comparison&#xD;
      cell bodies of the spinal afferents are located in the dorsal root ganglion and project to&#xD;
      the dorsal horn of the cord. They follow the paths of the sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
      efferents to the gut wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal afferents are either intramuscular or intraganglionic. Spinal afferents on the other&#xD;
      hand are located in the serosa, mesenteric attachments and the submucosa of the tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical stress response produces alterations in the haemodynamic, metabolic and immune&#xD;
      response of patients 7. The biochemical cytokine response to surgical trauma is well&#xD;
      understood and summarised well by Ni Choileain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are elements of immune over stimulation resulting in a cascade of cytokine activation&#xD;
      following surgery. These cytokines include tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and&#xD;
      interleukin 1B (IL-1B). These can stimulate the production and release of other cytokines&#xD;
      including interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 results in the production of C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      and other acute phase proteins through the hepatic component of this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic strategies are aimed at restoring these physiological imbalances associated with&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the rat sub diaphragmatic vagotomy has prevented the effects of intraperitoneal IL-1&#xD;
      administration which prevented increases in body temperature and the increase in secreted&#xD;
      hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE), and markedly attenuated the increases in plasma ACTH and&#xD;
      corticosterone 8. This is thought to have reduced the &quot;sickness response&quot; to intraperitoneal&#xD;
      cytokine administration. Similarly, administration of localised partial body exposure to&#xD;
      irradiation in vagotomised rats resulted in decreased hypothalamic, thalamic, hippocampal and&#xD;
      cortical IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a compared with non-vagotomised rats 9. It is therefore thought&#xD;
      that the vagus plays a major role in the surgical stress response although it is important to&#xD;
      point that the vagus is not thought to be solely responsible for the activation of&#xD;
      hypothalamic activity 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pro-inflammatory cytokine pathway after abdominal surgery, with direct action of cytokines&#xD;
      on the vagus nerve as a major vehicle in this response, is therefore, a feasible explanation&#xD;
      for contributing to POF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical context, recent developments in elective large bowel surgery include the use&#xD;
      of Fast Track (FT) or Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. The use of such&#xD;
      protocols is generally said to affect metabolic, neural and other organ activities in order&#xD;
      to reduce morbidity, increase recovery time and result in shorter hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous elements to these protocols, given there are multiple contributors to POF,&#xD;
      as already discussed. In brief, some of these interventions include extensive preoperative&#xD;
      counseling and preparation psychologically, no preoperative fasting, carbohydrate loading,&#xD;
      use of epidural anaesthesia, avoidance of peri-operative fluid over load, early removal of&#xD;
      catheters, drains and early mobilisation with physiotherapist. 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other interventions, such as pre-operative steroid administration, are currently being&#xD;
      trialed as part of an ERAS surgical protocol at the Manukau Surgery Centre (MSC), Middlemore&#xD;
      Hospital, Auckland. The purpose is to enhance recovery by decreasing the cascade of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory post surgical response using the immunosuppressive properties of this agent.&#xD;
      As discussed earlier, pro-inflammatory responses are hypothesised to contribute to POF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthetic (LA) agents, when applied in sufficient concentration at the site of&#xD;
      action, prevent conduction of electrical impulses by the membranes of nerve and muscle12. In&#xD;
      order to obtain a clear picture of the fundamental blocking mechanism, knowledge of the&#xD;
      channel-binding kinetics of the drug is necessary. The application of LA agents to the&#xD;
      intraperitoneal cavity has been investigated in several trials to decrease post operative&#xD;
      pain and enhance recovery 13-18. Unfortunately there are few studies if any looking at the&#xD;
      application of local anaesthesia in open procedures compared with laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrointestinal procedures. It is therefore an area where trials are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not unreasonable that the application of local anaesthesia to the intraperitoneal&#xD;
      cavity should play a role in ERAS protocols. In order to reduce postoperative pain and reduce&#xD;
      intra-abdominal to CNS signal transmission we will produce a transient &quot;chemical&#xD;
      affarenectomy&quot;. As part of the already established ERAS protocol at the Manukau Surgical&#xD;
      Centre (MSC), my aim is to look at the effects of instillation of local anaesthesia to the&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal cavity immediately after opening the abdominal cavity and we propose an&#xD;
      ongoing LA infusion with an intraperitoneal catheter and external pump postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To be involved in running the already established ERAS program at Manukau Surgical&#xD;
           Centre (MSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a randomised double blinded controlled trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
           intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia application on postoperative pain and POF in patients&#xD;
           under the ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is already an established ERAS perioperative care plan at the MSC. Patients are usually&#xD;
      recruited from surgical outpatients clinics at Manukau Super Clinic. Patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing colonic operations are recruited in the ERAS program under the supervision of the&#xD;
      primary consultant colorectal surgeon. My aim is to be involved in data gathering and&#xD;
      clinical aspects of maintaining this protocol.&#xD;

      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised double blinded clinical trial to investigate the effects of washing and infusing&#xD;
      the intraperitoneal cavity with local anaesthesia on postoperative pain and fatigue scores on&#xD;
      patients undergoing open colonic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval for this project has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the data from a previous study in measuring post-operative fatigue following colonic&#xD;
      surgery, in order to detect a reduction of post-operative fatigue by 30% on day 7&#xD;
      post-operatively with alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8, 21 patients are required in each group,&#xD;
      we will aim for 30 patients in each arm anticipating for possible drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers and opaque envelope method.&#xD;
      In the treatment arm patients will receive 10mls 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50mls with 0.9%&#xD;
      saline soon after the creation of the laparotomy or in the placebo arm, receive 50mls of 0.9%&#xD;
      normal saline in a similar fashion. One theatre staff nurse who will not be involved in&#xD;
      patient care will be given the blinded envelop and prepare the lidocaine or saline mixtures&#xD;
      in the theatre drug room. The mixtures will be unlabelled and appear similar in color. These&#xD;
      will be given to the surgeon during the procedure. All members of the staff involved in&#xD;
      patient care including the anaesthetist will be blinded to the solution administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theatre staff nurse will then prepare a small infusion pump. The mixture used in the pump&#xD;
      will be pre-mixed by one of the clinical pharmacists at Middlemore hospital who will not be&#xD;
      involved in patient care. The staff nurse will be un-blinded to the contents of the mixtures.&#xD;
      The nurse will prepare the pump and load either the anaesthetic or saline solution. At&#xD;
      closure, two small 2mm catheter will be placed in the peritoneal cavity at the site of the&#xD;
      operation to infuse local anaesthetic. This will penetrate through the skin once closure is&#xD;
      complete. This will be attached to a small infusion pump (On-Q pain buster). This pump will&#xD;
      contain either a 270mls of 0.2% ropivacaine or 270mls of 0.9% saline. All members involved in&#xD;
      patient care including surgical, anaesthetic and nursing teams will be blinded to the&#xD;
      contents of this pump. The pump will be activated at a set rate of 4mls/hr immediately once&#xD;
      the patient is in the post anaesthesia recovery room. The pump will run continuously. The&#xD;
      patient will continue recovery on the ward as per ERAS protocol. After 68 hrs the pump will&#xD;
      be stopped and the catheter will be removed in a similar fashion as routine drain removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of postoperative pain using Visual analogue scale (VAS) 1 hour, 2 hours, 4&#xD;
           hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, day 1, day 2 and day 3 post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced expiratory volumes using a peak flow meter immediately pre-operatively in the&#xD;
           anaesthesia room and 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, day 1, day 2 and day 3&#xD;
           postoperatively (best of 3 attempts for each measurement will be used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue assessment will be done using the Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale (ICFS)&#xD;
           pre-operatively and on day 1, 2 and 3, 7, 30 and 60 postoperatively respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Glucose, cytokines and local anaesthetic level at 8, 20, 48, 72 hours post op.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP, Albumin at 20, 48 and 72 hours post op.&#xD;
