      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about a new therapy device called the&#xD;
      Visualase® Thermal Therapy System (a device that uses a laser to kill tumor cells and is&#xD;
      guided using magnetic resonance thermal imaging [MRTI]). The Visualase® Thermal Therapy&#xD;
      System is used to treat metastatic brain tumors. Researchers want to find out if it is&#xD;
      possible to use this new device in patients with metastatic brain tumor(s), each measuring 3&#xD;
      centimeters (cm) or smaller. The safety of the device will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Device and Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Visualase® Thermal Therapy System combines 3 FDA-approved devices: the Visualase Cooled&#xD;
      Laser Application System, which delivers the laser (energy) beams to the tumor tissue; the&#xD;
      PhoTex 15 Diode Laser Series, which is the laser itself; and the Visualase ENVISION&#xD;
      Workstation, which is the computer system that helps the surgeon plan and monitor your&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Visualase® Thermal Therapy System will be used in this study to give patients a type of&#xD;
      therapy called Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT). LITT uses laser light to heat and&#xD;
      destroy the affected tissue; this is sometimes referred to as tissue ablation. In LITT, small&#xD;
      fiber-optic applicators are placed directly into the tumor and heating is performed from the&#xD;
      inside out, which may lead to the destruction of the tumor. During the heating process, MRTI&#xD;
      can be used to watch the temperatures around the applicator to make sure that the tumor&#xD;
      receives enough treatment and that the normal tissues around the tumor do not get too hot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LITT is less invasive than an open surgical procedure. There are no radiation-related side&#xD;
      effects, or limits on the number of times it can be repeated. Also, since the procedure is&#xD;
      performed using the MRTI, doctors can find out right away how effective the therapy was by&#xD;
      using special imaging sequences, which may also show any surviving tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can enroll on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the doctor&#xD;
      decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed within 14 days before your treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded, and you will be asked questions about any other&#xD;
           treatment you have had for the metastatic brain tumor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam. This will include an exam of the function of the&#xD;
           nerves in your head, an exam of your visual fields, and tests of your reflexes, muscle&#xD;
           strength, and senses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI scan of your brain within 30 days before LITT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 48&#xD;
           hours (2 days) before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will be scheduled for&#xD;
      treatment of the brain tumor(s) using the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be brought to a special operating room called the BrainSUITE®. The BrainSUITE® is a&#xD;
      regular operating room that has a built-in MRI machine that can be used for taking pictures&#xD;
      during the surgery. The imaging and procedure will be performed while you are under&#xD;
      anesthesia (either deep sedation or fully &quot;asleep&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard tumor biopsy will be performed. Then, using the same needle holder, the laser&#xD;
      applicator will be placed within the tumor. MRI scans will be taken to make sure the&#xD;
      applicator is placed properly. The biopsy and applicator placement will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, the laser treatment will be performed. At the same time, MRI scans will be taken&#xD;
      during the procedure. The treatment will last between 5 and 10 minutes. After treatment,&#xD;
      follow-up MRI scans will be taken, which may take 30-60 minutes longer. If any tumor tissue&#xD;
      is left over, the laser may be moved slightly and a second treatment performed. Once&#xD;
      completed, the needle will be removed, and your incision will be closed in the standard way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tumor biopsy results reveal that the tumor has not come back, LITT will not be&#xD;
      performed. Other treatment options which are available to you will be discussed with your&#xD;
      doctor prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the laser treatment, you will be observed in the hospital for 24 hours. While you are&#xD;
      in the hospital, at about 1 day after treatment, you will have a physical and neurological&#xD;
      exam, as well as a computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain (without using a contrast dye&#xD;
      injected in the bloodstream) to make sure there were no problems with treatment. This is&#xD;
      standard after any biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be seen by your doctor for follow-up testing at about 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and&#xD;
      6 months after your treatment. It will be very important for you to return to see your doctor&#xD;
      at your scheduled visits, even if you are feeling fine. At the follow-up visits, your doctor&#xD;
      will perform a complete physical and neurological exam. You will also have an MRI at all&#xD;
      visits, starting with the 1-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Each part of the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System is FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in delivering LITT to patients. Up to 22 patients will take part in this&#xD;
      clinical research study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
