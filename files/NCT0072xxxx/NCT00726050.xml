      This study will use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS (magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation to the brain), to examine how the brain distinguishes between two signals that&#xD;
      are spaced very closely in time. The ability to tell the difference between sensory signals&#xD;
      is important to understanding sensory input. Understanding how this works may help to develop&#xD;
      new treatments for sensory deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      undergo the following procedures during three visits to the NIH Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS - all visits (sham rTMS on one visit) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current passed through the coil&#xD;
      creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may&#xD;
      be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta burst stimulation (TBS) - all visits (sham TBS on one visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same as TMS, but brief pulses of electrical current are passed through the coil. Subjects&#xD;
      undergo intermittent TBS on one visit and continuous TBS on another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) - all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEP tests how sensory information travels along the nerves to the spinal cord and brain. A&#xD;
      small metal disk electrode placed on an arm delivers a small electrical shock. Electrodes&#xD;
      placed on the scalp record how the impulse travels over the nerve pathways to the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex of the brain. EEG (see below) records what sensory information the brain is detecting&#xD;
      and processing. Paired-pulse SEP is done before and after TBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal discrimination threshold - all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test investigates the brain's ability to discriminate sensory information. Electrodes&#xD;
      are placed on the subject's wrist. Two electrical pulses are delivered to the nerve at the&#xD;
      wrist at different spaced intervals to determine when the subject feels the two pulses are&#xD;
      fused into one. This test is done before and after TBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) - all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test records brain waves (electrical activity of the brain). Electrodes are placed on&#xD;
      the scalp with an electrode cap. The spaces between the electrodes and the scalp are filled&#xD;
      with a gel that conducts electrical activity.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to discriminate successive signals separated by time intervals in the&#xD;
      millisecond-range is an important element in analyzing the temporal characteristics of&#xD;
      sensory input. When two identical stimuli are presented with a sufficient time interval&#xD;
      between them, they are readily perceived as being two separate events. As they are presented&#xD;
      progressively closer together, there comes a point when the two separate stimuli are&#xD;
      perceived as one. However, the neural mechanism of temporal discrimination is unclear.&#xD;
      Therefore, our major objective is to analyze, in detail, the effect of cortical excitability&#xD;
      and inhibition on temporal sensory discrimination in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 25 adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming the cortical circuit in the somatosensory area plays an important role in temporal&#xD;
      discrimination, we plan to investigate the relationship between cortical excitability and the&#xD;
      ability of temporal discrimination. We hypothesize that the extent of cortical excitability&#xD;
      affects the ability to discriminate. Cortical excitability will be modulated by using&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Comparison of cortical excitability&#xD;
      changes will be determined before and after rTMS in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI).&#xD;
      The change in cortical information processing in SI will be studied using multi-channel&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) recording of paired-pulse somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs)&#xD;
      delivered at rest. Activity assessment in the cortical circuit will be measured by the&#xD;
      recovery curve of the amplitude of paired-pulse SEPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the change in amplitude of the paired-pulse SEP component&#xD;
      (P27) in 5-ms interstimulus interval condition for three types of rTMS. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      will be the amplitude of paired-pulse SEP components during other interstimulus interval&#xD;
      conditions (10 to 200 ms).&#xD;
