  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose of lenalidomide and&#xD;
      RAD001 that can be given without causing too many serious side effects. Another goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to look at how the participants cancer may respond to the study treatment.&#xD;
      Additionally, we wish to learn more about how the body breaks down and gets rid of the study&#xD;
      drugs. We will also try to find substances in the blood (biomarkers) that may help predict&#xD;
      how myeloma will respond to study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Researchers are looking for the highest doses of RAD001 and lenalidomide used in&#xD;
           combination that can be given safely so small groups of people will be enrolled in steps&#xD;
           in this trial. The first group will be given a certain dose of RAD001 and a certain dose&#xD;
           of lenalidomide. If they have few or manageable side effects, the next small group of&#xD;
           people will be enrolled with a higher dose of RAD001 and/or a higher dose of&#xD;
           lenalidomide. This will continue until the highest dose of the drugs used is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment will be given in 28 day cycles. Both RAD001 and lenalidomide are pills&#xD;
           that are taken orally. Both drugs will be started on the same day. RAD001 will be taken&#xD;
           either every other day or every day for the first 3 weeks (days 1-21) of each 28-day&#xD;
           cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily for the first 3 weeks (days 1-21) of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to the clinic weekly during the first cycle to monitor side&#xD;
           effects. The following will be performed at these clinic visits: physical examination,&#xD;
           medical history update, questionnaires, and blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On cycles 2-8, participants will come to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle. The&#xD;
           following will be performed at this clinic visit: physical examination, medical history&#xD;
           update, questionnaire, and blood word.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of cycle 8, a skeletal survey, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be&#xD;
           performed to check response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may continue to receive RAD001 and lenalidomide beyond 8 cycles if their&#xD;
           cancer does not get worse and they do not have unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
