  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that is primarily caused by&#xD;
      cigarette smoking. The breakdown of elastin, a protein found in the lungs, can cause lung&#xD;
      damage and may contribute to the development of COPD. Some people may be more prone to&#xD;
      elastin damage and in turn to developing COPD than others. This study will examine whether&#xD;
      genetic factors are responsible for altering elastin function and increasing the risk of&#xD;
      developing COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a disease in which the lung airways are damaged and partly obstructed, making it&#xD;
      difficult to breathe. There is no cure for this disease, and it is the fourth leading cause&#xD;
      of death in the United States. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. The most common risk factor for developing COPD is&#xD;
      cigarette smoking; however, only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with COPD in their&#xD;
      lifetimes, suggesting that some smokers are more prone to developing COPD than others.&#xD;
      Elastin, a protein found in the tissues surrounding the lung airways and in the alveolar&#xD;
      walls of the lung, is essential for healthy lung function. As elastin breaks down, lung&#xD;
      damage can occur, potentially leading to COPD. It is thought that some people may be&#xD;
      genetically predisposed to elastin damage by cigarette smoke, thus accounting for the select&#xD;
      group of smokers affected by COPD. This study will examine the ways in which elastin defects&#xD;
      contribute to the development of COPD. Researchers will examine whether genetic variations&#xD;
      play a role in altering elastin function and in influencing health outcomes in people with&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with COPD that was caused by emphysema. Participants will&#xD;
      complete one study visit that will include a medical record and history review and blood&#xD;
      collection (or saliva collection, if blood draw is unsuccessful). A portion of blood will be&#xD;
      stored for future genetic research. Participants will also complete questionnaires to collect&#xD;
      information on activities, health, and quality of life. Study researchers will contact&#xD;
      participants at the end of the study to collect follow-up medical information.&#xD;
