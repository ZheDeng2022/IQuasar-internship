    <textblock>
      The problem of cocaine dependence remains a major medical, social, and legal concern. Several&#xD;
      studies have suggested that disulfiram may be beneficial for the treatment of cocaine&#xD;
      dependence. A common assumption has been that disulfiram treatment, by increasing DA&#xD;
      availability, enhances the aversive aspects of stimulants. This study aims to measure plasma&#xD;
      activity in those with the C/C DBH genotype, which is associated with higher DBH activity&#xD;
      subsequently making the disulfiram treatment more effective, as well as determine the effects&#xD;
      of treatment with disulfiram on cocaine self-administration using a human laboratory model of&#xD;
      cocaine self-administration.&#xD;

             using cocaine by the smoked or IV route. Participants must report at least weekly use&#xD;
             for the past month and have a cocaine-positive urine test in the week of study entry;&#xD;
             3. Have vital signs after a 48 hours washout period as follows: resting pulse between&#xD;
             50 and 80 bpm, blood pressures between 105-130mm Hg systolic and 45-80mm Hg diastolic;&#xD;
             4. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%)&#xD;
             limits with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT,&#xD;
             AST, and alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function&#xD;
             tests (creatinine and BUN) &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal; 5. Have a baseline ECG&#xD;
             that demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, normal conduction, and no clinically&#xD;
             significant arrhythmias; and 6. Have a medical history and standard physical&#xD;
             examination demonstrating no clinically significant contraindications for study&#xD;
             participation, in the judgment of the admitting physician and the principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             previous medically adverse reaction to cocaine, including loss of consciousness, chest&#xD;
             pain, or epileptic seizure; 3. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  psychosis, bipolar illness or major depression as assessed by MINI (or SCID if&#xD;
                  necessary);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  organic brain disease or dementia assessed by clinical interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of any psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing treatment or&#xD;
                  which would make study compliance difficult;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of suicide attempts within the past three months assessed by MINI and/or&#xD;
                  current suicidal ideation/plan as assessed by MINI; 4. Have evidence of&#xD;
                  clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined by the PI; 5.&#xD;
                  Have a family history in first degree relatives of early cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;

                  asthma, chronic coughing and wheezing, or other respiratory illnesses; 9. Heavy&#xD;
                  current alcohol intake that is likely to lead to withdrawal symptoms, in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the PI; 10. Refuse to abstain from alcohol during the protocol and for&#xD;
