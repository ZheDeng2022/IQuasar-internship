      Rationale: Whole breast irradiation with 50 Gy after lumpectomy has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      local recurrence rate with a factor 3 to 4. An additional boost of 16 Gy to the tumorbed has&#xD;
      been shown to improve the local control rate even further. However, this boost dose appears&#xD;
      to reduce not only the local recurrences in the tumorbed, but also elsewhere in the breast,&#xD;
      suggesting that the boost may not always be delivered at the correct region. In addition,&#xD;
      even with the boost dose of 16 Gy, the local recurrence rate in young patients is still quite&#xD;
      high - with the majority of recurrences in the tumorbed. Consequently, further improvement of&#xD;
      the local control, especially in young women, is still an important aim to pursue, in order&#xD;
      to maintain breast conserving therapy (BCT) as an acceptable treatment option in young women.&#xD;
      One way to improve local control may be to increase the dose [Young Boost Trial], but also to&#xD;
      improve the definition of the tumorbed, i.e. the target volume for boost irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of incorporating a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT-thorax in the target volume delineation process on 1) the coverage&#xD;
      of the tumorbed by the 85% isodose, 2) the size of the irradiated boost volumes, and 3) the&#xD;
      interobserver variation in target volume delineation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A CE-CT scan of the thorax will be made prior to surgery, with the patient in&#xD;
      radiation treatment position. After breast conserving surgery, patients will be referred for&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy according to the standard guidelines. Prior to radiotherapy, a&#xD;
      standard CT thorax scan will be made for treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planning target volume (PTV) for the boost will be delineated according to the MAASTRO&#xD;
      protocol, by three independent observers (PTV-1A-C), using the planning CT only. Delineation&#xD;
      of the boost will be repeated after 3D registration of the pre-operative CT scan with the&#xD;
      planning CT-scan (PTV-2A-C). Thereafter, consensus will be obtained for the PTV-1A-C and the&#xD;
      PTV-2A-C, resulting in one PTV-1 and one PTV-2 for each patient. Radiation treatment plans&#xD;
      (RT-plans) will subsequently be designed for PTV-1 and PTV-2. Coverage of the treatment plans&#xD;
      by the 85% isodose for both PTV-1- and PTV-2, and the irradiated volumes (percentage of the&#xD;
      volume receiving 95% or more (V95)) will be calculated. Patients will be treated with the&#xD;
      treatment plan for PTV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 60 breast cancer patients, to be treated with BCT, with a mass visible on&#xD;
      mammography and/or ultrasound &gt; 0.5 cm, without contraindications for a CE-CT-thorax scan&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: &lt; 3 weeks prior to lumpectomy a CE-CT-thorax scan will be made of the entire&#xD;
      thorax, with the patient in the same position as planned during the post-operative&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Intravenous contrast will be given according to the standard thorax protocol of&#xD;
      MAASTRO clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The percentage of the PTV-2 receiving &lt; 85% of the dose, if treated with the RT-plan for&#xD;
           PTV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Difference in V95 for the RT-plan designed for PTV-1- versus for PTV-2. Other endpoints&#xD;
           will be interobserver variation, as measured by 1) percent volume overlap; 2) difference&#xD;
           in standard deviation of the average PTV-1 and PTV-2; 3) center of mass assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients will only be included after written informed consent. The preoperative&#xD;
      CE-CT-thorax-scan yields little additional radiation exposure, which will however be&#xD;
      negligible compared to the radiation treatment to be given because of the breast cancer. In&#xD;
      addition, there is a small risk on an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast, and on&#xD;
      renal complications. Therefore, renal function will be checked prior to giving contrast. A&#xD;
      kreatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min will be a contra-indication for contrast. The pre-operative&#xD;
      CT-scan will be made in MAASTRO clinic, requiring an additional visit to MAASTRO clinic. A&#xD;
      possible benefit may be that the pre-operative CE-CT thorax may improve the definition of the&#xD;
      target volume, and thereby reduce the risk on a local recurrence.&#xD;
