  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the effect of chemotherapy on decreasing the size of&#xD;
      unresectable pancreas cancer thereby allowing it to be surgically removed. In addition, this&#xD;
      study may provide information on how tumors behave when exposed to certain types of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although surgery is the only curative modality for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the majority of&#xD;
      patients (~80%)are unresectable at presentation. The use of a multimodality approach may be a&#xD;
      crucial method to improve the dismal survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. A&#xD;
      logical tactic is to use neoadjuvant cytotoxic agents and targeted drugs to facilitate&#xD;
      resectability.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
             Patients with endocrine tumors or lymphoma of the pancreas are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have locally advanced disease that is considered to be &quot;borderline&quot;&#xD;
             surgically resectable (see Section 4.0). Patients with metastatic disease or grossly&#xD;
             resectable disease on presentation are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease prior to starting this study. Patients with&#xD;
             primarily non-measurable disease, including lesions to small to be characterized,&#xD;
             effusions, ascites, diffuse bone disease, diffuse skin disease, leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease, lymphangitis, pneumonitis or disease measured by indirect or biochemical&#xD;
             means, are not eligible. Testing for measurable disease must have been completed 28&#xD;
             days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to utilization of tissue for research in this protocol. Tissue&#xD;
             will be evaluated via immunohistochemical staining for deoxycytidine kinase, ERCC-1&#xD;
             and ERCC-2 (XPD). Patients may be asked if they are willing to allow their tissue to&#xD;
             be used for future studies that are not defined in this protocol. Disallowing the use&#xD;
             of tissue for future studies does not limit eligibility in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must fulfill the required initial laboratory data to be obtained within 28&#xD;
             days prior to registration: AGC ≥ 1,500cells/μL, Platelet ≥ 100,000cells/μL, Hgb &gt; 8.0&#xD;
             g/dl, Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 X IULN, Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dL, AST(SGOT) ≤ 2.5x IULN,&#xD;
             ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5x IULN, CA19-9 (any value),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to read and understand English in order to participate in this&#xD;
             study, or have a certified translator present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the potentially harmful effects of chemotherapy on a developing fetus, patients&#xD;
             who are pregnant are planning to become pregnant, or who are lactating should not&#xD;
             participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective&#xD;
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign, date and give written consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be18 years of age or older to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are ineligible. Brain imaging studies are not&#xD;
             required for eligible patients with no neurologic signs or symptoms. If brain imaging&#xD;
             studies are performed, they must be negative for disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior surgery for their pancreatic carcinoma are not eligible&#xD;
             for this study. This does not include patients who have had cytologic brushing, fine&#xD;
             needle aspiration or core biopsy of their tumor for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy,&#xD;
             surgery, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior erlotinib or other therapies that target EGFR.&#xD;
             Patients must not have received prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, unstable angina or uncontrolled congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a significant history of intersitital lung disease&#xD;

             mononeuropathy multiplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have temperature &gt;101.30 F or active infection&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  There must be no other plans for the patient to receive concurrent chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy for the&#xD;
             treatment of their cancer while on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the undetermined effect of chemotherapy in patients with HIV infection and the&#xD;
             potential for serious interaction with anti-HIV medications, patients who are known to&#xD;
             be infected with HIV are not eligible for this study. An HIV test is not required to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
