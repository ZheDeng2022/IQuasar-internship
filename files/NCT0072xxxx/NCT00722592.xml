    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS), based upon&#xD;
      investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.0&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.0) and clinical findings, in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer&#xD;
      who receive combination therapy with vintafolide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      (PLD/Doxil®/Caelyx®) with that in subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who receive&#xD;
      PLD alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      vintafolide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as&#xD;
      Doxil® and outside the United States as Caelyx®) compared to PLD alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate&#xD;
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on&#xD;
      virtually all ovarian cancers. Early clinical evidence in a small number of Phase I subjects&#xD;
      and in a subset of subjects in an on-going single-arm Phase II study suggests that&#xD;
      vintafolide may have antitumor effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is&#xD;
      generally well-tolerated. This evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as&#xD;
      chemotherapy against advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at centers with EC20 imaging capability will also undergo imaging with the folate&#xD;
      receptor (FR-)targeting investigational diagnostic agent EC20 during the screening period to&#xD;
      assess uptake of this agent into tumors. This non-invasive procedure will provide additional&#xD;
      information on the utility of EC20 imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular&#xD;
      &quot;target&quot; before treatment with vintafolide therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) equal to or greater than&#xD;
&#xD;
        the institutional lower limit of normal. LVEF must be elevated within 90 days prior to&#xD;

               1. Have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of the therapeutic&#xD;
                  regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Practice an effective method of birth control (e.g., oral, transdermal or&#xD;
                  injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device, double-barrier contraception,&#xD;
                  such as diaphragm and spermicidal jelly) for the duration of their participation&#xD;

        The presence of any of the following will exclude the subject from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of tumor of low-malignant potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to PLD or anthracycline therapy&#xD;

             marrow, or prior radiation therapy within the past 3 years to the breast/sternum,&#xD;
             dermal lesions, head or neck&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (i.e., ≤ 6 weeks) history of abdominal surgery or peritonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious comorbidities (as determined by the investigator) such as, but not limited to,&#xD;
             active congestive heart failure or recent myocardial infarction. Subjects who require&#xD;
             antifolate therapy for the management of comorbid conditions (e.g., rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis) will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent malignancy or history of other cancer (except noninvasive skin cancer)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy&#xD;
             that is considered to be investigational (i.e., used for non-approved indications(s)&#xD;
             and in the context of a research investigation). Use of low dose corticosteroid&#xD;
             therapy (for nausea prophylaxis, etc) is acceptable; however, concomitant tamoxifen&#xD;
             therapy is not. Supportive care measures are allowed.&#xD;
