  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granuloma annulare is a benign, usually self-limiting, cutaneous dermatosis, which typically&#xD;
      presents as asymptomatic, flesh-colored or red papules, frequently arranged in an annular&#xD;
      pattern on the distal extremities. Although localized granuloma annulare is most commonly&#xD;
      observed, a generalized or disseminated form can occur. The etiology of granuloma annulare is&#xD;
      unknown, however, multiple inciting factors have been proposed. The purpose of the&#xD;
      investigators is to review the outcomes of treatment of granuloma annulare (GA) resistant to&#xD;
      standard regimens that resolved after a 3-months treatment course of monthly rifampin,&#xD;
      ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy, successfully used to treat paucibacillary leprosy,&#xD;
      a disease with clinical and histopathologic similarity to GA.&#xD;

      We will document the regimen treatment each patient has had and then review the following&#xD;
      from the patient's chart to target our specific aims as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What previous treatment options have been or/are currently being used?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How long did the patient take the treatment for?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Was the patient able to discontinue or become less dependent on prior treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Was the disease process slowed by the treatment?;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Were there any side effects that the patient experienced with treatment?&#xD;

        The investigators reported 6 cases of resistant GA that resolved after a 3-month treatment&#xD;
        course of monthly rifampin, ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy. ROM therapy has been&#xD;
        successfully used to treat patients with paucibacillary leprosy, which has morphologic and&#xD;
        histologic similarities to GA.&#xD;
