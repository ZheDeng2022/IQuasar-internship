    <textblock>
      We have observed that vitamin D deficiency, as evidenced by low serum 25(OH)D concentrations,&#xD;
      is common in children and adolescents with HIV infection. To determine whether vitamin D and&#xD;
      calcium supplementation improve bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children and adolescents, we propose a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial comparing supplementation with oral vitamin D and calcium to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on bone mineral accrual in&#xD;
           HIV-infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that BMC and BMD will increase to a greater extent in HIV-infected&#xD;
           children who receive supplementation with vitamin D and calcium. This hypothesis will be&#xD;
           tested by comparing changes in BMC and BMD, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
           (DXA), after one and two years of treatment in HIV-infected children and adolescents&#xD;
           receiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation compared to those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of HIV infection and vitamin D and calcium supplementation on&#xD;
           indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone formation and&#xD;
           resorption will return toward normal in HIV-infected children and adolescents who are&#xD;
           randomized to receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation. We will test these&#xD;
           hypotheses by comparing longitudinal changes in indices of mineral metabolism and bone&#xD;
           turnover markers in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and&#xD;
           calcium supplement versus those receiving placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate if vitamin D stores are a determinant of bone mass in HIV infected children and&#xD;
           adolescents receiving HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that vitamin D stores, as assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, are an&#xD;
      important determinant of bone mass in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.&#xD;
      We will test this hypothesis by evaluating whether measurements of bone mass are associated&#xD;
      with vitamin D stores, as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and other indices of&#xD;
      mineral metabolism, in treated HAART-treated HIV-infected children and adolescents.&#xD;

      A.1.a. Introduction This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of 24 months of supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium on bone&#xD;
      mass accrual in HIV-infected children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.1.b. Subject recruitment i. HIV-infected subjects on will be enrolled by Co-Investigators&#xD;
      from among HIV-infected children and adolescents who receive treatment at participating sites&#xD;
      who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.1.c. Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for measurement of serum 25(OH)D levels will be obtained from all HIV-infected children&#xD;
      and adolescents by the participating clinical sites. Samples will be analyzed and the results&#xD;
      known in advance of the cross-sectional study visit. Serum 25(OH)D levels will be used to&#xD;
      select participants. The following measures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history, including medications Pregnancy test for females of child bearing capacity&#xD;
      Height and weight Assessment of pubertal stage Assessment of dietary intake of calcium and&#xD;
      vitamin D Assessment of physical activity Determination of total body bone mineral content&#xD;
      (TBBMC), total body bone mineral density (TBBBMD), spinal BMC and BMD, and bone age&#xD;
      radiograph Fasting morning blood draw for indices of mineral metabolism: serum calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate, albumin, total alkaline phosphatase activity, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, iPTH, urinary&#xD;
      calcium and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of bone turnover: Serum N-telopeptide (N-tx, a marker of resorption), bone specific&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and osteocalcin (markers of formation) These measures will be&#xD;
      performed in the SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.2.a. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double-blind, randomized trial will compare the effect of 24 months of supplementation&#xD;
      with vitamin D3 and calcium to placebo on bone mineral accrual. Sixty HIV-infected children&#xD;
      and adolescents, aged 8-16, will be randomized to receive vitamin D3 plus calcium or placebo.&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables, BMC and BMD, will be measured before, and 1 and 2 years after&#xD;
      randomization. Serial measurements of serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, markers of bone&#xD;
      turnover will be assessed before and at defined intervals during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.2.b. Treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be assigned by randomization to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vitamin D3 (100,000 IU or 2.5 mg) administered orally every 60 days and elemental&#xD;
           calcium 500 mg twice daily; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vitamin D3 placebo administered orally every 60 days plus calcium placebo twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.2.c. Entry and randomization visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All eligible subjects will have the initial study entry evaluation performed at the&#xD;
           SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit by virtue of their participation in the&#xD;
           cross-sectional study (Section D.2.f). As the qualifying serum 25(OH)D level will be&#xD;
           known prior to the cross-sectional study visit, study participants eligible for the&#xD;
           randomized clinical trial can be randomly assigned (see Methods) during the&#xD;
           cross-sectional study visit to one of the two treatment arms; in such cases, the&#xD;
           cross-sectional visit will also function as the entry/baseline visit. Each subject will&#xD;
           be given the first dose of vitamin D3/placebo and the first 30 day supply of&#xD;
           calcium/placebo will be dispensed. females of child bearing capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.2.d. Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be seen monthly during the first year of the study and every two&#xD;
           months during the second year. Entry/baseline, 12-month and 24-month visits will take&#xD;
           place at the SLRHC Body Composition Unit. All other visits will take place at the site&#xD;
           where usual care is received. Vitamin D3/placebo will be administered during study&#xD;
           visits every 2 months. At monthly visits during the first year and every 2 months during&#xD;
           the second year after randomization, a 30 or 60 day supply of calcium/placebo will be&#xD;
           dispensed. Adherence to calcium supplementation will be assessed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.2.e. 12 and 24 month study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           These visits will take place at the SLRHC Body Composition Unit. At each visit, the&#xD;
           following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical history, including medications Pregnancy test for females of child bearing&#xD;
           capacity Height and weight Assessment of pubertal stage Assessment of dietary intake of&#xD;
           calcium and vitamin D Assessment of physical activity Determination of TBBMC, TBBBMD,&#xD;
           spinal BMC and BMD Bone age radiograph&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.a. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization of HIV-infected children to treatment arms will be performed by&#xD;
           computer-generated random numbers (SAS version 8.2 for Windows, SAS Institute, Cary,&#xD;
           NC). Randomization will stratify by sex and age (e.g., &gt; or &lt; 14 years) in order to&#xD;
           ensure that treatment groups are balanced with respect to these variables. Block&#xD;
           randomization will be used to ensure that the number of subjects in each arm remains&#xD;
           approximately similar over time. A randomization sequence will be generated by the study&#xD;
           biostatistician and communicated to the research pharmacist who will dispense active or&#xD;
           placebo medication as subjects are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.b. Adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adherence to calcium/placebo will be assessed at each visit through pill counts and use&#xD;
           of blister packages. Adherence to vitamin D/placebo will be ensured by supervised&#xD;
           administration during defined study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.c. Measurement of bone mineral status in children and adolescents:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bone mineral status in HIV-infected subjects will be determined by whole body and lumbar&#xD;
           spine DXA scans. These will be performed at the SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit&#xD;
           using the Hologic Delphi-A Scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of bone mineral content in grams by DXA correlates well with total body&#xD;
           calcium (Ellis 1996). To date, this laboratory has provided bone mineral and body&#xD;
           composition data using DXA in more than 13,000 subjects for more than 50 research&#xD;
           projects and clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cv for bone mineral density in human subjects in our laboratory is 0.8%. The Hologic&#xD;
           Delphi&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.4.d. Assessment of skeletal age:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skeletal age will be determined by standardized bone age radiographs of the left wrist&#xD;
           which will be performed at the SL site Department of Radiology on the same day as the&#xD;
           DXA scans. The sex-specific standards for bone age using plain films of the hand and&#xD;
           wrist from the Atlas of Greulich and Pyle will be used as the standard reference&#xD;
           (Greulich and Pyle 1959). A single pediatric radiologist, who will be blinded to the age&#xD;
           and treatment status of the subjects, will read all bone age radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up bone age radiographs will not be performed on subjects found on entry to have&#xD;
           achieved skeletal maturity (i.e. epiphyseal fusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maturation has profound effects on bone mineral accrual. Prior to the appearance of the&#xD;
           physical signs of puberty the only available method of assessing relative maturity or&#xD;
           &quot;biological age&quot; is to measure skeletal or &quot;bone age&quot; by standardized x-rays. Skeletal&#xD;
           age continues to be of use, even after the appearance of the physical signs of puberty,&#xD;
           because the rate of progression of bone maturation with puberty varies between&#xD;
           individuals. It is particularly variable in children with chronic disease whose general&#xD;
           health status and rates of growth and pubertal progress may &quot;catch-up&quot; or &quot;catch-down&quot;&#xD;
           in response to changes in treatment or in disease activity. In children with chronic&#xD;
           disease, bone age may be a better indicator of maturational status than chronological&#xD;
           age, size, or pubertal stage. Bone age therefore an important co-variate in this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.e. Assessment of pubertal status:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized physical examination performed by study investigators (Drs. Stephen Arpadi&#xD;
           and Mary Horlick) after explanation of the procedure and rationale to subjects and&#xD;
           family members to determined the level of sexual maturation. These will be performed&#xD;
           during study visits to the SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit using the method of&#xD;
           Tanner (Tanner 1970, Tanner 1971). Repeat assessments will not be performed on subjects&#xD;
           determined on entry to have experienced sexual maturation (i.e. Tanner Stage 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because of the normal wide variability in timing and pace of puberty, standardized&#xD;
           serial assessment of pubertal status of study participants will be performed to help&#xD;
           distinguish between the effects of puberty and the effects of study treatments,&#xD;
           increased age, height and weight on bone mineral accrual. Measurement of this variable&#xD;
           is potentially of great importance in studies of children with chronic illnesses such as&#xD;
           HIV-infection where delays in sexual maturation are common (de Martino 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in bone mineral mass by DXA at the time of puberty and its accompanying growth&#xD;
           spurt have been reported in both males and females (Glastre 1990, Gilsanz 1991, Rico&#xD;
           1993, Mora 1999). However, the reference standards generated by DXA manufacturers and&#xD;
           recent longitudinal studies are age- and sex-specific only (Bachrach 1999). Reference&#xD;
           standards based on age or puberty only are not helpful in evaluating patients with&#xD;
           disorders, such as HIV infection, which affect growth, timing of puberty, and may&#xD;
           independently affect bone mineral acquisition (Leonard 1999, Thearle 2000, Arpadi 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.f. Procedure for assessment of pubertal status:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The evaluation of puberty in this project will follow exactly the protocol of the BMDCS&#xD;
           project. The impact of pubertal stage on bone mineral accrual will be explained to all&#xD;
           participants at the entry study visit, so that they and their families will understand&#xD;
           the purpose of the physical examination for pubertal status. The pediatric&#xD;
           endocrinologist (MH), following the protocol established for the multicenter BMDCS&#xD;
           project, will evaluate pubertal stage. For girls, breast development will be assessed by&#xD;
           visual criteria, but also by palpation in the earliest stages of puberty (Marshall and&#xD;
           Tanner 1971, Biro 1992). For boys, testicular size will be assessed using the ovoids of&#xD;
           the Prader orchidometer (Zachman 1974, Biro 1995). For both boys and girls, pubic hair&#xD;
           development will be assessed by the criteria of Tanner (Marshall and Tanner 1970, 1971).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.g. Procedure for measuring height and weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standing height will be measured to the nearest 0.1cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer&#xD;
           (Holtain, Crosswell, Wales). Three separate measurements will be obtained at each time&#xD;
           point specified and the results averaged. Weight will be obtained with subjects in&#xD;
           hospital gown and measured to the nearest 0.1 kg (Weight Tronix, New York, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.h. Assessment of modifiable behavioral factors that influence bone mineral accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will use a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for dietary data collection to provide&#xD;
           an estimate of nutritional intake for this study. The availability of standardized&#xD;
           information on dietary intake also will permit investigation of the relation between&#xD;
           food/nutrient intake and bone accretion during growth in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weight-bearing physical activity will be determined using the published self-report tool&#xD;
           of Slemenda et al (1991). Although several studies support the validity of measures of&#xD;
           children's self-reports of physical activity, only Slemenda's study reported the use of&#xD;
           self-report of childhood weight-bearing physical activity (Sallis 1993, Slemenda 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.i. Procedures for dietary intake and physical activity questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following the protocol established for the multicenter BMDCS project, subjects will&#xD;
           complete a FFQ (with the help of their parent or guardian if they are under 14 years).&#xD;
           The questionnaire will take about 20 minutes and will be completed at the time of the&#xD;
           visit. A picture containing various serving sizes will be included with each FFQ.&#xD;
           Subjects are asked to indicate which picture best matches their serving size. Subjects&#xD;
           will be reminded to indicate how much they usually ate - not how much was served.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will be administered a questionnaire asking them to recall the number&#xD;
           of hours during the past week that they were involved in each of several physical&#xD;
           activities. The investigator will prompt the participants to recall their activity as&#xD;
           accurately as possible. The child may ask the parent to help. About ten minutes is&#xD;
           needed to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The FFQ, BLOCKIDS (NutritionQuest, University of Berkeley, Berkeley, CA), is comprised&#xD;
           of foods identified by NHANES III as important for this age and demographic group. Of&#xD;
           relevance to this project, measurements include dietary intake of Vitamin D and calcium.&#xD;
           The FFQ has been validated in African American children ages 8-10 years (Block 2000) for&#xD;
           some macro and micronutrients (e.g. correlation for calcium = 0.64). Additional&#xD;
           validation studies are planned as part of the BMDHC project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3..j. Procedures for biochemical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           General laboratory tests will be performed in the clinical chemistry laboratories of&#xD;
           study sites including CBCs, lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8), HIV viral load, renal and&#xD;
           liver function tests. Sera for specialized biochemistries (PTH, vitamin D metabolites,&#xD;
           OC, BSAP, NTx) is aliquoted, frozen immediately after collection, and transferred to&#xD;
           SLRHC where they will be stored at -70 degrees. The frozen samples will be analyzed in&#xD;
           the Core laboratory of the Irving Center for Clinical Research at Columbia University.&#xD;
           All samples from individual subjects will be analyzed in batches in the same assay to&#xD;
           reduce inter-assay variability. All of the planned assays are currently in place in the&#xD;
           Core Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum: Kits for intact PTH, vitamin D metabolites, and osteocalcin will be purchased&#xD;
           from Corning-Nichols Laboratory (San Juan Capistrano, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parathyroid hormone: PTH is currently being measured by a chemiluminescent method that&#xD;
           is now known to detect the 7-84 fragment of PTH as well as the intact form (1-84)of the&#xD;
           molecule (72). Intra-assay and inter-assay variability are 3.4% and 5.6% respectively.&#xD;
           The normal adult range for this assay is 10-65 pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitamin D metabolites: After extraction of serum samples, 25OHD will be measured in a&#xD;
           radio-binding assay. The intra-assay and inter-assay variability are 7.5% and 9.6%&#xD;
           respectively. The normal range is 9-52 ng/ml. Serum 1,25(OH)2D will be assayed in a&#xD;
           radioreceptor assay. The normal adult range is 15-60 pg/ml. The intra-assay and&#xD;
           inter-assay variability are 7.6% and 9.8% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Osteocalcin: Osteocalcin is measured by RIA according to the method of Gundberg et al.&#xD;
           The intra-assay and inter-assay variability are 4.3% and 5.7% respectively. The normal&#xD;
           range is 3.4-11.7 ng/ml for adult men, 2.4-10.0 ng/ml for adult premenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP): BSAP is measured by a solid phase, two-site&#xD;
           immunoradiometric assay that specifically measures the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase in serum. Kits are purchased from Hybritech Incorporated (San Diego, CA).&#xD;
           The intra-assay and inter-assay variability are 4.2% and 7.2% respectively. The normal&#xD;
           range is 8.0 - 16.6 ng/ml for adult women and 7.2 - 15.8 ng/ml for adult men.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum N-telopeptide (Osteomark, Ostex, Seattle, WA) is measured using a&#xD;
           competitive-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that utilizes microwells as the&#xD;
           solid phase onto which NTx has been adsorbed. Assay values are reported in nmoles Bone&#xD;
           Collagen Equivalents (BCE) per liter. The normal range is 6.2 - 19.0 in adult women and&#xD;
           5.4 to 24.2 in adult men. The intra-assay and inter-assay variability are 4.6% and 6.9%&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.l. Immunologic and virologic measures of HIV disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
           CD-4 +lymphocyte number and CD4% values for subjects will be obtain from results&#xD;
           performed in Clinical site laboratories as part of patient care. Quantitative viral load&#xD;
           assays -HIV RNA determined by polymerase chain reaction method performed as part of&#xD;
           clinical care at collaborating clinical sites will be collected used for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.m. Procedure for safety monitoring and toxicity management:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Urine pregnancy test will be administered to all females of child-bearing capacity at&#xD;
           each SLRHC visit and immediately before any radiological studies are performed. All&#xD;
           females of child bearing capacity will be questioned if they are pregnant prior to urine&#xD;
           testing and DEXA scanning.&#xD;

           Monitoring for hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hypocalemia: In order to maintain&#xD;
           blinding of subject treatment assignment, laboratory reports will be reviewed by Dr.&#xD;
           Shane, a Co-investigator, located at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, which is physically&#xD;
           apart from any of the clinical research facilities. This is also the location for the&#xD;
           GCRC where specialized laboratory assays will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum calcium and albumin and spot morning fasting urine will be monitored on a monthly&#xD;
           basis during the first year on study, and every 2 months during the second year. These&#xD;
           assays will be performed through Quest Diagnostics Laboratory as convenience samples&#xD;
           (i.e., run when collected).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical or laboratory abnormalities considered by the investigator to be related to&#xD;
           study drug will be managed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If hypercalcemia (&gt;10.5 mg/dl, albumin-corrected) develops, the dose of calcium will be&#xD;
           reduced by 250 mg/day and the levels rechecked one week later. If the abnormality does&#xD;
           not resolve, weekly stepwise reductions in oral calcium will be followed until a normal&#xD;
           level is achieved or supplemental calcium is discontinued. Vitamin D3 or placebo will be&#xD;
           withheld until serum calcium returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects with persistent abnormality will be referred to the treating physician. Vitamin&#xD;
           D3 or placebo will be withheld until serum calcium returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If severe hypercalcemia develops (&gt;12.0 mg/dl), all calcium supplements and Vitamin&#xD;
           D/placebo will be discontinued immediately and the subjects will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypercalceria If hypercalciuria develops (urinary calcium /creatinine ratio &gt;0.25 on&#xD;
           spot urine specimens), the subject will have a 24 hour urine collection performed for&#xD;
           confirmation. For confirmed hypercalciuria (&gt;4mg/kg/24 hr), the dose of calcium will be&#xD;
           reduced by 250mg and a spot urine repeated one week later. If the abnormality does not&#xD;
           resolve, weekly stepwise reductions in calcium will be followed until hypercalceria&#xD;
           resolves or supplemental calcium is discontinued. If necessary, vitamin D3 or placebo&#xD;
           will be withheld until urine calcium returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If hypocalcemia develops (&lt; 8.4 mg/dl, corrected for albumin), blood will be drawn for&#xD;
           Blood UreaNitrogen, serum electrolytes, creatinine, 25-OHD, PTH, Creatinine, Magnesium,&#xD;
           and Albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A subject with confirmed hypocalemia associated with vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD&lt;10&#xD;
           ng/dl and PTH &gt;73 will be withdrawn from the study and referred to their medical&#xD;
           provider for treatment and withdrawn from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring for vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the first year on study, serum for measurement of 25-OH and iPTH will be drawn&#xD;
           monthly and every 2 months during the second study year. Each subject's specimens will&#xD;
           be frozen immediately after collection, and transferred to SLRHC where they will be&#xD;
           stored at -70 degrees. At one year intervals the each subjects' samples will be assayed&#xD;
           in &quot;batched &quot; fashion. On the basis of these annual determinations, subjects with&#xD;
           persistent vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD&lt;10ng/l and PTH&gt;73) that lasts throughout both&#xD;
           winter and summer months, will be withdrawn from the study and referred to their medical&#xD;
           provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We anticipate low incidence of these particular abnormalities. In a prior study in which&#xD;
           the same dose of vitamin D3 (100,000 IU) was administered every 60 days for 6 months,&#xD;
           Guillemant et al. reported no instances of hypercalcemia in French adolescent males,&#xD;
           ages 13-16, with seasonal vitamin D deficiency (Guillemant 2000). In addition, in an&#xD;
           on-going study conducted by Dr. Shane (Prevention of Osteoporosis After Cardiac&#xD;
           Transplantation, ROI AR 46124-04), among the 74 subjects receiving the metabolically&#xD;
           active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol (0.25 ug BID), there were only 4 episodes of&#xD;
           urinary calcium excretion &gt;400 mg/g creatinine. Besides being on calcitriol, these&#xD;
           subjects were receiving corticosteroids, which also increase urinary calcium excretion.&#xD;
           Corticosteroids are not a permitted co-administered medication in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We do not anticipate Vitamin D3 will have an adverse effect on HIV infection or&#xD;
           antiretroviral medications. However, HIV-infected subjects who experience an otherwise&#xD;
           unexplained decline in immune status, based on CD4 count or CD4%, or an increase in&#xD;
           measure of HIV viral load believed by the treating physician to be possibly related to&#xD;
           study medications will be withdrawn from study participation. Measurements of CD4 count,&#xD;
           CD%, and HIV viral load will be measured at the clinical care sites as per standard of&#xD;
           care. Results will be monitored by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects who have decline in TBBMC z-score of &gt;0.5 from baseline at the one year&#xD;
           on-treatment DXA will be discontinued from study and referred for additional clinical&#xD;
           evaluation by the treating physician. In addition, if low impact or repeated fractures&#xD;
           occur, a clinical evaluation by the treating physician, safety officer and Study PI will&#xD;
           determine if the subject should remain on study.Monitoring DXA scan results of study&#xD;
           subjects will be performed by Dr. Horlick, a Co-Investigator and Director of the&#xD;
           Pediatric Body Composition Laboratory at St. Luke's-Roosevelt.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, because this is a placebo-controlled trial involving children, we have elected&#xD;
           to include an interim data analysis to be performed on 12 month on-treatment data (Human&#xD;
           Subjects, Section E.). A Data Safety and Monitoring Board comprised of experts in&#xD;
           biostatistics, pediatric HIV disease, pediatric endocrinology, and pediatric bone&#xD;
           acquisition will be established as per NIH guidelines to monitor study results for&#xD;
           safety and efficacy, to establish criteria for early termination of the study in&#xD;
           consultation with the Principal and Co-Investigators, and to determine if and when these&#xD;
           criteria have been fulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.3.n Data analysis and power calculations Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of&#xD;
           calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral accrual in HIV-infected children&#xD;
           and adolescents receiving HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary hypothesis of this study is that BMC and BMD will increase in HIV-infected&#xD;
           subjects randomized to receive vitamin D3 plus calcium compared to subjects receiving&#xD;
           placebo. We will test this hypothesis by comparing TBBMC, TBBMD, SBMC, and SBMD measured&#xD;
           by total body and spine DXA scans performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
           post-randomization in the 2 study arms using an intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to analyze the bone accrual&#xD;
           data. Differences in bone mineral content between the treatment and placebo groups will&#xD;
           be compared at 1 and 2 years while controlling for any possible differences between the&#xD;
           groups at entry to the trial. The between-group main effect (vitamin D3 and calcium&#xD;
           versus placebo) will test whether there is an overall difference between the groups,&#xD;
           while the within-group x time interaction effect will test whether the difference&#xD;
           between the groups is constant over the two follow-up years. The magnitude of change in&#xD;
           the vitamin D3 and calcium group will also be compared against normative data from the&#xD;
           BMDCS to determine how many children in each group achieve levels within normal limits&#xD;
           (95 % CI) using the algorithm presented in preliminary studies section C.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on our prior pilot data, the mean yearly change in TBBMC in 30 HIV-infected&#xD;
           children between the ages of 7-14 years was 120 g with a standard deviation of 84. A&#xD;
           difference in SD between boys and girls was noted. In order to maintain conservative&#xD;
           estimates we chose SD observed in girls. This can be assumed to be the level of yearly&#xD;
           change that will be observed in the placebo group. Based on data from the Pediatric&#xD;
           Rosetta Project (NIDDK 37352), a cross-sectional study of &gt;1300 children, the mean&#xD;
           yearly change in TBBMC in healthy African-American and Hispanic children ages 7-14 years&#xD;
           is 195 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effect size (d) comparing a mean yearly change of 120 g in the placebo group versus&#xD;
           a change of 195 g in the Vitamin D3 and calcium group is therefore 0.89. Twenty-one&#xD;
           children in each group will be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude&#xD;
           with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 80%. If the sample size is increased to 30 children in each&#xD;
           group, power will be sufficient to detect a difference of 61 gm between the vitamin D3&#xD;
           and calcium group and the placebo group with alpha = 0.05 and power = 80%. This is&#xD;
           comparable to the difference observed in a clinical trial of healthy adolescent girls&#xD;
           (mean age, 11.9 years) who received either calcium (110% of RDA) or placebo (Lloyd&#xD;
           1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Differences in the rate of sexual maturation during the study between treatment groups&#xD;
           may &quot;unbalance&quot; the groups with respect to a factor of significance to the bone mass&#xD;
           outcomes. To address this we have included a standardized measurement pubertal stage for&#xD;
           use as a covariate in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim #2: Determine the effect of HIV infection and vitamin D and calcium&#xD;
           supplementation on indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that indices of mineral metabolism are abnormal (low serum 25(OH)D and&#xD;
           elevated PTH) and biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption are increased in&#xD;
           HIV-infected children on HAART compared to normal controls and that indices of mineral&#xD;
           metabolism and markers of bone formation and resorption will return toward normal in&#xD;
           HIV-infected children and adolescents who are randomized to receive vitamin D and&#xD;
           calcium supplementation. We will test this hypothesis first by comparing markers of bone&#xD;
           turnover (osteocalcin, BALP and N-Tx) in HIV-infected and healthy children and&#xD;
           adolescents enrolled in the cross-sectional study using independent samples t-test to&#xD;
           compare means.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Longitudinal changes in bone turnover markers in HIV-infected children and adolescents&#xD;
           receiving vitamin D and calcium supplement will also be compared to those receiving&#xD;
           placebo. Levels of vitamin D metabolites and markers of bone turnover ((osteocalcin,&#xD;
           BALP and N-Tx) taken at intervals will be analyzed using a mixed model regression to&#xD;
           model trends in these measures over time to evaluate dependent inter-relationships&#xD;
           between these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim #3: Evaluate vitamin D stores in HIV-infected children and adolescent&#xD;
           receiving HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that vitamin D stores are decreased in children with HIV infection&#xD;
           compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will test this by comparing serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and indices of&#xD;
           mineral metabolism (25(OH)D 1,25(OH)2D) and PTH) in HIV-infected children and&#xD;
           adolescents receiving HAART compared to healthy controls. Data for testing this will be&#xD;
           obtained from the cross-sectional study. The HIV-infected group will consist of a sample&#xD;
           of HIV+ children screened for recruitment into the study while the healthy group will&#xD;
           consist of similar aged children recruited from the same neighborhood (including healthy&#xD;
           siblings of the HIV positive children). Screening levels of serum vitamin D metabolites&#xD;
           and PTH in the HIV-positive children will be compared with levels in the healthy&#xD;
           children using an independent samples t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main variable of interest is 25(OH)D as it best reflects vitamin D stores. Based on&#xD;
           prior pilot data, the mean (SD) expected 25(OH) among HIV-infected subjects is 21 (11)&#xD;
           ng/ml. The sample size in the present study has 80% power to detect change in 25(OH) D&#xD;
           of 8 ng/ml with alpha=0.05. Analysis of covariance based on a general linear regression&#xD;
           model will then be used to determine whether any possible group differences remain after&#xD;
           controlling for other factors such as race, sex, estimated dietary intake of Vitamin D&#xD;
           and sunlight exposure (using month of study as surrogate for sunlight exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim #4: Evaluate if vitamin D stores are a determinant of bone mass in HIV-&#xD;
           infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our hypothesis is that among HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART,&#xD;
           vitamin D stores, as measured by serum 25(OH)D, is a significant determinant of bone&#xD;
           mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will assess the relationship these variables have to TBBMC in HIV-infected children&#xD;
           and adolescents. This will be conducted through analysis of data obtained from a sample&#xD;
           of at least 60 HIV-infected children and adolescent being screened for the enrollment in&#xD;
           the longitudinal clinical trial. Within the HIV positive group, linear regression will&#xD;
           be used to determine whether HIV-related factors including antiviral medications,&#xD;
           markers of immunodeficiency (CD4count), HIV viral load, and levels of cytokines play a&#xD;
           role in predicting serum vitamin D levels and bone mass. Additional co-variates that&#xD;
           will be included in the model include age, sex, race, height, weight and pubertal stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These analyses are especially critical measurements for inclusion in this clinical trial&#xD;
           and in the analyses as these will allow for development of potential mechanistic&#xD;
           pathways for both the etiology of abnormal bone mass and intermediate response variables&#xD;
           involved in amelioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using multiple regression modeling we will assess the relationships of TNF, IL-6 vitamin&#xD;
           D levels and TBBMC. It is estimated that 50% of the HIV positive children who are&#xD;
           screened will meet the inclusion criteria for the trial and that approximately 100 to&#xD;
           120 HIV positive children will be available for the cross sectional comparison and so an&#xD;
           equal number of healthy children will be also recruited. With a total of 200 children,&#xD;
           the sample size will be large enough to add up to 18 covariates in addition to the&#xD;
           grouping factor (HIV-positive versus healthy) and test for a 5% increase in R2, with&#xD;
           alpha = 0.05 and power = 80 %. A sample of 100 HIV-positive children alone will allow&#xD;
           for a regression analysis that includes up to 9 predictors which collectively explain at&#xD;
           least 15% of the variance of the outcome variable (TBBMC, etc.) with alpha = 0.05 and&#xD;
           power = 80 %.&#xD;
