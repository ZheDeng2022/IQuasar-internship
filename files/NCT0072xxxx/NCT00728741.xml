      This study will locate areas in the brain that help people devise action plans to carry out&#xD;
      complex tasks requiring use of strategy. The ability to plan strategically is impaired in&#xD;
      patients who have had a stroke affecting the front parts of the brain. This study will use&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activity of different areas of&#xD;
      the brain during the formulation and execution of plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center four to five times to complete the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - MRI brain scan (if one has not been done within the past year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI - This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain.&#xD;
      The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The subject lies on a table&#xD;
      that can slide in and out of the scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur&#xD;
      during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 to 5 - Task training sessions and two fMRI scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI involves taking MRI scans while the subject performs a task in order to learn&#xD;
      about changes in brain regions that are involved in the performance of the task. Subjects are&#xD;
      trained in two tasks (see below) and then perform the tasks while in the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Task 1: The subject presses computer keys in response to the direction of arrows shown&#xD;
           on the computer screen. The keys are pressed according to a given set of rules the&#xD;
           subject is taught.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Task 2: This task is similar to task 1, but the subject is also asked to remember&#xD;
           certain previous actions and responses.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficient behavior requires the ability to generalize from previous experiences. This can be&#xD;
      achieved by behavioral strategies. We use many behavioral strategies; some strategies have&#xD;
      strict S-R associations -stop at the RED light-; others are modifiable -balancing skills of a&#xD;
      ballerina that becomes very useful during rock climbing- and serve as abstract strategies&#xD;
      that enable solving problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy use is common in our behavioral repertoire. A strategy can be defined as a set of&#xD;
      computations associated with the act of planning and directing overall operations and&#xD;
      movements involved in a task. A behavioral strategy that conscious behaving primates&#xD;
      spontaneously adopted in order to maximize their rewards have been well characterized in the&#xD;
      literature. These are called &quot;Repeat-Stay&quot;/&quot;Change-Shift&quot; strategy, and were shown to be&#xD;
      associated with prefrontal neuronal activity during multi-unit intra-cortical recordings,&#xD;
      clearly indicating a special role played by the prefrontal cortex in computing strategy use.&#xD;
      It is important to understand how the human brain computes and processes strategies. This&#xD;
      study aims at understanding the activation patterns, and neuronal connectivity in the human&#xD;
      brain when engaged in tasks that require strategies. We hypothesize that application of&#xD;
      strategies to solve tasks would show specifically and significantly increase Blood&#xD;
      Oxygenation Dependant (BOLD) signal, particularly the fronto-polar cortex (PFp), ventral and&#xD;
      orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex (PFV+o) in the human brains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two experiments described in this protocol may recruit up to 61 (6 for the pilot study)&#xD;
      adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The fMRI will consist&#xD;
      of two separate experiments: (1) the strategy experiment and (2) the memory control&#xD;
      experiment. Data will be analyzed separately for each part of the experiment: Responses to&#xD;
      tasks will be collected and this data (response times, accuracy rates) will be searched for&#xD;
      statistically significant differences using linear contrasts in an ANOVA model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging fMRI data will be analyzed for statistically significant functional activations&#xD;
      by using an implementation of the General Linear Model (GLM) (R. Turner et al., 1998; K. J.&#xD;
      Friston et al., 2005) in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to acquire response data (response times, error rates), and functional brain&#xD;
      activation data using fMRI. Therefore, we would have two outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the response data we will evaluate statistically significant differences in response&#xD;
      times, error rates, learning curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the BOLD fMRI data, the main outcome would be task specific neural activations that&#xD;
      would regress with the behavioral tasks in a General Linear Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measures will further our understanding about how the human brains use strategies&#xD;
      during complex task performance. This will lay the foundation to our understanding for how we&#xD;
      are capable of generalizing our experiences from specific instances. Such knowledge will also&#xD;
      improve our understanding of various aspects of movement genesis, and is likely to eventually&#xD;
      shed light on various movement disorders including psychogenic movement disorders and chorea&#xD;
      among others.&#xD;
