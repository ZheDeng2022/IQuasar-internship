  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of MLN4924 in adult&#xD;
      patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma. The patient population will consist of adults&#xD;
      with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is permitted) or&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that is relapsed and/or refractory after at least 2 prior standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimens and for which no curative option exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the expansion cohort, Schedule E, must specifically have Hodgkin lymphoma,&#xD;
      DLBCL-GCB subtype, DLBCL-non-GCB subtype, or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma will no longer be evaluated as a part of this study.&#xD;
