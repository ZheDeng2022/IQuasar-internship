      Sleep impairment is the most often reported of the 17 PTSD symptoms and is considered one of&#xD;
      the most refractory to treatment. This study proposes the use of sleep-directed hypnotherapy&#xD;
      to address sleep issues as a complementary element to empirically supported Cognitive&#xD;
      Processing Therapy (CPT) in treating PTSD in sexual and physical assault survivors.&#xD;
      Specifically the study aims to: 1) compare the results of sleep-directed hypnosis plus CPT&#xD;
      with CPT only, 2) to assess the relationship between sleep and PTSD symptoms, 3) to examine&#xD;
      relationships between sleep improvement, PTSD symptom improvement, and the therapeutic&#xD;
      elements (hypnosis, exposure, cognitive therapy) to determine mechanisms of action in the&#xD;
      intervention, 4) to assess the relationship between sleep and physical reactivity to&#xD;
      trauma-related cues and to other stimuli.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) has demonstrated significant empirical support in treating&#xD;
      victims of sexual assault suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) throughout its&#xD;
      program of research at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Similarly to the larger&#xD;
      treatment outcome literature, these clinical trials have revealed a portion of participants&#xD;
      whose sleep remains refractory to treatment even after conclusion of a full course of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the specific causes of sleep disturbance in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      sufferers, the most prominent of which are insomnia and nightmares, have not been determined.&#xD;
      However, sleep impairment is the most often reported of the 17 PTSD symptoms and is&#xD;
      considered one of the most refractory to treatment. It is theorized that PTSD sleep&#xD;
      impairment relates to the hypervigilance inherent in PTSD such that sleep is disrupted by the&#xD;
      perception that vigilance (in response to perceived threat) must be maintained at night.&#xD;
      Sleep impairment seen in PTSD sufferers may then result from increased physiological arousal&#xD;
      associated with chronic hypervigilance. Hypnosis provides deep relaxation which is&#xD;
      hypothesized to decrease overall hyperarousal. Nightmares and trauma cues can further disrupt&#xD;
      sleep through learning and conditioning. PTSD sufferers may learn to associate nighttime cues&#xD;
      with danger and conditioned emotional responses to these cues may disrupt sleep. Detecting&#xD;
      relatively innocuous environmental stimuli (i.e. normal nighttime noises) while trying to&#xD;
      fall asleep and interpreting them as dangerous increases arousal. Hyperarousal interferes&#xD;
      with sleep and has been identified as causal in the development of non-PTSD insomnia. Beyond&#xD;
      decreases in general hyperarousal, an additive benefit of the hypnotic trance and the use of&#xD;
      post-hypnotic suggestion would be the facilitation of new learning such that bedroom stimuli&#xD;
      could become associated with pleasant, restful images. The use of hypnosis as a complement to&#xD;
      CPT, an empirically supported, cognitive-behavioral intervention developed to treat PTSD,&#xD;
      could specifically remediate 1.) sleep onset and maintenance deficits, 2) the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of parasomnia episodes, and 3.) cumulative sleep deprivation. Acquisition of the&#xD;
      skill of self-hypnosis will provide PTSD sufferers with a tool to regain normal and&#xD;
      restorative sleep patterns. Restoring sleep will enhance the efficacy of CPT in remediating&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms (PTSD and major depression), reduce overall physiological reactivity,&#xD;
      increase psychosocial functioning, and decrease somatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes the use of sleep-directed hypnotherapy as a complementary element to the&#xD;
      empirically supported CPT in treating PTSD in sexual and physical assault survivors.&#xD;
      Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the results of sleep-directed hypnosis + CPT (hypCPT) versus CPT-only (CPT)&#xD;
      within a sample of female sexual/physical assault survivors. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      hypCPT group will show significantly greater improvement on overall PTSD severity, concurrent&#xD;
      psychopathology, and overall sleep impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the relationship between sleep and PTSD sxs. Specifically, identify temporal&#xD;
      and directional relationships between elevations in PTSD symptoms and increases in sleep&#xD;
      impairment while accounting for daily life stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate improvements with respect to the process of therapy. Specifically, examine&#xD;
      relationships between sleep improvement, PTSD symptom improvement, and the therapeutic&#xD;
      elements (hypnosis, exposure, cognitive therapy) to determine mechanisms of action in the&#xD;
      intervention. It is specifically hypothesized that improvements in sleep will be positively&#xD;
      and temporally related to improvements in PTSD symptomatology throughout treatment. Further,&#xD;
      overall decreases in sleep impairment will indicate a temporal, positive relationship to&#xD;
      overall improvements in psychosocial functioning and health-related concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Assess the relationship between sleep and psychophysiological reactivity to&#xD;
      trauma-related cues and to an auditory startle probe. It is hypothesized that impairment in&#xD;
      sleep onset and maintenance, frequency/intensity of parasomnia episodes, and overall sleep&#xD;
      deprivation will be positively related to elevations in psychophysiological reactivity&#xD;
      (heart-rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG) during a scripted-imagery paradigm and an&#xD;
      auditory startle paradigm. It is further hypothesized that decreases in sleep impairment will&#xD;
      be positively related to decreases in physiological reactivity across hypCPT treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be at least three months post-crime at the time of their&#xD;
             participation and will have been diagnosed with PTSD. Participants will score at least&#xD;
             a &quot;3&quot; on the CAPS symptom of sleep impairment. This score is indicative of clinically&#xD;
             significant symptomatology on any PTSD symptom. There is no upper limit on time since&#xD;
             the trauma for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria for participants include psychosis, mental retardation, active&#xD;
             suicidality, parasuicidality, or current addiction to drugs or alcohol. In the case of&#xD;
             apparent illiteracy, we will try to accommodate the individual as much as possible to&#xD;
             maximize success in the program. In addition, participants cannot be in a currently&#xD;
             abusive relationship or being stalked. For marital rape or domestic violence, the&#xD;
             participant must have been out of the relationship for at least three months.&#xD;
             Participants can have received any therapy in the past with the exception of CPT. They&#xD;
             may be receiving concurrent therapy as long as it is not trauma-focused. Allowing&#xD;
             subjects to continue with concurrent therapy offers them the option to continue with&#xD;
             established supports and more closely mimics clinical practice and the&#xD;
             generalizability of the results. Participants will be asked to monitor and adhere to&#xD;
             several behaviors that significantly impact sleep and may introduce error into the&#xD;
             study aims. Inability or unwillingness to comply the the following will constitute&#xD;
             exclusion criteria: Participants will be asked not to increase sleep medications, but&#xD;
             to continue usual practice. This usage will be monitored on a daily basis on the sleep&#xD;
             diaries. Daytime sleeping or naps will be monitored on the daily diaries and used as&#xD;
             an outcome measure as naps are utilized less and less frequently across time in a&#xD;
             number of insomnia treatment studies. Participants will also be asked to keep alcohol&#xD;
             consumption to no more than 14 servings per week with no more than 5 servings on any&#xD;
             given day. We will also ask participants to consume no more than 500 mg of caffeine on&#xD;
             a daily basis and to refrain from caffeine consumption after 6 pm. We will further ask&#xD;
             participants to maintain their bedtime and rise time during the work week and to not&#xD;
             vary these times by more than one hour on days off. Participants will record bedtime&#xD;
             and rise time on their daily diaries. Participants will be asked to maintain these&#xD;
             sleep-related behaviors for the duration of therapy - approximately 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
