    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open, multi-center study is to prospectively collect outcome data on&#xD;
      patients who are having lumbar spinal fusion surgery with implantation of the SpineLink®&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open, prospective, multi-center outcome study. This study will be conducted&#xD;
      at up to ten centers, each of which will enroll approximately 20 patients. A maximum of 200&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. This patient sample size will allow statistical comparison to&#xD;
      historical literature and allow an inter-center comparison of outcome. Enrollment into the&#xD;
      study may include all patients who have lumbar spinal fusion performed. All spinal fusion&#xD;
      surgery will be performed using the EBI SpineLink® system.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has demonstrated Grade I or Grade II degenerative spondylolisthesis&#xD;
             exhibited by maximum slippage on flexion and extension radiographs with symptoms that&#xD;
             include back pain and/or leg pain with spinal fusion indicated, or spinal instability&#xD;
             as evidenced by greater than 3 mm of translational motion or greater than 10 degrees&#xD;
             of angular motion between the involved vertebrae as evidenced by flexion-extension&#xD;
             radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. This surgery will be the primary fusion attempt with no more than three (3) vertebrae&#xD;
             or 2 disc spaces involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient must be available for yearly follow-up in the study until completion of&#xD;
             the 24 month evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must be skeletally mature (epiphyses closed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Bone grafting material must be limited to autograft and/or bone-bank allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient must be willing to comply with the treatment regimen, follow-up&#xD;
             requirements, and have the legal ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with supplemental spinal internal fixation devices previously implanted at&#xD;
             any other level and/or a previous fusion attempt at the involved level(s) (no&#xD;
             interbody fusions, salvage procedures, or prior hardware).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with other pathology at the involved spinal level, e.g., osteomyelitis,&#xD;
             Paget's disease, pathologic fracture, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a disease entity or condition that totally precludes the possibility of&#xD;
             bony fusion such as known active cancer, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have significant metabolic diseases including insulin dependent diabetes,&#xD;
             renal dysfunction, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients involved in personal injury litigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or nursing females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient in whom unapproved biologicals (e.g. BMP-2) or bone substitute materials (e.g.&#xD;
             Grafton) would be used at the fusion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are unable to understand and sign an informed consent or who, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would be psychologically unwilling or unable to&#xD;
             understand or complete the protocol, especially those unwilling or unable to&#xD;
             participate in the follow-up.&#xD;
