  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, four-arm, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and to determine the optimal tolerated regimen (OTR) of pazopanib in combination&#xD;
      with epirubicin or doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in cohorts of 3 to receive escalating doses of pazopanib and epirubicin or&#xD;
      doxorubicin. Dose escalation schemas for each study arm are described in the protocol. For&#xD;
      each arm, the OTR will be defined as the highest dose combination of the agents where no more&#xD;
      than one out of six patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. Twelve additional patients&#xD;
      in each arm will be studied with the OTR to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. This will&#xD;
      allow an assessment of potential drug-drug interactions. Antitumor activity will be assessed&#xD;
      using RECIST criteria.&#xD;
