      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the safety and efficacy of intravitreal flucinolone acetonide implants in the&#xD;
      management of patients having refractory ocular Behcet's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A multi-center, prospective single arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of retisert&#xD;
      (intravitreal flucinolone acetonide 0.59 mg) in patients with refractory ocular Behcet's&#xD;
      disease. This study will be conducted at 4 sites, located in Korea. The number of subject is&#xD;
      expected approximately 15 patients. The medical records for the patients meeting following&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be collected until 1 year after implantation.&#xD;
