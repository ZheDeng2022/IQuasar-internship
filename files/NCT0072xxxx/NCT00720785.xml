  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK) cells are white blood cells that have a limited ability to kill cancer&#xD;
      cells. This ability might be enhanced if they are given 24 hours after an injection of the&#xD;
      drug bortezomib. This study will determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What dose of NK cells can be given safely to subjects with metastatic solid tumors or&#xD;
           leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness and side effects of NK cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the body handles NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 70 years of age who have a solid tumor or leukemia, and for whom&#xD;
      standard treatments are not effective, may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo&#xD;
      the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apheresis to collect NK cells. For this procedure, a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a&#xD;
      vein in the subject s arm. Blood flows from the vein into a cell separator machine, which&#xD;
      separates the white cells from the other blood components. The white cells are extracted and&#xD;
      the rest of the blood is returned to the body through a second tube placed in a vein in the&#xD;
      other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy with the drug pentostatin to suppress the immune system and prevent it from&#xD;
      attacking the NK cells that will be infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy with bortezomib to increase NK cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion of the NK cells. In this dose-escalating study, successive groups of patients&#xD;
      entering the study receive increasingly higher numbers of cells to determine the highest safe&#xD;
      dose level. Up to ten dose levels may be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 drug therapy to maintain NK cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations during therapy including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment, history and review of medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws for routine and research tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics study after the NK infusion to see how the body handles the cells. For&#xD;
           this test, the number of NK cells in the blood are measured over time. This requires&#xD;
           drawing about 1 teaspoon of blood at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24&#xD;
           hours after the infusion (day 1); then every 24 hours on days 2 through 7, then once on&#xD;
           days 10, 14, and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy (subjects with leukemia only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan, bone scan and PET scan, if indicated, for disease evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who respond well after one treatment cycle may be eligible to continue NK cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune lymphocytes that are identified by the expression&#xD;
      of the CD56 surface antigen and the lack of CD3. Unlike antigen specific T cells, NK cells do&#xD;
      not require the presence of a specific tumor antigen for the recognition and killing of&#xD;
      cancer cells. Our in vitro studies have demonstrated that pretreatment of malignant cells&#xD;
      with bortezomib significantly enhances NK-mediated tumor cytotoxicity by sensitizing cells to&#xD;
      TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL is a member of tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      family of cytokines that promotes apoptosis. Importantly, in our laboratory, in vitro&#xD;
      expanded NK cells isolated from patients with metastatic cancers or hematological&#xD;
      malignancies exhibited significantly more cytotoxicity against their tumor cells when tumors&#xD;
      were pre-treated with bortezomib compared with untreated tumor controls. These findings&#xD;
      suggest that drug-induced sensitization to TRAIL could be used as a novel strategy to&#xD;
      potentiate anticancer effects of autologous adoptively infused NK cells in patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Murine studies conducted in our laboratory have also established that bortezomib treatment&#xD;
      sensitizes tumors in vivo to killing by adoptively infused syngeneic NK cells; murine renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma line (RENCA) tumors in BALB/c mice grew significantly slower and survival was&#xD;
      prolonged when syngeneic NK cell infusions where given following bortezomib treatment&#xD;
      compared to mice receiving NK cell infusions alone or bortezomib alone. This anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect was further potentiated by eradicating T-regulatory cells prior to adoptive NK cell&#xD;
      infusion and by administering interleukin-2 after adoptive NK cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, our laboratory has developed techniques for the in vitro isolation and expansion of&#xD;
      NK cells to levels suitable for the treatment of cancer patients. Furthermore, we have also&#xD;
      established good viability and sterility of these expanded NK cells which, compared to fresh&#xD;
      NK cells, have increased surface expression of TRAIL and have enhanced cytotoxicity against&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose this non-randomized, Phase I, dose escalating study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and the anti- tumor effects of escalating doses of adoptively infused ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded autologous natural killer (NK) cells against metastatic cancers or hematological&#xD;
      malignancies sensitized to NK TRAIL cytotoxicity with bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine the safety (maximum tolerated dose) of escalating&#xD;
      NK cell doses of adoptively infused ex vivo expanded autologous NK cells in subjects with&#xD;
      treatment refractory metastatic tumors or hematological malignancies that are sensitized to&#xD;
      NK cell cytotoxicity using bortezomib. Secondary objectives will include the anti-neoplastic&#xD;
      effects of this treatment regimen (assessed using standard disease specific response&#xD;
      criteria) and the toxicity profile associated with extended cycles of protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be assessed at day 21 (3 weeks after the Day 0 NK cell infusion).&#xD;
