      The main aim of the study is to develop a method that allows responders to be distinguished&#xD;
      from non-responders before long-term treatment is initiated. Subsidiary aims are to record&#xD;
      changes in pulmonary functional parameters, NO concentrations and peak flow variability, the&#xD;
      use of beta2 sympathomimetics and the asthma symptom score.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Leukotriene antagonists (montelukast) are particularly effective as controllers before&#xD;
      exposure to an allergen (Leff 1998). The same applies to the treatment of bronchoconstriction&#xD;
      induced by physical exertion or cold air (Richter 2000). Montelukast binds to the cysteinyl&#xD;
      leuko¬triene-1 receptor, where it prevents leukotriene from binding. Leukotrienes play a key&#xD;
      role as mediators in inflammatory processes. By binding to the receptor they cause, among&#xD;
      other things, edema, damage to the bronchial epithelium and bronchoconstriction. Accordingly,&#xD;
      in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity montelukast brings about bronchial dilation.&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of the drug in children have been well documented (Knorr 1998). Hence&#xD;
      montelukast is approved for the treatment of bronchial asthma in children (over six months of&#xD;
      age). As with other antiasthmatic drugs, there are responders and nonresponders to&#xD;
      leukotriene receptor antagonists. The proportion of nonresponders to montelukast among&#xD;
      children is esti¬mated to be 30% to 40%. At present the only way to distinguish&#xD;
      non-responders from responders is to run a treatment trial for several weeks. If the symptom&#xD;
      score falls, if the use of beta2 sympathomimetics is reduced, if pulmonary function and/or&#xD;
      the quality of life improves, it is assumed that the patient is a responder. This method is&#xD;
      not only tedious but also unsafe, since a change is the aforementioned parameters could occur&#xD;
      spontaneously, without this being reliably attributable to the influence of the drug. In the&#xD;
      planned study approximately 30 children with asthma of GINA classes 2 and 3 will be regularly&#xD;
      examined for pulmonary function, symptom score and nitrogen monoxide (NO). First, however,&#xD;
      the acute pharmacologic effect of a single dose of montelukast will be deter¬mined over a&#xD;
      period of four hours by measuring pulmonary function and levels of exhaled nitrogen monoxide&#xD;
      (NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.1. Questions addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is it possible to discriminate between responders and nonresponders at a very early stage on&#xD;
      the basis of the acute pharmacologic effect of montelukast? Does this classification agree&#xD;
      with the results after 12 weeks of treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.2. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who show a bronchospasmolytic effect in their functional pulmonary test (FEV1&#xD;
      increased by at least 5%) within four hours of taking montelukast also show a positive&#xD;
      response (defined as a combination of at least two variables (see section on the definition&#xD;
      of responders/non-responders during treatment)) after 12 weeks of treatment. Conversely,&#xD;
      patients who show no acute effect do not have a positive response during long-term therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, the results of the acute pharmacologic effect correspond to the effect during&#xD;
      long-term therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to develop a method that allows responders to be distinguished&#xD;
      from non-responders before long-term treatment is initiated. Subsidiary aims are to record&#xD;
      changes in pulmonary functional parameters, NO concentrations and peak flow variability, the&#xD;
      use of beta2 sympathomimetics and the asthma symptom score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include approximately 30 patients aged 6 to 14 years with diagnosed bronchial&#xD;
      asthma who have been on constant anti-inflammatory therapy for at least four weeks (GINA&#xD;
      classes 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is a single-center, two-phase, single-arm study. In order to detect a&#xD;
      potential placebo effect, the treatment phase will be preceded by a single-blinded two-week&#xD;
      placebo run-in phase, followed by a 12 week open-label treatment phase.&#xD;
