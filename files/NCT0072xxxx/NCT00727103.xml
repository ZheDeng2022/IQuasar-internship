      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to find out whether varenicline (ChantixTM) treatment&#xD;
      decreases alcohol use and smoking in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
      Varenicline may also improve cognition (memory and concentration) and negative symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      poor attention, poverty of speech, apathy, affective flattening, anhedonia) in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use (more than 33%) and smoking (80-90%) commonly occur together in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Varenicline (ChantixTM) has been approved by the FDA as a medication for&#xD;
      smoking cessation. Recent animal studies have shown that chronic varenicline administration&#xD;
      decreased alcohol consumption. There are no human data available on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      varenicline in alcohol-use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to find out whether varenicline treatment decreases&#xD;
      alcohol use and smoking in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
      Varenicline may also improve cognition (memory and concentration) and negative symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      poor attention, poverty of speech, apathy, affective flattening, anhedonia) in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study will enroll a cohort of up to 30 subjects with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder and nicotine and alcohol dependence, who are receiving ongoing&#xD;
      outpatient mental health treatment from community providers. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups (varenicline vs. placebo). Following a one week&#xD;
      screening phase, participants will be seen on day 4, day 8, then weekly over an 8-week&#xD;
      treatment period. One week supply of medication will be dispensed at each study visit, with&#xD;
      the exception of the first week, when only 4 days supply will be given on 2 days (visit 1 and&#xD;
      2). One month after discontinuation of medication, a follow-up interview will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varenicline and placebo will be dispensed in 0.5 mg and 1 mg color coded capsules. During the&#xD;
      first 3 days of treatment, participants will take one 0.5 mg tablet of varenicline (or&#xD;
      placebo) by mouth daily. If the medication is well-tolerated, the dose will be increased to&#xD;
      0.5 mg by mouth twice daily for 4 days. From day 8, the dose will be increased to the&#xD;
      standard dosing schedule of 1 mg (1 tablet) by mouth twice daily. At the end of the 8th week,&#xD;
      varenicline will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured clinical psychiatric interview and physical exam will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
      along with a urine drug screen, which will be repeated on week 8, and at 1 month follow-up.&#xD;
      Blood tests (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, then monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During weekly study visits patients will undergo breath carbon-monoxide and breath alcohol&#xD;
      testing, and they will answer questions about depression, smoking and alcohol use. Detailed&#xD;
      assessment of psychiatric symptom severity (including neuropsychological testing) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, at the end of the treatment phase (week 8). A functional MRI study&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and at the end of study to assess changes in blood flow,&#xD;
      emotional processing and working memory related to varenicline treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      genetic polymorphism of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and gene expression changes&#xD;
      related to drinking/smoking/psychosis and varenicline treatment will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the proposed study are two fold: first to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of conducting a similar study on a larger scale, and second to establish pilot data for&#xD;
      determining the effect size for hypothesized treatment effects on alcohol and nicotine use&#xD;
      based on objective tests and self report. These estimates will help inform the minimum sample&#xD;
      size needed for a larger future trial.&#xD;
