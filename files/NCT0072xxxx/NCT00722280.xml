      Overall Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish hand transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive strategy for the&#xD;
      treatment of upper extremity amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of rejection and enable allograft survival while minimizing the&#xD;
      requirement for long term high dose immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we propose to utilize the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot;, which is an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory strategy that has been implemented in solid organ transplants at UPMC. Early&#xD;
      results in living related liver and kidney patients have confirmed that this protocol&#xD;
      provides the means to allow graft survival with minimization of maintenance immunosuppression&#xD;
      and even allows weaning of some patients from long-term immunosuppression.We hypothesize that&#xD;
      a similar protocol can enable graft survival in highly immunogenic composite tissue&#xD;
      allografts like hand transplants while reducing the number,dosing and/or frequency of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs associated with serious adverse effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Suitable candidates will be identified via patient information brochures and via&#xD;
      advertisements directed at upper limb amputees. For this purpose, a web-page will be&#xD;
      constructed for free access by interested individuals. This website will be accessible&#xD;
      through standard search engines. Interested potential subjects will be instructed to contact&#xD;
      the investigator for an appointment. At the time of appointment, candidates will be first&#xD;
      requested to complete a screening consent form (SCF) before undergoing further&#xD;
      evaluation/medical screening procedures. The SCF includes a written consent to obtain PHI of&#xD;
      the candidate. When the candidate visits UPMC he will undergo a consultation with the PI who&#xD;
      will perform a thorough clinical assessment and explain in detail the treatment options,&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the procedure. Candidates will be requested to complete a screening&#xD;
      consent at this stage. Appropriate subjects will then undergo further medical screening&#xD;
      procedures that include a number of examinations and investigations to determine their&#xD;
      candidacy for hand transplantation. Prospective recipients who are selected based on results&#xD;
      of screening procedures will be invited to review and sign the full informed consent form&#xD;
      prior to being wait-listed for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening tests include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and physical exam, including height and weight Urine pregnancy test for all female&#xD;
      subjects of childbearing potential Complete blood count, differential, reticulocyte count,&#xD;
      platelet count ABO type Liver function tests including SGPT or SGOT, serum bilirubin (total&#xD;
      and direct), total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and GGT, PT, PTT with INR Serum&#xD;
      electrolytes and renal function panel to include the following: sodium, potassium, chloride,&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, creatinine and BUN Urinalysis and&#xD;
      creatinine clearance test to determine GFR Infectious disease studies: HIV antigen, HTLV I-II&#xD;
      antibody, antibodies to HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B core antibody,&#xD;
      and hepatitis B surface antigen titers are required Infectious disease titers: CMV, EBV, HSV,&#xD;
      toxoplasmosis and VZV (IgG and IgM when indicated) Pulmonary function tests, including DLCO2&#xD;
      Chest X-ray EKG and MUGA scan or echocardiogram for determination of cardiac ejection&#xD;
      fraction Sinus X-ray (if clinically indicated) CT scans (CT Angiography)/MRI studies&#xD;
      (Functional MRI, Skeletal MRIs of hand/hips) as indicated by medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination Ophthalmologic examination Dental consult Psychiatric evaluation&#xD;

    <description>This program is the primary site for a novel immune modulation protocol for hand and/or forearm transplantation using donor bone marrow stem cells. This protocol, otherwise called the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot; has been published and implemented in 8 hand/forearm transplantations. The Pittsburgh hand transplant program is the only center that has experience with the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot; to reduce the number and dosing of immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection of hand/forearm transplants.</description>

        Donor Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Brain dead donors who have met the criteria for Determination of Death will be selected by&#xD;
        the hand transplant team in conjunction with the CORE (Center for Organ Recovery and&#xD;
        Education), the organ procurement agency (OPO) for Pittsburgh and covers Pennsylvania, New&#xD;
        York and West Virginia. The mandatory requirements are family consent for limb donation,&#xD;
        stable donor (does not require excessive vasopressors to maintain blood pressure), age&#xD;
        between 18 to 55 years, limb matched for size with recipient, same blood type as recipient,&#xD;
        negative cross-match, and importantly accurately matched for gender, skin tone and race&#xD;
        (may be relative requirement depending on recipient consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recipient Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recipients will be selected from a population of subjects with upper limb loss. Recipients&#xD;
        may be male or female and of any race, color or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age (&gt;18 years &lt;60 years): Recipients &lt;18 years of age are excluded due to limitations&#xD;
             of giving full informed consent and the potentially increased risk of&#xD;
             lymphoproliferative disorder in a younger population. Once hand transplantation and in&#xD;
             particular the strategy for minimizing immunosuppression has proven to be efficacious&#xD;
             and safe, the restrictions with regard to recipient age may be relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No serious co-existing medical (coronary artery disease, diabetes) or psycho-social&#xD;
             problems (including alcoholism, drug abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be negative for malignancy (for 10 years) or HIV (at transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Negative crossmatch with donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Negative pregnancy test in female recipient of child bearing potential and consent to&#xD;
             use reliable contraception for at least one year following transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Consent to cell collection, storage, and bone marrow infusion as part of the treatment&#xD;
             regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Amputation may be recent (acute injury) or remote (patient may have undergone&#xD;
             rehabilitation with prostheses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Conditions that may impact the immunomodulatory protocol: These include diseases like&#xD;
             HIV or malignancy that could expose the recipient to an unacceptable risk under&#xD;
             immunosuppressive treatment. Sensitized recipients with high level of preformed&#xD;
             antibodies are also at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions that may impact the success of the surgical procedure or increase the risk&#xD;
             of postoperative complications: These include inherited coagulopathies like&#xD;
             Hemophilia, Von-Willebrand's disease, Protein C and S deficiency, Thrombocythemias,&#xD;
             Thallassemias, Sickle Cell disease etc. Mixed connective tissue diseases and collagen&#xD;
             diseases can result in poor wound healing after surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Conditions that may impact functional outcomes: Lipopolysaccharidoses and amyloidosis&#xD;
             are few of the conditions that may impact nerve regeneration and impair outcomes.&#xD;
             Also, rare disorders of bone healing like osteopetrosis may also be causes for&#xD;
             exclusion.&#xD;
