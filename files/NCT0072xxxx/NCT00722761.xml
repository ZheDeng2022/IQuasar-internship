      The purpose of this study is to find out if taking a birth control pill, YAZ, is safe and&#xD;
      effective for treating acne on the trunk (the main part of the body that does not include the&#xD;
      arms, legs, and head).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acne vulgaris is a very common skin disorder. It is caused when oil-producing skin glands&#xD;
      (sebaceous glands) become plugged. The plug can cause blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and&#xD;
      cysts on the face, neck, upper chest, and upper back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YAZ is a combination birth control pill. A &quot;combination&quot; pill means that it is made up of&#xD;
      more than one major ingredient. Nearly all birth control pills are made up of a combination&#xD;
      of estrogen and progestin hormones. Estrogens are steroid hormones produced by the ovaries&#xD;
      responsible for the typical female features. Progestins are steroid hormones produced by the&#xD;
      ovary and placenta responsible for making the uterus fit for pregnancy. YAZ also contains an&#xD;
      estrogen called ethinyl estradiol, and a progestin called drospirenone. People who develop&#xD;
      acne have sebaceous glands that are over-stimulated (that is, the sebaceous glands have&#xD;
      increased activity) by male sex hormones (androgens). The progestin in YAZ blocks the male&#xD;
      sex hormones (androgens) that cause acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug being used in this study is called YAZ. It has been approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate acne in women who want an oral contraceptive&#xD;
      for birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, YAZ will be compared to a placebo for safety and effectiveness. A placebo&#xD;
      looks like the study drug but contains no active drug (like a sugar pill). We use placebos in&#xD;
      research studies to learn if the effects seen in research subjects are truly from the study&#xD;
      drug or from other reasons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne is a common skin disease that affects 85-100% of the population. Although it often&#xD;
      appears during puberty, it may persist during the third decade of life and even later. It is&#xD;
      characterized by a variety of lesions consisting of non-inflammatory lesions known as&#xD;
      comedones, and inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules, nodules and cysts. It commonly&#xD;
      occurs on the face, chest, and back. Although not as noticeable as facial acne, truncal acne&#xD;
      may also affect a person's self esteem and body image and reduce one's participation in&#xD;
      sports because of the need to undress in a shared locker room. Most acne studies focus on&#xD;
      facial acne and ignore treatment outcomes in the chest and back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial, developing in the sebaceous gland. These factors&#xD;
      include intrafollicular hypercornification, which induces follicular obstruction resulting in&#xD;
      comedone formation, excess sebum production, Propionibacterium acnes activity and&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone therapies, such as oral contraceptives and antiandrogens (e.g. spironolactone)&#xD;
      counteract the effects of androgens on the sebaceous glands. It has been over ten years since&#xD;
      estrogen-containing oral contraceptives (OCs) first obtained FDA approval for use in acne.&#xD;
      Since then, several randomized controlled trials have corroborated their efficacy and safety&#xD;
      for this growing indication in women of child bearing age. Studies have shown hormonal&#xD;
      therapies to be effective in treating moderate acne vulgaris in women with no known&#xD;
      contraindication to OC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YAZ is an oral contraceptive that is FDA approved for acne vulgaris. Unlike other progestins,&#xD;
      drospirenone has unique antimineralocorticoid (mild diuretic effect) and antiandrogenic&#xD;
      properties. The antiandrogenic property of drospirenone means that it blocks the male sex&#xD;
      hormones that can cause acne. In two multicenter, double blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled studies, 889 subjects, ages 14 to 45 years, with moderate acne received&#xD;
      YAZ or placebo for six 28 day cycles. The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent change&#xD;
      in inflammatory lesions, non-inflammatory lesions, total lesions, and the percentage of&#xD;
      subjects with a &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;almost clear&quot; rating on the Investigator's Static Global&#xD;
      Assessment (ISGA) scale on day 15 of cycle 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to a treatment group upon randomization. Bayer HealthCare&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals personnel, investigators, subjects and study nurse/coordinators will be&#xD;
      blinded to the study product treatment assignment. The study duration will be 24 weeks with&#xD;
      visits at screening, baseline (week 0), week 6, week 12, week 18, and week 24. Lesion counts&#xD;
      (total, inflammatory, non-inflammatory) and an ISGA, and photography will be performed on&#xD;
      every visit. A physical examination will be done at baseline and Week 24. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed from reported adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
