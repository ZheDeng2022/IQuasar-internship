    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB-IV) non small cell lung cancer who have not&#xD;
      received prior chemotherapy will be treated with erlotinib 150 mg once a day and sorafenib&#xD;
      400 mg twice a day. The objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy and safety of this&#xD;
      combination treatment. Additional exploratory study objectives are correlation of biomarkers&#xD;
      and imaging modalities potentially predictive for response and (progression free) survival.&#xD;
