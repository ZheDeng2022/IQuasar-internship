      This proposal puts forward a research plan to initiate a genetic databank, henceforth&#xD;
      referred to as The Genebank at Scripps Clinic Registry. This database will usher in genomic&#xD;
      research at Scripps as we strive to stay at the forefront of cardiovascular research in the&#xD;
      new century. Human subject donation allows for the creation of the proposed genebank.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The completion of the human genome project within the final months of the previous&#xD;
      millennium, is a landmark of scientific accomplishment. This achievement heralds the&#xD;
      importance human and molecular genetics will play in the coming century in medicine. In&#xD;
      short, one expects that dissecting the phenotypic aspects of disease to a culprit&#xD;
      mutation/variation of a gene or collection of genes, will modify and or augment our present&#xD;
      diagnostic ability leading on to new therapeutic interventions that are targeted based on&#xD;
      these discoveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad application of human genetics will progress from the study of rare mendelian traits&#xD;
      with complete penetrance compiled over the last 3-4 decades to a large number of &quot;common&quot;&#xD;
      diseases that have multi-gene etiology with variable penetrance such as non-insulin dependent&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Cardiology will probably stay at a forefront of this&#xD;
      transformation, as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in developing countries, and is fast reaching the same status in the underdeveloped&#xD;
      countries. Furthermore, the track record of rapid adaptation of new technology and research&#xD;
      in the field of cardiology, would give further impetus to this transition. In the midst of&#xD;
      these dynamic currents, this proposal puts forward a research plan to initiate a genetic&#xD;
      databank, henceforth referred to as The Genebank at Scripps Clinic Registry. This database&#xD;
      will usher in genomic research at Scripps as we strive to stay at the forefront of&#xD;
      cardiovascular research in the new century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is, to obtain blood samples in order to define genes for various&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions. The blood samples will go through DNA analysis and noted for 1&#xD;
      million SNP's per individual.&#xD;

      Cardiac Catheterization Patients&#xD;

      Blood will be collected from the patients that will undergo heart catheterization for&#xD;
      establishing a gene bank registry. Informed consent will take place prior to cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization. 38 cc of blood collected will be processed to create a repository of DNA,&#xD;
      RNA, and lymphoblastoid cell-line immortalization on selected patient populations, plasma and&#xD;
      serum. The DNA will be amplified in certain patient populations to preserve the quantity.&#xD;
