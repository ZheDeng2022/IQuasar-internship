  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the development of chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders. Pain pathways are triggered in part by ectopic discharges of voltage-sensitive&#xD;
      sodium channels, which are in abundance in both the peripheral and the central nervous&#xD;
      systems. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a selective blocker of Na+ channels and causes analgesia&#xD;
      either by decreasing the propagation of action potentials by Na+ channels and/or by blocking&#xD;
      of ectopic discharges associated with chronic pain. TTX is extracted from the puffer fish&#xD;
      (fugu). Results from animal pharmacology studies revealed that TTX is a more potent analgesic&#xD;
      than standard analgesic agents such as aspirin, morphine or meperidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the management of severe cancer pain generally includes the use of opiates. This&#xD;
      can often result in undesirable side effects, and treatment with this type of medication is&#xD;
      not always effective. Because currently available pain-relieving therapy is unsatisfactory&#xD;
      for many patients, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches for the management of&#xD;
      moderate or severe cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies indicate that intramuscular (into a muscle) or subcutaneous (under the skin)&#xD;
      injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) may reduce pain in cancer patients who did not respond to&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposed study (TEC-006) is designed to 1) demonstrate in a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial that the subcutaneous 30 μg b.i.d. dose of TTX for 4 days is&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain outcome and improving quality of life; 2) characterize the onset&#xD;
      and duration of analgesia, and 3) demonstrate that TTX is well tolerated in patients with&#xD;
      inadequately controlled cancer-related pain.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female subjects with moderate to severe pain (related to cancer or cancer&#xD;
      treatment)inadequately controlled by current therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin treatment (TTX) with that of&#xD;
           placebo as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pain outcome (pain intensity reduction or use of analgesics)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  improvement in quality of life (physical and emotional functioning)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin with that of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the onset of analgesic response of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the duration of analgesic response associated with subcutaneous&#xD;
           tetrodotoxin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design&#xD;
      trial of the efficacy and safety of tetrodotoxin in patients over 18 years of age with stable&#xD;
      but inadequately controlled moderate to severe pain associated with cancer. Approximately 15&#xD;
      centers across Canada, New Zealand and Australia are expected to participate. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      tetrodotoxin (30 µg b.i.d.) or placebo will be administered to 127 patients per group for&#xD;
      four consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be at least three weeks from the start of screening to the end of&#xD;
      analgesic response. Patients will be screened for the study and will enter a 4- to 7-day&#xD;
      baseline period within 28 days of screening. Following the baseline period, patients will&#xD;
      either be admitted to the hospital or be seen at the site's outpatient facility on a daily&#xD;
      basis. Patients will be randomized on Day 1 to receive study drug twice daily for four&#xD;
      consecutive days. After the treatment period, all patients will be seen again on Days 5, 8,&#xD;
      and 15 for further safety and efficacy evaluations, and then every two weeks until their pain&#xD;
      returns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 254 subjects (127 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in this study. The first&#xD;
      interim analysis is planned to adjust the sample size after 60 evaluable subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled, completed and data are available for analysis. A second interim analysis is planned&#xD;
      after 50% of subjects(110 evaluable subjects) have completed the study and data are available&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product 30 µg TTX (tetrodotoxin injectable) or an equivalent volume of&#xD;
      placebo, identical in appearance, injected subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments will include global pain intensity, component-specific pain intensity,&#xD;
      ATC and breakthrough analgesic use, impact of pain on physical functioning (general activity,&#xD;
      walking ability, or normal work), and emotional functioning (mood, relations with other&#xD;
      people, or enjoyment of life), impressions of change, onset of analgesic response, duration&#xD;
      of analgesic response, and time to peak analgesic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include adverse event reporting, vital signs, physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two co-primary endpoints will be analyzed in this study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary #1 (composite endpoint): Proportion of responders observed in each treatment arm&#xD;
      for the composite endpoint satisfying the following three components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a ≥30% decrease in mean pain intensity or a decrease of ≥50% of opioid use from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a ≥30% improvement of QOL in at least one descriptor of physical functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a ≥30% improvement of QOL in at least one descriptor of emotional functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary #2 (Pain intensity endpoint): Proportion of responders observed in each treatment&#xD;
      arm for reduction in pain intensity satisfying the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. a ≥30% decrease in mean pain intensity or a decrease of ≥50% of opioid use from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trends for differences between treatments will be individually tabulated for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact of pain on physical functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact of pain on emotional functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the proportion of responders in each treatment group will be made using the&#xD;
      Mantel-Haenszel procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety as assessed by the analysis of adverse events, abnormal laboratory results, and&#xD;
      abnormalities detected by 12-lead electrocardiogram.&#xD;
