      This study will examine how research volunteers experience their participation in studies in&#xD;
      order to develop surveys to be used by research centers trying to improve the experience of&#xD;
      their participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older who have participated in an NIH research protocol within the&#xD;
      past 2 years as someone with a medical condition under study may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight participants will participate in a moderator facilitated focus group in a discussion&#xD;
      about being in research studies. An observer audiotapes the discussion and takes written&#xD;
      notes. The focus group discussion lasts about 1 to 1 (Omega) hours.&#xD;

      The conduct of high quality clinical research is dependent on the ability to recruit and&#xD;
      retain subjects who are invested in, understand, and have confidence in the clinical research&#xD;
      process. Understanding subjects experiences as research volunteers is critical to the&#xD;
      continual improvement of the processes of clinical research and, subsequently, to enhancing&#xD;
      the subject s experience. Heretofore, studies evaluating the subject s comprehension of the&#xD;
      informed consent process have served as, at best, an indirect measure of the quality of the&#xD;
      subject s experience. Few, if any, studies have assessed the quality and efficacy of the&#xD;
      entire clinical research process from the subject s perspective. This study is the first&#xD;
      phase of a two-part study designed to directly measure research participants perceptions of&#xD;
      all aspects of the clinical research process (e.g., recruitment, informed consent, education,&#xD;
      autonomy and subject's rights, provision of clinical care) for the purposes of improving the&#xD;
      clinical research subject s experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining robust, validated data requires a partnership between those with expertise in the&#xD;
      design and analysis of surveys, and those who can articulate the needs of research&#xD;
      participants and improve the way in which clinical research is conducted. For the former, we&#xD;
      will be greatly advantaged by our partnership with NRC Picker, which has committed the&#xD;
      resources necessary to assist the survey project development; conduct the focus groups,&#xD;
      telephone interviews, and expert advisory group sessions required to further optimize the&#xD;
      survey; collaborate in the analysis; and fund the second-stage formal validation of the&#xD;
      survey. For the latter, we have assembled a collaborative team of research professionals from&#xD;
      the CTSA award recipient centers, and interested GCRCs, with expertise in human subject&#xD;
      protections, research ethics, research conduct, education and performance improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study entails the recruitment and conduct of up to a total of 22 Focus Groups,&#xD;
      each consisting of either 8-10 research subjects (12-16 groups) or 6-10 research&#xD;
      professionals (6 groups), in order achieve the first goal: to assess the key dimensions of&#xD;
      the research experience upon which to test the second part of the research, a perception of&#xD;
      the research experience survey. The current study will involve 8-11 academic medical centers,&#xD;
      enrolling a total of 100-128 research subjects, and 45-60 research professionals in total. A&#xD;
      second goal of the project is to describe the process, obstacles and successes of&#xD;
      implementing a multi-center protocol across the GCRCs and the CTSA consortium. A subsequent&#xD;
      research protocol will concern the fielding and validation of that survey in approximately&#xD;
      3,700 subjects at up to 10 academic medical centers (CTSA and GCRC awardees).&#xD;
