      The project's primary purpose is to establish a network of Hospice Palliative Care settings&#xD;
      using a common and consistent method of assessing and documenting bowel functioning in order&#xD;
      to be able to carry out future collaborative studies of constipation treatments. The&#xD;
      secondary goal is to gather normative data on current bowel care function and outcomes of&#xD;
      current treatments which can be used to determine sample size calculations for future&#xD;
      controlled trials of bowel management protocols. In order to complete this goal the project&#xD;
      requires a thorough assessment of current nursing practice in regard to bowel care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Site assessment: Each site will be assessed as to their current bowel assessment and&#xD;
      documentation methods, and their current bowel management strategy. Clinical practice leaders&#xD;
      (nursing and physician) will be interviewed, and as many of the nurses as can be contacted&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire about bowel care at their site, with some&#xD;
      focus groups being held in order to allow all staff to have input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review will be carried out to include at least 30 patients to establish&#xD;
      the current documentation standard and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of bowel care on nursing practice will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: As a result of the assessments at all the sites and in collaboration with the&#xD;
      site leaders, the research team will devise a common reporting and documentation system which&#xD;
      will enable systematic collection of bowel outcomes data. It is intended that the Victoria&#xD;
      Bowel Performance Scale will be introduced, in combination with other reporting tools&#xD;
      specific to bowel management. The tools may vary from site to site depending on the context&#xD;
      of care, for example an inpatient unit will have differing requirements to an outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. However the goal is for required outcome data to be retrievable from charts from all&#xD;
      settings in a consistent, complete and reliable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: Medical and nursing staff will be surveyed in the same way as in the initial&#xD;
      assessment (interviews, questionnaires and focus groups), to assess the performance and&#xD;
      acceptability of the modified reporting process. A second chart review will be undertaken&#xD;
      when at least 30 patients have passed through the service. Outcomes from the chart reviews&#xD;
      will be communicated back to care providers in order to give them feedback as to the quality&#xD;
      of bowel care they are providing. Any further modifications to the data tracking system will&#xD;
      be made so that by the end of the project the system is acceptable to all sites and&#xD;
      functioning effectively, allowing the network of collaborating sites to proceed to the next&#xD;
      step: clinical trials of different bowel care treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data recorded will be that required to determine comparability of cohorts with&#xD;
      respect to risk for constipation and will include the following variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palliative Performance Status (PPSv2) on admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis (if cancer, which tumour type)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major comorbid diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of abdominal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy during admission (if yes, to abdomen or not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications taken during admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days on bowel protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge or death&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for bowel function for each patient will be the proportion of&#xD;
      days with at least one bowel movement a day, and the proportion of patients with a bowel&#xD;
      movement at least 40 % and at least 50% of days. The secondary outcome variables of the study&#xD;
      will be use of enemas, suppositories or lactulose, and reported cramping and/or diarrhoea.&#xD;
      Diarrhoea will be defined as either passage of watery stool at least once a day, or more than&#xD;
      3 bowel movements a day. These were the same outcome variables used in the docusate study.&#xD;
      Sites will be grouped according to type of setting (hospice, PCU, home etc). Sites with very&#xD;
      similar patients will be combined for statistical analysis (for example the two Vancouver&#xD;
      residential hospices to which patients are referred through a common process and assigned to&#xD;
      according to bed availability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of the BPS will be assessed through a combination of questionnaires and focus&#xD;
      groups with staff at sites which elect to pilot it after reviewing the results of the initial&#xD;
      assessment. Their responses will be analysed using qualitative methodology. Staff will also&#xD;
      be asked at the end of the study whether or not they would prefer to continue to use the BPS&#xD;
      for routine clinical assessment or to revert to their previous method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The utility of the BPS as a suitable outcome measure for clinical trials of bowel management&#xD;
      treatments will be explored by correlating the single item BPS score with the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome variables. As scoring of the BPS is essentially a composite of multiple&#xD;
      outcome variables, (bowel movement frequency, consistency, degree of sphincter control and&#xD;
      associated symptoms such as cramping etc.) it is anticipated that the BPS will provide at&#xD;
      least the same outcome information as the multiple individual variables, which are rarely&#xD;
      fully documented. We hope that the BPS will provide more patient-centred and useful&#xD;
      information to guide laxative treatment, as the tool is centred around the individual's&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; bowel habit, rather than relying on arbitrarily defined norms. Data from all sites&#xD;
      will be able to be pooled for this analysis.&#xD;
