      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving erlotinib&#xD;
      together with docetaxel and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib given together with docetaxel and&#xD;
      radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with locally advanced squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma of the head and neck treated with erlotinib hydrochloride in combination with&#xD;
           docetaxel and radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine objective response rate, locoregional control rate, duration of response,&#xD;
           patterns of failure, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose and effect of this treatment on biologic correlates in tumor tissue&#xD;
           and/or surrounding mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for up to 2 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on week 3, patients receive docetaxel&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour once a week and radiotherapy (may be intensity-modulated) once daily for 8&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with N2 or greater cervical&#xD;
      lymph node involvement at baseline or with residual disease may undergo surgery. Patients&#xD;
      with persistent disease during study therapy undergo salvage surgery 6-12 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample, tissue biopsy, mucosal scraping, and saliva collection at&#xD;
      baseline and periodically during study. Samples are analyzed for markers of angiogenic&#xD;
      activity (VEGF, sVEGFR-2, sKIT, ICAM, and PDGF), pharmacokinetic studies, gene expression&#xD;
      profile, and human papilloma virus DNA by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients will be evaluated every 4-8 weeks for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then&#xD;
      once a year thereafter.&#xD;
