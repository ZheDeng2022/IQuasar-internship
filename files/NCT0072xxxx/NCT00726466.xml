  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efalizumab is an immunosuppressive recombinant humanized IgG1 monocolonal antibody (150 Kd)&#xD;
      that binds to human CD11a (1) and is used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Efalizumab&#xD;
      was derived from the humanization of the murine efalizuman monoclonal antibody MHM24, which&#xD;
      recognizes human and chimpanzee CD11a. Humanization of MHM24 was accomplished by grafting the&#xD;
      murine complementarity determining regions (hypervariable region) into consensus human IgG1/&#xD;
      heavy and light chain sequences (Werther et al 1996). These same consensus human&#xD;
      immunoglobulin sequences have been successfully used in the humanization of other murine&#xD;
      antibodies, including those targeted to HER2 and IgE. Efalizumab inhibits the binding of&#xD;
      LFA-1 to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) thereby inhibiting the adhesion of&#xD;
      leukocytes to other cell types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized, Fab fragment of a mouse monoclonal antibody targeted&#xD;
      against VEGF. As VEGF binds to cellular receptors, it stimulates angiogenesis and vascular&#xD;
      leakage. Blockade of VEGF by ranibizumab leads to reduced stimulation of cell proliferation&#xD;
      and permeability resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis and decreased leakage. Ranibizumab&#xD;
      intravitreal administration in neovascular AMD patients has been shown to effectively reduce&#xD;
      vascular leakage and growth of CNV and to stabilize or improve visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further improve visual acuity, a combination therapy using efalizumab and ranibizumab is&#xD;
      proposed. Efalizumab could target the adhesion factors that precede angiogenesis and improve&#xD;
      the outcome for AMD patients in combination with the anti-VEGF agent, Ranibizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, study of 0.5 mg intravitreal dose of Ranibizumab in combination with 1&#xD;
      mg/kg/wk subcutaneous dose of Efalizumab in in subjects with AMD. 10 subjects from 1 site&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. Subject accrual into the trial is expected to be completed&#xD;
      within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be evaluated monthly with a full ocular examination, visual acuity&#xD;
      measurement (ETDRS chart at distance of 4 meters), OCT, and adverse event monitoring.&#xD;
      Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and fundus photos will be done at BSL, Months 3, 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive efalizumab 1mg/kg weekly subcutaneous injections for 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Efalizumab injections can be self administered after an initial teaching session&#xD;
      in office on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive six initial doses of 0.5 mg/eye intravitreous monthly injections of&#xD;
      ranibizumab (Day 0, Months 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) with scheduled follow-up visits monthly for 12&#xD;
      months. Re-treatment after the first six injections will be on an as-needed basis, based on&#xD;
      predefined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase III studies of patients with primary or recurrent choroidal neovascularization&#xD;
           (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with repeated&#xD;
           intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab showed evidence for bioactivity,&#xD;
           safety, and tolerability (Rosenfeld 2006);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase III studies of patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated&#xD;
           with weekly subcutaneous efalizumab injections of 1mg/kg showed evidence for&#xD;
           bioactivity, safety, and tolerability (Dubertret 2006);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase I study of patients with uveitis treated with subcutaneous efalizumab injections&#xD;
           of 1mg/kg in patients with uveitic macular edema is currently enrolling&#xD;
           (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00280826)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination therapy of an iCAM-1 inhibitor and an anti-VEGF agent may offer increased&#xD;
           treatment benefit in the management of age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
