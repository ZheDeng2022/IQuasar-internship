      The purpose of this study is to test whether treatment with Aripiprazole leads to a reduction&#xD;
      in methamphetamine craving and use in patients diagnosed with methamphetamine dependence.&#xD;
      Patients presenting at the Omaha VA Medical Center for treatment of methamphetamine&#xD;
      dependence, and meet inclusion criteria for the study will be invited to participate.&#xD;
      Participation in the study will last for approximately 14 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine abuse and dependence have become a major health problem. The lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence rates for these disorders may be as high as 2-3% and can lead to significant&#xD;
      medical, psychiatric, and dental problems and can increase morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Methamphetamine abuse is a pattern of use that leads to problems in one or more areas of&#xD;
      life. Methamphetamine dependence is a more severe disorder, often involving biological&#xD;
      adaptations to the effects of methamphetamine, such as tolerance to or physical dependence on&#xD;
      methamphetamine, loss of control over its use (as noted by several failed attempts at&#xD;
      quitting, preoccupation with the next high, etc.), and maladaptive consequences secondary to&#xD;
      its excessive use, including the medical, legal, and social consequences of methamphetamine&#xD;
      intake. The lack of any FDA-approved medications for methamphetamine dependence has resulted&#xD;
      in an increased demand for research in the area of pharmacotherapy of this disorder. While&#xD;
      some medications have been studied in an exploratory fashion, there is still a great need for&#xD;
      more research in this area. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      aripiprazole (at a relatively low dose of 5-15 mg per day), as compared to placebo in a&#xD;
      prospective, double blinded study in participants with methamphetamine dependence, in&#xD;
      reducing the use and craving for methamphetamine. We expect that aripiprazole will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the use of methamphetamine as measured by the changed in the proportion&#xD;
      of participant's methamphetamine-free weeks. Secondary outcomes include; urine for&#xD;
      quantitative methamphetamine, self-report of methamphetamine use (as measured by the Time&#xD;
      Line Follow Back Scale - TLFB, and Brief Substance Craving Scale -BSCS), caving and use of&#xD;
      other substances over the course of the 12 week active treatment portion of the trial. A&#xD;
      secondary goal of this study will be to test the efficacy of the Interactive Voice Response&#xD;
      (IVR) technology to gather data from participants, and its correlation with the data on&#xD;
      methamphetamine and other substance use, craving, and medication adherence collected during&#xD;
      the weekly visits. Patient's mood and anxiety will be measured through the course of the&#xD;
      study using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), and&#xD;
      Quality of Life Index (QOLI). Safety measures will include the Abnormal Involuntary Movement&#xD;
      Scale (AIMS), Side Effects Checklist (SEC), Barnes Akathisia scale, Fasting Blood Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring, and patient weight monitoring.&#xD;
