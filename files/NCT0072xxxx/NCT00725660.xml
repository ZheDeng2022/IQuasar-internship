      BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia complicates about 2% of pregnancies. It accounts for at least 50&#xD;
      000 maternal deaths per year worldwide and is the second most common cause of maternal death&#xD;
      in the developing world. Also, Pre-eclampsia is the commonest cause of iatrogenic&#xD;
      prematurity, It frequently coexists with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and placental&#xD;
      abruption, other important causes of adverse prenatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many studies investigating whether the disease can be prevented. In order to&#xD;
      achieve this, one needs to be able to identify firstly those women that are at highest risk&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies showed that impedance to flow in the uterine arteries decreases with gestation&#xD;
      in normal pregnancies, while in pregnancies with established pre-eclampsia or IUGR the&#xD;
      impedance is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations led to a number of screening studies in the second trimester, which&#xD;
      assessed if it is possible to predict those pregnancies destined to have complications of&#xD;
      impaired placentation. These studies showed that women with increased impedance to uterine&#xD;
      artery blood flow have an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and detection can be&#xD;
      further increased by using angiogenic factors (That are involved in the pathogenesis of Pre-&#xD;
      eclampsia and could be useful for early prediction of the disease: VEGF, PIGF, PP13, sFLT1)&#xD;
      in combination with uterine arteries Doppler study in the second trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: In this study we would like to add uterine arteries Doppler to the early routine&#xD;
      detailed ultrasound examination (14-16 weeks), in 3000 women in Jerusalem. in addition we&#xD;
      would like to check angiogenic factors from the serum blood taken for the routine triple test&#xD;
      in these women (16-18 weeks).pregnancy outcome would be collected after labour from the&#xD;
      medical centers participating in this research.&#xD;
