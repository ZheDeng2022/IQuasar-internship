      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are at increased risk of developing tumors called&#xD;
      plexiform neurofibromas (PN) that arise from nerves. These tumors are usually non-cancerous,&#xD;
      but they can cause serious medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib was recently approved to treat patients with kidney cancer and is now being tested&#xD;
      in children with cancer. It affects several pathways thought to be important for the&#xD;
      development and growth of PN and may therefore shrink these tumors or slow their growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the highest dose of sorafenib that can safely be given to children and young&#xD;
      adults with PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the side effects of sorafenib in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how the body handles sorafenib by measuring the amount of drug in the bloodstream&#xD;
      over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine how the drug affects blood flow and blood cells and proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if sorafenib can shrink or slow the growth of PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of sorafenib on learning, attention, memory, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 3 and 18 years of age with NF1 who have inoperable PN that can cause&#xD;
      significant disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients take sorafenib tablets twice a day in 28-day treatment cycles. They may continue&#xD;
      treatment until their tumor grows or they develop unacceptable drug side effects. In this&#xD;
      dose escalation study, the dosage is increased with every 3 to 6 children who are enrolled&#xD;
      until the highest safe dose is determined. In any case, the dose will not exceed that used in&#xD;
      children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are monitored regularly with physical examinations, blood and urine tests, MRI scans&#xD;
      and quality-of-life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose bones are still growing have periodic x-rays of the hips and lower legs to&#xD;
      monitor for possible changes in the structure of growing bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have periodic tests of learning and memory before starting treatment and before&#xD;
      cycles 4, 12, 18 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have pharmacokinetic studies to examine how the body handles sorafenib. blood&#xD;
      samples are drawn before the first dose of sorafenib and then at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours,&#xD;
      3 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 10 to 12 hours, 24 hours and 30 to 36 hours following the first&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing tumors of&#xD;
           the central and peripheral nervous system, including plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which&#xD;
           are benign nerve sheath tumors that are among the most debilitating complications of&#xD;
           NF1. Plexiform neurofibromas may be congenital and appear to have the fastest growth&#xD;
           rate in young children. There are no standard treatment options for PN other than&#xD;
           surgery, which is often difficult due to the extensive growth and invasion of&#xD;
           surrounding tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plexiform neurofibromas are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells that lack NF1 gene&#xD;
           expression resulting in upregulation of Ras, which initiates several signaling cascades&#xD;
           regulating cell proliferation. In addition, PN over express epidermal and platelet&#xD;
           derived growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factors, which may&#xD;
           promote angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sorafenib, a novel orally bioavailable, bi-aryl urea, is a potent inhibitor of raf&#xD;
           kinase and a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is currently undergoing&#xD;
           evaluation in adult cancers, and may mediate anti-tumor effects in PN by several&#xD;
           mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral sorafenib administered daily to&#xD;
           pediatric patients with NF1 and inoperable PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the acute and chronic toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
           sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate for potential bone toxicities of sorafenib such as growth plate expansion&#xD;
           and growth retardation using automated volumetric MRI analysis of growth plates,&#xD;
           multiple measures for height and growth, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to evaluate&#xD;
           bone mineral density, and laboratory measurements for evaluation of bone turnover and&#xD;
           metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of sorafenib on the growth rate of PN, quality of life, and&#xD;
           cognitive function while on treatment with sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pediatric Patients (3-18 years) with NF1 and inoperable measurable PN that have the&#xD;
      potential to cause significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sorafenib will be administered orally BID on a continuous dosing schedule (28 days = 1&#xD;
           treatment cycle). Limited dose escalations will be performed to define the MTD based on&#xD;
           tolerability of sorafenib during the first three treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status will be evaluated using volumetric MRI analysis at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive function and quality of life outcomes will also be assessed in a pilot fashion&#xD;
           to define measures to be used in subsequent phase II trials.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: greater than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 18 years of age at the&#xD;
             time of study enrollment. The upper age limit is in place because early childhood and&#xD;
             puberty are considered to be the greatest risk for disease progression, and where&#xD;
             sorafenib may have the most benefit. In addition, an important objective of this study&#xD;
             is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in the pediatric population since&#xD;
             it has been well studied in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis: Patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs that have the potential to cause&#xD;
             significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that could&#xD;
             compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could&#xD;
             cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major&#xD;
             deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or significant cosmetic problems, lesions of the&#xD;
             extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions.&#xD;
             Histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent&#xD;
             clinical and radiographic findings, but should be considered if malignant degeneration&#xD;
             of a PN is clinically suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may&#xD;
             involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with&#xD;
             connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve. In addition to&#xD;
             PN, all study subjects must have either positive genetic testing for NF1 or have at&#xD;
             least one other diagnostic criterion for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus conference:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in prepubertal&#xD;
                  subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in post pubertal subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Optic glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first-degree relative with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion&#xD;
             of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Patients who underwent surgery for&#xD;
             resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is&#xD;
             measurable as per criteria above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior Therapy: Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is&#xD;
             not feasible, or if a patient with a surgical option refuses surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,&#xD;
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical&#xD;
                  therapy directed at their PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  May have received less than or equal to 1 myelosuppressive regimen for PN or&#xD;
                  other tumor manifestations associated with NF1 such as optic glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,&#xD;
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, or other VEGFR inhibitors are&#xD;
                  eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not&#xD;
                  have been administered within the past 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received prior medical therapy for their PN must have recovered from&#xD;
                  the toxic effects of all prior therapy before entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Performance status: Patients greater than 10 years of age must have a Karnofsky&#xD;
             performance level of greater than or equal to 50%, and children less than or equal to&#xD;
             10 years old must have a Lansky performance of greater than or equal to 50% (Appendix&#xD;
             I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hematologic Function: Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 1500/microl, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9g/dl, and platelet greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 100,000/microl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Coagulation: Patients must have adequate hemostatic function defined as PT and PTT&#xD;
             less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN. Patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation&#xD;
             for thrombosis are eligible if they meet criteria for adequate hemostatic function (PT&#xD;
             and PTT less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN) and thrombotic episode occurred 3 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Use of anticoagulants or thrombolytics for care and maintenance&#xD;
             of central venous catheters is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Hepatic Function: Patients must have bilirubin within the upper limit of normal for&#xD;
             age, and ALT within the upper limit of normal for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serum lipase and amylase within upper limits of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Renal Function: Patients must have a creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 60ml/min/1.73 m(2) or a normal serum creatinine based on age&#xD;
             described in the table below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years) less than or equal to 5 Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years) 5 less than or equal to 10 Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 1.0&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years) 10 less than or equal to 15 Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 1.2&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years) greater than 15 Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood pressure: Patients must have a systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than&#xD;
             95th percentile for age and gender (Appendix II) measured as described in section 2.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine&#xD;
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent&#xD;
             from all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years old).&#xD;
             When appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions. This can be&#xD;
             accomplished through one of the following mechanisms: a) the NCI, POB screening&#xD;
             protocol, b) an IRB-approved institutional screening protocol or c) the study-specific&#xD;
             protocol. Documentation of the informed consent for screening will be maintained in&#xD;
             the patient s research chart. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical&#xD;
             indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for baseline values&#xD;
             even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): All patients greater than 18 years of age will be&#xD;
             offered the opportunity to assign DPA so that another person can make decisions about&#xD;
             their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to risks of fetal and teratogenic&#xD;
             adverse events as seen animal studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to&#xD;

             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sorafenib is predominantly metabolized via CYP3A4, and patients who take cytochrome&#xD;
