      This study focuses on the validation of the Adaptation Index instrument as a measurement of&#xD;
      adaptive behaviors used to reduce symptoms of FI and to describe the use of adaptive&#xD;
      behaviors among women with FI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is common knowledge that women with pelvic floor dysfunction will develop, initiate and&#xD;
      adopt behaviors which mitigate their symptoms or impairment. For some women, this involves&#xD;
      wearing a pad and for others, knowledge of restroom locations. Little is known about the role&#xD;
      of such behaviors in helping women adapt to urinary incontinence (UI), pelvic organ prolapse&#xD;
      (POP), or fecal incontinence (FI). Additionally, there are no studies that address the&#xD;
      persistence of these behaviors following treatment as measured by traditional outcomes.&#xD;
      Results of a pilot study that assessed quality of life (QOL) in women with pelvic floor&#xD;
      disorders (PFD) indicated that women relied heavily on behavioral adaptation in order to cope&#xD;
      with PFD symptoms. Subsequently, a draft Adaptation Index was developed with input from&#xD;
      investigators of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN). This measure was further refined&#xD;
      by focus groups as part of the 1J06 protocol. The 1J06 study is investigating the properties&#xD;
      of this tool in subjects with UI and POP. This study focuses on the validation of this&#xD;
      instrument as a measurement of adaptive behaviors used to reduce symptoms of FI and to&#xD;
      describe the use of adaptive behaviors among women with FI.&#xD;
