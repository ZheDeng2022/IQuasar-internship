  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most frequent neoplasm of the women in Taiwan and in the world.&#xD;
      Cervical cancer affects half a million women each year and results in about 200,000 worldwide&#xD;
      and it also influences about 2,700 women and about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each&#xD;
      year and in Taiwan. There is strong evidence suggesting that this cancer is 100% attributable&#xD;
      to infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV); in fact, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) has very recently recognized that this cancer is caused by HPV. There are&#xD;
      around 100 different HPV-types, of which around 40 types infecting the anogenital tract and&#xD;
      causing cervical lesions and cervical cancer have been called High Risk HPV (i.e., HR-HPV-16,&#xD;
      -18, -31, -33, and -58). From recent years, there is compelling evidence that infection with&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in most virus induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role&#xD;
      in clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by both&#xD;
      epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune compromised patients such as HIV infected&#xD;
      women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering other forms of malignancies, are&#xD;
      at higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Moreover, several&#xD;
      studies establish the existence of natural HPV-specific immunity in humans. Immune responses&#xD;
      of the host are indeed critical in the virus-related infectious diseases. The immune response&#xD;
      against HPV antigens is Human leukocyte antigen restricted. Consequently, the HLA class I and&#xD;
      II phenotype may be correlated with an effective immune response against HPV associated&#xD;
      cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign antigen, such as those&#xD;
      contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be proposed to affect the risk of&#xD;
      developing cervical cancer. Studies by different groups on associations between certain HLA&#xD;
      alleles and susceptibility to, or protection against CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma,&#xD;
      reveal varying conclusions and warrant further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most potentially oncogenic, persistent, long-term HPV infections induce an antibody response&#xD;
      against virus proteins which can be detected by ELISA test and can be a good indicator of&#xD;
      past as well as current infections and chronic active infection, associated with the presence&#xD;
      of cervical lesions and the high risk of acquiring cervical cancer. In fact, it has been&#xD;
      reported that women who are seropositive for HPV-16 present a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      cervical carcinoma than seronegative women. L1-viral capsid proteins are one of the targets&#xD;
      for antibodies induced by persistent HPV genital infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The L1 protein represents more than 90% of the total protein on the surface of the virus.&#xD;
      This protein is able to assemble itself, forming virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs, mainly&#xD;
      type 16, have been broadly used for studying the antibody response induced by genital&#xD;
      HPVinfection. The VLP-antibody presence is stable in time, correlated with the number of&#xD;
      sexual partners, and associated with persistent infection, viral load, and development of&#xD;
      neoplasic lesions; this is rarely found in patients suffering from transitory infections.&#xD;
      Seropositivity occurs more frequently in patients who have progressed to CIN III and invasive&#xD;
      cancer than in those suffering from CIN I or CIN II and the antibody response is&#xD;
      significantly higher in women having a higher viral load than those with lower viral load.&#xD;
      Prospective studies have shown that 70-90% of HPV-16 infected women are seroconverted between&#xD;
      6 and 18 months after HPV DNA has been detected and that this rarely occurs in patients&#xD;
      detected as having transient HPV DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, other serological studies have shown that 20-50% of women suffering from&#xD;
      HPV-associated lesions, with HPV DNA presence, do not present detectable levels of anti-VLP&#xD;
      antibodies; this is in part due to the lack of an optimized test and the fact that these&#xD;
      antibodies reactivity is type-specific for the virus. An optimized VLP-based ELISA test has&#xD;
      been recently reported showing 93% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity for discriminating&#xD;
      between positive and negative control sera. However, there was no report to evaluate the&#xD;
      antibody response in patients with HPV-infected cervical lesions and with the prognosis of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So in the present proposal, we would like to examine the anti-L1 antibodies of various HPV&#xD;
      types among Taiwanese women with HPV-related CIN or cervical cancer. The purposes of this&#xD;
      proposal are 1) to address the immunologic responses to HPV between CIN and cervical cancer&#xD;
      patients. , 2) to elucidate the correlation between immunologic responses to HPV and disease&#xD;
      severity of cervical cancer., 3) to evaluate the correlation between immunologic responses to&#xD;
      HPV and the prognosis of cervical cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples of patients' sera were collected on the day of surgery. 2. The sera samples were&#xD;
      freezedon -200C until analyzed. 3. The sera samples will be shipped to the Lab. of Merck&#xD;
      company in US. 4. HPV Serologic Assay A competitive radioimmunoassay developed by Merck&#xD;
      Research Laboratories will be was used and perform to quantitate serum HPV- 6, 11, 16, 18,&#xD;
      31, 33, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, or 68 antibodies in Merck Research Laboratories (12). Results&#xD;
      will be read from a standard curve, corrected for dilution, and reported in arbitrary units&#xD;
      (milli-Merck Units, or mMU per milliliter). A fixed cutoff of 5.9 mMU per milliliter (derived&#xD;
      by repeatedly testing a panel of positive and negative samples against the standard curve)&#xD;
      will be used to determine the HPV-6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, or 68 serologic&#xD;
      status of the women.&#xD;
