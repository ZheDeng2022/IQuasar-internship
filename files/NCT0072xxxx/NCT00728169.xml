  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify community resources and challenges in improving the&#xD;
      health of community members with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this project is to use Community-Based Participatory Research methodology&#xD;
      to develop interventions aimed at improving asthma management in high-risk African American&#xD;
      asthmatics. This &quot;ground-up&quot; longterm approach has never been tested before in asthmatics.&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study will be accomplished with four specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Conduct focus groups to identify barriers to asthma management in the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Use a community advisory board (CAB) consisting of participants selected from the&#xD;
      various focus groups to gather information about solutions for the above barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Use the information from the CAB to develop an intervention to improve asthma self&#xD;
      management behaviors in the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Refine the developed intervention based on feedback from focus groups conducted in Aim&#xD;
      1.&#xD;

      Volunteer will be asked to respond to several questions that address their perceptions about&#xD;
      asthma. Volunteers will also be asked to discuss their beliefs about asthma. Everyone in the&#xD;
      group will be given an opportunity to answer questions. Volunteers can decide that they no&#xD;
      longer want to participate in the group discussion at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discussion will last from 1.5 - 2 hours. The focus group discussion will have a maximum&#xD;
      of 10 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be audio and video taping the discussion so that we do not miss any information that&#xD;
      volunteers share with us. The audio and video tapes will not be shared with anyone outside&#xD;
      our staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteer participation in this study is voluntary and there will be no negative consequences&#xD;
      if volunteers decide not to participate. Volunteers are also free to withdraw from this study&#xD;
      at any time. Withdrawal or refusal to participate will not affect health care services or&#xD;
      other rights.&#xD;
