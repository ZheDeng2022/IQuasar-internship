      The purpose of this study is to find out if certain types of Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanning&#xD;
      will help to better detect markers in the brain that are related to the neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A small percentage of patients who have this&#xD;
      type of lupus experience symptoms that may result from a blood clot or change in blood vessel&#xD;
      structure in the brain. These neuropsychiatric symptoms can include an inability to think&#xD;
      clearly, a change in level of awake and/or awareness, and in the worst cases, seizure and&#xD;
      stroke. Another goal of the study is to find out if individuals with fibromyalgia (FM), or&#xD;
      chronic pain, have symptom-related markers in any of these scans as well. Better and earlier&#xD;
      detection of markers that are related to acute neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) and FM will be&#xD;
      helpful to all who are affected by these diseases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE with neuropsychiatric&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have recent onset of neurological symptoms that have been active within the last 14&#xD;
             days. The criteria for NPSLE study patients will be a clinically significant&#xD;
             neurologic examination which, in the opinion of the treating physician, may be due to&#xD;
             SLE and requires MRI evaluation. Patients will be classified according to the&#xD;
             nomenclature recommended by the ACR on Neuropsychiatric Manifestations in SLE, and&#xD;
             further classified as &quot;focal,&quot; &quot;nonfocal,&quot; or &quot;seizure&quot; [68].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to complete all study procedures and sign the informed consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Report no neurological symptoms at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients meeting the baseline criteria will be sequentially enrolled from the&#xD;
             Lupus Cohort. Recruitment will be adjusted to include equal numbers of APA positive&#xD;
             and APA negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet the established ACR criteria for FM [69].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to complete all study procedures associated with baseline&#xD;
             scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those SLE patients with acute onset of neurological symptoms with duration longer than&#xD;
             14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are left-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who meet 1990 ACR criteria for FM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have acute onset of neurological symptoms related to SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are left-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who meet ACR criteria for FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid medical illnesses capable of causing a worsening of physical functional&#xD;
             status independent of the diagnosis (e.g., morbid obesity), autoimmune diseases other&#xD;
             than SLE cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g., angina, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             COPD(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), chronic asthma), uncontrolled endocrine&#xD;
             or allergic disorders (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, Type I diabetes), and malignancy&#xD;
             within 2 years, excluding successfully treated squamous or basal skin carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any present psychiatric disorder involving a history of psychosis (e.g.,&#xD;
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional&#xD;
             disorder, etc.), current suicide risk or attempt within 2 years of the study, or&#xD;
             substance abuse within 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with mood disorders will not be excluded.&#xD;
