    <textblock>
      We will iteratively adapt and modify the NC woman-focused intervention (Women's CoOp),&#xD;
      including the field manual and instrumentation, to focus on pregnant African-American women&#xD;
      who abuse crack, are currently in substance abuse treatment, and are at risk for HIV or are&#xD;
      HIV positive. We then will test the newly developed intervention in a Stage IB pilot-sized&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) in a traditional substance abuse treatment clinic to&#xD;
      determine (a) feasibility; (b) relative efficacy compared with substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (TAU), across several domains of functioning (e.g., substance use, HIV&#xD;
      risk behaviors); and (c) the intervention's potential mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this Stage IA/B study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To adapt the culturally specific, manualized woman-focused intervention to&#xD;
      specifically address issues of pregnancy and substance abuse, relationships with men, social&#xD;
      support, parenting, HIV status, living with HIV, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, and HIV&#xD;
      risk-reduction methods for pregnant and postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To compare the relative efficacy of the woman-focused intervention for pregnant women&#xD;
      relative to standard substance abuse treatment to sustain reductions in substance abuse and&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviors, maintain retention in drug treatment, reduce violence, and improve&#xD;
      prenatal care and ARV treatment adherence (as needed) at 3- and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To explore the intervention's potential mechanisms of action (e.g., by examining the&#xD;
      mediating effects of changes in knowledge about HIV risk behaviors, psychological distress,&#xD;
      readiness for change) and moderating factors (e.g., HIV status, age, stage of pregnancy,&#xD;
      relationships with men) that may influence response to the treatment.&#xD;

      3. Estimated Enrollment: Can this be changed to 59 (the final enrollment)? Also, is there a&#xD;
      way to change &quot;Estimated&quot; to &quot;Final&quot; or something more definite? 4. Study Start Date: Can&#xD;
      this be changed to May 2007? 5. Study Completion: February 2009 (I know this date differs&#xD;
      from the date in the email I sent earlier when I responded to your questions. Sorry, but this&#xD;
      is the correct date to use) 6. Detailed Description: Can the current text be replaced with&#xD;
      the following?&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH: During Stage 1A, the team conducted a series of separate focus groups with an&#xD;
      expert panel (including researchers, clinicians, and service providers); our Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board; HIV+, substance-using, postpartum women; and HIV-, substance-using,&#xD;
      postpartum women. We first inquired about how we could adapt the existing measures in the&#xD;
      instrumentation, adapt the intervention to address issues of substance-using women who were&#xD;
      pregnant, and determine the fidelity of its delivery. After this first set of focus groups,&#xD;
      the Woman-Focused manual, measures, and intervention were revised to reflect new adaptations.&#xD;
      Then the second set of focus groups with the same members were conducted for review of these&#xD;
      materials and fidelity measures. Feedback was solicited to verify our adaptations and then it&#xD;
      was pretested to further refine and finalize the manual and measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Stage 1B, we recruited 59 women from treatment facilities in North Carolina. We&#xD;
      marketed the study through a brochure as women entered the treatment programs. We also&#xD;
      utilized existing outreach efforts for substance abusers at risk for HIV. Women who were&#xD;
      eligible and consented to participate in the study gave a urine sample to assess drug use and&#xD;
      take part in a 1½ hour ACASI interview. Topics included demographics, drug use, substance&#xD;
      abuse treatment, physical health, sexual behavior, mental health, employment history, and&#xD;
      criminal history. Once they completed the interview, the women were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the women's intervention condition or a treatment as usual condition. Once randomized,&#xD;
      women in the woman-focused intervention were asked to complete four one-hour intervention&#xD;
      sessions within a month that included a personalized assessment and a personal action plan.&#xD;
      As part of the second session, woman-focused intervention participants were offered HIV&#xD;
      testing. Women in the TAU condition received the traditional substance abuse treatment&#xD;
      services. Women in both groups were also assessed at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Measures&#xD;
      included behavioral outcomes, satisfaction with the intervention, and services received.&#xD;
