    <textblock>
      Inadequate feeding of infants and toddlers impairs physical and cognitive development and is&#xD;
      a major contributor to early childhood infectious disease illnesses and preventable&#xD;
      mortality. Optimal feeding has two broad components: Exclusive breast feeding (EBF) for the&#xD;
      first-6 months followed by continued breast feeding accompanied by complementary foods (CF)&#xD;
      that is adequate in quantity and quality. While EBF is theoretically straightforward, CF is&#xD;
      more complex. This is because CF is typically limited mainly or entirely to plant-based foods&#xD;
      in developing countries worldwide. Dependence on adequate, affordable locally-produced foods&#xD;
      for complete CF requires an inexpensive, regular source of meat especially to provide&#xD;
      'problem' micronutrients, notably, but not only, zinc and bioavailable iron. While the use of&#xD;
      micronutrient-fortified CF and of supplements, including SprinklesTM, is spreading, their&#xD;
      efficacy largely remains uncertain as does their availability, particularly on a sustainable,&#xD;
      affordable basis Achievement of the widespread regular use of meat as a CF requires: (1)&#xD;
      adequate local production of affordable small scavenging/foraging animals in poor rural and,&#xD;
      where feasible, periurban communities worldwide; (2) effective communication for behavioral&#xD;
      change/education so that young children, starting at age 6 months (when meat is readily&#xD;
      accepted by infants), receive priority in the use of this meat. Solid scientific evidence of&#xD;
      the value of international/national programs to achieve this goal is essential to provide the&#xD;
      basis and incentive for major international and national programs to promote the feeding of&#xD;
      meat as an early and regular CF. The acquisition of such evidence is the goal of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention to be evaluated is meat fed daily as a complementary food from age 6-18&#xD;
      months. Thirty infants-toddlers in each of 60 rural communities (total of 1,800 subjects)&#xD;
      will participate. In a cluster design, twenty communities (test) will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive meat,twenty communities (control) will receive a plant recipe providing the same&#xD;
      amount of calories, twenty communities (fortified cereal) will receive a commercially&#xD;
      available fortified cereal providing the same amount of calories. This project will be&#xD;
      located in rural China in a county where high quality collaboration is already established,&#xD;
      and where we have recently demonstrated inadequate bioavailable zinc intake and zinc&#xD;
      deficiency in toddlers. We have also found a high (30%) incidence of stunting, now widely&#xD;
      used as an indirect indicator of populations with zinc deficiency. Other advantages of this&#xD;
      location include the willingness of doctors located in each rural community to provide the&#xD;
      test or control meal 7 days per week in their homes and the absence of any access to&#xD;
      supplements / fortified products which could complicate interpretation of data. The young&#xD;
      children in the test communities will receive certified safe lean pork 7 days per wk.&#xD;
      Starting with a very small quantity at 6 months, the quantity of lean pork will be increased&#xD;
      as infants are ready to take more up to a plateau of 2 oz/d. No subsequent increases are&#xD;
      planned because neither zinc nor iron requirements increase from 6-11 months to 12-18 months.&#xD;
      Lean pork will be used because pigs are ubiquitous in China and can be maintained cheaply by&#xD;
      scavenging/foraging on waste materials adjacent to human habitation. Test and control&#xD;
      clusters will also receive nutrition education to achieve maximal diversification of locally&#xD;
      available affordable foods. Longitudinal outcome measures include indices of physical growth,&#xD;
      especially length; infectious disease incidence and prevalence; cognitive development; zinc&#xD;
      and iron intake and biomarkers for these and other micronutrients. Zinc absorption will be&#xD;
      measured. Data will flow daily from communities to the district hospital in Xi-Chou, weekly&#xD;
      to the data manager in Shanghai and 3-monthly to the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) and&#xD;
      to the University of Colorado research group.&#xD;

      Objectives The goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of a daily intake of locally&#xD;
      available, low cost meat as a complementary food for young children aged 6-18 months who are&#xD;
      otherwise dependent on continued breast feeding and locally available non-fortified plant&#xD;
      foods only. Efficacy will be determined by public health outcomes, including infectious&#xD;
      disease morbidity and both physical and cognitive development, with linear growth as the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure. Other outcome measures required for interpretation of these results&#xD;
      are food and nutrient intake; biomarkers of key micronutrient status; zinc absorption and&#xD;
      measures of host factor that might compromise the effects of optimizing nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Inadequate complementary feeding (CF) is a major contributor to preventable&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in young children in the developing world. Except in emergency&#xD;
      situations, inadequate macronutrient intake is largely attributable to lack of adequate&#xD;
      maternal knowledge, while optimal micronutrient intake depends on food diversity. Though food&#xD;
      fortification programs can diminish or possibly eradicate the need for food diversity,&#xD;
      reliable sources of affordable fortified foods/supplements are frequently unavailable and&#xD;
      their efficacy not always certain. Locally grown, nutritionally complete affordable sources&#xD;
      of CF are and will remain a key strategy especially for the millions of rural poor. Adequate&#xD;
      food diversity depends on meat to provide adequate zinc and also a favorable source of&#xD;
      bioavailable iron, in addition to assuring sufficient intake of other key micronutrients,&#xD;
      e.g. vitamin B12. Meat's theoretical benefits in CF have not, however, been tested&#xD;
      adequately. Clear demonstration of public health benefits is essential to support policies to&#xD;
      promote local production of adequate, affordable small foraging animals with priority use for&#xD;
      older infants/toddlers. The long-term goal is to achieve nutritionally complete complementary&#xD;
      feeding from affordable local sources for millions of poor rural/semi-rural young children&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The project is an unmasked randomized controlled trial with cluster design in which&#xD;
      60 rural village communities, each with 30 infants, within the County of Xi-Chou, Wen-Shan,&#xD;
      Yunnan Province, SW China will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
      control clusters. The intervention will be meat fed daily from age 6-18 months. Control&#xD;
      participants will receive an equi-caloric rice-based supplement or a commercially available&#xD;
      fortified rice cereal. The intervention team will include 80 community doctors, supervised&#xD;
      and supported by senior staff at Xi-Chou Women's and Children's Hospital. This senior staff&#xD;
      will be also be responsible for purchasing and quality of intervention foods. The&#xD;
      intervention meat will be certified safe pork, because pigs are ubiquitous in rural China and&#xD;
      can be maintained cheaply by foraging/scavenging. Lean pork, which will be increased as&#xD;
      accepted up to a plateau of 2 oz/d, will be provided as a meat-rice recipe daily in the&#xD;
      community doctors' homes; any food remaining will be fed at home later in the day. Control&#xD;
      children will receive a daily plant-based recipe or fortified rice cereal also in their&#xD;
      community doctors' homes. Starting at the time of recruitment at age 3 months, monthly&#xD;
      nutrition education messages will be given to mothers. Initially focusing on exclusive breast&#xD;
      feeding; after 6 months of age, education for both test and control clusters will focus on&#xD;
      optimizing diversity of locally available, affordable complementary foods and on responsive&#xD;
      feeding (messages designed to increase energy intake are not required in this population).&#xD;
      Specially trained local and Shanghai health research teams will obtain longitudinal outcome&#xD;
      measures between 6-18 months. Outcomes include: anthropometry at 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months;&#xD;
      daily records of infectious disease morbidity (kept by community doctors); Bayley Scales of&#xD;
      Infant Development III at 6, 12, 18 months plus the WHO motor questionnaire; 24-hr dietary&#xD;
      recall data at 6, 7, 9, 12, 15 18 months; biomarkers and, on a subsample, measurements of&#xD;
      zinc absorption and gut function at 6, 9 and 18 months. Data will be transferred daily to the&#xD;
      local research base at Xi-Chou Women and Children's Hospital, checked for accuracy and&#xD;
      entered into the data management system. These data will be transferred weekly to the data&#xD;
      manager in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Xin-Hua Hospital. Data will be&#xD;
      collated and shared with the Colorado research group at 3-monthly intervals. SAS software&#xD;
      will be used for a range of outcome-specific statistical measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Positive outcomes for meat group versus controls will provide scientific&#xD;
      justification for promotion of production of affordable small animal meats globally in&#xD;
      rural/semi-rural and even peri-urban communities and of communication for behavioral&#xD;
      change/education to provide meat as a regular complementary feed from age 6 months.&#xD;
