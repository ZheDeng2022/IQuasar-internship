      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The primary objective is to delineate the brain structures that are involved in pain using&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will result in increases in metabolism and neuronal activity in specific delineated&#xD;
      areas of the brain.&#xD;

      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advancement in pain management, pain relief and patient satisfaction are still&#xD;
      inadequate in many patients. Functional imaging techniques have recently made it possible to&#xD;
      identify the main cerebral components of the human nociceptive system. These comprise at&#xD;
      least two main human nociceptive components working in parallel called the medial and lateral&#xD;
      pain systems. This has provided a physical construct for the concept of the human pain&#xD;
      matrix. Careful study of these areas of the human brain has the potential to drive&#xD;
      development of new classes of analgesic compounds. PET is an imaging technique that can&#xD;
      quantify increases in nerve cell activity in selective regions of the brain (1-5). PET&#xD;
      provides the means to measure tissue concentrations of labeled drugs in brain and other&#xD;
      tissues and also to measure changes in receptor occupancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies have examined the pattern of increased brain activity that follows&#xD;
      experimentally-induced acute pain (2) and chronic pain syndromes (1,3,5). Distal pain&#xD;
      pathways (e.g. spinothalamic tract) project to the thalamus and then discrete regions of the&#xD;
      cortex via thalamocortical projections. Among cortical areas involved in sensation,&#xD;
      perception, and attention in both humans and monkeys are anterior cingulate gyrus, insular&#xD;
      cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex. PET studies with&#xD;
      experimental human pain also demonstrate activation in brain areas related to sensory-motor&#xD;
      integration. However, depending on the type of noxious stimulation, different areas of brain&#xD;
      are activated (2). Components of the lateral system such as the primary somatosensory (SI)&#xD;
      cortex do appear to be frequently activated with tonic (non-phasic experimental pain) and&#xD;
      phasic pain (67% and 69% of studies show activations, respectively). But only 23% of studies&#xD;
      of chronic clinical pain studies demonstrate activation of SI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have performed the first clinical study (IRB study #05121504) to investigate the change in&#xD;
      brain activity associated with significant postoperative pain (6). This was an IRB-approved&#xD;
      study with just one patient to establish that the methods we have developed will be sensitive&#xD;
      enough for a more complete randomized clinical trial. We determined that postsurgical pain is&#xD;
      associated with increased activity in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex. Other&#xD;
      brain regions showing increased postsurgical activity were the contralateral parietal cortex,&#xD;
      bilateral pulvinar and ipsilateral medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, contralateral&#xD;
      putamen, contralateral superior temporal gyrus, ipsilateral fusiform gyrus, ipsilateral&#xD;
      posterior lobe and contralateral anterior cerebellar lobe. We have received permission from&#xD;
      the IRB to perform a larger study with 21 patients (IRB study #07050273).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although fMRI has also been used for functional brain imaging, the advantages of PET over&#xD;
      fMRI are (7):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET is detected in neural tissue, while fMRI is detected in the venous compartment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PET with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) gives a direct measure of glucose metabolism,&#xD;
           while fMRI measures blood flow by measuring changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PET has a larger signal-to-noise ratio than fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PET is less susceptible to movement artifacts than fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. With PET for brain only the head is in the scanner, less claustrophobic than fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. PET does not have the inhomogeneity artifacts of fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. PET has the capacity for future ligand-binding studies (e.g. opioid receptor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparable brain imaging studies have not been performed in primates due to the difficulty of&#xD;
      having an animal not move for the duration of the scan, without the use of anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better interpret our PET brain images in the above clinical trials, we need more baseline&#xD;
      data on the variability in brain activation from person-to person, especially in people with&#xD;
      no or minimal pain. Clinical oncology utilizes PET imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring&#xD;
      of many types of cancer, e.g. Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. The&#xD;
      brain of these individuals can be considered within normal range and could be a control for&#xD;
      our other studies involving postoperative pain and its alleviation. To obtain these 'control'&#xD;
      brain scans, a patient being scanned for diseases outside the brain would not have to have an&#xD;
      additional radionuclide injection. Instead, after the primary body scan is completed, the&#xD;
      patient platform would be moved slightly so the head is now centered in the scanner, and the&#xD;
      scanning process resumed, for approximately 20 minutes. Since the half-life of the FDG&#xD;
      radionuclide is about 110 min, there will still be adequate signal available to be picked up&#xD;
      by the detector during this secondary scan.&#xD;
