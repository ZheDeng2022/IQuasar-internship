    <textblock>
      Different pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the development of chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders. Pain pathways are triggered in part by ectopic discharges of voltage-sensitive&#xD;
      sodium channels, which are in abundance in both the peripheral and the central nervous&#xD;
      systems. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a selective blocker of Na+ channels and causes analgesia&#xD;
      either by decreasing the propagation of action potentials by Na+ channels and/or by blocking&#xD;
      of ectopic discharges associated with chronic pain. TTX is extracted from the puffer fish&#xD;
      (fugu). Results from animal pharmacology studies revealed that TTX is a more potent analgesic&#xD;
      than standard analgesic agents such as aspirin, morphine or meperidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the management of severe cancer pain generally includes the use of opiates. This&#xD;
      can often result in undesirable side effects, and treatment with this type of medication is&#xD;
      not always effective. Because currently available pain-relieving therapy is unsatisfactory&#xD;
      for many patients, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches for the management of&#xD;
      moderate or severe cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies indicate that intramuscular (into a muscle) or subcutaneous (under the skin)&#xD;
      injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) may reduce pain in cancer patients who did not respond to&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposed study (TEC-006OL) is designed to provide the option for all patients who&#xD;
      participated in the TEC-006 study (both tetrodotoxin and placebo-treated) to receive or&#xD;
      continue to receive tetrodotoxin treatment.&#xD;

      Study Objectives: In cancer patients with moderate to severe pain who participated in the&#xD;
      TEC-006 study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the long-term efficacy of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment in&#xD;
           reducing the pain outcome and improving the quality of life (physical and emotional&#xD;
           functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin (TTX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the duration of analgesia following repeated cycles of tetrodotoxin (TTX)&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicentre, open-label, continuation trial of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      tetrodotoxin in patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe pain associated with&#xD;
      cancer. All patients who participated in the TEC-006 study (tetrodotoxin and&#xD;
      placebo-treated), who would like to continue with tetrodotoxin treatment and meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, are eligible to receive the First Treatment Cycle for this&#xD;
      continuation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at all centres participating in the TEC-006 study. Patients may&#xD;
      receive repeated cycles of treatment with tetrodotoxin. Each Treatment Cycle will consist of&#xD;
      4 days of treatment with 30 μg b.i.d. of tetrodotoxin injected subcutaneously. Each Treatment&#xD;
      Cycle will last from the start of treatment to the end of the analgesic response. All&#xD;
      patients completing the first Treatment Cycle in this protocol must meet the criteria of the&#xD;
      Responder (First TEC-006OL Treatment Cycle) definition in order to be eligible for a second&#xD;
      Treatment Cycle. Patient eligibility for all subsequent Treatment Cycles will be determined&#xD;
      using the eligibility criteria for a Repeated Treatment Cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30ug TTX(Tetrodotoxin injectable) injected subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worst pain in last 24 hours, average pain in last 24 hours, and/or component-specific pain&#xD;
      intensity in last 24 hours, ATC and breakthrough analgesic use, impact of pain on physical&#xD;
      functioning (general activity, walking ability, or normal work), and emotional functioning&#xD;
      (mood, relations with other people, or enjoyment of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include adverse event reporting, vitals signs, physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial analysis of results of the TEC-006OL study will be completed in parallel with the&#xD;
      TEC-006 study. Further periodic analyses will be completed every 6 months until the study is&#xD;
      closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy and safety analyses will be performed for subjects that are dosed at least once&#xD;
      in protocol TEC-006OL. All analyses performed will be descriptive. No statistics involving&#xD;
      hypothesis testing will be performed.&#xD;
