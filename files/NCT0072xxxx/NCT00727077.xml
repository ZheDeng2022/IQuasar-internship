      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Intron A (3 Mio I.E./m2, 3&#xD;
      times per week) and Rebetol (15 mg/kg/day) in children aged 3 to 17, treated in common&#xD;
      medical practice at 10 sites in Germany. The primary objective is to determine if there are&#xD;
      any new severe adverse events observed with this recently approved dosing regimen. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the rates of eradication of the HCV virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was terminated due to low enrollment. At the time of termination, 3 participants&#xD;
      had enrolled. Therefore, these 3 participants transferred into study P04538 (NCT00727077) and&#xD;
      will be included in the P04538 (NCT00727077) data reporting.&#xD;
