    <textblock>
      The PRESILLION Study is a non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety of an approved Cobalt Chromium bare metal stent system for the treatment of ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease attributable to a stenotic de novo lesion in a native coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 100 patients with up to two de novo native coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions with a maximum lesion length of 30mm in a maximum of two major coronary arteries with&#xD;
      reference vessel diameter &gt;= 2.5mm and &lt;= 4.0mm by visual estimation. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 1 month and 6 month post-procedure for assessment of MACE and all other adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PRESILLION Stent System is intended for use in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease attributable to stenotic de novo lesions of native coronary arteries with reference&#xD;
      vessel diameter from 2.5 mm to 4.0 mm with a lesion length up to 30 mm that are amenable to&#xD;
      percutaneous treatment with coronary stenting. The stent is intended as a permanent implanted&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the PRESILLION Stent System&#xD;
      in the treatment of de novo stenotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The primary safety&#xD;
      measure is the composite of MACE up to one (1) month follow up. The MACE rate shall meet the&#xD;
      performance goal for bare metal stents in order to show the safety of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been amended and data will be collected for a time point as close as&#xD;
      possible to (but after) the 6 months post index procedure in a non-interventional and&#xD;
      retrospective manner. The data point will contain exactly the same follow-up information as&#xD;
      was collected during the 1 month follow-up.&#xD;
