        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a&#xD;
             post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. -&#xD;
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt,&#xD;
             HRT should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can&#xD;
             suppress FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg for men and ≥ 45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the&#xD;
             range 18.5-31.0 kg/m² (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects who have received antiretroviral treatment in the past, adequate&#xD;
             treatment options to construct HIV therapy with at least 3 active antiretrovirals for&#xD;
             future treatment, based on review and agreement by the Investigator and the GSK&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;

             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
