  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol may prevent cancer in healthy people. Studying samples of blood and urine in the&#xD;
      laboratory from participants who are taking resveratrol may help doctors learn more about how&#xD;
      this drug is used by the body. This phase I trial is studying the side effects of resveratrol&#xD;
      and to see how it works in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of resveratrol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity in&#xD;
      healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the modulation effect on phase II detoxification enzymes. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      safety in participants treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive oral resveratrol once daily for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a daily diary documenting adverse events and an intake calendar for&#xD;
      recording the daily intake of any non-routine medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo blood sample collection periodically. Lymphocytes are isolated and&#xD;
      analyzed for baseline GST activity and level. Serum is analyzed to determine bilirubin levels&#xD;
      to be used as surrogate UGT 1A1 activity. Analyses of CYP probe drugs will be performed using&#xD;
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. A sensitive ELISA assay will be used&#xD;
      for quantitative analyses. Urine samples are collected periodically and drug and metabolite&#xD;
      levels will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Modulation of CYP enzyme activities</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of resveratrol intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by a comparison of CYP enzyme activities from baseline to end of resveratrol intervention. CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, and 3A4 activity will be assessed by plasma paraxanthine/caffeine ratio, urinary dextromethorphan/dextrophan ratio, urinary losartan/losartan metabolite ratio, and area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time curve, respectively. The primary analysis will consist of paired t-tests of differences in log values from baseline to end of intervention (equivalent to log of the ratio).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Phase II enzyme activity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of resveratrol intervention</time_frame>
    <description>GST activity and GST-pi level in blood lymphocytes and serum bilirubin levels will be used to assess Phase II enzyme activity. Paired t-tests of differences in values from baseline to end of intervention will be used, with a 2-sided significance level of 0.0167 for the three tests.</description>
