      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral ceftibuten for 7 days versus 10&#xD;
      days in acute pyelonephritis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the ceftibuten for 7 days will be not inferior to ceftibuten 10&#xD;
      days in the rate of renal scarring at 6-12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most common serious bacterial infections in childhood,&#xD;
      particularly in young children, with an estimated prevalence in febrile infants of 5.3%. It&#xD;
      has been considered an important risk factor for the development of renal scarring, and renal&#xD;
      insufficiency. More recently the long term outcomes of pyelonephritis has ameliorated,&#xD;
      probably because of prompt diagnosis and therapy, and the importance of urinary tract&#xD;
      infection as a risk factor for renal insufficiency has been questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the optimal type and duration of antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      pyelonephritis in children is not established yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a general agreement that children who are dehydrated, unable to drink, or in whom&#xD;
      sepsis is possible, should be admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside this conditions, evidence suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be&#xD;
      treated effectively with cefixime, ceftibuten or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. given orally&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently updated Cochrane review on antibiotic treatment for acute pyelonephritis in&#xD;
      children identified twenty three studies (3407 children). No significant differences were&#xD;
      found in persistent renal damage at six to 12 months (824 children: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to&#xD;
      1.26) or in duration of fever (808 children: WMD 2.05, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94) between oral&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and IV therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10&#xD;
      days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (3 studies, 341&#xD;
      children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49) were found between IV therapy (3 to 4 days) followed&#xD;
      by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7 to 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors concluded that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with&#xD;
      oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses&#xD;
      (2 to 4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral treatment also is easier to use and does not require admission to hospital, leading to&#xD;
      reduced costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the exact duration of oral therapy is not established. Current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend 7-14 days course of broad-spectrum antibiotics capable of reaching significant&#xD;
      renal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to evaluate if oral ceftibuten for 7 days is equally effective&#xD;
      as oral ceftibuten for 10 days in acute pyelonephritis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial to determine whether a short term&#xD;
      therapy with ceftibuten ( 7 days) will be therapeutically similar to a long term therapy ( 10&#xD;
      days), measuring as major outcome the prevalence of renal scars.&#xD;
