    <textblock>
      Several open-label studies reported thalidomide efficacy in inducing clinical remission and&#xD;
      steroid tapering in refractory Inflammatory Bowel diseases (IBD), both in adults and in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized placebo controlled (RCT) double blind study, to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      thalidomide in inducing clinical remission at 8 weeks in refractory IBD patients aged 2-20&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of the study is that thalidomide would be more effective than placebo&#xD;
      in inducing clinical remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT phase is followed by a open-label phase, to further evaluate efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      thalidomide in thalidomide responders, with a total follow up of one year.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are particularly debilitating. They present&#xD;
      chronic-recurrent symptoms which often seriously affects the patient's quality of life, acute&#xD;
      complications which may need surgical interventions and long-term risks as evolution in&#xD;
      cancer for ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although onset is most common in the third decade of life, more than one third of IBD cases&#xD;
      are diagnosed before age sixteen, and these younger patients, especially with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, are increasing in Western countries. Recent studies in the United Kingdom, Sweden&#xD;
      and the United States report an incidence of 5-7 new cases of IBD every year per 100,000&#xD;
      subjects &lt; 16 years of age, with an increasing trend over the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD-related morbidity causes special concern in childhood-onset cases, since the disease can&#xD;
      compromise height and weight development. This is even worsened in patients with poor disease&#xD;
      control, which need steroid treatment in multiple courses and/or for a long period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various drugs and treatments available for the management of IBD, but some&#xD;
      patients, during the course of the illness, become resistant to conventional treatment, or&#xD;
      develop serious adverse effects to immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A particular challenge is represented by those patients (especially children) who fail to&#xD;
      respond to conventional treatment, or are steroid-dependent, or suffer from serious side&#xD;
      effects from steroids use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide was first marketed in the early 1960s as a sedative drug and sadly gained&#xD;
      notoriety because of its teratogenic effect. After few years from this tragedy, thalidomide&#xD;
      was rediscovered both as an immunomodulator and as an anti-inflammatory drug, with anti tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alfa properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide is now approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and erythema nodosum&#xD;
      leprorum. It has also been tested, with beneficial effects, in a variety of inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, especially those involving the skin and mucous membranes: recurrent aphthous&#xD;
      stomatitis, oral and oesophageal ulcers in HIV, oral and genital ulcers and intestinal&#xD;
      symptoms in Behcet's syndrome, graft versus host disease, skin manifestations in systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. In these diseases, especially in those&#xD;
      cases resistant to conventional treatments, thalidomide seems to have a promising role as a&#xD;
      secondary therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of thalidomide in IBD has been recently evaluated in several&#xD;
      open-label studies both adults and children, some of which with a long-term follow up. A&#xD;
      total of approximately 200 patients with steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent IBD were&#xD;
      treated with thalidomide. Overall, the drug was effective in inducing clinical remission in&#xD;
      20-70% of patients (average of 40%). 60-100% patients (average of 70%) had some clinical&#xD;
      response. Steroid-tapering was possible in 60-100% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent side effect of thalidomide in IBD cases was neuropathy, which mainly&#xD;
      reported as cumulative dose-dependent. Other possible side effects are constipation,&#xD;
      sedation, dermatitis, mood disturbance, vertigo, cephalea, hypertension, hormonal&#xD;
      alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experience of our center, thalidomide was effective in achieving clinical remission in&#xD;
      several children, adolescents, and young adults with intractable IBD. From 1998 to 2004&#xD;
      twenty-eight patients with refractory moderate-severe IBD (19 CD, 9 UC) received thalidomide&#xD;
      1.5-2.5 mg/kg/day. Remission was achieved with thalidomide in 21 of 28 (75%) patients (17&#xD;
      with CD, 4 with UC). Mean duration of remission was 34.5 months. Sixteen of 20 (80%) patients&#xD;
      suspended steroids. Reversible neuropathy occurred in seven of 28 (25%) patients, but only&#xD;
      with cumulative doses over 28 g. Other side effects requiring thalidomide suspension were&#xD;
      vertigo/somnolence (one case), and agitation/ hallucinations (one case).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of thalidomide therapy in children,&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with refractory Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UD), with a total follow up of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: randomized placebo controlled double blind study, to evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
           thalidomide in refractory IBD patients, at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: open-label study, to evaluate efficacy and safety of thalidomide in patients&#xD;
           responders to Thalidomide in Phase I, with a total follow up of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be stratified for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Given the hypotheses&#xD;
      that thalidomide will be effective in inducing clinical remission at 8 weeks in 60% of&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease, and 55% of patients with ulcerative colitis, compared to 20%&#xD;
      of patients with placebo, with a significance of 0.05% and a power of 80%, estimated needed&#xD;
      sample size is of 124 patients.&#xD;
