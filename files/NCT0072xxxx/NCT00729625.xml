  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who have sustained strokes are unable to effectively use their hemiparetic&#xD;
      upper extremity. Limited mobility in the performance of daily activities, such as eating or&#xD;
      dressing, adversely affects their quality of life and compromises independence.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation techniques engaging the hemiparetic limb in repetitive task practice (RTP) may&#xD;
      improve upper extremity function and quality of life in patients with stroke, but costs limit&#xD;
      the number of patients that can utilize this type of therapy. Advances in microprocessor&#xD;
      design and function make the use of an assistive device as an adjunct to RTP plausible. An&#xD;
      innovative assistive repetitive motion (ARM) device using an &quot;air muscle&quot; has been developed&#xD;
      specifically for the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic upper extremity. The primary aim of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to collect pilot data to estimate the clinical effectiveness of using&#xD;
      the ARM device in conjunction with RTP to improve upper extremity motor function and the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients with stroke. Twenty sub-acute (3 to 9 mos. post-stoke) patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to a RTP only or ARM + RTP group. The RTP group will receive 15 days (4&#xD;
      hours per day) of intensive one-on-one RTP therapy. The ARM + RTP group will use the ARM&#xD;
      device for 2 hours per day and receive 2 hours of intensive RTP per day for 15 days. Clinical&#xD;
      motor function and quality of life measures will be taken before and after the interventions&#xD;
      and two months later. We hypothesize that the ARM + RTP group will exhibit greater&#xD;
      improvements in motor function and quality of life measures than the RTP only group.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Estimate the effectiveness of using an assistive repetitive motion device&#xD;
      (ARM) in conjunction with repetitive task practice (RTP) on motor recovery of patients with&#xD;
      sub-acute stroke. This aim will be examined by comparing pre-intervention motor performance&#xD;
      levels with the immediate post-intervention and two months post-intervention. The primary&#xD;
      outcome variables will be scores on the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Test (FMA) and Wolf Motor&#xD;
      Function Test (WMFT). We hypothesize patients in the RTP + ARM group will exhibit greater&#xD;
      gains in upper extremity motor recovery/performance than the RTP and ARM only groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Estimate the effectiveness of using the ARM device in conjunction with RTP on&#xD;
      health related quality of life of patients with sub-acute stoke. This aim will be examined&#xD;
      through the administration of clinical quality of life questionnaires. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable to assess health related quality of life will be change scores on the Stroke Impact&#xD;
      Scale (SIS), controlling for depressed mood as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic&#xD;
      Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, from the pre-, immediate post and two-month post&#xD;
      intervention testing sessions. We hypothesize patients in the RTP + ARM group will exhibit&#xD;
      greater improvements on quality of life measures at the two-month follow-up session than the&#xD;
      RTP and ARM only groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design, Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of the following three interventional groups: repetitive&#xD;
      task practice, assistive repetitive motion and repetitive task practice plus assistive&#xD;
      repetitive motion. Details regarding the activities each group will perform are below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repetitive task practice (RTP) procedure: patients in the RTP group will work closely&#xD;
           with rehabilitation professional (supervisor) for four hours per day for three weeks. We&#xD;
           are currently accepting applications for this position. At minimum, this individual will&#xD;
           be a licensed Physical or Occupational Therapist with clinical experience and a desire&#xD;
           to participate and follow the outlined research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will report to the Mellon Center at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF)&#xD;
           around 8:00 AM each day and leave around 12:00 PM. During their stay at the CCF they&#xD;
           will be asked to engage in a series of activities that are planned for them to use their&#xD;
           weaker or more impaired hand and arm. We will be making some additional measures about&#xD;
           the speed at which they can do functional activities (such as reaching and folding a&#xD;
           towel) during the testing days immediately before and after the training period and two&#xD;
           months after completion of the training (e.g. Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and&#xD;
           Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA)). Quality of life will be assessed with the Stroke&#xD;
           Impact Scale (SIS) controlling for depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies&#xD;
           Depression (CES-D) scale. These clinical tests require approximately 1.5 hours to&#xD;
           administer. Participants will also be encouraged to use their weaker hand and arm at&#xD;
           home and during the weekends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assistive repetitive motion (ARM) procedure: Patients will report to the Mellon Center&#xD;
           at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) around 8:00 AM each day and leave around 12:00&#xD;
           PM. During their stay at the CCF they will be asked to wear an assistive device on their&#xD;
           more impaired or affected upper extremity. This device will be placed snugly on their&#xD;
           arm and wrist. The device has a small &quot;air muscle&quot; that when activated will slowly lift&#xD;
           their fingers and wrist from your resting wrist position. This device is classified as a&#xD;
           non-significant risk device by the FDA (see attached letter dated 1-15-05). The patient&#xD;
           should not experience any pain or discomfort during this stretching activity. If they do&#xD;
           experience any pain or discomfort they can activate a stop switch located on the control&#xD;
           box with their unimpaired hand. The SIS, CES-D WMFT and FMA will be administered&#xD;
           immediately before and after the training period and two months after completion of the&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RTP + ARM Procedure: Patients will report to the Mellon Center at the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
           Foundation (CCF) around 8:00 AM each day and leave around 12:00 PM. During their stay at&#xD;
           the CCF they will be asked to wear an assistive device on their more impaired or&#xD;
           affected upper extremity for two hours. This device will be placed snugly on their arm&#xD;
           and wrist. The device has a small &quot;air muscle&quot; that when activated will slowly lift the&#xD;
           fingers and wrist from a resting wrist position. They should not experience any pain or&#xD;
           discomfort during this stretching activity. If they experience any pain or discomfort&#xD;
           they can activate a stop switch located on the control box with the unimpaired hand.&#xD;
           After completion of the two hour ARM intervention they will participate in two hours of&#xD;
           RTP therapy. During this time they will engage in a series of activities that are&#xD;
           planned for them to use the weaker or more impaired hand and arm. The SIS, CES-D WMFT&#xD;
           and FMA will be administered immediately before and after the training period and two&#xD;
           months after completion of the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this project will provide valuable data as a pre-requisite for submission of&#xD;
      a multi-year R01 randomized clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of using an&#xD;
      assistive device, such as the ARM, as an adjunct to RTP. This project has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients will not be excluded because of somatosensory deficits or the&#xD;
      nature of previous physical interventions. We will not randomize patients on the basis of&#xD;
      side of stroke or hand dominance but will undertake secondary data analyses examining these&#xD;
      variables. In past applications of one form of RTP, CI therapy, to chronic stroke patients in&#xD;
      the laboratories of Taub and Miltner, there were no significant differences in treatment&#xD;
      effects for patients with right and left-sided strokes. In previous evaluations of CI&#xD;
      therapy, Taub did not find any difference in outcomes among the small percentage of patients&#xD;
      with pre-morbid left dominance. Therefore, there is no reason to exclude these patients from&#xD;
      participation. We believe that the motivation to improve use of an affected pre-stroke&#xD;
      non-dominant upper extremity is sufficiently strong to support profound improvement from&#xD;
      treating that limb as well as from treating the dominant limb. Distributions of dominance and&#xD;
      hand preference have been acquired from patients meeting eligibility criteria in 1998 at&#xD;
      several sites for determining participation of sites for the EXCITE trial and side of&#xD;
      cerebral pathology showed remarkably equal left-right distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a score of less than 24 on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination or a score of 36&#xD;
           or below on the Token Test of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a first stroke less than 3 months or more than 9 months prior to the initiation of&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. less than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. clinical judgment of excessive frailty or lack of stamina (e.g., cannot attend to&#xD;
           instructions, stay awake, engage in functional activities, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. serious uncontrolled medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. excessive pain in any joint of the more affected extremity that could limit ability to&#xD;
           cooperate with the intervention, as judged by the examining clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. passive range of motion less than 45 degrees for: abduction, flexion or external&#xD;
           rotation at shoulder, or pronation of forearm; or greater than 30 degrees flexion&#xD;
           contracture at any finger joint (patients who pass the motor criteria specified above do&#xD;
           not tend to have the type of pain or limitation of movement that would exclude them from&#xD;
           treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. unable to stand independently for 2 min., transfer independently to and from the toilet&#xD;
           or perform sit-to-stand&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. current participation in other pharmacological or physical intervention studies, or have&#xD;
           received injections of anti-spasticity drugs into upper extremity musculature within the&#xD;
           past 3 months, or wish to have drugs injected in the foreseeable future&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. receiving any anti-spasticity drugs orally at the time of expected participation&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. received phenol injections less than 12 months prior to receiving therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. contemplating a move from proximity to the treatment site in less than 1 year from the&#xD;
           randomization date. Prospective patients who qualify but who have profound postural&#xD;
           instability will undergo the intervention while walking with contact guarding or, when&#xD;
           feasible, using their leg(s) and more involved arm to propel a wheelchair.&#xD;
