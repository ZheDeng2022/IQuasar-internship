  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hydroxychloroquine works in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously treated prostate cancer. Autophagy destroys proteins and other substances in cells&#xD;
      and may be used by prostate cancer cells to survive. Hydroxychloroquine, which blocks&#xD;
      autophagy, may slow the growth of and possibly kill prostate cancer cells.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven stage D0 prostate cancer (i.e., tumor originally diagnosed as&#xD;
             being limited to the prostate) or D1 prostate cancer (metastatic to regional lymph&#xD;
             nodes) and have a rising PSA value after definitive local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have undergone local treatment via prostatectomy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have PSA progression after local treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PSA values for patients after surgery must be &gt; 0.2 ng/mL, determined by two&#xD;
                  measurements, at least 1 month apart and at least 6 months after prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PSA values for patients after radiation must be ≥ 2.0 ng/ml greater than the&#xD;
                  nadir achieved after radiation, determined by two measurements at 1 month apart&#xD;
                  and at least 6 months after the radiation treatment is completed. (Patients who&#xD;
                  received adjuvant or salvage radiation after prostatectomy must have PSA of &gt;0.2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The first two PSA values (in 5.1.3a and 5.1.3b), along with a third (study&#xD;
                  baseline) value must all be rising (i.e., there must be an overall rising&#xD;
                  trajectory, such that the third value cannot be lower than the first value).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline bone scan and CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrating no metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 2. (see Appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A WBC &gt; 3500/μl, ANC &gt;1500/μl, hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl, and platelet count &gt;100,000/μl&#xD;
             are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 50&#xD;
             ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin must be within 1.5X the normal institutional limits. If total&#xD;
             bilirubin is outside the normal institutional limits, assess direct bilirubin. The&#xD;
             direct bilirubin must be within normal parameters. Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT)&#xD;
             must be less than 2.5X the institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented ophthalmic exam within the last twelve months demonstrating no evidence of&#xD;
             retinopathy. Patients with retinal changes will be considered for enrollment with&#xD;
             written clearance from a board certified ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a serum total testosterone level ≥150 ng/dL at the time of enrollment within&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorder that would compromise the safety of the patient&#xD;
             or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be off ADT in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and/or salvage setting for at least 3&#xD;
             months and have a testosterone level &gt; 150 ng/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second primary malignancy except most situ carcinoma (e.g. adequately treated&#xD;
             non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin) or other malignancy treated at least 5 years&#xD;
             previously with no evidence of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active clinically significant infection requiring antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  G6PD deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking other commercially available medications which may theoretically either&#xD;
             stimulate or inhibit autophagy, which are calcitriol and chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking medications which may lead to interactions with hydroxychloroquine, including&#xD;
             penicillamine, telbivudine, botulinum toxin, digoxin, and propafenone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have visual field changes from prior 4-aminoquinoline compound use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be taking hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compound.&#xD;
