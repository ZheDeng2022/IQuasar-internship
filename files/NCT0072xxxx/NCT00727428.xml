  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to assess a novel formulation of FluLaval. The idea is to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary data on the safety and immune response to the FluLaval TF influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in adults. These data will serve as a basis for further studies involving different&#xD;
      populations. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary&#xD;
      phase/study.&#xD;
