  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilator is an essential element in the care of critically ill&#xD;
      intubated patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It covers the entire process of&#xD;
      liberating the patient from mechanical support and from endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of weaning involves two-step strategies: 1. Assessment of readiness for weaning,&#xD;
      including physiological measurement, such as maximum inspiratory pressure, tidal volume,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and etc. 2. Spontaneous breathing trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy has become an increasingly common intervention in ICUs, especially for patients&#xD;
      with prolonged mechanical ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy may reduce work of breathing by improving some aspects of pulmonary mechanics,&#xD;
      such as reducing dead space and decreasing airway resistance, but to date, there is no&#xD;
      evidence that this is linked to reduction in weaning time or length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe such improvement in pulmonary mechanic, which may reflect in the&#xD;
      weaning parameter that respiratory therapist measured before weaning program, may be&#xD;
      different from that measured before tracheostomy creation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesized that the improvement in pulmonary mechanic for&#xD;
      patients with weaning failure after tracheostomy may reflect on weaning parameters, and that&#xD;
      this improvement may be able to predict the subsequent successful weaning from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereby the investigators perform a prospective single-center study to investigate the changes&#xD;
      of weaning parameters in difficult weaning patients after tracheostomy as a predictor of&#xD;
      subsequent successful weaning.&#xD;

      Weaning from mechanical ventilator is an essential element in the care of critically ill&#xD;
      intubated patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It covers the entire process of&#xD;
      liberating the patient from mechanical support and from endotracheal tube1. The process of&#xD;
      weaning involves two-step strategies: 1. Assessment of readiness for weaning, including&#xD;
      physiological measurement, such as maximum inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, respiratory&#xD;
      rate and etc. 2. Spontaneous breathing trial. The incidence of successful weaning is&#xD;
      estimated around 68.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite there is no consensus on the optimal timing of tracheostomy, patients with prolonged&#xD;
      trans-laryngeal intubation are finally succumbed to tracheostomy, as prolonged&#xD;
      trans-laryngeal intubation causes tissue trauma, promotes bacterial translocation and&#xD;
      infection, making tracheostomy an increasingly common intervention in ICUs. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      tracheostomy may reduce work of breathing by improving some aspects of pulmonary mechanics,&#xD;
      such as reducing dead space and decreasing airway resistance, but to date, there is no&#xD;
      evidence that this is linked to reduction in weaning time or length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ｗe believe such improvement in pulmonary mechanics, which may reflect in the weaning&#xD;
      parameters that respiratory therapist measured before weaning program, may be different after&#xD;
      tracheostomy creation, especially in those patient with weaning failure. Ｗe therefore&#xD;
      hypothesized that there may be an improvement in pulmonary mechanic for patients with weaning&#xD;
      failure after tracheostomy, and that this improvement may be able to predict the subsequent&#xD;
      successful weaning from mechanical ventilator support. Hereby the investigators perform a&#xD;
      prospective single-center study to investigate the changes of weaning parameters in weaning&#xD;
      failure patients after tracheostomy as a predictor of successful weaning.&#xD;
