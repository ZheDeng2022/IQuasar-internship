  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Certain types of cancers, including sarcoma and melanoma, have specific antigens (protein&#xD;
      molecules) on their surfaces. Research has shown that producing an immune reaction to these&#xD;
      antigens may be able to keep tumors from growing by encouraging the immune system to destroy&#xD;
      the tumor cells. By creating a vaccine that contains antigens similar to those found on the&#xD;
      cancer cells, researchers hope to cause an immune reaction that targets the cancer cells.&#xD;
      However, more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of this type of&#xD;
      vaccine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether a tumor cell vaccine, given to individuals who have had surgery to&#xD;
      remove malignant tumors from the chest, can cause an immune reaction that will prevent the&#xD;
      tumors from coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      the lungs, pleura, or mediastinum, and have recently had surgery to remove tumors in the&#xD;
      chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the option to have leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for&#xD;
           studies on how the body is responding to the vaccine. Participants who agree to have&#xD;
           this procedure will have it before the start of treatment and after the sixth and eighth&#xD;
           vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seven days before the first vaccine, participants will receive the chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
           celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive the experimental vaccine as an injection in the thigh or arm,&#xD;
           and may receive it in two shots depending on how many cells are in each vaccine.&#xD;
           Participants will receive a diary to monitor medication doses and side effects, as well&#xD;
           as additional cyclophosphamide and celecoxib to take at home as directed by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one vaccine every month for 6 months, and will have regular blood&#xD;
           tests and imaging studies. After the sixth vaccine, participants who have successfully&#xD;
           responded to the treatment will have two additional vaccines given 3 months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the eighth vaccine, participants will have followup visits every 3 months for 1&#xD;
           year and then every 6 months for up to 4 years....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years, the cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA) have emerged as attractive targets&#xD;
      for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of&#xD;
      CTAs, immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to&#xD;
      low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.&#xD;
      Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with allogeneic tumor cells expressing high&#xD;
      levels of multiple CTAs in combination with depletion of T regulatory cells will induce broad&#xD;
      immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with sarcomas,&#xD;
      melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or&#xD;
      mediastinum will be vaccinated with irradiated K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing GM-CSF&#xD;
      (K562-GM) following thoracic metastasectomy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction&#xD;
      with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO&#xD;
      BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs will be assessed before and after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the safety of K562-GM allogeneic tumor cell vaccines in combination with oral&#xD;
      metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in patients undergoing thoracic metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven sarcoma, melanoma, or epithelial&#xD;
           malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who can be rendered no clinical&#xD;
           evidence of active disease (NED).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, without&#xD;
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate&#xD;
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;&#xD;
           pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no&#xD;
           immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination&#xD;
           commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater&#xD;
           than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic&#xD;
           function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 times upper limits of normal. Serum&#xD;
           creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater&#xD;
           than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from thoracic metastasectomy, patients with NED or MRD will be&#xD;
           vaccinated via deep subcutaneous injection with 1x10(8) irradiated K562 GM-tumor cells&#xD;
           periodically over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicities, and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post&#xD;
           vaccination serologic responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as cell&#xD;
           mediated responses to epigenetically-modified autologous EBV-transformed B and&#xD;
           autologous tumor cells (if available) will be assessed before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
           assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined&#xD;
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the&#xD;
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than&#xD;
           definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 25 patients will be accrued to this trial.&#xD;

                  and have shown no evidence of disease during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients with intracranial metastases, which have been treated by surgery or&#xD;
                  radiation therapy may be eligible for study provided there is no evidence of&#xD;
                  active disease and no requirement for anticonvulsant therapy or steroids&#xD;
                  following treatment.&#xD;

          2. Patients requiring corticosteroids (other than inhaled) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with life expectancy less than 12 months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation, who cannot be transferred to other agents&#xD;
