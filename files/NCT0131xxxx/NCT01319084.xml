    <textblock>
      Considering the development of gastric cancer surgery using da Vinci Robotic Surgical System,&#xD;
      the development of educational program needs to be achieved in Korea and this institute.&#xD;
      Moreover, because of the large number of gastrectomy including robotic surgery for gastric&#xD;
      cancer treatment, the investigators can provide high quality of educational program using da&#xD;
      Vinci System. Therefore, the investigators wanted to create an innovative real-time training&#xD;
      module, which can provide an intraoperative step-by-step guide to robotic surgical&#xD;
      procedures. This technological project was named as Advanced Robotic Multi-display&#xD;
      Educational System (ARMES).&#xD;

      Considering the development of gastric cancer surgery using da Vinci Robotic Surgical System,&#xD;
      the development of educational program needs to be achieved in Korea and this institute.&#xD;
      Moreover, because of the large number of gastrectomy including robotic surgery for gastric&#xD;
      cancer treatment, the investigators can provide high quality of educational program using da&#xD;
      Vinci System. Therefore, the investigators wanted to create an innovative real-time training&#xD;
      module, which can provide an intraoperative step-by-step guide to robotic surgical&#xD;
      procedures. This technological project was named as Advanced Robotic Multi-display&#xD;
      Educational System (ARMES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four-stages of ARMES development are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standardization of the key steps of the selected procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preparation of well edited short video clips for each of the previously determined steps&#xD;
           using our extensive library of videos of over 350 high quality robotic gastrectomies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Production of a 3D animation of the key surgical steps;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Integration of the video segments into the da Vinci Robot system using TileproTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through predetermined standardized segments of short operation video clips and 3D animation,&#xD;
      the investigators are developing a versatile intra-operative on-screen audiovisual mentoring&#xD;
      system using TileproTM program, which will improve surgeons' capabilities to perform complex&#xD;
      robotic operations achieving quicker operation specific competency. It will help surgeons at&#xD;
      initial state of robotic surgery in technical as well as oncological aspect for cancer&#xD;
      surgery in detail and step-by-step. Finally this program can be applied to other robotic&#xD;
      surgery and progressed to be a standard education program.&#xD;
