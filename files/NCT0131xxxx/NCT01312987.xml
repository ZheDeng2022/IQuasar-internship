  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess what impact an integrated educational and&#xD;
      feeding intervention delivered to infants and children has on growth (weight and height),&#xD;
      development (cognitive and gross motor), nutrition (dietary behaviors, food insecurity, and&#xD;
      micronutrient status - folate, iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D), and morbidity (respiratory&#xD;
      and diarrheal) outcomes. A randomized community trial was used to implement a nutrition&#xD;
      intervention program consisting of monthly education sessions, a lipid-based nutrition&#xD;
      supplement, and food vouchers for local staples.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All healthy children between the ages of 5-18 months old and their mothers who are&#xD;
             residents of the municipalities of Santa Lucia, Magdalena and San Antonio who do not&#xD;
             present any of the medical conditions listed in the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers have understood and signed consent forms to enable their children to&#xD;
             participate in the study. They were willing to have their child participate in one or&#xD;
             more blood draws, bi-monthly sessions: 1) nutrition classes and food voucher and&#xD;
             lipid-based nutritional supplement and 2) height/weight monitoring, dietary intake&#xD;
             questionnaire, and health outcome information. As well as the additional data&#xD;
             assessments necessary to be considered active participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with congenital anomalies, mental retardation, severe physical handicap,&#xD;
             under-nutrition caused by medical conditions that contribute to under-nutrition such&#xD;
             as heart disease, kidney failure, face and throat problems that interfere with&#xD;
             swallowing, medical problems interfering with the absorption of food, chronic diseases&#xD;
             such as tuberculosis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with a known allergy to peanuts and eggs will also be excluded from the&#xD;
             study, 30% of children with known allergies to nuts also have an allergy to eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans to move or change their place of residence outside of the study region in the&#xD;
             next 2 months would make them ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers who are younger than 16 years of age will be excluded from the study. Women&#xD;
             younger than 16 might not understand the consent process and the importance of&#xD;
             following the guidelines established in the research, therefore we chose not to&#xD;
             include this group as &quot;eligible&quot; participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who are &lt;= -2 standard deviations below the norm for z score for weight for&#xD;
             age. These children are severely malnourished and need to be carefully followed under&#xD;
             the supervision of a qualified health care provider.&#xD;
