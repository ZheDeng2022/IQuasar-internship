      This prospective, multicenter study is intended to establish the efficacy and toxicity of&#xD;
      treating unresectable colorectal liver metastases with accurately administered radiation&#xD;
      using the CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignant disease worldwide, with an&#xD;
      estimated 1,023,000 new cases and 529,000 deaths each year. The liver is the most frequent&#xD;
      site of metastatic spread from colorectal cancer, 25% of colorectal cancer patients will have&#xD;
      liver metastases at the time of initial colorectal resection and more than 50% of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients will develop liver metastases during the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care and only potential curative therapy for colorectal liver&#xD;
      metastases is liver resection of the metastatic lesions. Surgical resection provides long&#xD;
      term survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) liver metastases. In a report of&#xD;
      1001 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
      in NY, USA, surgical resection of liver metastases resulted in 3- and 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      of 37% and 22%, respectively. Advances in pre- and intra-operative imaging and chemotherapy&#xD;
      during recent years have increased overall survival up to 60% at 5 years after liver&#xD;
      resection. However, 80-90% of liver metastases are unresectable at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      usually due to tumor location, multifocality, inadequate functional hepatic reserve or the&#xD;
      patient's overall condition. For those patients, harboring unresectable liver metastases,&#xD;
      alternative treatment approaches include neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local ablation therapy and&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent availability of neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic agents has increased the response&#xD;
      rates and doubled the median overall survival time for metastatic colorectal cancer from 10&#xD;
      to 20 months. Recent studies have demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy allows 12.5% of&#xD;
      patients with unresectable CRC liver metastases to be significantly downstaged and eligible&#xD;
      for hepatic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unresectable CRC liver metastases, local ablative therapies are widely applied. Local&#xD;
      ablative treatment refers to a variety of intervention techniques that specifically target&#xD;
      tumors to directly destroy them. Numerous methods of ablation have been developed including&#xD;
      cryoablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The most widely employed non-radiation based local ablative treatment is&#xD;
      RFA which induces thermal ablation by passing high-frequency alternating current through the&#xD;
      tumor utilizing electrodes that are placed within the tumor and surrounding tissue. RFA can&#xD;
      be applied percutaneously under ultrasonic guidance or directly during laparoscopy or open&#xD;
      laparotomy. Local recurrence rates of 44.4% at 18 months were reported by Solbiati et al. for&#xD;
      CRC liver metastases with a median diameter of 2.6 cm. For tumors greater than 4 cm the local&#xD;
      recurrence rate was 68%. RFA has an overall 3-year survival rate of 28-46% and a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 25%. However, patients with advanced hepatic decompensation, large tumors (3&#xD;
      to 5 cm), or multifocal tumors are generally considered poor candidates for RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional radiation therapy has been shown useful for palliation of hepatic capsular pain,&#xD;
      but historically it has played a minor role in the treatment of patients with unresectable&#xD;
      liver metastases. This can be attributed chiefly to the low tolerance of the whole liver to&#xD;
      radiation. The liver was thought to be a relatively radiosensitive organ and with whole liver&#xD;
      irradiation, it was difficult to achieve the radiation doses necessary to eradicate gross&#xD;
      tumors without causing radiation induced liver disease. Partial liver irradiation has shown&#xD;
      some promise. Limiting irradiation to only one-third of the liver through three-dimensional&#xD;
      (3D) conformal radiotherapy techniques, including intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT),&#xD;
      several studies have shown that partial liver irradiation is safe with doses up to 50-72.6&#xD;
      Gy. However, further dose escalation with conventional radiation therapy techniques risks&#xD;
      injury to adjacent abdominal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a novel approach for the local&#xD;
      ablation of liver metastases. SBRT provides a conformal isodose distribution with a steep&#xD;
      radiation dose gradient allowing much higher doses of radiation than conventional radiation&#xD;
      therapy and conformal radiotherapy techniques to be delivered safely with high precision to&#xD;
      focal liver metastases while minimizing the radiation dose to normal liver and adjacent&#xD;
      organs. To achieve this, precise localization of the target during treatment is required&#xD;
      which necessitates accounting for tumor motion. SBRT technology utilizes a number of&#xD;
      techniques to accommodate for tumor and respiratory motion including motion-restrictive&#xD;
      techniques such as frames and abdominal compression, as well as motion-compensating&#xD;
      techniques such as active breathing control and tumor tracking. The motion-restrictive&#xD;
      techniques can be difficult for some patients to withstand, limiting those patients from&#xD;
      being able to receive treatment. The motion-restrictive techniques can also necessitate the&#xD;
      use of wide margins. Rusthoven et al. found a gross tumor volume (GTV) to planning target&#xD;
      volume (PTV) expansion of up to 15 mm necessary in the craniocaudal direction. Wide margins&#xD;
      can result in irradiation of a substantial volume of normal liver, potentially increasing the&#xD;
      risk of radiation-induced injury. Some studies suggest the motion-compensating approach of&#xD;
      active breathing control can aid in reducing the margins required by motion-restrictive&#xD;
      approaches, however, Korreman et al. suggest those reductions may only be applicable with the&#xD;
      use of image-guidance between and within sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery system (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA) an advanced&#xD;
      platform to deliver SBRT, provides a therapeutic solution to this problem by continuously&#xD;
      tracking the tumor during treatment while it accounts for organ motion due to respiratory&#xD;
      movement, using the Synchrony respiratory tracking system (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale,&#xD;
      CA). Utilizing continuous tumor tracking, margin expansion to account for motion uncertainty&#xD;
      can be reduced, having the potential to make this a safe and effective treatment. The&#xD;
      frameless nature of the CyberKnife and its continuous image guidance system eliminates the&#xD;
      need of motion-restriction techniques increasing the comfort and availability of the&#xD;
      treatment to patients.&#xD;
