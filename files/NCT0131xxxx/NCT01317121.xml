      Multi-site Communication Deficits Underlying Cognitive Dysfunction in the Prodromal Phase and&#xD;
      First Episode of Schizophrenia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal long-range connectivity between brain areas and corresponding impaired&#xD;
      synchronization of oscillatory rhythms in neuronal networks represent an important&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia. Although schizophrenia is considered&#xD;
      as a neurodevelopmental disorder the mechanisms by which the abnormal neural circuitry and&#xD;
      communication develops before the onset of clinical symptoms are unknown. This project aims&#xD;
      to investigate the relationship between disturbed neural synchronization and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia and is intended to identify patients with&#xD;
      increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Present approaches to describe subjects at risk&#xD;
      for psychosis based on clinical features have not been completely convincing since&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms in the prodromal phase are often too unspecific. Recent studies suggest&#xD;
      that detecting cognitive deficits might help for a more precise identification of high risk&#xD;
      subjects. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms have not yet been&#xD;
      investigated sufficiently. Precise identification of subjects with high risk for switching to&#xD;
      schizophrenia would be very important since interventional strategies such as medical&#xD;
      treatment even with second generation antipsychotics are not completely free of risk and&#xD;
      therefore should be limited to subjects with a maximal benefit. In this project subjects at&#xD;
      risk for psychosis will be investigated with electroencephalography (EEG),&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI). Follow up investigations will be performed after switching to&#xD;
      schizophrenia has occurred or not. Neural synchronization between the prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
      the hippocampal formation will be investigated using a working memory paradigm. Here,&#xD;
      different levels of memory load will be investigated using the n-back paradigm. Earlier&#xD;
      studies showed disturbed functional and effective connectivity between the hippocampus and&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex both in patients with schizophrenia and subjects at risk. Neural&#xD;
      synchronization between the prefrontal cortex and sensory areas will be investigated with&#xD;
      different attentional paradigms. Here, tones will be presented that have to be responded to&#xD;
      by button press. Earlier studies demonstrated disturbed auditory evoked gamma oscillations in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia and unaffected siblings. Neural oscillations will be recorded&#xD;
      with 64-channel EEG and localized by means of simultaneous functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI). Integration of EEG and fMRI will be performed using single-trial coupling in&#xD;
      order to detect brain regions involved in specific oscillatory rhythms. Using both paradigms,&#xD;
      neural long-range synchronization will be analyzed. In addition, dynamic causal modelling&#xD;
      will be used for further characterization of functional relationships among brain regions&#xD;
      involved. The investigators expect a functional relationship between cognitive deficits in&#xD;
      subjects with prodromal schizophrenia and subjects with a first episode of schizophrenia with&#xD;
      regards to long range neural synchronization. In addition, the investigators expect to&#xD;
      identify subjects at high risk for schizophrenia with the analysis of disturbed long range&#xD;
      synchronization.&#xD;
