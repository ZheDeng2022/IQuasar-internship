        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; Diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip for at least one hip (right or left hip, or&#xD;
             both hips) determined by satisfaction of BOTH of the following (as outlined in the&#xD;
             STUDY TEST BATTERY section above):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification Criteria for&#xD;
                  osteoarthritis of the hip, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rating of current Degree of Pain in the hip on the 0-100 Visual Analog Scale of&#xD;
                  40 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        N.B.: If both hips satisfy both of the above criteria for diagnosis of osteoarthritis of&#xD;
        the hip, the hip with the highest VAS pain rating will be selected for evaluation in this&#xD;
        study. That is, only one hip per subject will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hip pain was present on most days of the prior three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's use of pain relief medication(s) has been stable over the past 30 days, and&#xD;
             the subject is willing and able to maintain this existing use of pain relief&#xD;
             medication(s) as his or her sole pain relief medication use, as needed, throughout&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been on current non-pain relief medication regimen (for any indication or&#xD;
             condition such as hypertension, pulmonary disease or cardiac disease), unchanged, or&#xD;
             on no current non-pain relief medication regimen, for at least 30 days prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment, and is willing and able to maintain his or her regular non-pain relief&#xD;
             medication regimen, unchanged, throughout the course of his or her study participation&#xD;
             unless the subject's physician states that a medication change is needed for the&#xD;
             subject's safety and well-being, in which case the subject agrees to inform the study&#xD;
             PI of the change(s) made ,.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to abstain from partaking in other/new treatments (other than the&#xD;
             study procedures) to improve osteoarthritis of the hip pain and other symptoms during&#xD;
             the course of participation in the study. Such treatments include new medications,&#xD;
             dietary/herbal supplements/ minerals, weight loss programs, water or other new&#xD;
