      The purpose of this study is to examine the neural basis of response inhibition, working&#xD;
      memory, and sustained attention in adolescents and adults with&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with particular emphasis on quantifying the&#xD;
      effects of methylphenidate (i.e., treatment with psychostimulants) on neural function.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo electrophysiological measurement of brain function during&#xD;
      laboratory cognitive tasks. This research is aimed to develop a better understanding of how&#xD;
      ADHD neural dysfunction relates to clinical presentation and medication response during the&#xD;
      transition from adolescence to adulthood. The specific aims and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To characterize the effect of Ritalin (methylphenidate) on neural activity&#xD;
      underlying performance on the response inhibition task in ADHD adolescents and adults.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1) Methylphendiate will increase N2 and P3 amplitude in ADHD persons during&#xD;
      medicated EEG sessions; Hypothesis 2) There will be a significant age Ã— medication&#xD;
      interaction such that ADHD teens will show increased amplitude of N2 while medicated,&#xD;
      particularly at frontal sites, whereas ADHD adults will show differentially greater effect of&#xD;
      medication on P3 amplitude and latency at central sites. Hypothesis 3) Brain activity&#xD;
      assessed by fMRI will differ between unmedicated and medicated states.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      By conservative estimate, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common&#xD;
      disorder that occurs in at least 3 to 6% of school-aged children (Barkley, 1990). It is&#xD;
      marked by symptoms of inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior that are developmentally&#xD;
      inappropriate. These symptoms must occur in multiple settings and impair functioning to a&#xD;
      clinically significant degree (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). ADHD is&#xD;
      believed to be a developmental disorder that begins in early childhood, which distinguishes&#xD;
      it from disorders of attention and behavioral control that arise later as consequence of&#xD;
      brain injury. Although ADHD was once thought to affect only children, considerable evidence&#xD;
      has accumulated to show that ADHD frequently continues into adulthood. Approximately 60% of&#xD;
      ADHD youth (about 3-4% of all adults) have clinically significant residual problems as adults&#xD;
      (Faraone, 1999; Hechtman, 2000; Mannuzza &amp; Klein, 1999). Although inattention problems appear&#xD;
      to persevere into adulthood unchanged, studies suggest that some persons' ADHD&#xD;
      hyperactive/impulsive symptoms diminish following teenage years. However, the mechanism for&#xD;
      this decrease is not currently known (Wender, 1987; Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1986, 1993; Brown,&#xD;
      1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expert consensus holds that a deficit in response inhibition is a core feature of ADHD&#xD;
      (Barkley, 1998). Supporting this, neuropsychological research suggests that ADHD persons'&#xD;
      commonly perform poorly on tasks that require inhibition of response. These tasks, called&#xD;
      Go/No-Go or Stop Signal tasks, require continual manual responding to successively presented&#xD;
      stimuli and an occasionally withheld response following a predefined signal. Numerous&#xD;
      neuropsychological studies have shown that ADHD children, teens, and adults respond more&#xD;
      variably on Go trials on such tasks. They also have longer reaction times and more failures&#xD;
      to inhibit responses on No-Go trials (Koshack et al., 2003; Oosterlaan, et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Wodushek &amp; Neumann, 1999). Psychostimulant medications like methylphenidate improve&#xD;
      performance deficits (Bedard et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between abnormalities of brain structure/function and cognitive test performance in&#xD;
      ADHD persons is well-established, if poorly understood. There is evidence for smaller right&#xD;
      frontal lobe volume, abnormalities in basal ganglia size, and reductions in white matter&#xD;
      tracts in persons with ADHD (Castellanos et al., 1994; Castellanos et al., 1996; Filipek et&#xD;
      al., 1997; Hynd et al.,1993; Mataro et al., 1997). Prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are&#xD;
      involved in planning, initiation, execution, and supervision of ongoing cognitive and motor&#xD;
      functions (Fuster, 1997). Structural brain abnormalities correlate with deficits in these&#xD;
      cognitive functions and with impulsive behaviors that are symptoms of ADHD (Casey et al.,&#xD;
      1997; Mataro et al., 1997; Semrud-Clikeman et al., 2000). Functional imaging techniques,&#xD;
      which quantify neural systems operation with respect to cognitive processes, are particularly&#xD;
      valuable tools used to characterize dysfunctional neural networks. The most frequently&#xD;
      employed method is electrophysiology, in which small voltage changes on the scalp occurring&#xD;
      during task performance are recorded and averaged into waveforms that depict brain function&#xD;
      to events of interest. These average EEG waveforms are called event-related potentials&#xD;
      (ERPs). ERPs to Go/No-Go tasks are well characterized in healthy, non-clinical samples&#xD;
      (Logan, 1994). The most frequently observed component to No-Go trials is a large negative&#xD;
      potential occurring approximately 275 msec following stimulus presentation (N2) that has a&#xD;
      fronto-central distribution. The large N2 has been interpreted as a reflection of early&#xD;
      response inhibition processes. Electrophysiological studies find that the large N2 often seen&#xD;
      with successful inhibition is diminished in ADHD children and adolescents (Overtoom et al.,&#xD;
      2002; Pilszka et al., 2000; Yong-Liang et al., 2000). A literature review reveals no&#xD;
      comparable studies of ADHD adults, so the degree of N2 abnormality in older ADHD persons is&#xD;
      not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERP source localization suggests that the No-Go N2 arises from activity in inferior&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (Bokura, 2001; Pliszka, 2000). The few FMRI studies of ADHD are consistent&#xD;
      with this finding (Garavan et al., 1999; Liddle et al., 2001; Watanabe et al., 2002). Rubia&#xD;
      et al. (1999) find less brain activity in right superior-lateral prefrontal cortex, right&#xD;
      inferior prefrontal cortex, and left caudate nucleus in unmedicated ADHD adolescent boys&#xD;
      relative to controls. Vaidya et al. (1998) report similar findings for ADHD children, and&#xD;
      also showed that methylphenidate increased activity in the striatum for ADHD participants.&#xD;
      These results support a fronto-temporal N2 decrease in ADHD in brain areas implicated by&#xD;
      structural studies as abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durston and colleagues also found evidence that compared to non-ADHD, ADHD children also&#xD;
      activate a more diffuse network of posterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions to&#xD;
      subserve successful response inhibition (Durston et al., 2003). Increasing age also&#xD;
      significantly alters the pattern of activity seen on Go/No-Go tasks for healthy, non-ADHD&#xD;
      persons in these brain regions. Children activate more volume of prefrontal cortex compared&#xD;
      to adults (Casey et al., 1997). There also is evidence that healthy adults and teenagers use&#xD;
      different neural networks to achieve comparable response inhibition task performance (Rubia&#xD;
      et al., 2000). Healthy adults show modulation of ventral prefrontal activity depending on&#xD;
      task difficulty, whereas children appear to maximally activate these areas generally (Durston&#xD;
      et al., 2002). In a sample of ADHD participants ages 8 to 20, age was found to correlate&#xD;
      positively with left inferior frontal cortex, and correlate negatively with hemodynamic&#xD;
      activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Tamm et al., 2002). In other words, there&#xD;
      was increasing use of cortex known to be a primary substrate of response inhibition, while&#xD;
      reliance on cortex that is a primary substrate of working memory and other &quot;on-line&quot;&#xD;
      cognitive processes decreased with age. These differences suggest that age is an important&#xD;
      variable in understanding response inhibition neural activity in both ADHD and non-ADHD&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related changes to behavior or cognitive functioning are typically interpreted within a&#xD;
      developmental framework. Researchers hypothesize that age-related improvements in neural&#xD;
      function (i.e., increased neural connectivity or functional specialization) are responsible&#xD;
      for improvements in ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptomatology. A body of evidence indirectly&#xD;
      supports such contentions. Adults and adolescents are developmentally distinct with regard to&#xD;
      brain structure and function. Structural MR studies consistently show increases in white&#xD;
      matter volume throughout early childhood to early adulthood (Caviness et al.,1996; Giedd et&#xD;
      al., 1999) reflecting increasing connectivity among cortical areas, especially in reciprocal&#xD;
      connections between prefrontal and posterior brain areas (Goldman-Rakic, 1987). Gray matter&#xD;
      is seen to increase in a linear fashion until puberty and decrease during adolescence in most&#xD;
      brain regions. These curves peak in the frontal and parietal lobes at about age 12, the&#xD;
      temporal lobes at age 16, and the occipital lobes at increase until 20 (Giedd et al., 1999).&#xD;
      These findings are paralleled by histological animal and in vivo studies of human brain&#xD;
      development that show a sharp reduction in syntapogenesis at puberty, followed by an period&#xD;
      of synaptic pruning that continues at a similar rate throughout middle adulthood (Bourgeois,&#xD;
      2001). These changes presumably reflect the shaping of brain structure/function following&#xD;
      experience (Purves, 1988), and such changes likely reflect continuing performance&#xD;
      improvements on some cognitive tests throughout adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The juxtaposition of changes in brain structure/function and ADHD behavior from adolescence&#xD;
      to adulthood raises the possibility that the two might be linked. Furthermore, if these&#xD;
      factors are directly related, a link should be observable in a study that focuses on a core&#xD;
      impairment of ADHD (i.e., response inhibition) across different age groups. Two positions&#xD;
      have arisen in the field of developmental neurobiology to explain how ADHD symptoms diminish.&#xD;
      First, some researchers hold that brain areas crucial for behavioral inhibition (i.e.,&#xD;
      ventral prefrontal cortex) may continue to mature, albeit at a delay. Second, it is possible&#xD;
      that other, unimpaired cognitive mechanisms develop to compensate for behavioral inhibition&#xD;
      system impairment. Among others, some candidate compensatory mechanisms include stimulus&#xD;
      evaluation or working memory processes. Because of the lack of research, neither of these&#xD;
      positions have great support at the current time; moreover, the two possibilities are not&#xD;
      incompatible. However, this question is crucial in understanding the pathophysiology of ADHD.&#xD;
      Figure 2 (right) depicts a two possible relationships of response inhibition development in&#xD;
      terms of ERP N2 amplitude. In Figure 2A, the diminished N2 seen in ADHD youth could be&#xD;
      hypothesized to resolve with increasing age. Alternatively (Figure 2B), there may be no such&#xD;
      gains in response inhibition N2 neural function. Rather, other cognitive processes that can&#xD;
      be measured with different ERP indices may reflect the development of compensatory neural&#xD;
      mechanisms in older ADHD persons, such as those reflected by the P3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Previous research shows that response inhibition measured on Go/No-Go tasks is&#xD;
      abnormal in all ages of ADHD persons, and that methylphenidate improves performance and&#xD;
      alters neural function. When electrophysiological indices of response inhibition (i.e., the&#xD;
      N2 ERP) are compared between No-Go success and failure trials, ADHD persons show differences&#xD;
      related to automatic processes involved with response inhibition thought to involve&#xD;
      prefrontal brain activity. This conclusion is supported by fMRI studies that localize No-Go&#xD;
      hemodynamic response to inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and medial cortex (i.e., anterior&#xD;
      cingulate and premotor cortex). Therefore, the N2 measures the strength of inhibitory neural&#xD;
      processing, likely reflecting activity in brain structures known to be abnormal in ADHD with&#xD;
      respect to both structure and hemodynamic function. However, electrophysiology has not yet&#xD;
      been used to measure behavioral inhibition in ADHD adults, or to compare ADHD adults and&#xD;
      youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use electrophysiology to determine whether age-related differences in ADHD&#xD;
      symptom expression are related to differences in brain activity involved with response&#xD;
      inhibition. Furthermore, by quantifying ADHD brain function both on and off psychostimulant&#xD;
      medication, it will be possible to determine how age influences ADHD persons' neural response&#xD;
      to methylphenidate. We broadly hypothesize that methylphenidate will affect each groups' ERPs&#xD;
      differently. Medication-related differences also will be observed in ADHD symptom severity&#xD;
      and neuropsychological test performance. Innovations include that this will be the first&#xD;
      electrophysiology study 1) of response inhibition in ADHD adults, 2) that attempts to&#xD;
      directly link brain function changes to symptomatology changes in maturation, and 3) that&#xD;
      examines medication effects on cognition and behavior across age groups in ADHD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADHD will be diagnosed based on DSM-IV criteria for ADHD combined subtype ADHD. Combined&#xD;
        subtype ADHD requires at least 6 of 9 possible symptoms within both the&#xD;
        Hyperactive-Impulsive symptom cluster and the Inattentive symptom cluster. This will be&#xD;
        assessed using information gathered from the K-SADS-PL interview with either the potential&#xD;
        participant or their parent, and from published self- and parent-report ADHD symptom rating&#xD;
        scales (Brown, 1996; Barkley, 1998). Predominantly Inattentive ADHD persons will not be&#xD;
        included. The Predominantly Inattentive subtype is the subject of much theoretical debate,&#xD;
        as it is not clear that these persons represent a unitary disorder, or that they are&#xD;
        neurobiologically similar to combined-subtype ADHD (Millich et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To further aid proper ADHD diagnosis, all potential participants will be administered a&#xD;
        battery of neuropsychological tests. Potential ADHD participants will undergo testing while&#xD;
        unmedicated. This battery will include IQ, and attention and memory tests (WASI, Trail&#xD;
        Making, Symbol Digit, Stroop Test, and Rey AVLT), as well as several measures of executive&#xD;
        functioning known to be sensitive to the cognitive deficits observed in ADHD samples&#xD;
        (Kaplan &amp; Stevens, 2002). Normal performance on all cognitive tests known to be sensitive&#xD;
        to ADHD will exclude participants from the study. Full Scale IQ score from the WASI below&#xD;
        80 or above 120 will exclude participants from further participation. Diagnostic interviews&#xD;
        using the SCID-IV (First et al., 1996) will be used to obtain a detailed psychiatric&#xD;
        history. Lifetime or current history of other major Axis I psychiatric disorders, including&#xD;
        bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance dependence disorders, or obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
        disorders, will exclude potential participants. These disorders may better explain the&#xD;
        presence of attention symptomatology, which DSM-IV criteria indicate precludes an ADHD&#xD;
        diagnosis. In addition, the disruptive behavior disorders module of the K-SADS-PL will be&#xD;
        used to evaluate the presence of childhood Conduct Disorder and adult Antisocial&#xD;
        Personality Disorder (ASPD). These diagnoses will also exclude further participation, as&#xD;
        these conditions may be better associated with different abnormalities in prefrontal brain&#xD;
        function (Bauer, 1997; Stevens et al., 2001). Potential participants also will be excluded&#xD;
        if they report a history of head injury (e.g., loss of consciousness &gt; 10 min), seizure&#xD;
        disorder, life threatening disease, family history of schizophrenia, uncorrected visual or&#xD;
        auditory deficits, or conditions contraindicated for MRI (claustrophobia, metal in body,&#xD;
        pregnancy, etc.). Up to 25% of persons with ADHD suffer from learning disorders (Tannock &amp;&#xD;
        Brown, 2000). Because educational failure is so prevalent in this group, we will include&#xD;
        these people into the study. While the strict inclusion criteria will exclude many&#xD;
        potential participants, this is necessary to ensure a homogenous participant population&#xD;
        that varies by the presence or absence of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only ADHD persons who are regularly prescribed a classic psychostimulant(Ritalin,&#xD;
        dexedrine, etc) will be recruited. This will confirm that such persons show a beneficial&#xD;
        therapeutic response to stimulants that can be characterized using brain function&#xD;
        measurements. While this will prevent the comparison of brain activity response among&#xD;
        various medications, it will simplify interpretation of the results. Finally, subjects will&#xD;
        be excluded if they are taking any adjunctive medication for ADHD symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
        Wellbutrin, etc.) or another psychoactive medication.&#xD;
