      This multicentric, randomized, double-blind and controlled study aims to examine the effect&#xD;
      of a fermented dairy product containing the probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001&#xD;
      (Actimel® = tested product) on the incidence of respiratory and gastro-intestinal common&#xD;
      infectious diseases (cumulated number of infections during the intervention period: primary&#xD;
      criteria), and on the Quality of Life in adults submitted to multi-stressor situation.&#xD;
      Volunteers received either 200g/day of tested product (N=121) or control product (N=118) for&#xD;
      7-weeks.&#xD;
