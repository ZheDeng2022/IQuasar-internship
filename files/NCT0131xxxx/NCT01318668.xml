  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effects of a nicotine challenge on brain activity, behavior and mood will&#xD;
      be evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers who have a smoking habbit: The first group&#xD;
      will undergo a series of treatments with NicVax, aimed at producing nicotine antibodies in&#xD;
      the body and preventing nicotine to enter the brain. The second group will receive a placebo&#xD;
      treatment. This pre-treatment (vaccination) will take place over a 18-week period. All&#xD;
      participants will then undergo two days of testing. On each day the subjects will perform a&#xD;
      number of psychomotor and memory tests after a challenge with nicotine (gum) or placebo(gum).&#xD;
      Also brain activity will be studied in an fMRI scanner. We expect to see an effect on brain&#xD;
      activation and performance only in the placebo-vaccinated group. The Nicvax vaccinated group&#xD;
      should show activation and performance comparable to that after challenge with placebo(gum)&#xD;
      as in this group nicotine should not cross the blood brain barrier and enter the brain&#xD;

      Rationale: To develop a more effective treatment for nicotine addiction is a public health&#xD;
      priority. In order to do so a better understanding is needed of the mechanisms 1) underlying&#xD;
      nicotine addiction and 2) the way treatments alter the way nicotine transiently and&#xD;
      permanently alters multiple cognitive and executive functions. Most effects of nicotine on&#xD;
      the Central Nervous System (CNS) are directly mediated by nicotine molecules. Treatment with&#xD;
      3'aminomethylnicotine P. aeruginosa r-Exoprotein A Conjugate Vaccine (NicVAX™) stimulates the&#xD;
      production of nicotine specific antibodies. These antibodies bind the small nicotine&#xD;
      molecules, preventing them to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and thus preventing CNS&#xD;
      stimulation. A nicotine challenge given after vaccination will show no or diminished direct&#xD;
      effects of nicotine on CNS stimulation. The blocking effects of the nicotine specific&#xD;
      antibodies will be evaluated on several cognitive tasks and on reactivity to smoking-related&#xD;
      cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Main aim; to show that NicVAX attenuates nicotine induced CNS effects on brain&#xD;
      activation and cognitive performance relative to placebo. The secondary aim is to evaluate&#xD;
      how these changes in CNS stimulation alter subjective measures and the addictive properties&#xD;
      of nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: within-subject cross-over double-blind placebo controlled study. Study&#xD;
      population: 48 current smokers, male, age 25-40, at least smoking 10 cigarettes /day the last&#xD;
      year, in general good health. Additional criteria; 1) No contra-indications for MRI 2) No&#xD;
      history of cognitive deficits or brain trauma 3) No use of psychoactive medication 4) No&#xD;
      contra-indications for nicotine gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): The group will be randomized in two sub-populations. 1) 28&#xD;
      volunteers will receive five injections of 3'aminomethylnicotine P. aeruginosa r-Exoprotein A&#xD;
      Conjugate Vaccine (NicVAX™), 2) 20 smokers will receive five injections placebo. On test days&#xD;
      both groups will be given a nicotine challenge; a chewing gum either containing nicotine&#xD;
      (2mg) or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: correlation between nicotine specific antibody and 1) the&#xD;
      BOLD response during resting state, during the smoking-cue reactivity paradigm and during&#xD;
      task performance; in regions of interest associated with the specific tasks; 2) the number of&#xD;
      correct response and the reaction time; 3) correlation between nicotine specific antibody and&#xD;
      subjective signs of nicotine addiction, measured with several questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: participants will complete a medical screening questionnaire (15-30 min) and&#xD;
      will undergo a medical screening (45 min; 2 blood samples, a urine sample and an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram). Informed consent will be obtained. All participants will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with NicVAX or Placebo 5 times on day 0, 28, 56, 84 and 112 (4 weeks in between each&#xD;
      injection) During the training session (Day 0; ±1,5 hour) the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      and baseline laboratory results will be reviewed to ensure that no changes to the&#xD;
      participants health and eligibility status occurred since the Screening Visit. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized and receive either one dose NicVAX 400µ in 1 ml or a placebo&#xD;
      intramuscular. The cognitive fMRI task will be trained in a dummy scanner, and questionnaires&#xD;
      will be completed. Subsequent vaccinations (days 28, 56, 84 and 112) should be given in the&#xD;
      alternating deltoid muscle. Participants will be observed for 60 minutes to monitor possible&#xD;
      adverse events. Adverse events, vital signs and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
      During each test session (days 133, 140) participants will complete 5 questionnaires (30&#xD;
      minute total) and will perform several cognitive tasks inside the fMRI scanner (scan session&#xD;
      in total ~85 min). The last test session (day 140) three blood samples (5-8 ml each) will be&#xD;
      taken for nicotine-specific antibody assessment and to monitor changes. In total the study&#xD;
      will take 18 hours to complete. The participants will be paid 10 euro/hr as compensation. The&#xD;
      risk of vaccination, fMRI scanning and of administration of nicotine 2mg gum (delivering a&#xD;
      dose of approximately 1-1.5 mg nicotine to the bloodstream) is negligible for carefully&#xD;
      screened participants. The nicotine specific-antibody vaccine has been clinically tested on&#xD;
      several occasions; the safety profile was favourable. Local reactogenicity was generally mild&#xD;
      to moderate and subsided spontaneously. Vaccinated subjects with the highest antibody levels&#xD;
      (top 30%) smoked less cigarettes per day and reported a higher abstinence rate than placebo&#xD;
      subjects, establishing proof-of-concept. The group receiving the vaccine could therefore in&#xD;
      theory reduce smoking/exposure to tobacco smoke and have consequential health benefits.&#xD;
