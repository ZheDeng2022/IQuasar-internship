  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back and posterior pelvic pain are common in pregnant females. Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated disability and it is estimated that all women experience some degree of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal discomfort during pregnancy. Borg-Stein et. al. found 25% of pregnant females&#xD;
      have temporarily disabling symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is demonstrated controversy over the mechanism of low back pain in pregnancy. The&#xD;
      biomechanical theory implies that the enlarging uterus causes the maternal center of gravity&#xD;
      to move anteriorly causing stress on the low back. Jensen et. al. demonstrated that weight&#xD;
      gain correlated with biomechanical changes. The changes were measured by weight gain in&#xD;
      segmental regions of the body and in principal moments of inertia from the sit to stand&#xD;
      movement. Literature does not demonstrate a specific correlation between weight gain and the&#xD;
      biomechanical changes of sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center of gravity. These three&#xD;
      measurements may have a correlating effect on the underlying cause of low back pain in&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the correlation between weight gain of pregnant females and the&#xD;
      biomechanical changes of sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center of gravity. The change in&#xD;
      weight over the last two trimesters will be correlated with the sway rate, lumbosacral angle&#xD;
      and center of gravity. The degree of symptomatic low back pain as measured by the Oswestry&#xD;
      Low Back Pain Scale will also be correlated with the sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center&#xD;
      of gravity.&#xD;

      The principal investigator will recruit subjects at the yoga studio and one of the&#xD;
      investigators and the research assistant will recruit subjects at the NSU clinic. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will go through a short verbal pre-screening to ensure they fit the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Subjects that fit this criteria will read and sign the consent form. The&#xD;
      PI and research assistant will answer any questions about the study prior to the subject&#xD;
      giving consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the subject's initial weight will be measured on the postural scale and documented.&#xD;
      Change in weight is the dependent variable in this study. The following independent variables&#xD;
      will be measured: lumbosacral angle, sway rate and shift of weight posteriorly. The&#xD;
      lumbosacral angle will be measured by a digital inclinometer. The lumbosacral angle is&#xD;
      measured between the plane of the superior surface of S1 to the horizontal plane. Saur et.&#xD;
      al., demonstrated that the inclinometer technique for lumbosacral angle has established&#xD;
      validity and reliability in comparison to radiographic x-rays. Comparison of radiographic and&#xD;
      inclinometer technique is clinically suitable for measuring lumbar position. Keeley et. al.&#xD;
      reported high correlation coefficients for interrater reliability with the inclinometer&#xD;
      technique on patients with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional measurements of sway rate and center of gravity will be measured by the&#xD;
      postural analyzer. The quadruple scale that will be used in this study is based on four&#xD;
      digital force plates with computer communication operated by software enabling test analysis.&#xD;
      The quadruple scale will provide numeric and graphic data on total weight, weight&#xD;
      distribution (kg. or lb.), percentage weight difference, sway rate and an estimate of the&#xD;
      location and deviation of the subject's center of mass. All data will be recorded and saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following those measurements, the subject will be asked to complete the Oswestry Low Back&#xD;
      Pain Scale. The Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale is a suitable questionnaire for an&#xD;
      English-speaking population and to enquire about areas of functioning specifically relevant&#xD;
      to low back pain sufferers, such as lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping and&#xD;
      socializing. Fisher et. al. demonstrated that the Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale is an&#xD;
      acceptable instrument for back pain patients with evidence of criterion-related validity,&#xD;
      factorial validity and moderately high internal consistency. It has good face validity for&#xD;
      the patients. According to Fisher et. al., the Oswestry Scale can be recommended as a&#xD;
      relevant measure of disability with evidence of validity, reliability and sensitivity to&#xD;
      change for both clinical and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of time needed to complete the measurements and the Oswestry Low Back Pain&#xD;
      Scale should take 15 minutes. Biweekly, willing participants will be recruited and previous&#xD;
      participants will be continually measured for weight, lumbosacral angle, sway rate and&#xD;
      deviation of the subject's center of mass.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients in their second or third trimester who are patients at NSU Ob/Gyn&#xD;
             clinic or prenatal yoga students at Red Pearl Yoga Studio who are willing to&#xD;
             participate in the study and follow up with measurements for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria include women who have a BMI of over 30 or whom are clinically&#xD;
             obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abdominal obesity can cause low back pain and it increases the lumbosacral angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women will be excluded who have prior history of back surgery, acute disc herniation,&#xD;
             arthritis, immunological disorder, acute fracture and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional exclusion criteria include high risk pregnancies such as gestational&#xD;
             diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa and abruptio placentae.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All of the following could be contributory for low back pain and may affect the&#xD;
             biomechanics of the low back.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patients at the NSU clinic have these exclusion criteria documented in their&#xD;
             medical chart, they will not be approached for recruitment in the study. During the&#xD;
             verbal pre-screening, the research assistant will ask the subject if they have any of&#xD;
             the above conditions. If so, they will not be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
             The same verbal pre-screening will be used at the yoga studio for recruitment. No data&#xD;
             will be collected for subjects who are excluded during the pre-screening.&#xD;
