      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving&#xD;
      everolimus together with docetaxel is more effective than giving docetaxel alone in treating&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus given&#xD;
      together with docetaxel in treating patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic&#xD;
      head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of everolimus and docetaxel&#xD;
           in treating patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma of the head and neck. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of everolimus when&#xD;
           combined with docetaxel in these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the response rates in patients receiving the combination of docetaxel and&#xD;
           everolimus and those receiving docetaxel alone. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between docetaxel and everolimus in&#xD;
           these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of everolimus on downstream targets of mTOR in tumor in these&#xD;
           patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the time to progression after docetaxel and everolimus in these patients.&#xD;
           (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a pilot study to attempt to identify predictors of response, including&#xD;
           evaluation of EGFR family member expression, mutations, or amplifications. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To attempt to identify downstream targets of the EGFR pathway including phosphorylation&#xD;
           of S6 and phosphorylation of AKT. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus with docetaxel&#xD;
      followed by a randomized phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and escalating doses of oral&#xD;
           everolimus on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses&#xD;
           of therapy, patients may continue to receive everolimus weekly as a single agent until&#xD;
           evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm A: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.Treatment repeats every&#xD;
                21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
                toxicity. Patients with progressive disease are eligible to cross over into the&#xD;
                everolimus arm at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm B: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm A and oral everolimus (at a dose&#xD;
                determined in the phase I portion of the study) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment&#xD;
                repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
                unacceptable toxicity. After the completion of combination therapy, patients may&#xD;
                continue to receive maintenance everolimus weekly, at the investigator's&#xD;
                discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic monitoring in the phase I study. Tissue&#xD;
      samples are collected at baseline and periodically during the study for biomarker and other&#xD;
      laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for at least 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 100&#xD;
      patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.&#xD;
