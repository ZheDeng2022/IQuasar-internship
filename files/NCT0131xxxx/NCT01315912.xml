    <textblock>
      In a prospective interventional study, 44 Clomiphene resistant infertile patients were&#xD;
      selected from Abolfazl Infertility Clinic of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences.&#xD;
      Letrozole was given orally in a dose of 2.5mg, 5mg and 7.5mg, respectively. If the patient&#xD;
      displayed no response, the dosage was increased. The size of follicle, endometrial thickness,&#xD;
      estradiol, complications and clinical pregnancy rate were evaluated as the final outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective intervention, the investigators studied Abolfazle outpatients who were&#xD;
      referred to us by Bushehr University of Medical Sciences in Iran between January 1, 2008 and&#xD;
      December 30, 2010. The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of Bushehr&#xD;
      University of Medical Sciences and all patients were required to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent before the study commenced.There were 3 steps in which the investigators prescribed&#xD;
      letrozole (Femara,Novartis,Quebec,Canada). In all cases, daily administration began on the&#xD;
      3rd day of the menstrual cycle through to the 7th day (totaling 5 days). In the first step&#xD;
      the investigators prescribed letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg (one tablet) for one or two cycles&#xD;
      according to the patient's response. Normal follicular size and endometrial thickness were&#xD;
      considered 18-24 mm and 6 mm or more respectively.1 If the follicle was deemed not&#xD;
      acceptable, the dose of letrozole was increased at the next cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second and third steps the investigators prescribed letrozole at a dose of 5 mg daily&#xD;
      and 7.5 mg/day,respectively and according to patient's response, repeat the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the investigators tested the hypothesis that prescribing letrozole as an&#xD;
      ovulation induction agent in infertile women would increase pregnancy rate, ovulation and&#xD;
      follicle number (at the normal size range of 18-24 mm), endometrial thickness (to normal&#xD;
      thickness of 6 mm) and not have considerable side effects in the patients. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure was normal follicular size and the secondary outcome measure were the&#xD;
      clinical and current pregnancy rates. Clinical pregnancy was considered as the presence of a&#xD;
      gestational sac with fetal heart activity. Letrozole tablets were prescribed by an&#xD;
      experienced nurse who throughly explained the method of use to the patients. Sonography was&#xD;
      done by an experienced radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse prescribed letrozole to the patients and the university hospital laboratory's&#xD;
      technician did not know past medical history of clomiphene resistance of the patients. The&#xD;
      radiologist did not have any knowledge about the drugs prescribed to the patients. Side&#xD;
      effects and complications of Letrozole were detailed to all patients by an obstetrician.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by the Statistical Package for Social Science version 11.5&#xD;
      for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago. IL). The data was analyzed by student's t-test and&#xD;
      chi-squared test for linear trend and comparing proportions. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study group consisted of polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS) patients diagnosed&#xD;
             according to the Rotterdam criteria. The investigators defined Clomiphene citrate&#xD;
             (Clomid, Iran hormone,Tehran,Iran) resistance as anovulation after consumption of 3&#xD;
             cycles of cc at 150 mg/day, determined by serial estradiol monitoring and sonography.&#xD;
             Patients resistant to Clomiphene citrate became candidates for letrozole&#xD;
             (Femara,Novartis,Quebec,Canada) consumption at the step-up of the protocol. Patients&#xD;
             were between 18 and 39 years of age, body mass index (BMI) was &gt; 19 or &lt; 30 kg/m2 and&#xD;
             day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt; 12Miu/Ml.&#xD;
