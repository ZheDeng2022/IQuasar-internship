    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single treatment vs.&#xD;
      multiple treatments of CoolSculpting™ by Zeltiq™ Aesthetics for non-invasive cooling of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat using the eZ App 8 large applicator on the abdomen for fat layer reduction.&#xD;

      The Zeltiq Cooling Device to be used in this study (i.e, CLN1) is designed to non-invasively&#xD;
      cool skin and subcutaneous fat. The device provides cooling at a controlled preset level&#xD;
      (i.e., temperature) as defined by a pre-programmed treatment profile and provides continuous&#xD;
      feedback on the temperature of the cooling plate interface with the skin. The device also is&#xD;
      able to provide warming at a controlled and variable, preset temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cooling device includes an applicator, which is the component used to apply cooling and&#xD;
      warming to the treatment site, and the control unit which houses the system controller, power&#xD;
      source, and other hardware. Each applicator is comprised of at least two thermoelectric&#xD;
      coolers with an aluminum plate which is the primary skin interface for cooling and warming.&#xD;
      The thermoelectric cooler is controlled and powered by a thermoelectric cooler controller is&#xD;
      part of the control system. The device allows a well-controlled temperature to be applied to&#xD;
      and maintained at the surface of the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zeltiq Aesthetics Cooling Device to be used in this study has one applicator&#xD;
      configuration. The vacuum applicator, which includes a small amount of vacuum pressure to&#xD;
      create the massage effect. A disposable sleeve is provided for use with each of these&#xD;
      applicators to provide an interface between the applicator and the skin. Sensors are included&#xD;
      in the disposable sleeve to measure the temperature at the interface and to provide feedback&#xD;
      to ensure appropriate control of the applicator temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the protection of the subject, safety features are incorporated into the device to avoid&#xD;
      any unexpected excursions in the temperature. The device will automatically terminate the&#xD;
      procedure if the measured temperature exceeds the minimum and maximum programmed temperature&#xD;
      by more than one degree, i.e., 1ºC colder than the minimum programmed cooling temperature or&#xD;
      1ºC warmer than the maximum programmed temperature. Furthermore, the device has been tested&#xD;
      extensively prior to being made available for use in this clinical study. Electrical safety&#xD;
      tests to established standards (IEC-60601, UL-2601) have been performed and extensive testing&#xD;
      has been performed to demonstrate device temperature reproducibility. Biocompatibility&#xD;
      testing has been performed on any materials that are to contact the treatment site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended to evaluate the large applicator of the Zeltiq Aesthetics non-invasive&#xD;
      cooling device and to evaluate treatment of the lower abdomen to determine if non-invasive&#xD;
      cold exposure will consistently result in a reduction of fat when used by clinicians in an&#xD;
      environment that represents routine clinical practice.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of 20 subjects, ages 18-65 years, who have clearly&#xD;
        visible fat in the lower abdomen and are appropriate candidates as per the Study Doctor's&#xD;
