      Uterine Leiomyomata, also known as uterine fibroids, are non-cancer tumors found in the wall&#xD;
      of the uterus or womb. Uterine fibroids are the common cause of surgery (removal of the&#xD;
      uterus). African American women are 3-4 times more likely to have uterine fibroids. Currently&#xD;
      there is no effective long-term medical treatment for fibroids. Hormones have been used for&#xD;
      short-term therapy, but they are not used long-term because of the risk of side effects. When&#xD;
      women stop receiving the hormone therapy often fibroids return. Surgery is the common&#xD;
      treatment for women who are suffering from abnormal symptoms caused by fibroids. Hysterectomy&#xD;
      is an effective treatment, however women cannot have children after removal of the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) is one of the main natural chemicals found in green tea..&#xD;
      Research the investigators have done in the laboratory and in animals leads them to believe&#xD;
      EGCG may decrease the growth of fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to determine whether EGCG will cause fibroid tumors to shrink and&#xD;
      reduce fibroid related symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding and pelvic discomfort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Uterine leiomyoma (also known as fibroids) are benign estrogen-dependent tumors of the&#xD;
           uterine wall. Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive&#xD;
           tract, occurring in 20-70% of premenopausal women in the reproductive age women and&#xD;
           cause multiple clinical complications such as acute and chronic pelvic pain as well as&#xD;
           excessive vaginal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, moreover they are considered as&#xD;
           the leading indication for hysterectomy in reproductive age African American (AA) women.&#xD;
           The impact of these serious clinical complications on women's health is tremendous.&#xD;
           African American women are particularly affected as the prevalence of uterine fibroids&#xD;
           is about 4 times higher in that ethnic group compared to Caucasians. Being a major&#xD;
           health disparity issue, uterine fibroids appear to further diminish the quality of life&#xD;
           for AA women who also suffer from higher incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
           heart disease, obesity, and cancer. Currently there is no effective long-term medicinal&#xD;
           treatment for this common disease. GnRH analogues are effective short medical therapy&#xD;
           option. However, they are not approved for long-term (more than 3 months) because of the&#xD;
           risk of irreversible bone loss and osteoporosis and other major side effects. When these&#xD;
           medications are discontinued, the fibroids return to their original size with symptoms&#xD;
           recurring, that is why they are FDA approved in uterine fibroids only as preoperative&#xD;
           adjuvant to improve the fibroid-related iron-deficiency anemia. Surgery, usually in the&#xD;
           form of hysterectomy, is the traditional treatment of women with symptomatic uterine&#xD;
           fibroids. Clearly hysterectomy is an effective treatment but it precludes future&#xD;
           fertility. This creates a major dilemma for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who&#xD;
           have not completed their families or have not even started a family. Problems with&#xD;
           fibroids must be viewed as a public health concern as well as a major health disparity&#xD;
           issue. The general public in relation to this problem must be concerned about the: (1)&#xD;
           The decrease in the quality of life of women who are affected, and hence the well-being&#xD;
           of the whole family; (2) Interference with inter-family dynamics and relationships.&#xD;
           Decrease in productivity in the workforce/job performance. Increase in cost of health&#xD;
           care caused by the more than 600,000 hysterectomies/Y in USA alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Green Tea Extract&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will evaluate the utility of EGCG, green tea extract, which is a common nutritional&#xD;
      supplement, in symptomatic relief of this common women's health problem. Considering the wide&#xD;
      acceptability of nutritional supplements especially among African American women, the ethnic&#xD;
      group most affected by uterine fibroids, this project can potentially provide an effective&#xD;
      and inexpensive non-surgical alternative for management of uterine fibroids. Green tea is a&#xD;
      common agent used by women for multiple purposes. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the&#xD;
      major catechin (about 80%) of green tea. EGCG exhibit several useful biological effects&#xD;
      including anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative as well as anti-oxidant effects. A study&#xD;
      conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture reported that green tea has potent&#xD;
      anti-cancer effects against a wide range of human cancer cells. Green tea's polyphenols, most&#xD;
      notably EGCG, are considered responsible for those positive effects. Green tea polyphenols&#xD;
      have also been shown to inhibit key pathways of tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior Human Experience with EGCG Several human clinical studies used EGCG for extended&#xD;
           periods of time in which EGCG was very well tolerated with virtually no reportable side&#xD;
           effects. Wolfarm and colleagues used oral EGCG 300 mg/day in cardiac patients and&#xD;
           reported improved endothelial function and increased brachial artery flow-mediated&#xD;
           dilation that paralleled changes in EGCG plasma concentration. reported on the&#xD;
           consumption of 500-1000 mg/day of oral EGCG for 3 months which resulted in marked&#xD;
           decrease in several anti-oxidative biomarkers compared to placebo. Numerous studies have&#xD;
           described favorable effects of EGCG when used in overweight and obese individuals for&#xD;
           extended durations. Chow et.al. reported on human use of EGCG with 30 healthy volunteers&#xD;
           randomly assigned to one of the following doses of Polyphenon E (a decaffeinated green&#xD;
           tea catechin mixture): 400, 800, or 1200 mg/day (10 subjects per dose group). Only&#xD;
           transient mild nausea was noted in 3% of the study participants and was seen only at the&#xD;
           highest study agent dose (1200 mg EGCG/day) and in the fasting condition. Doses of 800mg&#xD;
           were well tolerated with no reported side effects. Grapes also contain polyphenols and&#xD;
           catechins such as EGCG. EGCG is the most powerful of these catechins that accounts for&#xD;
           the favorable health effects from the use of grapes extracts. Grapes polyphenols have&#xD;
           been shown to inhibit key pathways of tumor growth. Grapes EGCG appear to block each&#xD;
           stage of tumor-genesis by modulating signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation,&#xD;
           transformation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which are clearly involved in&#xD;
           pathogenesis of various tumors including uterine fibroids. Freeze-dried table grapes&#xD;
           powder has been used recently for several months in pre-and post-menopausal women at&#xD;
           doses of up to 36 gm/day. This dose corresponds to about 800mg EGCG/day. This treatment&#xD;
           was very well tolerated with no reported side effects. This suggests that such&#xD;
           supplement can be successfully administered to women as part of life or diet&#xD;
           modification programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical Data Recent studies from our group demonstrated the ability of EGCG to&#xD;
           control the proliferation and to induce apoptosis in human leiomyomata cells in vitro&#xD;
           and in animal models. Our preclinical data in fibroid animal models demonstrates that&#xD;
           EGCG at a dose of 1.25mg/Kg/day added to drinking water was able to induce a highly&#xD;
           significant (up to 80%) shrinkage of fibroid lesions compared to untreated controls. The&#xD;
           treatment was well tolerated with no detected side effects. Such daily doses of EGCG&#xD;
           have been administered safely to human subjects in prior clinical trials. This effect is&#xD;
           partially attributed to potent inhibitory effect of EGCG on Catechol-O-methyl&#xD;
           transferase (COMT), an enzyme that we have recently linked to pathogenesis of uterine&#xD;
           fibroids. In this proposal we aim to evaluate the efficacy of Epigallocatechin gallate&#xD;
           (EGCG) in reducing the size of uterine fibroids and improving quality of life in women&#xD;
           with symptomatic uterine fibroids, as well as assess its safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have recently demonstrated elevated levels of expression of catechol-O-methyl&#xD;
           transferase (COMT) in uterine fibroids compared to adjacent normal myometrium, and&#xD;
           described its important role in fibroid pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interestingly, recent reports demonstrated that EGCG has potent anti-COMT activity.&#xD;
           These reports have shown that green tea extract intake is associated with weight loss&#xD;
           due to diet-induced thermo-genesis. This effect is generally attributed to EGCG. This&#xD;
           catechin is known to be capable of inhibiting COMT, which is the enzyme that degrades&#xD;
           nor-epinephrine, thus stimulating thermo-genesis. The inhibition of COMT by EGCG was&#xD;
           uncompetitive with respect to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) suggesting that there is no&#xD;
           direct interaction between EGCG and the SAM-binding site on the COMT, yet there was&#xD;
           clear inhibition of COMT activity with increasing EGCG concentration. Additionally, the&#xD;
           Vmax values for methylation were decreased. Our preliminary data also showed that EGCG&#xD;
           inhibited COMT gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in human leiomyomata cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our hypothesis is that the use of the &quot;EGCG&quot; as a nutritional supplement will decrease&#xD;
           the size of uterine fibroids and improve fibroids-related clinical symptoms in women&#xD;
           resulting in a significant improvement in their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This work will evaluate the utility of a common nutritional supplement in symptomatic&#xD;
           relief of a very common women's health problem. Considering the availability, lower&#xD;
           cost, as well as the wide acceptability of nutritional supplements, this project can&#xD;
           potentially provide an inexpensive non-surgical alternative for management of uterine&#xD;
           fibroids which would have a major impact on health of women from all ethnic groups.&#xD;
