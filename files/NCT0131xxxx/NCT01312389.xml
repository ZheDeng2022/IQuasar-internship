      This is a Phase I/II randomized study for subjects with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer to determine the feasibility and safety as well as immunogenicity&#xD;
      of OC-L, an autologous vaccine comprised of autologous Oxidized tumor Cell Lysate (OC-L)&#xD;
      administered by intradermal/subcutaneous injection in combination with Ampligen&#xD;
      (poly-l:poly-C12U), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. Study duration is 24 months. This study&#xD;
      has two Phases eligible subjects enrolled in Phase 1 will receive the OC-L admixed with&#xD;
      Montanide ISA 51 with intravenous Ampligen. Subjects enrolled in Phase II will be randomized&#xD;
      to two ARMS. This randomized design will allow for the unbiased evaluation and comparison of&#xD;
      immune response among the 2 treatment arms. patients will be randomized (10 per treatment&#xD;
      arm) in blocks of size 4 or 6, such that treatment assignment will be balanced after each&#xD;
      group of 4 or 6 patients has been randomized. ARM A 10 patients will receive OC-L. Arm b 10&#xD;
      patients will receive OC-L with Ampligen. Following each vaccination, subjects in Phase I and&#xD;
      Arm B will be given intravenous Ampligen 3 times starting 2-3 days after each vaccine&#xD;
      administration. All subjects will receive vaccine on Day 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive Prevnar on day 0 and day 14. Subjects will be treated till exhaustion of OC-L or&#xD;
      disease progression whichever occurs first subjects will be contacted every 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 5 years and then annually for survival. The OC-L study product is manufactured and quality&#xD;
      tested at Cell and Vaccine Production Facility and then released to IDS, where it will be&#xD;
      admixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG on day of vaccination.&#xD;
