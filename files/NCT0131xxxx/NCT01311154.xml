  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is distinctive in studying known carriers of resistant Enterobacteriaceae.&#xD;
      It examines both phenotypic and genotypic expansion in the AMR bacterial population as a&#xD;
      function of antibiotic treatment, and examines the effect of antibiotics on the dissemination&#xD;
      of resistance genes from species to species. It will examine CRE, important emerging&#xD;
      pathogens, which are a significant threat to public health, but yet not well studied. The&#xD;
      proposed study will use an interdisciplinary approach, combining PK/PD, phenotypic, and&#xD;
      genetic data to understand the effect of antibiotics on the likelihood of spread of AMR. Most&#xD;
      previous studies have focused on the effect of antibiotic agents on clinical detection,&#xD;
      infection or acquisition of AMR among non-carriers67,68. Other studies have looked at the&#xD;
      effects on colonisation-resistance mostly among healthy volunteers69. Very few studies have&#xD;
      examined the effects of various antibiotic agents on carriers of ARB and those focused&#xD;
      primarily on vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE)70. No similar studies have been conducted&#xD;
      with regard to ESBL or to CRE. Correlation with clinical factors and environmental&#xD;
      contamination has not been determined in previously published studies. The proposed study&#xD;
      also extends the analysis to the effect of antibiotic treatment on dissemination of&#xD;
      resistance genes which may be of great importance as these events may lead to emergence of&#xD;
      new AMR strains and species. The proposed study not only examines the effects of various&#xD;
      antibiotic agents and classes, but also the effects of duration of treatment and PK/PD&#xD;
      indices on amplification of ARB. The study will also examine the effect of antibiotics on the&#xD;
      epidemicity and fitness of colonising strains&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will conduct an observational longitudinal prospective study in 3 hospitals in units with&#xD;
      high prevalence of resistant organisms. Consenting patients will be screened for carriage of&#xD;
      AMR organisms at admission, and those found to be carriers of the target ARB will be included&#xD;
      in the longitudinal study. To improve the yield of screening we may use risk stratification&#xD;
      based on risk factors identified at each center. Patients included in the longitudinal study&#xD;
      will be asked to provide serial stool samples every 2-3 days during hospitalisation (rectal&#xD;
      swab will be allowed as replacement for stool specimen, after developing appropriate&#xD;
      methodology to correlate between stool samples and rectal swabs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These samples will be analysed using quantitative cultures for the number of resistant&#xD;
      organisms, and samples will be subject to quantitative real time PCR to quantify resistant&#xD;
      genes (CTX-M, TEM, SHV, KPC, VIM as required). In parallel, environmental contamination will&#xD;
      be examined and quantified using similar methods. Data will be collected daily regarding&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, other medications, clinical parameters, bowel movements and presence of&#xD;
      diarrhoea, and various PK/PD indices. The target antibiotic for this study include commonly&#xD;
      use agents in the hospital setting including quinolones, cephalosporins,&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem, doripenem, metronidazole, clindamycin and&#xD;
      aminoglycosides. The duration, the sequential order of treatment and PK/PD indices will be&#xD;
      examined. The effects of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis will be examined as an important end&#xD;
      point. The effects of the target antibiotic agents/classes on selection, enrichment, and&#xD;
      spread of the target AMR organisms. Analyses will be conducted to compare: 1. the effects of&#xD;
      various antibiotics 2. the effect of duration of therapy 3. the durability of the effect&#xD;
      (posttreatment). 4. The effects of PK/PD indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis will examine the risk of developing infections as function of various&#xD;
      factors including time and load of carriage of resistant organisms and of exposure to&#xD;
      antibiotics will be performed. Correlation with clinical isolates will be performed including&#xD;
      typing, gene and plasmid analyses to determine correlation between colonising and infecting&#xD;
      strains. Experiment simulating patient contact will be conducted to examine contamination of&#xD;
      hands, gloves and gowns after contact in order to correlate between environmental&#xD;
      contamination and contamination of healthcare workers. Additional work will be conducted on&#xD;
      profiling bacterial communities by DNA fingerprinting techniques using length hetrogeneity&#xD;
      (LH-PCR) and automated ribososmal internal spacer analysis (ARISA) on a sample of the&#xD;
      patients studied.&#xD;
