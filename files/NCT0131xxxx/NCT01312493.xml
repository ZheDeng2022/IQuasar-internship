      This is a non-randomized phase II trial of targeted radiotherapy (RT) administered&#xD;
      concurrently with panitumumab in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      the head and neck. This protocol addresses patients with medical comorbidities that make them&#xD;
      poor candidates for concurrent chemotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment will be directed at&#xD;
      disease visible on diagnostic imaging modalities and the ipsilateral hemi-neck, sparing&#xD;
      elective regions in the contralateral N0 hemi-neck with less than 20% chance of microscopic&#xD;
      involvement. We explore the following hypothesis: Can acceptable locoregional disease control&#xD;
      be obtained with less treatment-related morbidity by focusing RT on regions of gross disease,&#xD;
      sparing regions with a low risk of harboring subclinical disease from elective RT?&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oral cavity,&#xD;
             oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage III, IVA, or IVB disease (locally advanced with no systemic metastases and&#xD;
             without bilateral nodal disease, i.e., N2c).&#xD;
&#xD;

             &gt;12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible if they have concurrent medical conditions that render them poor&#xD;
             candidates for chemotherapy. Patients are considered to be in this group if any of the&#xD;
             following criteria is met: Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl (or estimated creatinine&#xD;
             clearance &lt;50mL/min); Insulin dependent diabetes; SGOT, SGPT, or alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
