  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An experimental treatment for metastatic melanoma involves cell therapy, in which&#xD;
      researchers take white blood cells (lymphocytes) from the tumor tissue, grow them in the&#xD;
      laboratory in large numbers, and then use the cells to attack the tumor tissue. Before&#xD;
      receiving the cells, chemotherapy is needed to temporarily suppress the immune system to&#xD;
      improve the chances that the tumor-fighting cells will be able to survive in the body. In&#xD;
      some studies of cell therapy, individuals who have received total body irradiation (TBI) in&#xD;
      addition to the chemotherapy (in order to increase the length of time that they do not&#xD;
      produce white blood cells) seem to have a slightly better response to the treatment, but it&#xD;
      is not known if adding radiation to the cell therapy will cause a better response for all&#xD;
      individuals. Researchers are interested in comparing cell therapy given with the usual&#xD;
      chemotherapy to cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy and TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effectiveness of cell therapy given with chemotherapy to cell therapy given&#xD;
      with chemotherapy and total body irradiation in individuals with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,&#xD;
           and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups: cell therapy with chemotherapy alone&#xD;
           (group 1) or cell therapy with chemotherapy plus TBI (group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will provide a tumor sample from either surgery or a tumor biopsy for&#xD;
           white blood cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells for cell&#xD;
           growth and future testing, and TBI group participants will also provide stem cells to&#xD;
           help them recover after radiation. (TBI participants who cannot provide enough stem&#xD;
           cells will be moved to the non-radiation treatment group.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (two treatments over 2 days)&#xD;
           and fludarabine (five treatments over 5 days) starting 7 days before the cell therapy.&#xD;
           Participants in the TBI group will also have TBI for the 3 days immediately before the&#xD;
           cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive the white blood cells, followed by high-dose aldesleukin&#xD;
           every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion to help keep the therapy cells&#xD;
           alive and active. Participants will also have injections of filgrastim to stimulate&#xD;
           blood cell production, and participants in the TBI group will also receive their stem&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months after treatment to prevent&#xD;
           pneumonia, and will be asked to return for regular monitoring and followup visits for at&#xD;
           least 5 years to evaluate the tumor s response to treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate&#xD;
           the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose&#xD;
           aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy&#xD;
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or&#xD;
           with 2 Gy or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using RECIST&#xD;
           criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Complete regression rates in these three&#xD;
           consecutive trials were 12%, 20%, and 40%, respectively strongly suggesting that the&#xD;
           addition of TBI could improve the complete regression rate. Of the 20 complete&#xD;
           regressions seen in this trial, 19 are on-going at 37 to 82 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the complexity of developing selected TIL for use in adoptive transfer, we&#xD;
           have recently developed a simplified method for producing TIL that is more applicable to&#xD;
           use in outside institutions. Utilizing young TIL cells (sometimes with CD8 purification)&#xD;
           in 105 patients, the objective response rate was 34% with a 6.6 % incidence of complete&#xD;
           regressions. All patients in this trial received the cyclophosphamide fludarabine&#xD;
           regimen alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the strong suggestion that the addition of TBI to the chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
           could increase durable, complete regression rates in patients with metastatic melanoma,&#xD;
           we are now attempting to definitively determine whether the addition of TBI to the&#xD;
           chemotherapy preparative regimen can improve complete response rates, and overall&#xD;
           survival in patients receiving young TIL .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine, in a prospective randomized trial, the complete response rate and survival of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ACT using young TIL plus aldesleukin treatment&#xD;
      following either a chemotherapy preparative regimen alone, or the same chemotherapy&#xD;
      preparative regimen plus TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients who are 18 years or older must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration or total body irradiation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is&#xD;
      established patients with will be prospectively randomized to receive ACT with young TIL plus&#xD;
      aldesleukin following either a non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen or this&#xD;
      same regimen plus TBI.&#xD;

             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease&#xD;
             and AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
