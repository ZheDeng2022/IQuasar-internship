      Prostate biopsy is performed by multiple consecutive biopsy needle insertion into the&#xD;
      prostate gland under a trans-rectal ultrasound probe guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the performing physician navigates the needle using a momentary 2D ultrasound image&#xD;
      (longitudinal and transverse B mode) without any record of the full prostate boundaries or&#xD;
      previous biopsies' location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's Objectives are to record the trans-rectal biopsy procedure including the initial&#xD;
      scan and the needle biopsy location and to modulate a 3D model of the prostate with accurate&#xD;
      display the locations of the various biopsies taken during the procedure.&#xD;

        2. INTRODUCTION Prostate biopsy is performed by multiple consecutive biopsy needle&#xD;
           insertion into the prostate gland under the trans-rectal ultrasound probe guidance. The&#xD;
           needle is inserted through a designated needle guide on the ultrasound probe, through&#xD;
           the rectum wall and into the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the performing physician navigates the needle using a momentary 2D ultrasound image&#xD;
      (longitudinal and transverse B mode) without any record of the full prostate boundaries or&#xD;
      previous biopsies' location. By recording the procedure the Navigo™ system will generate and&#xD;
      display in off-line an accurate 3D model of the prostate and position the biopsies taken in&#xD;
      the prostatic volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE 3.1 Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To record the trans-rectal biopsy procedure including the initial scan and the needle&#xD;
      biopsy location 2) To modulate a 3D model of the prostate and accurately display the&#xD;
      locations of the various biopsies taken during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is a noninvasive system that allows the physician to accurately record the&#xD;
      biopsy procedure without changing the imaging system, the biopsy routine or the techniques&#xD;
      used today to scan and guide the biopsy needle insertion. The ability to create an accurate&#xD;
      3D model of the prostate and accurately position the biopsy needle location will allow the&#xD;
      performing physician a more precise navigation and easier and more accurate biopsy within the&#xD;
      prostate volume and enable a better analysis of the procedure and the pathological results,&#xD;
      hence improved clinical outcomes with intended therapy or surveillance ( i.e.- prepare for&#xD;
      follow-up biopsy procedure if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE The Navigo™ system is comprised of two main elements:&#xD;
      a standard laptop computer with a digitizer input to record incoming video input (from the&#xD;
      ultrasound system), and an electro-magnetic 3D tracking system. The 3D tracking system is&#xD;
      connected via USB to the laptop computer, the transmitter is placed beneath the patient's&#xD;
      mattress and two sensors are attached,- one to the ultrasound probe (at the base/ non&#xD;
      invasive part of the probe) and the other to the patient's back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system tracks and records the location of the ultrasound probe and the incoming&#xD;
      video from the ultrasound system. The patient's movement is recorded and compensated when the&#xD;
      ultrasound images are placed with reference to each other. In post procedure, the physician&#xD;
      defines the boundaries of the prostate on selected ultrasound images and a 3D model of the&#xD;
      prostate is displayed with all recorded biopsy specimens' locations displayed in the&#xD;
      prostatic volume. The physician will be able to examine in post analysis the scattering&#xD;
      quality of the biopsy specimens in the prostatic volume and update the pathology results. The&#xD;
      3D model can be rotated, manipulated and displayed in the physician's preferable choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is intended to record and display in 3D the biopsy procedure of any&#xD;
      patient undergoing a prostate trans-rectal biopsy. The Navigo™ system is intended to record&#xD;
      all the data from the initial scan, the volume measurements, and the biopsy needle insertion.&#xD;
      All the images are saved and can be reviewed in post analysis, the needle location can be&#xD;
      updated according to the physician's marking on the recorded ultrasound image and the&#xD;
      pathology results will be displayed in color on the 3D model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. METHODS AND PROCEDURES 5.1 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The trans-rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy procedure will be conducted with no&#xD;
           change what so ever from the currently conducted procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The exceptions to the normal procedure is the addition of the flat transmitter under&#xD;
           the patients mattress, the 2 external attached sensors and the recording of the&#xD;
           procedure via the video-out put of the ultrasound using the Navigo™ system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The 3D model will be compared with the recorded ultrasound images by the physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recorded data will be processed off-line (post biopsy /off-line analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis of the results will be completed in post procedure by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Trial Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A short one-time calibration of the Navigo™ system with the ultrasound system will be&#xD;
           completed by a trained technician (UC-CARE's technician)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The transmitter will be placed beneath the patient's mattress and the body sensor will&#xD;
           be attached to the patients' back using a regular disposable medical sticker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trans-rectal ultrasound probe will be held by the physician and controlled&#xD;
           throughout the procedure according to the existing current biopsy protocol, without any&#xD;
           alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The common ultrasound video output will be connected to the video input of the Navigo™&#xD;
           system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's identifications will be filled to allow proper post examination analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the initial scan of the prostate and the volume measurements the Navigo™&#xD;
           system will record the data and store it for post analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the 3D biopsy screen a 3D model of the prostate will be displayed with record of all&#xD;
           needle biopsy locations as recorded during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pathology results can be loaded to the Navigo™ system and displayed on the 3D model&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. SUBJECT POPULATION SELECTION 6.1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Eligibility -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned for trans-rectal prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's unwilling to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metal prosthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS No immediate benefits are expected to be gained by the&#xD;
           subjects participating in the study as the 3D modeling and the display is completed post&#xD;
           procedure. The procedure will be carried out exactly as it would have been without the&#xD;
           Navigo™ system participating in the biopsy procedure. The post procedure 3D model&#xD;
           display with the biopsy specimen's location may enable better data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. POTENTIAL RISKS TO SUBJECTS The Navigo™ system is a passive system that does not&#xD;
           require any change in the procedure performed today. The various components do not come&#xD;
           in direct contact with the patient or the physician and the computer and 3D tracking&#xD;
           system are well within the required safety protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo system has been approved by the CE. The 3D tracking system is approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for medical use and is classified as Type CF which is the most stringent classification,&#xD;
      being required for those applications where the applied part is in direct conductive contact&#xD;
      with the heart or other applications as considered necessary. The 3D tracking system is also&#xD;
      part of an approved Helsinki trial in Bnei-zion hospital (monitoring of the birth progress,&#xD;
      trial initiated by Dr. Yoav Paltieli) Adverse effects are not expected according to the&#xD;
      accumulated experience with the 3D tracking system. Similarly, the Navigo™ system is not&#xD;
      expected to add to the procedure any pain or discomfort to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. SUBJECT RECUITMENT Study population will be recruited from the pool of patients who are&#xD;
      scheduled for trans-rectal biopsy procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will include the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Post procedure display of the prostate's 3D model and the location of the various biopsy&#xD;
      specimens taken during the procedure in the prostatic volume&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Comparison of the results with the physician analysis of the specimens location as derived&#xD;
      from the images themselves&#xD;
