      Part I: Survey of Coronary Artery Calcification and Stenosis in Participants with Different&#xD;
      Glycaemic Status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis in community-dwelling adults with&#xD;
      different glycaemic status, using dual-source CT angiography (CTA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 adults with normal glucose regulation (NGR), 200 with impaired glucose regulation (IGR)&#xD;
      and 200 with type 2 diabetes were recruited from an urban community of Shanghai, who then&#xD;
      underwent a comprehensive examination including questionnaire, anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      biochemical analysis and CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Follow-up of Cardiovascular Events and Re-evaluation of Coronary Artery&#xD;
      Calcification and Stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the development of cardiovascular diseases in subjects recruited in part I and&#xD;
      re-evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis using CTA after 3-year follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the predictive value of coronary artery calcification and stenosis with future&#xD;
      risks of cardiovascular diseases and the possible development of coronary artery disorders&#xD;
      among participants with different glycaemic status&#xD;
