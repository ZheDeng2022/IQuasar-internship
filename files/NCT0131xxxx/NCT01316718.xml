    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to define the clinical benefit and possible mediators of the&#xD;
      benefit of mesalazine in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore evaluate symptoms (primarily bowel frequency) and markers&#xD;
      reflecting mast cell activation and small bowel tone.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or Female patients aged 18-75 years old able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients should all have had a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy within the last 12&#xD;
             months to exclude microscopic colitis. (If not, but they have had a negative&#xD;
             colonoscopy within 5 years and symptoms are unchanged, then a sigmoidoscopy and&#xD;
             mucosal biopsy of the left colon would be sufficient to exclude microscopic colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. IBS-D Patients meeting Rome III criteria prior to screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with ≥ 25% soft (score &gt; 4) and &lt; 25% hard (score 1 or 2) stools during the&#xD;
             screening phase, as scored by the daily symptom and stool diary*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a stool frequency of 3 or more per day for 2 or more days per week&#xD;
             during the screening phase*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Satisfactory completion of the daily stool and symptom diary during the screening&#xD;
             phase at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child bearing potential willing or able to use at least one highly effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method throughout the study. In the context of this study, an effective&#xD;
             method is defined as those which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) when used consistently and correctly such as: implants, injectables, combined&#xD;
             oral contraceptives, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If inclusion criterion 4 and/or 5 is/are not met but the results are considered&#xD;
                  atypical (as observed from medical history and patient recall) then the patient&#xD;
                  can be re-screen on 1 occasion only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior abdominal surgery which may cause bowel symptoms similar to IBS (note&#xD;
             appendectomy and cholecystectomy will not be an exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients unable to stop anti-muscarinics, anti-spasmodics, high dose tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants (i.e. above 50 mg/day), opiates/anti-diarrhoeal drugs*, NSAIDs&#xD;
             (occasional over the counter use and topical formulations are allowed), long-term&#xD;
             antibiotics, other anti-inflammatory drugs or 5-ASA containing drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and low dose tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants (i.e. up to 50 mg/day) for at least 3 months previous unwilling to&#xD;
             remain on a stable dose for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with other gastro-intestinal diseases including colitis and Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with the following conditions: Renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment or&#xD;
             salicylate hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients currently participating in another trial or have been in a trial within the&#xD;
             previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are considered unsuitable due to&#xD;
             inability to comply with instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with serious concomitant diseases e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
             neurological etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Loperamide is allowed as rescue medication through-out the trial, however if &gt; 2&#xD;
                  doses / week are taken during the screening phase then they are not eligible,&#xD;
                  though they can be re-screened on 1 occasion only.&#xD;
