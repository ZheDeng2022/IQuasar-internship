      This is a phase-I clinical trial to determine the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion and an immunomodulatory combination of&#xD;
      Interferon-alpha (INF-a), Bevacizumab and Aspirin, followed by adoptive transfer of&#xD;
      vaccine-primed, ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated peripheral blood autologous T-cells, and&#xD;
      vaccination with whole tumor vaccine, administered intradermally in combination with&#xD;
      Bevacizumab in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer who previously underwent induction vaccination with whole tumor vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive T-lymphocytes infusion at a dose of 20 billion ± 20% cells for all&#xD;
      patients. Subjects who cant meet target dose level can still enroll but will be analyzed&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before T-cell infusion, all subjects will undergo lymphodepletion with a single course of&#xD;
      outpatient high-dose lymphodepleting chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide (300&#xD;
      mg/m2/d for 3 consecutive Days) and intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      Days on Days -5 to -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will receive an immunomodulatory cycle of (Bevacizumab and&#xD;
      Aspirin) ~14 Days before apheresis (if they do not have a frozen apheresis product from a&#xD;
      previous collection) and another cycle between apheresis and T-cell infusion (approx. from&#xD;
      Day -20 through Day -7, (+/- 5 Days)). The immunomodulatory cycle will consist of the&#xD;
      following: intravenous 10 mg/kg Bevacizumab on Day -35, and Day -20 (+/- 5 Days), and 325 mg&#xD;
      Enteric Coated Aspirin orally starting Day -35 for 14 Days and starting on Day -20 for 14&#xD;
      Days. They will also receive three subcutaneous injections of Interferon-alpha (Intron®a 2b)&#xD;
      (INF-a) (subjects will have the option to self administer Interferon-alpha and they will be&#xD;
      provided instructions) at a dose of 5 MIU on Days -3, -2 and -1. EX vivo&#xD;
      CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~1-2 Days after last Day of&#xD;
      interferon-alpha treatment, ideally on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a dose of 5-10 million cells of OC-DC vaccine intradermally, or&#xD;
      OC-L (2.5-5x106 oxidized tumor cells admixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG) 2-3 Days post T-cell&#xD;
      infusion and on Day 16-18. Subjects will start receiving Bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg and vaccine&#xD;
      (if available) starting Day 30 and every 3 weeks thereafter until end of study. (Funding&#xD;
