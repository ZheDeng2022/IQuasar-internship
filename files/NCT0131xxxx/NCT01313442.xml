      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gastrointestinal cancers can occur in the throat, stomach, gallbladder, liver, pancreas,&#xD;
      and colon. Researchers are interested in evaluating how active the immune system is in trying&#xD;
      to fight the cancer by studying blood and tumor tissue donated from individuals who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood and tumor samples from individuals who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers in order to study the immune system s response to the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with throat, stomach,&#xD;
      gallbladder, liver, pancreatic, or colon cancer, and are scheduled to be treated at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require at least one but no more than four visits to the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will&#xD;
           provide a baseline blood sample for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide additional blood samples 2 and 4 months after the baseline&#xD;
           sample, as well as a final sample at the completion of the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide tumor tissue samples only if they undergo a surgical procedure&#xD;
           related to the treatment for their gastrointestinal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerous recent therapeutic advances have changed standard treatment options for&#xD;
           patients with GI cancer. These include newer chemotherapeutic agents in addition to&#xD;
           established proof of principle for anti-angiogenic agents. The burden of GI cancers is&#xD;
           reflected by the presence of three GI cancer types in the top five causes of cancer&#xD;
           mortality. Over 58,000 deaths yearly can be attributed to GI cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While immune-based therapies in GI cancers are experimental at the current time, a&#xD;
           gathering body of literature is suggestive of an enormous potential, either alone, or&#xD;
           most likely in combination with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before immunotherapy can be combined with non-immune based treatment options we first&#xD;
           need to investigate the effects of non-immune based therapies on immune responses&#xD;
           (especially immune-evasive mechanisms) with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commensal gut microbiota play an important role in colonic inflammation and colon&#xD;
           cancer. The human gut flora consists of approximately 100 trillion microbial cells,&#xD;
           which their disruption leads to many types of diseases including inflammatory bowel&#xD;
           disease and colorectal cancer. Recent studies have shown that colon cancer patients as&#xD;
           well other patients with gastrointestinal cancers have an altered gut flora when&#xD;
           compared to healthy controls. As an example, intestinal microbiome has been shown to&#xD;
           contribute to the start and progression of certain kinds of liver diseases such as NAFLD&#xD;
           as well as end-stage liver diseases 2-4 Therefore, it is important to investigate&#xD;
           further as to how the gut affects the patient s response to chemotherapy, other types of&#xD;
           cancer therapy and to tumor growth in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To serve as an umbrella protocol to allow collection, storage and investigation of samples&#xD;
      from patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in support of Thoracic and GI Oncology&#xD;
      Branch translational trials to develop new therapeutic agents and novel treatment approaches&#xD;
      as well as new prognostic and diagnostic models. Also, to collect samples from patients with&#xD;
      non-GI cancers for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing evaluation for participation in NCI treatment protocols in the NCI&#xD;
           intramural program with diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 year of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, tumor tissue or stool samples may be collected from consenting subjects at the&#xD;
           initial visit and/or at the time of visit to NIH, scheduled per other NIH protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of subject s samples include but not limited to immune-monitoring, single cell&#xD;
           sequencing, identifying of gene expression and generation of CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool samples will be used to determine the intestinal microbiome.&#xD;
