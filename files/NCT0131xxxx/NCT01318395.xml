  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects approximately one fourth of the world population and therefore&#xD;
      contributes substantially to the worldwide burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease and&#xD;
      end-organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in small artery structure characterized by an increased wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) are&#xD;
      characteristic feature of target organ damage in hypertension. Of clinical importance,&#xD;
      structural arteries of small subcutaneous arteries have been shown to be of prognostic&#xD;
      significance, with adverse prognosis in subjects with higher WLR. However, the assessment of&#xD;
      arteriolar structure from biopsies of subcutaneous tissue is invasive and impractical in&#xD;
      clinical practice. A new approach focuses on retinal arteriolar structural parameters by&#xD;
      using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) with automatic full-field perfusion imaging&#xD;
      analyses (9). This approach allows the non-invasive assessment of both the outer diameter&#xD;
      (OD) and inner diameter (ID) of retinal arterioles in vivo and, thus, analyses vascular&#xD;
      remodeling of retinal arterioles by calculating WLR = (OD - ID) / ID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial role in the efforts of prevention of end-organ damage plays the renin angiotensin&#xD;
      system (RAS). The increased mechanical strain on the vasculature at a higher BP can cause&#xD;
      injury to the endothelial wall. Activation of the RAS increases BP and stimulates a local&#xD;
      inflammatory response to repair the injury. Long-term or repeated response to injury leads to&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and microvascular damage, and hence end-organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining RAS inhibitors may provide greater end-organ protection than use of either class&#xD;
      alone. However, ONTARGET has failed to show superiority of the dual RAS blockade (ACE-I and&#xD;
      ARB) in patients at high cardiovascular risk. The combination of ARBs and direct renin&#xD;
      inhibitors (DRIs) emerged as the only available, valid and innovative option for blocking the&#xD;
      RAS at two different sites (sequential blockade). Indeed, AVOID study and ALLAY study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the DRI aliskiren has additional and to some extent blood pressure&#xD;
      independent effects on albuminuria and left ventricular hypertrophy, both signs of&#xD;
      subclinical organ damage in hypertension, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no data are available with respect to the effects of ARBs and DRIs on vascular&#xD;
      properties in the short and long term To close this gab we focus in this study on vascular&#xD;
      structural and functional changes since vascular adaptation to high blood pressure occurs in&#xD;
      the early phase of hypertensive disease.&#xD;

      Hypertension affects approximately one fourth of the world population and therefore&#xD;
      contributes substantially to the worldwide burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease and&#xD;
      end-organ damage (1). Therefore, the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to provide effective&#xD;
      long-term lowering of elevated blood pressure (BP) and prevention of hypertensive&#xD;
      end-organ-damage and mortality (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in small artery structure characterized by an increased wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) are&#xD;
      characteristic feature of target organ damage in hypertension. (3; 4). A clinical study&#xD;
      examining small arteries obtained from gluteal biopsies of patients with hypertension&#xD;
      revealed that an increased WLR of subcutaneous small arteries is one of the first&#xD;
      manifestations of target organ damage in hypertension that occur before proteinuria and&#xD;
      cardiac hypertrophy (5). Of clinical importance, structural arteries of small subcutaneous&#xD;
      arteries have been shown to be of prognostic significance, with adverse prognosis in subjects&#xD;
      with higher WLR (6-8). However, the assessment of arteriolar structure from biopsies of&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue is invasive and impractical in clinical practice. A new approach focuses&#xD;
      on retinal arteriolar structural parameters by using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF)&#xD;
      with automatic full-field perfusion imaging analyses (9). This approach allows the&#xD;
      non-invasive assessment of both the outer diameter and inner diameter of retinal arterioles&#xD;
      in vivo and, thus, analyses vascular remodeling of retinal arterioles by calculating WLR =&#xD;
      (outer diameter - inner diameter) / inner diameter) (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, we could demonstrate that treated hypertensive patients with poor BP&#xD;
      control have a greater WLR of retinal arterioles than those with good blood pressure control.&#xD;
      Interestingly, in this cohort we did not find a significant relation between BP and WLR of&#xD;
      retinal arterioles using correlation analyses. We have concluded that this lack of a relation&#xD;
      might well be the result of the effects of some antihypertensive drugs to beneficially&#xD;
      influence vascular structure (9). Subsequently, we analyzed WLR of retinal arterioles in a&#xD;
      cohort of never-treated patients with essential hypertension and normotensive controls. In&#xD;
      this cohort, both systolic BP and diastolic BP were significantly related to WLR of retinal&#xD;
      arterioles independent of traditional CV risk factors and other confounders, e.g. subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and dietary salt intake. Moreover, in this cohort, the&#xD;
      WLR of retinal arterioles was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial role in the efforts of prevention of end-organ damage plays the renin angiotensin&#xD;
      system (RAS) due its dual role on salt and water homeostasis (blood pressure) and the&#xD;
      vascular response to injury. The increased mechanical strain on the vasculature at a higher&#xD;
      BP can cause injury to the endothelial wall. Activation of the RAS increases BP and&#xD;
      stimulates a local inflammatory response to repair the injury. Long-term or repeated response&#xD;
      to injury leads to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular damage (12), and hence end-organ&#xD;
      damage. Therefore increasing evidence is not suppressing, that antihypertensive medications&#xD;
      which inhibit the RAS may provide incremental end-organ protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we have shown that hypertensive patients have an impaired vasodilatory response of&#xD;
      retinal arterioles to Flickerlight test - which improves after treatment with Angiotensin&#xD;
      Receptor Blockers (ARBs) - and have a reduced nitric oxide (NO) activity in the retinal&#xD;
      circulation, that is normalized after treatment with ARBs (13; 14). Likewise, in a previous&#xD;
      study analyzing the arterial resistance vessels also in the systemic circulation we found&#xD;
      that in contrast to diuretics and placebo, valsartan improved endothelial function and&#xD;
      vascular properties (estimated by pulse wave anlalysis) (15; 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining RAS inhibitors may provide greater end-organ protection than use of either class&#xD;
      alone. However, the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global&#xD;
      Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) has failed to show superiority of the dual RAS blockade&#xD;
      (Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and ARB) in patients at high cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      (17). The combination of ARBs and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) emerged as the only&#xD;
      available, valid and innovative option for blocking the RAS at two different sites&#xD;
      (sequential blockade). Indeed, the Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes&#xD;
      (AVOID) study (18) and the Aliskiren in Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (ALLAY) study (19)&#xD;
      demonstrated that the DRI aliskiren has additional and to some extent blood pressure&#xD;
      independent effects on albuminuria and left ventricular hypertrophy, both signs of&#xD;
      subclinical organ damage in hypertension, respectively (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no data are available with respect to the effects of ARBs and DRIs on vascular&#xD;
      properties in the short and long term To close this gab we focus in this study on vascular&#xD;
      structural and functional changes since vascular adaptation to high blood pressure occurs in&#xD;
      the early phase of hypertensive disease.&#xD;
