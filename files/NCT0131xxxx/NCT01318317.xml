      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically engineered&#xD;
      lymphocyte therapy and to see how well it works after peripheral blood stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (PBSCT) in treating patients with high-risk, intermediate-grade, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL). Genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy may stimulate the immune system in different&#xD;
      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving rituximab together with chemotherapy before a&#xD;
      PBSCT stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF), or plerixafor helps stem cells move&#xD;
      from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation therapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem&#xD;
      cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed&#xD;
      by the chemotherapy. Giving genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy after PBSCT may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for NHL&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded autologous central memory T cell (TCM)-enriched cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T&#xD;
      cells genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in&#xD;
      conjunction with a standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (aHSCT) for research participants with high-risk intermediate grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphomas who have relapsed after primary therapy, or who did not achieve complete remission&#xD;
      with primary therapy. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to&#xD;
      describe the full toxicity profile. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of research participants receiving TCM-enriched CD8+ T cells&#xD;
      genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific CAR for which the transferred cells are&#xD;
      detected in the circulation 28 days (+/- 3 days) by woodchuck hepatitis virus&#xD;
      post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) quantitative (Q)-polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tempo, magnitude, and duration of engraftment of&#xD;
      the transferred T cell product as it relates to the number of cells infused. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the impact of this therapeutic intervention on the development of CD19+ B-cell&#xD;
      precursors in the bone marrow as a surrogate for the in vivo effector function of transferred&#xD;
      CD19-specific T cells. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the progression-free and overall survival of treated research participants&#xD;
      on this protocol. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of genetically engineered lymphocyte&#xD;
      therapy followed by a phase II study. Patients receive standard salvage chemotherapy per&#xD;
      standard practice and undergo standard mobilization for stem cell collection with filgrastim&#xD;
      and/or plerixafor. Some patients may also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) within 4 weeks&#xD;
      of transplant. Patients receive standard myeloablative conditioning followed by autologous&#xD;
      PBSCT. Patients then undergo infusion of ex vivo expanded autologous TCM-enriched CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells expressing CD19-specific CAR on day 2 or 3 after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for at least 15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
