  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with myeloma that has either not responded to previous treatment or has returned&#xD;
      after previous treatment will be given a combination of the drugs bendamustine and&#xD;
      bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bortezomib and bendamustine will be given using an intravenous line (IV) on days 1 and 4&#xD;
      of each cycle, with bortezomib being given first, before each dose of bendamustine. Each&#xD;
      cycle will be 28 days long, so patients will be treated the first week of each cycle and then&#xD;
      have 3 weeks 'off' (without any treatment). Disease assessments will be performed on day 22&#xD;
      of each cycle. Patients will receive the study drugs until their disease progresses or they&#xD;
      are withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies, bendamustine seems to work well with other drugs. Thus, this study hopes to&#xD;
      show that the combination of bortezomib and bendamustine will have activity in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma who have a measurable paraprotein in the serum&#xD;
      or urine or measurable protein by Freelite or measurable disease by plasmacytoma will be&#xD;
      given a combination of bendamustine and bortezomib each cycle. Response rate (PR or better&#xD;
      after 2 cycles) and duration of response will be assessed. Therapy will be continued until&#xD;
      disease progression. The bendamustine would be used in a day 1, day 4 dosing schedule after&#xD;
      each dose of bortezomib to take advantage of the chemosensitizing properties of bortezomib.&#xD;
      This minimizes the days of treatment to just the first week and allows rebound of blood&#xD;
      counts. This will be a phase II trial with dose reduction as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bendamustine is a drug which appears to be non-cross-resistant with other alkylating agents&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of bortezomib and&#xD;
      bendamustine will have activity in relapsed/refractory myeloma.&#xD;
