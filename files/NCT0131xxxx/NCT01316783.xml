      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - African Americans have one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the United States,&#xD;
      and often have other medical problems related to obesity and cardiovascular disease. These&#xD;
      conditions have various risk factors, including high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol&#xD;
      levels, and insulin resistance. However, these risk factors have not been studied very&#xD;
      closely in individuals with African ancestry, including Afro-Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      migrant populations. Researchers are interested in conducting a genetic study on obesity,&#xD;
      adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, and other common health conditions in individuals with&#xD;
      African ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect genetic and non-genetic information from individuals with African ancestry to&#xD;
      study common health conditions related to obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who self-identify as African American, Afro-Caribbean,&#xD;
      or migrants from sub Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo a physical examination and will provide a blood sample for&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also answer questions about personal and family medical history and&#xD;
           current lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This research protocol is designed to study the genetic basis of the clustering of several&#xD;
      metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      (CVD), obesity, and other related conditions in populations of the African Diaspora. This&#xD;
      project takes advantage of the well-established infrastructure and success of Dr. Anne Sumner&#xD;
      s NIDDK clinical protocols. The project will aim to enroll subjects from her cohorts which&#xD;
      include whites, African Americans and Africans living in the United States with the goal of&#xD;
      performing quantitative trait analysis using a candidate gene approach to understand the&#xD;
      genetic basis of serum lipid levels, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and other metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. For aim 2, we propose to perform whole exome sequencing in a subset of cases&#xD;
      (n=48, 96 chromosomes, African ancestry) to identify both rare and common variants for&#xD;
      multiple metabolic parameters. Variants identified by the exome sequencing effort and by a&#xD;
      current sequencing project of six candidate lipid genes will be genotyped in the entire&#xD;
      cohort. Overall, these studies will further efforts to understand if black-white differences&#xD;
      as well as differences within black populations exist in the genetic basis of T2D, CVD, and&#xD;
      obesity. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will form the basis&#xD;
      of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural researchers, and&#xD;
      non-NIH scientists.&#xD;

        The estimated number of participants is 1000. Based on Dr. Sumner's previous work with&#xD;
        these cohorts, we expect 25% of the African Ancestry populations to have abnormal glucose&#xD;
        tolerance or diabetes, 50 percent to be obese, and 20% to be hypertensive. For whites the %&#xD;
        frequency will be lower. The power analysis is based on black populations, the focus of the&#xD;
        study. The enrollment ceiling is 1000 and the anticipated enrollment by year is 100&#xD;
        individuals.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will include unrelated persons who self-identify as white or African American,&#xD;
        Afro-Caribbean or migrant from sub-Saharan Africa. Adults of African ancestry are&#xD;
        prioritized for this study because of the paucity of genetics studies investigating the&#xD;
        association of risk alleles contributing to the prevalence of T2D, CVD, obesity and other&#xD;
        common conditions in this population. A small proportion of whites (less than 10%) will be&#xD;
        included in this study, as they are in Dr. Sumner s ongoing projects; they will have the&#xD;
        same clinical measurements obtained in the same laboratory to serve as a comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members are excluded to avoid biases in our analyses due to&#xD;
&#xD;
        genomic similarities between family members. Children are excluded as these phenotypes&#xD;
        present more commonly in adults. Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of men and&#xD;
        women. No prisoners, pregnant women or fetuses will be included in this study.&#xD;
