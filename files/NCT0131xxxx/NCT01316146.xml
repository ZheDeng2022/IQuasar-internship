  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused by&#xD;
      germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which stops them&#xD;
      from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that&#xD;
      are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
      Investigators hope that both will work better together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells&#xD;
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. Investigators now want to see if&#xD;
      they can attach a gene to T cells that will help them do a better job at recognizing and&#xD;
      killing lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new gene that investigators will put in T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This&#xD;
      antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called&#xD;
      CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been&#xD;
      strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in&#xD;
      the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this&#xD;
      way, it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells seem to&#xD;
      kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the&#xD;
      cancer are unknown.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When the patient enrolls on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD30 chimeric&#xD;
      receptor-activated T cells. The dose level of cells that they will receive will not be based&#xD;
      on a medical determination of what is best for the patient, instead the dose is based on the&#xD;
      order in which the patient enrolled on the study relative to other participants. Subjects&#xD;
      enrolled earlier in the study will receive a lower dose of cells than those enrolled later in&#xD;
      the study. The risks of harm and discomfort from the study treatment may bear some&#xD;
      relationship to the dose level. The potential for direct benefit, if any, may also vary with&#xD;
      the dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells into the&#xD;
      vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take 1-10 minutes.&#xD;
      Investigators will follow the subject in the clinic after the injection for up to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells are working and how&#xD;
      long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the&#xD;
      size of the lymphoma on imaging studies after the T-cell infusion, s/he can receive up to six&#xD;
      additional doses of the T cells at 8 to 12 weeks intervals if s/he wishes. After each T-cell&#xD;
      infusion, s/he will be monitored as described above.&#xD;
