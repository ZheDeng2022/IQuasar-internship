      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if intensive chemotherapy (hyper-CVAD&#xD;
      therapy) given in combination with liposomal vincristine (Marqibo), in addition to rituximab&#xD;
      for patients who are CD20 positive and/or imatinib, dasatinib, or ruxolitinib for patients&#xD;
      with the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, can help to control ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. The&#xD;
      safety of this treatment will also be studied. CD20 is a protein &quot;marker&quot; that is found in&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Liposomal vincristine is FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with CLL who have relapsed at least 2 times. All of the other study drugs used in&#xD;
      this study are FDA approved and commercially available. The combination of liposomal&#xD;
      vincristine with the other study drugs is also being used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 65 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adriamycin (doxorubicin) is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is designed to disrupt with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may&#xD;
      slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytarabine (Ara-C) is designed to insert itself into DNA (the genetic material of cells) of&#xD;
      cancer cells and stop the DNA from repairing itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate is designed to disrupt cells from making and repairing DNA and &quot;copying&quot;&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vincristine is designed to disrupt the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop&#xD;
      their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal Vincristine (Marqibo) is designed to help vincristine stay in the bloodstream for a&#xD;
      longer time, more specifically target tumor tissue, and deliver more of the drug to a tumor&#xD;
      site over a longer period of time. This may increase how effective the drug is and lower the&#xD;
      risk of possible side effects in healthy, non-tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to attach to leukemia cells and activate&#xD;
      a series of events that may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI--Imatinib, Dasatinib, or Ruxolitinib) Imatinib is a drug&#xD;
      designed to block cancer cells from growing and dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib and ruxolitinib are designed to block a protein that cancer may need to grow,&#xD;
      survive, or spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups, based on your already performed diagnostic test for a certain protein, called CD20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you test positive for CD20, you will receive hyper-CVAD therapy plus rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you test negative for CD20, you will receive hyper-CVAD therapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients with the Philadelphia chromosome (considered Philadelphia-positive or&#xD;
      Ph+) will receive imatinib or dasatinib in either group. Patients with Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome-like disease will receive dasatinib or ruxolitinib. The study doctor will decide&#xD;
      which drug these participants will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper-CVAD therapy is a combination of 7 chemotherapy drugs: the combination of adriamycin&#xD;
      (doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide, and liposomal vincristine, alternating with the combination&#xD;
      of cytarabine (Ara-C), dexamethasone, methotrexate, and liposomal vincristine. You will&#xD;
      receive the 2 different study drug combinations over 21-28 day &quot;courses.&quot; You will begin with&#xD;
      Course A treatment and alternate with the Course B treatment every other course. You will&#xD;
      stay overnight in the hospital for the first 4-5 days of each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Course A of treatment, you will receive cyclophosphamide, liposomal vincristine,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Course B of treatment, you will receive methotrexate, cytarabine, and liposomal&#xD;
      vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses of treatment on this study will continue to alternate or switch between the Course A&#xD;
      study drug combination for all odd number courses (3, 5, and 7) and the Course B study drug&#xD;
      combination for all even number courses (4, 6, and 8) for a total of up to 8 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are on study, all doses of study drug combinations will be given through a central&#xD;
      venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein&#xD;
      while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more&#xD;
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 2, and 3 you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 24 hours, mesna by&#xD;
      vein continuously over 24 hours, and liposomal vincristine by vein over 1 hour +/- 30 minutes&#xD;
      (Day 1 only). Mesna is given to help prevent blood in the urine, which is sometimes caused by&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2 and 7, methotrexate then cytarabine will be given by intrathecal (IT) infusion&#xD;
      directly into your spinal fluid to lower the risk of the disease spreading to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 4, you will receive doxorubicin by vein over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5 or 6, G-CSF will be injected under the skin to help with the recovery of bone marrow&#xD;
      cells recovery 24 hours after the dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8, you will receive liposomal vincristine by vein over 1 hour +/- 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-4 and Days 11-14, dexamethasone will be given by mouth with a glass of water or by&#xD;
      vein as a short infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD20 positive patients only will also receive rituximab by vein over 6 hours, on Days 1 and&#xD;
      8, in addition to receiving all study drugs, as described above. If you are CD20 negative,&#xD;
      you will not receive rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ph+ participants will receive imatinib by mouth with breakfast and a large glass of water&#xD;
      (about 8 ounces) or dasatinib by mouth on Days 1-14 during Course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-like disease will receive dasatinib 1 time each day or&#xD;
      ruxolitinib 2 times each day on Days 1-14 during Course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, you will receive methotrexate by vein over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2 and 3, you will receive cytarabine by vein over 2 hours every 12 hours for a total&#xD;
      of 4 doses. You will also be given citrovorum factor (leucovorin) by vein or by mouth to help&#xD;
      prevent the possible side effects of methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5 or 6, G-CSF will be injected under the skin to help with bone marrow recovery 24&#xD;
      hours after the dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 5 and 8, cytarabine then methotrexate will be given by IT infusion to lower the risk&#xD;
      of the disease spreading to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD20 positive patients only will also receive rituximab by vein over 4 hours, on Days 1 and&#xD;
      8, in addition to receiving all study drugs, as described above. If you are CD20 negative,&#xD;
      you will not receive rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ph+ participants will receive imatinib by mouth with breakfast and a large glass of water&#xD;
      (about 8 ounces) every day during Courses 2-8. Dasatinib will be given by mouth every day&#xD;
      during Courses 2-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-like disease will receive dasatinib 1 time each day or&#xD;
      ruxolitinib 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course 1 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons each time) will be drawn weekly for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Week 2 and 3 or 4, a bone marrow aspirate will be performed to check the status&#xD;
           of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of Course 1, if the study doctor thinks it is needed, a chest X-ray or CT&#xD;
           scan will be performed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, any of these tests may be repeated at any time while&#xD;
      you are receiving the study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have lymphoblastic lymphoma and you have enlarged lymph glands in the chest, you may&#xD;
      receive radiation treatment to the chest after completing 8 courses of therapy and before you&#xD;
      begin maintenance therapy. If you are to receive radiation therapy to the chest, the study&#xD;
      doctor will discuss this procedure and its known risks with you in more detail, and you will&#xD;
      be given a separate consent form to sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy -- Non-Ph+ Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 8 courses of the study drug combinations, you will begin maintenance therapy&#xD;
      for a total of 30 months, and will be interrupted by 2 periods of intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
      consolidation courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month during maintenance therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take 6-mercaptopurine every day by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive methotrexate by vein or mouth 1 time every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive liposomal vincristine by vein over 1 hour +/- 30 minutes on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1-5 each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First intensive chemotherapy consolidation courses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six (6) months after you begin maintenance therapy, you will receive two months of&#xD;
           intensive chemotherapy courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, you will receive cyclophosphamide, liposomal vincristine, doxorubicin, and&#xD;
           dexamethasone (similar to Course 1) for Month 6 of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About one (1) month later, you will receive methotrexate by vein (at a lower dose than&#xD;
           given during Course 2) on Day 1 and pegylated asparaginase by vein over about 2 hours on&#xD;
           Day 2. You will be given each drug 1 time each week for a total of 4 weeks for Month 7&#xD;
           of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About eighteen (18) months after you begin maintenance therapy, you will repeat the intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy courses just described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy -- Ph+ Participants and Participants with Ph-like Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 8 courses of the study drug combinations, you will begin maintenance&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus TKI (imatinib or dasatinib if you have Ph+ disease; or dasatinib or&#xD;
      ruxolitinib if you have Ph-like disease). Maintenance chemotherapy will be given for a total&#xD;
      of 24 months, and will be interrupted by 2 periods of intensive chemotherapy courses and the&#xD;
      TKI at 6 and 13 months from the start of maintenance. You will continue receiving the TKI&#xD;
      every day from that point on, unless intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month during maintenance therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take imatinib, dasatinib, or ruxolitinib every day by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive liposomal vincristine by vein over 1 hour +/- 30 minutes on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1-5 each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive chemotherapy consolidation courses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      °At six (6) and eighteen (18) months after you begin maintenance therapy, you will receive&#xD;
      two months of intensive chemotherapy courses. You will receive cyclophosphamide, liposomal&#xD;
      vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with the TKI (similar to Course 1). If the&#xD;
      disease is CD20 positive, you may receive rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance therapy and the intensive consolidation therapy, you will have blood&#xD;
      (about 5 teaspoons) drawn every 4 weeks +/- 4 weeks for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intensive chemotherapy consolidation, for as long as you continue to receive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy, blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn every 4 weeks +/- 4 weeks, until&#xD;
      maintenance therapy is completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests while on Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3-6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy performed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have mediastinal disease, you will have a chest x-ray or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive up to 8 courses of therapy. If you are not Ph+, you will continue to receive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy for up to 30 months. If you are Ph+, you will continue to receive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy for up to 24 months, followed by imatinib or dasatinib alone&#xD;
      indefinitely. You will be taken off the study if disease gets worse, you experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, or the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are 60 years or older, you will receive Course 1 chemotherapy in a protective&#xD;
      isolation room to decrease the risk of any infection(s) that you may be exposed to while&#xD;
      receiving the Course 1 treatment.&#xD;
