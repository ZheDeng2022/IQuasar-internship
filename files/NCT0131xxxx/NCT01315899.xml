  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a disorder of the digital blood vessels resulting in episodic&#xD;
      impairment of blood flow. During an attack of RP which commonly affects the hands and feet&#xD;
      these arteries contract briefly which limits the blood flow (this is called a vasospasm) and&#xD;
      deprived of blood the skin turns white then blue. The aim of this study is to prove the&#xD;
      concept that ORM-12741 can prevent these blood vessel spasms.&#xD;

             to systemic sclerosis. Active RP will be defined as a history of cold sensitivity&#xD;
             associated with colour changes of cyanosis or pallor, as well as of at least 6 attacks&#xD;
             weekly during the winter months. Diagnosis of systemic sclerosis will be defined by&#xD;

             RP symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for the relief of RP symptoms that in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator cannot be stopped from the screening visit until end&#xD;
             of the last experimental session&#xD;
