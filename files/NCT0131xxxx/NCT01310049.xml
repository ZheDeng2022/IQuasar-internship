      The purpose of this first-in-man trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ascending single and multiple doses of LEO 32731 in healthy male subjects. The trial will be&#xD;
      performed in three parts. In Part 1, single doses of LEO 32731 will be administered to&#xD;
      healthy male subjects. In Part 2, the effect of food on the single oral dose pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      will be investigated. In Part 3, multiple doses of LEO 32731 will be administered to healthy&#xD;
      male subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects will, prior to any study related activities, have given their written&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects will be Caucasian males between 18 and 55 years of age and with a body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations&#xD;
             (congenital non haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is NOT acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are not, or whose partners are not willing to use appropriate&#xD;
             contraception (such as condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from&#xD;
             the time of the first dose until 3 months after the final dosing occasion. Male&#xD;
             subjects whose partners are of child-bearing potential must also agree to use an&#xD;
             additional highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14&#xD;
             days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the&#xD;
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including&#xD;
             herbal remedies) within 7 days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort, known to&#xD;
             chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days of the first&#xD;
             dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending follow-up&#xD;

             months prior to the first dosing occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have donated any blood, plasma or platelets in 3 months prior to&#xD;

             hayfever) as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have a supine blood pressure and supine pulse rate at screening higher&#xD;
             than 140/90 mmHg and 100 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, or lower than 90/50&#xD;
             mmHg and 50 bpm, respectively&#xD;

             history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse as determined by the Investigator (one&#xD;
             unit of alcohol equals Â½ pint [285 mL] of beer or lager, one glass [125 mL] of wine,&#xD;
             or 1/6 gill [25 mL] of spirits).&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the&#xD;

             block, complete right bundle branch block or Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome defined as&#xD;
