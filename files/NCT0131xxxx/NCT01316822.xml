    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced cancer will receive&#xD;
      investigational study drug ARRY-382. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in&#xD;
      order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable&#xD;
      side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study&#xD;
      drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 50 patients from the US will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
             cancer refractory to standard treatment, for which no standard therapy is available or&#xD;
             for which the patient refuses standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease or evaluable, nonmeasurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL, ANC &gt; 1500/uL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and ALT/serum glutamic pyruvic&#xD;
             transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potassium, magnesium and calcium (corrected calcium when serum albumin levels are&#xD;
             abnormal) within the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating a mean QTcF &gt; 450 msec (triplicate assessment) at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit or history/evidence of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina, coronary angioplasty,&#xD;
             or stenting, within the past 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator, within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of concomitant medication that is a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer within 14&#xD;
             days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Class II, III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
             functional classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (if a patient has brain metastases and is&#xD;
             on steroids, the steroid dose must have been stable for at least 30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the Investigator, would preclude adequate absorption (a previous Whipple procedure is&#xD;
             allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria exist.&#xD;
