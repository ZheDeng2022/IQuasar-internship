  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (METH) is a debilitating and frequently abused substance that is often&#xD;
      comorbid with HIV infection. HIV+ persons with current METH abuse or dependence (HIV+/METH+)&#xD;
      have several characteristics, in addition to their substance use, that make them particularly&#xD;
      susceptible to nonadherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) including elevated rates of&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment, co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders, and unstable living&#xD;
      situations. The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address&#xD;
      these potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further&#xD;
      develop and refine a personalized, automated, real-time, mobile phone, text messaging&#xD;
      intervention (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+&#xD;
      persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus&#xD;
      text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the&#xD;
      improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/METH+ persons; and 3) To&#xD;
      examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data&#xD;
      collected over the study. In order to realize these aims, the investigators will leverage the&#xD;
      infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success, impact,&#xD;
      and innovation: 1) the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which is a&#xD;
      NIDA-funded center that focuses on the combined effects of METH and HIV infection, and 2) the&#xD;
      California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), which&#xD;
      conducts research on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially, the&#xD;
      investigators will refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and&#xD;
      tailored to the needs of HIV+/METH+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once&#xD;
      refined, the proposed iTAB intervention will use text messages that are automated, scalable,&#xD;
      personalized, interactive, flexible, and motivating. The investigators will assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and effectiveness of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e.,&#xD;
      MEMS caps) over a 6-week period via a pilot RCT with 40 HIV+/METH+ assigned to the iTAB&#xD;
      intervention and 20 HIV+/METH+ assigned to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of&#xD;
      nonadherence including frequency of METH use, neuropsychological impairment, and mood will be&#xD;
      examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate for these factors associated&#xD;
      with nonadherence as compared to CTRL. Further refinement to the iTAB intervention will be&#xD;
      made in order to pursue a large-scale R01 using our tailored intervention.&#xD;

Behavioral: individualized Texting for Adherence Building (iTAB)&#xD;
Intervention is designed to send automated text messages to HIV+ persons who are current methamphetamine (METH+) users. Text messages are personalized, automated, real-time text messages. The iTAB intervention is designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+ persons above and beyond an active comparator group.</description>

          <description>Participants in the individualized Texting for Adherence Building (iTAB) arm will receive daily text messaging reminders for antiretroviral medication adherence. These text messages will be targeted to the specific schedule and needs of the individual. Participants will also receive a one-time psychoeducational intervention reviewing the importance of adherence to anti-HIV medications.&#xD;
individualized Texting for Adherence Building (iTAB): Intervention is designed to send automated text messages to HIV+ persons who are current methamphetamine (METH+) users. Text messages are personalized, automated, real-time text messages. The iTAB intervention is designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+ persons above and beyond an active comparator group.</description>

          <description>Participants will receive a one-time psychoeducational intervention reviewing the importance of adherence to anti-HIV medications. They will also receive daily text messages to evaluate mood and methamphetamine use, but these messages will not remind participants about medication adherence.&#xD;
