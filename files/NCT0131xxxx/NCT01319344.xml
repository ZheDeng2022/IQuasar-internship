  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) are at increased risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.This increased cardiovascular risk is attributed to metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulations like impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      abdominal obesity and arterial hypertension, which promote oxidative stress and inflammation&#xD;
      with consecutive endothelial dysfunction causing an atherogenic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldosterone promoted end organ damage is mainly found in the cardiovascular system and the&#xD;
      kidney. Inflammation and activation of different factors promotes fibroblast growth and&#xD;
      matrix production resulting in myocardial fibrosis, vascular remodelling and renal fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MetSyn and aldosterone are cardiovascular risk factors and it is of crucial importance to&#xD;
      note that there is a connection between MetSyn and aldosterone. Other cross sectional studies&#xD;
      show a direct correlation of aldosterone levels and impaired glucose metabolism in patients&#xD;
      with and without the MetSyn. Taken together, aldosterone influences essential parameters of&#xD;
      the MetSyn. Coincidentally parameters of the MetSyn are stimulus for an increased aldosterone&#xD;
      synthesis, i.e. visceral adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In large scale clinical trials - RALES, EPHESUS, 4E - inhibition of MR has proven to be&#xD;
      beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure and post myocardial infarction and this&#xD;
      result has been confirmed for diabetic patients, who are known to have an increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only very limited data on the impact of MR inhibition on metabolic, endocrine, and&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters in patients with MetSyn, who have not yet suffered from&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;

      Patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) are at increased risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increased cardiovascular risk is attributed to metabolic dysregulations like impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity and arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, which promote oxidative stress and inflammation and together cause an&#xD;
      atherogenic environment. MetSyn is now a well established cardiovascular risk factor and&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence of MetSyn in the western world are constantly rising with 19.8&#xD;
      percent prevalence in Germany 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldosterone is predominantly synthesized in the adrenal glands. In addition, local&#xD;
      aldosterone synthesis has been found in the heart and vasculature and aldosterone synthesis&#xD;
      in adipocytes is discussed. Aldosterone exerts its effects via the mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      (MR). Besides the well described MR in the distal tubule of the kidney MR have also been&#xD;
      detected in other organs such as the vasculature and a paracrine mode of action is discussed.&#xD;
      Recently it has been described, that MR can be activated independent of aldosterone in&#xD;
      hypertensive and obese rats 1. Aldosterone promoted end organ damage is mainly found in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system and the kidney. Inflammation and activation of different factors&#xD;
      promotes fibroblast growth and matrix production resulting in myocardial fibrosis, vascular&#xD;
      remodelling and renal fibrosis. Aldosterone appears to be involved in all steps of this&#xD;
      process by synthesis of reactive oxygen species, induction of inflammation and growth factors&#xD;
      like TGF-Beta and connective tissue growth factor. Taken together aldosterone - as the&#xD;
      MetSyn- is an independent cardiovascular risk factor 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MetSyn and aldosterone are cardiovascular risk factors and it is of crucial importance to&#xD;
      note that there is a connection between MetSyn and aldosterone. In clinical studies it was&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated that Renin and Aldosterone in patients with MetSyn are elevated 6.&#xD;
      Similar results have been obtained in animal studies where obesity induced arterial&#xD;
      hypertension increased renin and aldosterone levels 7-9. In a cross sectional study with 397&#xD;
      participants the impact of aldosterone on the onset of arterial hypertension and MetSyn was&#xD;
      analysed. In this study blood pressure was associated with aldosterone levels and aldosterone&#xD;
      was correlated with waist circumference, insulin, HOMA index and an unfavourable lipid&#xD;
      profile 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cross sectional studies show a direct correlation of aldosterone levels and impaired&#xD;
      glucose metabolism in patients with and without the MetSyn 10;11. Taken together, aldosterone&#xD;
      influences essential parameters of the MetSyn. Coincidentally parameters of the MetSyn are&#xD;
      stimulus for an increased aldosterone synthesis, i.e. visceral adipocytes 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In large scale clinical trials - RALES, EPHESUS, 4E 2;3;13 - inhibition of MR has proven to&#xD;
      be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure and post myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      this result has been confirmed for diabetic patients, who are known to have an increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. In addition, these diabetic patients had significant less hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      episodes, indicating an association of MR inhibition and glucose metabolism. Despite the&#xD;
      promising data of MR inhibition on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity there is only very&#xD;
      limited data on the impact of MR inhibition on metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters in patients with MetSyn, who have not yet suffered from cardiovascular events.&#xD;
