      Objective: Continuous nerve block (freezing the nerve) is needed for knee replacement surgery&#xD;
      to reduce pain, increase rehabilitation and discharge patients home fast. A lot of time,&#xD;
      money and hospital resources are invested in inserting these catheters. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to compare two end points used for insertion of continuous femoral nerve block and to see&#xD;
      which one results in fewer failures on the surgical ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Patients having total knee replacement surgery will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups. The continuous femoral nerve block catheter will&#xD;
      be inserted using ultrasound and nerve stimulation with two different end points (certain&#xD;
      muscle contraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed on day 1 and 2 after surgery to observe which catheter fails, how&#xD;
      much pain the patient suffers and how much painkiller the patients used.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous femoral nerve block (c FNB) is a widely used regional anesthetic technique for&#xD;
      many lower limb operations. It provides superior pain relief, faster ambulation, and shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay and less risk of side effects when compared with patient controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulating catheters (SC): SC were introduced back in 1999 to provide an objective end point&#xD;
      to guide the catheter position by maintaining the desired evoked muscle response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulating catheter for continuous femoral nerve block: Salinas et al compared stimulating&#xD;
      catheters vs. non-stimulating catheter in volunteers having femoral nerve block. They&#xD;
      maintained a quadriceps evoked muscle twitch &lt; 0.5 mA through the stimulating catheter . They&#xD;
      reported a block success of 100% via the stimulating catheters versus 85% via the&#xD;
      non-stimulating catheters (P = 0.07) and a much dense motor block and pain scores with SC as&#xD;
      compared to NSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor responses of the femoral nerve: With peripheral nerve stimulation of the femoral nerve,&#xD;
      two responses may be elicited, sartorius muscle contraction (contraction of the sartorius&#xD;
      muscle through stimulation of its muscular branch) or quadriceps muscle contraction or&#xD;
      patella twitch (contraction of the quadriceps muscle through stimulation its respective&#xD;
      muscular branches). The two divisions of the femoral nerve are in fact medial and lateral&#xD;
      divisions rather than anterior and posterior . The medial division supplies the sartorius&#xD;
      muscle and the lateral division supplies the quadriceps muscle and both divisions lay within&#xD;
      close proximity in the same fascial plane. Several regional anesthesia texts states that the&#xD;
      anterior branch, supplying a motor branch to sartorius is above the fascia iliaca and this is&#xD;
      partly why this stimulation should not be sought for FNB because there would be inadequate&#xD;
      spread around the femoral nerve. An anatomical study by Gustafson et al and other anatomical&#xD;
      text have forfeited this theory , . Furthermore, the rectus femoris of quadriceps often gets&#xD;
      part of its innervation from the same division supplying the sartorius muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most authors advocate preferentially searching the quadriceps muscle response as articular&#xD;
      branches are derived from the posterior or lateral division of the femoral nerve . However,&#xD;
      the success of femoral nerve block using either quadriceps or sartorius twitch has not been&#xD;
      confirmed with randomised controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary catheter failure: is defined as the failure of the peripheral continuous nerve&#xD;
      block to provide adequate pain relieve after the primary block was instituted. The incidence&#xD;
      ranges from 10 - 40% depending on the definition used , , . A lot of time, money and hospital&#xD;
      resources are invested in placing the peripheral nerve catheters with the objective of&#xD;
      providing optimal pain management and faster recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the success of FNB using sartorius muscle twitch is equivalent to&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle twitch response. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective&#xD;
      randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing femoral nerve block at the inguinal crease&#xD;
      using sartorius or quadriceps muscle twitch as an end point for stimulation via a stimulating&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With institutional ethical approval (Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada) and&#xD;
      having obtained written informed consent, we plan to recruit 40 patients, aged 18-75, ASA&#xD;
      I-III scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee arthroplastly in this prospective,&#xD;
      randomised, single blinded controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients with a history of significant medical or psychiatric problems,&#xD;
      BMI &gt; 40, allergy to local anesthetic drugs, prior surgery in the inguinal region,&#xD;
      neurological disease with sensory or motor deficit, and diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the block room: patients will be premedicated with acetaminophen 1000 mg, celecoxib 400 mg&#xD;
      and gabapentin 400 to 600 mg as part of out multimodal pain regimen. After an 18-gauge IV&#xD;
      cannula is placed, patients will receive midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) for anxiolysis and routine&#xD;
      monitors will be attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized with random computer allocation into 2 groups:&#xD;
      group 1 = sartorius muscle twitch (SMT), group 2 = quadriceps muscle twitch (QMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Femoral Nerve block: After aseptic skin disinfection and sterile draping of the&#xD;
      inguinal region, a 38 mm broadband 13-6 MHz linear array ultrasound (US) probe (Philips HD&#xD;
      11XE, Bothell, WA) will be placed on the skin to locate the position of the femoral nerve at&#xD;
      the inguinal crease. The ultrasound transducer will be covered with a sterile, transparent&#xD;
      dressing TegadermTM HP (3M Heath Care, St. Paul, MN). Sterile conductivity gel Ultra/Phonic&#xD;
      (Pharmaceutical Innovations TM, Newark, NJ) will be used. In plane or out of plane approach&#xD;
      will be used to guide the tuohy needle towards the femoral nerve. A skin wheal will be raised&#xD;
      with 2 to 3 mLs of local anesthetic solution (1% lidocaine), peripheral nerve stimulator&#xD;
      (PNS) with an initial current output of 1mA (frequency 2Hz, pulse width 0.1ms) will be used&#xD;
      to verify the type of evoked muscle response. The stimulating tuohy needle will be inserted&#xD;
      at 45ยบ angle to the skin, 1 cm lateral to the femoral artery pulsation towards the femoral&#xD;
      nerve under ultrasound guidance. The anesthesiologist will seek either sartorius or&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle evoked muscle response based on the random number allocation in sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes. The stimulating needle will be adjusted and once the appropriate muscle&#xD;
      twitch was obtained at a current of less than 0.4 mA, the catheter will be threaded 3-5 cm&#xD;
      pass the needle tip while maintaining spread of local anesthetic solution in a short axis&#xD;
      view. Plain ropivacaine 0.5% mixed with lidocaine 1% will be injected in increments of 5 mL&#xD;
      after negative aspiration up to a total of 20 mL. To determine the spread of local anesthetic&#xD;
      agent we divided the area around the femoral nerve into 8 pie-chart sectors with the femoral&#xD;
      nerve in the middle. For documentation we will use a piece of transparency film with the pie&#xD;
      chart of eight even sectors drawn on it . The film will be positioned over the US image such&#xD;
      that the center of the pie chart is positioned on the middle of the femoral nerve and the&#xD;
      upper edge of the film is parallel to the upper edge of the US image. Having done this, we&#xD;
      could determine the local anesthetic spread and compare it between the two groups. Time to&#xD;
      femoral nerve location (time needle entered the skin to localization of plexus with adequate&#xD;
      twitch), time to catheter insertion (start to end of catheter insertion) and time to&#xD;
      completion of drug injection (start to end of drug injection) will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor and Sensory assessment: Motor block of femoral nerve, and sensory block of the femoral,&#xD;
      saphenous, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves will be evaluated by a blinded observer every&#xD;
      5 minutes for a period of 30 minutes post block insertion. A 22 G hypodermic needle will used&#xD;
      to assess sensation in the femoral nerve distribution: middle third medial thigh, lateral&#xD;
      femoral cutaneous nerve: lateral thigh, and saphenous nerve: anteriomedial middle third leg .&#xD;
      Sensation will be graded as 0 = normal sensation, 1 = dull sensation, and 2 = no sensation.&#xD;
      Motor block evaluation was graded as 0 = full power, 1= partial block (paresis), 2 = complete&#xD;
      block (paralysis). The quadriceps muscle strength will be assessed by grading the ability or&#xD;
      inability to extend the leg of the operated limb against gravity after the hip is passively&#xD;
      flexed at 45ยฐ. Complete femoral nerve block will be defined as complete loss of a sharp&#xD;
      sensation at middle third medial thigh with complete inability to extend the knee joint after&#xD;
      hip flexion at 45ยบ after 30 minutes post block insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the 30 minutes assessment period, each patient will receive a sciatic&#xD;
      nerve block and spinal anesthesia. Sciatic nerve block will be performed using the subgluteal&#xD;
      approach with 20ml of 0.5% plain ropivicaine. Spinal anesthesia will be performed in the&#xD;
      lateral position with the operated side uppermost. Intrathecal isobaric bupivacaine 10 mg&#xD;
      with 10 ยตg of fentanyl will be injected under sterile conditions using 25 G whitacre needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative period: patients will receive acetaminophen 1000mg q6 hourly, celexocib 200mg&#xD;
      q12 hourly and gabapentin 200mg q8 hourly given orally. Patients will also receive&#xD;
      hydromorphone contin 3mg q8 hourly and a hydromorphone patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for&#xD;
      breakthrough postoperative pain. Visual analogue scale (VAS) will be assessed 4 hourly for&#xD;
      the first 48 hours. Total hydromorphone consumption and time of first PCA dose will be&#xD;
      recorded. The patient will be given a 24 h diary to record VAS on. The research assistant&#xD;
      will interview the patient on postoperative day one and two. VAS scores will be documented&#xD;
      from the patient diary and the nursing records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of our study will be the number of secondary femoral nerve block&#xD;
      failure 24 hours past catheter insertion. A dull needle will be used to test the sensory&#xD;
      dermatomes for femoral nerve (mid thigh medial aspect). Normal sensation compared with the&#xD;
      non-operative site will be considered as failure of the catheter. Secondary catheter failure&#xD;
      is defined as the lack of impaired sensory deficit on the medial and anterior aspect of the&#xD;
      mid thigh. The study is designed as a pilot study to obtain estimates upon which to base a&#xD;
      future larger trial. As such a rigorous sample size calculation is not provided. The goal&#xD;
      will be to recruit a minimum of 12 subjects per group, which is the number, required to&#xD;
      construct a confidence interval (Statistical Rules of Thumb by Gerald van Belle, 2002, John&#xD;
      Wiley and Sons). To account for potential drop out, the number will be increased to 20 per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include; time to perform the block, VAS scores at 24 hours, total oral&#xD;
      hydromorphone use and hydromorphone PCA, and spread of local anesthetic around the femoral&#xD;
      nerve. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,&#xD;
      North Carolina, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operating room efficiency: an average femoral nerve catheter technique takes around&#xD;
           20-25 minutes to complete. Part of the delay in the execution of this procedure is&#xD;
           eliciting quadriceps twitch through the stimulating catheter. If this study proves that&#xD;
           the two elicited twitches as equally efficacious, it can shorten the procedure time by&#xD;
           7-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential nerve injury: minimal tuohy needle manipulation could potentially reduce the&#xD;
           risk of nerve injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient discomfort: Minimal needle manipulations will lead to decrease patient&#xD;
           discomfort.&#xD;
