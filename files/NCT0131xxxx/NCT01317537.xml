      Project Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic personal health record (ePHR) could maximize patient/clinician collaboration&#xD;
      and consequently improve patient self-management and related health outcomes. The purpose of&#xD;
      the proposed project is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of an ePHR that&#xD;
      has been modified using a patient- and family-centered approach and incorporates the&#xD;
      experiences, perspectives, and insights of patients and family members actually using the&#xD;
      system. Comparison of patients with the ePHR intervention to a group of &quot;care as usual&quot;&#xD;
      patients will be performed. The investigators Specific Aims are: (1) To improve the&#xD;
      application of patient- and family-centered care elements in an existing ePHR, based on&#xD;
      feedback from a pilot study of patients and their families. The modified ePHR will be tested&#xD;
      in a pilot group of patients with hypertension and their families. (2) To implement and test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the modified ePHR with patients being treated for hypertension by a team&#xD;
      of physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurse clinicians, and support staff in two ambulatory&#xD;
      settings. Outcome measures will include patient activation and perception of care,&#xD;
      quantifiable biological markers, patient-physician communication, and congruence of treatment&#xD;
      with guidelines, particularly medication management; (3) To monitor the shift in provider and&#xD;
      support staff awareness and incorporation of patient- and family-centered care as a result of&#xD;
      implementation of the ePHR using questionnaires and focus groups. If successful, this ePHR&#xD;
      could be implemented in additional locations in the Southeast.&#xD;

    <description>Patients complete the validated paper-and-pencil Patient Activation Measure (PAM) developed by Judy Hibbard. The instrument assesses the degree to which a patient is &quot;activated,&quot; that is the degree to which they are an active agent in their own health care, e.g. ask questions of their health care provider.</description>
