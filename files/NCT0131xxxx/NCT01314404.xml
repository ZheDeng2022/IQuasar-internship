    <textblock>
      The Global Alliance to Immunize Against AIDS Vaccine Foundation (GAIA Vaccine Foundation or&#xD;
      GAIA VF) proposes to carry out a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) study in&#xD;
      conjunction with a Willingness To Participate (WTP) evaluation to establish the prevalence of&#xD;
      cervical dysplasia, to and perform Human Papillomavirus (HPV) subtyping studies in Bamako and&#xD;
      in Sikoro-Mekin, a village within the perimeter of Bamako, the capital of Mali, West Africa.&#xD;
      Working with experienced collaborators, we propose to carry out an HPV prevalence study&#xD;
      (among women diagnosed with cervical cancer at Hôpital Touré), coupled with a study of&#xD;
      Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) and Willingness To Participate (WTP) in an HPV&#xD;
      vaccine study among individuals living in Sikoro-Mekin. These studies will lay the groundwork&#xD;
      for a phase IV study of Gardasil® at the same site, which would be an important step forward&#xD;
      for West Africa.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination with the Gardasil vaccine has the potential to&#xD;
      eradicate cervical cancer worldwide. However, the impact of quadrivalent Gardasil vaccination&#xD;
      in developing world settings, where HPV subtype prevalence may differ, is unknown. Prior to&#xD;
      conducting a Phase IV trial, HPV subtyping should be studied. Furthermore, few data are&#xD;
      available on vaccine acceptability, health systems preparedness and vaccine&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and long-term impact in this region of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Evaluate, in a sample of 160 women diagnosed with cervical cancer recruited from the&#xD;
      hospital Hôpital Touré, the prevalence of HPV subtypes associated with cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Hôpital Touré is the referral center for cervical cancer patients from the entire city of&#xD;
      Bamako (&gt;1.8M inhabitants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Train local clinical staff to implement good clinical protocols and good clinical&#xD;
      laboratory practices for cervical cancer screening, and establish HPV sub-typing methodology&#xD;
      at the affiliated laboratory sites [Sikoro, Bamako, Mali and the National Institute for&#xD;
      Research on Public Health (INRSP), Bamako].&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Perform a survey evaluating the Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) and Willingness&#xD;
      To Participate (WTP) with regard to HPV and HPV vaccines in the proposed trials site (300&#xD;
      individuals will be asked to complete surveys with trained surveyors; minimum of 100&#xD;
      adolescents and their 200 parents). Use focus groups and house-by-house interviews as means&#xD;
      of collecting data. Obtain information on preferred consenting, screening and notification&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) We plan to identify and recruit a sample of 160 women diagnosed with cervical cancer&#xD;
      within the department of gynecology of the Hospital Gabriel Touré in Bamako, Mali. These&#xD;
      patients will have been previously identified and diagnosed by clinical exam by an&#xD;
      obstetrician-gynecologist at Gabriel Touré, and will have been identified as surgical&#xD;
      candidates by a doctor. Recruitment will be done during appointments either for a curative&#xD;
      biopsy or for a more extensive surgical procedure. No biopsy will be done just for the sake&#xD;
      of the study. During the study, each participant will sign a consent form and undergo an&#xD;
      interview with a nurse. The nurse will be in charge of briefly presenting the proposed study&#xD;
      protocol and ensuring that the patient (a) had been positively diagnosed with cervical cancer&#xD;
      (diagnoses are established from a clinical case and/or based on the patient's history), (b)&#xD;
      voluntarily expressed a willingness to have a biopsy or other gynecological operations and&#xD;
      have a doctor collect tissue samples during a &quot;standard&quot; medical appointment (i.e. not linked&#xD;
      to the study), (c) agreed to have blood drawn, (d) was older than 18, and (e) had the&#xD;
      capacity to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect the necessary data for this study, the following procedures will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws: Blood samples will be collected in order to measure antibodies against a&#xD;
           panel of HPV types, including HPV 16 and 18. Blood samples will be sent to the&#xD;
           laboratory for Applied Molecular Biology (LAMB/LBMA) located in Bamako, for&#xD;
           centrifugation and serum aliquoting. The serum samples will be stored at -20°C and will&#xD;
           be sent to the United States every four months for serological testing in the Merck&#xD;
           laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serology: The serum samples will be sent to the Merck research laboratories in the&#xD;
           United States (Wayne Laboratories) and will be tested using the Luminex immunological&#xD;
           assay. This assay will allow for the detection of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid test: A rapid test will be conducted on the cells from the tissue samples. This&#xD;
           test will allow for the detection of 14 types of HPV (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51,&#xD;
           52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) in two and a half hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue collection: Two cervical scrapes will be collected from each patient. One sample&#xD;
           will be taken of the cells on the outer opening of the cervix and the other sample will&#xD;
           be taken of the cells inside the cervical canal. Cervical scrapes will be stored in&#xD;
           liquid nitrogen for maximum preservation and will be sent to the Merck laboratories to&#xD;
           be analyzed by a laboratory technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): PCR assays will be conducted at the Laboratory for&#xD;
           Applied Molecular Biology (LBMA) with adherence to strict standards of good laboratory&#xD;
           practices. HPV sub-typing will be conducted with the cells from the cervical scrapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to protect the identity and confidentiality of each patient, a unique identification&#xD;
      number will be used. Only the study personnel - and the patient, if requested - will have&#xD;
      access to the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) We will be identifying and training the experts necessary for this study. We plan to&#xD;
      recruit and train local medical personnel in clinical and laboratory practices. We want to&#xD;
      develop necessary protocols for this study, put an infrastructure in place, and train medical&#xD;
      personnel. This step is necessary not only for this study, but also for preparing for a&#xD;
      vaccine trial (if possible). The goal is to lay the groundwork for all clinical studies to&#xD;
      come, and to improve the conditions of vaccine research in Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) In order to assess KAP and WTP with regard to HPV and HPV vaccines, we plan to contact&#xD;
      the inhabitants of Sikoro-Mekin with the help of community leaders and peer educators. Sikoro&#xD;
      is a peri-urban neighborhood of Bamako with a population of around 40,000. The study will&#xD;
      comprise the six sectors of the neighborhood. We want to interview around 300 people total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two questionnaires will be given. The participant will be given the first questionnaire,&#xD;
      which will be followed by an information and education session. This will be followed by a&#xD;
      second, identical questionnaire that will permit us to measure information retention and&#xD;
      comprehension from the information session. The information sessions will be conducted either&#xD;
      in small groups or individually in order to improve the quality of information provided, as&#xD;
      well as the contact and communication with the person being surveyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and analyzed according to (i) Interview and questionnaire responses&#xD;
      (ii) HPV subtypes and (iii) serology, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and rapid test&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting this study will allow us to collect information that could help bolster the fight&#xD;
      against the spread of HPV and cervical cancer in Mali. With the development of protocols and&#xD;
      the training of medical personnel, we are striving to reinforce human capacity, improve&#xD;
      research conditions, and lay the groundwork for all clinical studies to come in Mali. We hope&#xD;
      that the collection and analysis of KAP/WTP data will be used for the goal of promoting the&#xD;
      introduction of the Gardasil vaccine in Mali. Finally in the coming years we hope to obtain&#xD;
      approval for the use of Gardasil and to plan for an HPV vaccine trial in Mali.&#xD;
