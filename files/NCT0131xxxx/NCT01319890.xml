      Current evidence regarding the optimal surgical approach to potentially curable right colonic&#xD;

      eminence based opinion suggests that an alternative surgical technique, single incision&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery (SILS), may improve short and long term outcomes after minimally&#xD;
      invasive right colonic resection. A true, prospective analysis comparing standard of care&#xD;
      (laparoscopic right hemicolectomy) and this &quot;new&quot; therapy(SILS) has yet to be published.&#xD;

      The 'SILVERMAN' 1 Trial Single Incision Laparoscopic Versus Existing Resection (Minimal&#xD;
      Access) for Neoplasia- A Multi-institutional Randomised Controlled Trial&#xD;

&#xD;
      Background Colonic cancer is the third commonest cause of cancer mortality in women and men&#xD;
      in the developed world[1]. Old age, adenomatous colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, low intake of dietary fibre and family history of colorectal cancer all predispose&#xD;
      to the development of colonic cancer[2-4]. Certain genetic syndromes such as Hereditary&#xD;
      Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC), Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), Peutz-Jeghers&#xD;
      Syndrome (PJS) and Juvenile Polyposis have a significant lifetime risk of developing colonic&#xD;
      cancer[5-8]. Historically, open surgery has been the mainstay of treatment for localised,&#xD;
      potentially curable colonic cancer. Laterally, minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery has&#xD;
      largely supplanted open surgery in the management of colonic cancer[9,10,11]. Published data&#xD;
      have shown that laparoscopic assisted resection has equivalent oncological outcomes in terms&#xD;
      of long term survival when compared to conventional open surgery. Similarly, Level 1 evidence&#xD;
      from the major randomised controlled trials in this field suggests that laparoscopic colonic&#xD;
      resection confers advantages over the open approach during the perioperative period in terms&#xD;
      of reduced requirement for parenteral narcotics and oral analgesics, earlier restoration of&#xD;
      intestinal function, earlier ambulation, and shorter hospital stay. To date there remains no&#xD;
      consensus or accepted guidelines on the surgical management of potentially curable right&#xD;
      colonic cancer. The NHS published guidelines on management of colorectal cancer simply state&#xD;
      that surgeons offering their patients potentially curative laparoscopic resections should be&#xD;
      appropriately trained in such specialist techniques12. Currently, surgeons competent in&#xD;
      minimal access surgery favour laparoscopic right hemicolectomy as the technique of choice for&#xD;
      right colonic resection. Intestinal continuity can be restored intracorporeally, or&#xD;
      extracorporeally by exteriorising the mobilised segment of ileum/right and transverse colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of &quot;single incision laparoscopic surgery&quot; (SILS) has further advanced the&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach to the management of complex surgical diseases. SILS, currently&#xD;
      in the embryonic stages of development, utilises a single incision to insert a single access&#xD;
      device into the abdominal cavity under direct vision. Typically, the device is inserted in&#xD;
      the midline and utilises a 2-3cm incision around the umbilicus, itself an embryonic natural&#xD;
      orifice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optical and operating trocars are inserted through the access device and the procedure is&#xD;
      carried out as a conventional laparoscopic procedure. Many short case series and reports have&#xD;
      been published describing the feasibility of SILS in performing complex surgical procedures&#xD;
      for both benign and malignant disease[13,14,15]. Specialised, complex colorectal procedures&#xD;
      such as proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), ileocolic resection for&#xD;
      terminal ileal Crohn's mass and colonic resection for cancer have been successfully performed&#xD;
      using single incision laparoscopic surgery[16,17,18,19]. To date, several short series of&#xD;
      SILS right hemicolectomy have been published in the literature[20,21].Thus, rather than a new&#xD;
      or novel technique, SILS is a derivation of laparoscopic surgery, performed through a single&#xD;
      incision. There is no evidence in the literature that SILS colectomy confers any&#xD;
      disadvantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery and to dtae, there are no reports of&#xD;
      SILS putting patients at increased risk of complication. Postulated benefits of SILS&#xD;
      colectomy over conventional laparoscopic colectomy include reduced number of incisions,&#xD;
      improved cosmesis, less pain, faster return to normal activities/work and shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay. Heretofore, there has been no randomised controlled clinical trial comparing SILS and&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. Having previously demonstrated the&#xD;
      benefits of laparoscopic resection over open resection in the treatment of colon cancer we&#xD;
      feel the time is ripe to further extrapolate these data by comparing laparoscopic right&#xD;
      hemicolectomy with a proposed new treatment modality, single incision laparoscopic right&#xD;
      hemicolectomy, in the format of a multicentre, international randomised controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge transfer/implementation Current evidence regarding the optimal surgical approach to&#xD;
      potentially curable right colonic cancer is based on numerous, well designed randomised&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials. Currently, eminence based opinion suggests that an alternative&#xD;
      surgical technique, SILS, may improve short and long term outcomes after minimally invasive&#xD;
      right colonic resection. A true, prospective analysis comparing standard of care&#xD;
      (laparoscopic right hemicolectomy) and this &quot;new&quot; therapy(SILS) has yet to be published.&#xD;
      Having established the optimum treatment modality the minimally invasive approach to right&#xD;
      colonic tumors the results will be communicated at national and international meetings.&#xD;
      Findings will be submitted to an international surgical journal to ensure maximal&#xD;
      communication of results and will be made available to national and international academic&#xD;
      societies to enable the establishment of guidelines of best practice for surgical management&#xD;
      of right colonic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare patient outcome following standard of care (laparoscopic right hemicolectomy) and&#xD;
      an alternative, established, recognized therapy (SILS right hemicolectomy) for the treatment&#xD;
      of right colonic tumors. Specific research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which treatment modality confers least perioperative morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
           surgical management of right colonic tumors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does treatment influence length of time to discharge home and return to activities of&#xD;
           daily living?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are treatment modalities equivalent in terms of extent of resection (lymph node yield,&#xD;
           resection margins etc)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy An Irish based, multi-centre, international trial will be performed with the aim of&#xD;
      comparing two treatment modalities for patients presenting with right colonic cancer.&#xD;
      Pre-operative details, intraoperative findings and post-operative course will be&#xD;
      prospectively accrued by the operating surgeon. Each surgeon has previous experience in&#xD;
      performing this procedure and currently offer SILS colectomy to their patients outside of a&#xD;
      clinical trial setting. All patients will be followed up and primary and secondary end-points&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Qualitative - Lymph node yield&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Histopathological grade of specimen&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  30 day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cancer free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative- operative time&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Return to normal activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study will be an international multi-centred ,randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Ethical approval will be sought prior to study implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age 18-85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Histologic confirmation of right colonic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inability to give informed consent (e.g. dementia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous midline laparotomy incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. T4 tumour diagnosed on pre-operative imaging or intra-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous pelvic irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. FAP/ HNPCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Colonic carcinoma against a background of ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Emergent surgery for perforated/obstructing right colonic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outline All patients with histologically confirmed right colonic tumours will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Individual patient consent will be sought. Each patient will be&#xD;
      randomized at the pre-operative visit the day prior to surgery; thus, each patient will know,&#xD;
      in advance, which procedure they are undergoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be staged pre-operatively with Computed Tomography of abdomen and pelvis to&#xD;
      facilitate therapeutic and operative strategy. All patients will be given prophylaxis against&#xD;
      deep vein thrombosis (sequential intermittent pneumatic compression devices/compression&#xD;
      stockings and low molecular weight heparin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single, prophylactic dose of antibiotics will be given perioperatively; the choice of&#xD;
      antibiotic will be determined according to institutional guidelines. Operative procedure will&#xD;
      be according to standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, pneumoperitoneum will be established following insertion&#xD;
      of a 12mm umbilical port. Two or 3 further operating trocars (5mm) will be inserted; the&#xD;
      number and position will be at the operating surgeons discretion. When it is necessary to use&#xD;
      more than two 5mm trocars to complete the procedure this will be recorded. Ligation of the&#xD;
      vascular pedicle must be performed intracorporeally using an endovascular stapling device,&#xD;
      endoclips or an electrothermal coagulation device. If the major vessels are ligated&#xD;
      extracorporeally when the mobilised colon has been exteriorised for resection the procedure&#xD;
      will be classified as &quot;laparoscopic assisted&quot;- i.e. converted to an open procedure- for the&#xD;
      purposes of this trial. Intestinal continuity will be restored extracorporeally using end to&#xD;
      end, end-to side or side-to side anastomosis. The type of anastomosis will be at the&#xD;
      surgeons' discretion (stapled vs. handsewn) and will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients having SILS right hemicolectomy will receive the same perioperative care as those&#xD;
      undergoing conventional laparoscopic resection. The SILS access device is inserted through a&#xD;
      4-5cm incision (max 6cm incision), 2cm above and 1 cm below the umbilicus. The access device&#xD;
      utilises three 5mm trocars facilitating entry to the peritoneal cavity. The choice of access&#xD;
      device will be at individual surgeons' discretion. In the event of additional ports being&#xD;
      required to complete a SILS minimally invasive procedure the number of additional trocars&#xD;
      used will be recorded. Oral fluids will be commenced on the evening of surgery and diet will&#xD;
      be introduced the following morning, depending on clinical status. Urinary catheters will be&#xD;
      removed on post-operative day 1 and ambulation encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data collection will be performed by the operating surgeon, a designated&#xD;
      member of the surgical team (present at time of operation) or Dr. Martin, Co-PI on the study,&#xD;
      and recorded on an electronic pro-forma and submitted to an on-line database (the iCore&#xD;
      website- Institute for Clinical Outcomes in Research and Education). Each patient enrolled in&#xD;
      the study will be given a study number and all data will be registered under this number.&#xD;
      Patients will thus be deidentified. Any data that could potentially identify patients such as&#xD;
      D.O.B/ date of surgery, date of discharge will be excluded . It will include patient&#xD;
      demographics (age, sex), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade and specific&#xD;
      co-morbidities, intervention performed, operation performed, number of ports used, technique&#xD;
      for ligation of vascular pedicle, type of anastomosis, re-intervention during index admission&#xD;
      (radiological or operative) in-hospital morbidity (myocardial infarction, deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, abscess requiring drainage, urosepsis, renal&#xD;
      failure or respiratory insufficiency), mortality, analgesic requirements, time to return to&#xD;
      diet, time to discharge to home. Further details will be recorded at post-operative visits&#xD;
      including the number of days alive following discharge, reinterventions within 12 months and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Each patient will be seen at 3 and 12 months post-operatively. For&#xD;
      those patients from out of state who prefer to be followed up locally we will perform a&#xD;
      telephone interview at the timelines outlined. Patient satisfaction will be determined using&#xD;
      the Short Form (SF-36) questionnaire at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The main short-term endpoints of the study are both qualitative (lymph node&#xD;
      yield, grade of specimen) and quantitative (operative time, cosmesis satisfaction, resumption&#xD;
      of normal diet/intestinal function, length of hospital stay). Cancer-related survival is the&#xD;
      main long-term primary end-point. The working hypothesis is that there will be no significant&#xD;
      differences in this variable between SILS and conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy,&#xD;
      but that differences in variables related to the short-term outcome (i.e. morbidity and&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay) would favour SILS. We assume that a difference in cancer-related&#xD;
      survival of less than 15% between treatments indicates an equivalent efficacy. Assuming a 70%&#xD;
      5-year cancer-related survival in the laparoscopic colectomy group, a minimum of 100 patients&#xD;
      per group is required to show that both surgical techniques are equivalent with an α level of&#xD;
      0•20 and a β error of 0•05. Recruitment of patients is not expected to be difficult because&#xD;
      evidence to date is convincing of at least equivalent outcome and we believe that most&#xD;
      patients would hope to be assigned to the SILS group, with potentially shorter hospital stay,&#xD;
      less pain and improved cosmesis. From a surgeon's perspective, SILS is technically feasible&#xD;
      and represents only a slight modification of the conventional laparoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Inclusion and Patient Accrual All eligible patients (see exclusion criteria)&#xD;
      presenting to participating hospitals with right colonic tumors will be recruited for the&#xD;
      trial. . Each patient will be randomized at the pre-operative visit the day prior to surgery;&#xD;
      thus, each patient will know, in advance, which procedure they are undergoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be furnished with a patient information leaflet and will have the implications&#xD;
      of inclusion in the trial explained to them by the operating surgeon. It will be explained&#xD;
      that non-willingness to participate in the trial will not have any negative impact on their&#xD;
      treatment. If the patient is willing to participate in the trial, verbal and written consent&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to transfer to the operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation schedules will be in blocks, with the proposed treatment delivered in writing&#xD;
      in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. If inferiority of efficacy is&#xD;
      demonstrable on preliminary statistical analysis, the trial will be stopped prematurely to&#xD;
      prevent harm to patients. We aim to perform a preliminary analysis of the pooled data at&#xD;
      6/12/18/24 months or when 100/150/200 patients have been entered into the trial; whichever&#xD;
      comes first will prompt preliminary analysis. Each adverse event will be included in the&#xD;
      electronic file of each patient in the study. The data will then be communicated with the PI&#xD;
      at each site participating in the study. In the event of one technique being of greater risk&#xD;
      to patients, the lead center in Dublin, Ireland will terminate the study prematurely.&#xD;
      Similarly, in the event of a PI in the study being unhappy with the outcomes of the study,&#xD;
      they are free to withdraw from the trial at any time. This withdrawal will be reported in&#xD;
      publishing the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      Because the scope of the study is non-metastatic colon cancer, patients in whom metastases&#xD;
      are detected intra-operatively will not be included in the analyses of long-term outcome.&#xD;
      Survival is calculated from surgical resection of primary tumour to the last visit or death.&#xD;
      For cancer-related survival, patients who die from other causes will be censored from the&#xD;
      study at time of death. Probability curves will be constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method&#xD;
      and compared with the log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use proportional-hazards modeling with forward selection to determine the influence&#xD;
      of patients' baseline characteristics on cancer-related survival and other variables. The&#xD;
      surgical procedure and any variable reaching a p value of less than 0•10 in the univariate&#xD;
      analysis will then undergo multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be compared by χ2 test, with the Yates correction when necessary.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be compared by the Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test,&#xD;
      depending on their distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All p values will be two-sided with a p value of less than 0•05 indicating a significant&#xD;
      difference. All calculations will be performed with SPSS (version 18.0 for Windows).&#xD;
