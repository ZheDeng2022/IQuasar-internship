    <textblock>
      Postpartum dyspareunia (PD) is a recognized phenomenon: it is estimated that 50-60% of women&#xD;
      have dyspareunia 6 to 7 weeks following delivery, and 33% and 17% will still report pain&#xD;
      during intercourse three and six months after delivery, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies that evaluated the prevalence and the causes for PD referred primarily to obstetric&#xD;
      trauma, such as vaginal tears, episiotomy, the mode of repair and damage to the pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles as probable causes for PD. These studies did not refer to estrogen deficiency and the&#xD;
      possible effect of breastfeeding on vaginal atrophy and its contribution to PD. Comparison&#xD;
      between vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections revealed that there is no difference in the&#xD;
      prevalence of PD between the two groups, and according to these findings it can be assumed&#xD;
      that the mechanical trauma to the vagina and pelvic floor during delivery is not the main&#xD;
      cause for the development of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency is a common cause for postmenopausal dyspareunia.&#xD;
      With estrogen deficiency, profound changes occur in the vagina: vaginal mucosa becomes thin&#xD;
      and pale or hyperemic and loose her flexibility. Blood flow decreases, normal vaginal&#xD;
      discharge is reduced, and maturation of epithelial cells do not take place in the absence of&#xD;
      estrogen. Women with estrogen deficiency may complain of dryness, pruritus, irritation,&#xD;
      burning, dysuria, pain and dyspareunia. These changes are reversible by estrogen, given&#xD;
      systemically or topically, and cause resolution of clinical findings, as well as&#xD;
      disappearance of symptoms in several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to postmenopausal patients, breastfeeding women immediately after delivery,&#xD;
      experience decline of estrogen levels, and this decline may persist as long as lactation is&#xD;
      continued. Therefore, many women after delivery may experience vaginal atrophy due to&#xD;
      transitional lack of estrogen. It is possible that this atrophy is the cause for the high&#xD;
      rate of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical experience shows that many women present with postpartum dyspareunia with&#xD;
      vaginal atrophy, and that vaginal atrophy is responsible for part or most of their&#xD;
      complaints. Although most gynecologists recognize atrophy easily in menopausal women, vaginal&#xD;
      atrophy is not recognized correctly in most puerperal patients and therefore do not receive&#xD;
      attention and proper treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to characterize the phenomenon of postpartum vaginal atrophy in terms&#xD;
      of prevalence, risk factors and duration, and the association between vaginal atrophy and&#xD;
      postpartum dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also intend to evaluate the effect of vaginal treatment with estriol cream 0.1% (Ovestin&#xD;
      cream) on postpartum dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will expand our knowledge regarding postpartum dyspareunia and will enable&#xD;
      formulating recommendations for evaluation and treatment of PD.&#xD;
