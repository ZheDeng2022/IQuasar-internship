    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties of single doses of TAK-329 with a single dose of a&#xD;
      subcutaneously-injected rapid-acting insulin analog in participants with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
      juvenile-onset diabetes, occurs primarily due to Î²-cell destruction, usually leading to&#xD;
      absolute insulin deficiency. The condition is immune-mediated and is usually idiopathic.&#xD;
      Tight glycemic control using intensive insulin therapy was shown in the Diabetes Control and&#xD;
      Complications Trial (DCCT) to reduce rates of microvascular complications in T1DM; however,&#xD;
      achieving and maintaining such control in T1DM using standard insulin therapy requires a high&#xD;
      level of support and is associated with increased potential for hypoglycemia, increased&#xD;
      weight gain and, in some patients, aggravation of cardiovascular risk factors including&#xD;
      dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-329 is being developed by Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center, Inc. (TGRD) as an&#xD;
      adjunct treatment to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who&#xD;
      use insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at 1 site in the United States. A total of 36 male and female&#xD;
      adult participants with T1DM will take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last about 77 days, including a 28 days screening period, 4 cross-over&#xD;
      treatment periods and a follow up period. Participants will be confined to the study clinic&#xD;
      for 2 days in each period. Participants will also be contacted by phone 30 days following the&#xD;
      last dose of study drug.&#xD;
