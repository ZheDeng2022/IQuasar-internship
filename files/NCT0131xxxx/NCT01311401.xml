      The aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The metabolic risk factors that can predict diabetes after 10 years in a Circassians&#xD;
           population-based sample of people who were aged 35 years or older and living in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Circassians minority in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High fasting glucose has the most powerful predictive value for type 2 diabetes mellitus in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The claimed importance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding a powerful risk factor for future diabetes mellitus can contribute to intensifying&#xD;
      the preventive measures in a small part of the population, by that to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      new diabetes without increasing the health cost.&#xD;

      Research design and methods The present study is a 10 year, nested prospective cohort,&#xD;
      population-based survey of the metabolic syndrome risk factors including type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The original cross-sectional survey was conducted in two small Circassian villages&#xD;
      in north Israel with 4000 inhabitants. The baseline evaluation was performed between 1996 and&#xD;
      - 1997. Among the 739 randomly selected men (n=289) and women (n=450 of the 4000 individuals&#xD;
      who were aged 35 years or older. Mean age of men was 53.2±11.8 years and of women was 52±&#xD;
      years. Mean BMI for men and women was 27.5± and 29.4± Kg/m2, respectively. Plasma glucose&#xD;
      level for men and women was mg/dL(22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit the same cohort in the proposed study and individuals who were&#xD;
      free of diabetes at base line will be included. The number of deceased changed their&#xD;
      residence and those who will decline to participate in the follow-up study will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ziv hospital and all participants&#xD;
      will give an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data. Body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, blood total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, low density cholesterol (LDL), high density cholesterol (HDL) and blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements were done 10 years ago. In the present study, after 8 hours of caloric&#xD;
      fast, blood glucose levels will be tested and patients will be asked about known recent&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus in the last 10 years or treatment by dietary, hypoglycemic drugs or&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data. In the morning, after an overnight caloric fast, venous blood will be&#xD;
      sampled for the measurement of plasma concentrations of glucose. The blood levels of glucose&#xD;
      will be done by Olympus 640 at ZIV hospital. Diagnosis of diabetes. At baseline and at the&#xD;
      10-year follow-up, the presence of diabetes will be established according to World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) criteria (84), i.e., when fasting glucose will be ≥126 mg/dl or when the&#xD;
      participants will have a clinical diagnosis of the disease and treatment was ongoing (diet,&#xD;
      drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of the disease will be confirmed by reviewing the medical records of their&#xD;
      general practitioners. No case of diabetes will be accepted without a validated confirmation.&#xD;
