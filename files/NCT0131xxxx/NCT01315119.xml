    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn the value of the SPY ELITEÂ® intra-operative angiography in&#xD;
      reducing post-operative complications associated with low breast skin blood flow after breast&#xD;
      reconstruction using implants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, and over 180,000 women will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with this disease in 2008. Last year, over 57,000 breast reconstructive procedures&#xD;
      were performed, of which prosthetic reconstruction constituted 76%. Immediate reconstruction&#xD;
      has been favored over delayed procedures for psychological and technical reasons. However,&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction is associated with significantly higher complication rates&#xD;
      (50-52%) than delayed procedures (32-36%), especially when a prosthetic technique is used.&#xD;
      For prosthetic reconstructions, the most significant early complications include necrosis of&#xD;
      the mastectomy skin flaps, infection, delayed wound healing and exposure of the implant. The&#xD;
      published incidence of these complications ranges between 10% and 40% and is predominantly&#xD;
      associated with malperfusion of mastectomy skin flaps. Thus, evaluation of skin perfusion and&#xD;
      elimination of poorly vascularized areas could help reduce the high rate of complications in&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction.&#xD;
