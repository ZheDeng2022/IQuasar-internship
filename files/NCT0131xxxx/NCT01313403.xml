      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Medications to treat major depression act on a brain chemical called serotonin, which binds&#xD;
      to receptors on brain cells. More research is needed on how serotonin receptors work in the&#xD;
      brain, and imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information&#xD;
      on how these receptors function in the brains of individuals with depression and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The experimental radioactive chemical [11C]CUMI has been designed to react with&#xD;
      serotonin receptors, and researchers are interested in studying its effectiveness using&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to see how well it gets into the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of the radiotracer [11C]CUMI in brain imaging studies of&#xD;
      serotonin receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who either have been diagnosed with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder or are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history, physical and psychiatric&#xD;
           examination, blood and urine tests, and questionnaires about mood. Participants will&#xD;
           also have an electrocardiogram at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will have a MRI scan of the brain to provide&#xD;
           baseline data on brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second study visit, participants will have a PET scan with the [11C]CUMI contrast&#xD;
           agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighteen million people in the United States are currently suffering from Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder, which is characterized by episodes of low mood, poor self attitude and poor&#xD;
      vitality. Of those suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), only one third completely&#xD;
      improve, but even among these cases, there is a waiting period of several weeks or more&#xD;
      during which antidepressants take effect. Our inability to adequately treat MDD is evident in&#xD;
      its being ranked number one in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) among persons aged&#xD;
      15-44. Given this profound burden, improving our understanding of the molecular basis of MDD&#xD;
      is of utmost importance in the development of novel antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotoninergic neurotransmission is implicated in MDD, as demonstrated by the relative&#xD;
      success of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs block the reuptake of&#xD;
      serotonin through the serotonin transporter, which then increases serotonin at the synaptic&#xD;
      cleft. Serotonin then binds to 5-HT1A receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors that&#xD;
      are present both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Presynaptically, these receptors act&#xD;
      as autoinhibitory receptors, triggering decreased firing rates and serotonin release. This&#xD;
      autoinhibition, which lasts for about two weeks, is believed to be the reason why patients&#xD;
      experience a delay in symptomatic improvement after initiation of SSRIs. Serotonin binding to&#xD;
      postsynaptic receptors mediates symptomatic improvement of depression. Multiple positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) studies utilizing antagonists at 5-HT1A have been conducted. The&#xD;
      results are mixed, with some noting increased and others noting decreased 5-HT1A in the&#xD;
      brains of patients with MDD. While clinical heterogeneity and the effects of previous&#xD;
      treatment with SSRIs may be confounding factors, the lack of consistent finding could also be&#xD;
      secondary to using antagonist rather than agonist radioligands. Unlike agonists, antagonists&#xD;
      are unable to discriminate between 5-HT1A in the high and low affinity states, and only the&#xD;
      high affinity state, which is G-protein-coupled, allows for activity at the 5-HT1A receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a PET study using 5-HT1A radiolabelled agonist, C(11)CUMI, to determine whether&#xD;
      there is a difference in the density and distribution of 5-HT1A in the high affinity state in&#xD;
      the brains of patients with MDD versus controls. We will perform an internal control at 1-5&#xD;
      days after initiation of SSRI to determine whether increased serotonin causes detectable&#xD;
      displacement of C(11)CUMI. At 4-8 weeks after initiation of SSRI treatment, we will reimage&#xD;
      patients to determine whether there is a change in the density of 5-HT1A in the high affinity&#xD;
      state.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with MDD (Inclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be between 18-55 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a DSMIV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must at the time of study enrollment be experiencing an episode of Major&#xD;
             Depression per DSMIV criteria, and as demonstrated by a Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
             Scale (HDRS; 17 item) greater than 18 (Williams, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers (Inclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be adults between 18-55 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17 item) less than 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with MDD (Exclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With the exception of substance abuse and anxiety disorders, any past or current Axis&#xD;
             I diagnosis other than Major Depressive Disorder. With regard to substance abuse&#xD;
             disorders, we will allow past diagnoses so long as there is no question of substance&#xD;
             or alcohol dependence, the patient has not had substance abuse patterns in the year&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, and other criteria regarding LSD and ecstasy use are met (see&#xD;
             below). We will screen for substance abuse patterns in the year prior to enrollment by&#xD;
             excluding heavy alcohol use, as defined as greater than 14 drinks per week for men and&#xD;
             greater than 7 drinks per week for women. With regard to anxiety disorders, we will&#xD;
             allow past or present diagnoses of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, social phobia and&#xD;
             panic disorder, so long as the anxiety disorder is not felt to outweigh the magnitude&#xD;
             of the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. This will be determined by clinical&#xD;
             investigators in this protocol. Particular attention will be made to ensure that the&#xD;
             patient does not have a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder or&#xD;
             Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use, because it may alter serotonin&#xD;
             receptor properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of ecstasy use more than 3 times in life, because it may alter serotonin&#xD;
             receptor properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current suicidality or serious depressive symptoms warranting more intensive&#xD;
             management than weekly visits in our psychiatric outpatient clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Psychiatric symptoms warranting psychotropic medications other than the selected SSRI&#xD;
             study drug. The exception to this is infrequent use of benzodiazepine (e.g. lorazepam&#xD;
             (Ativan), 0.5-1.0 mg for anxiety). Infrequent is defined here as less often than 3&#xD;
             times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In women, irregular menses such that it will not be possible to determine the phase of&#xD;
             the cycle. This is because previous data show that the phases of the menstrual cycle&#xD;
             may affect 5-HT1A binding by radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Psychotropic medication use (including benzodiazepines and illicit drugs) during the&#xD;
             21 days (42 days for fluoxetine) prior to the PET scan. The exception would be 1-5&#xD;
             doses of 0.5-1.0mg of benzodiazepine (lorazepam (Ativan)) by mouth, separated by at&#xD;
             least 24 hours between doses, for anxiety related to study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serious medical problems including but not limited to chronic neurological disease&#xD;
             such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, brain masses or lesions &gt; 1cm in&#xD;
             diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet, or fear of enclosed&#xD;
             spaces likely to make the subject unable to undergo an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Head trauma resulting in a period of unconsciousness lasting longer than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of fetal alcohol syndrome or other neurodevelopmental disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Recent exposure to radiation (i.e., PET from other research) which when combined with&#xD;
             this study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Inability to lie flat on camera bed for about 2.5 h&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of adverse reaction to the medication that we plan to use in the patient,&#xD;
             which will be selected among sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) or escitalopram&#xD;
             (Lexapro)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Pregnancy at time of scan (BetaHCG will be measured in all female patients within 24&#xD;
             hours of scan and must be negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers (Exclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With the exception of substance abuse, any past or current Axis I diagnosis. With&#xD;
             regard to substance abuse disorders, we will allow past diagnoses so long as there is&#xD;
             no question of substance or alcohol dependence, the patient has not had substance&#xD;
             abuse patterns in the year prior to enrollment, and other criteria regarding LSD and&#xD;
             ecstasy use are met (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of psychotic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If female, any history of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), because PMDD has&#xD;
             been shown to correlate with changes in 5-HT1A distribution in brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any history of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use, because it may alter serotonin&#xD;
             receptor properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of ecstasy use more than 3 times in life, because it may alter serotonin&#xD;
             receptor properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In women, irregular menses such that it will not be possible to determine the phase of&#xD;
             the cycle. This is because previous data show that the phases of the menstrual cycle&#xD;
             may affect 5-HT1A binding by radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Psychotropic medication use (including benzodiazepines and illicit drugs) during the&#xD;
             21 days (42 days for fluoxetine/ Prozac, which has a longer half-life) prior to the&#xD;
             PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serious medical problems including but not limited to chronic neurological disease&#xD;
             such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases or any cardiopulmonary disease that&#xD;
             would increase risks associated with sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet, or fear of enclosed&#xD;
             spaces likely to make the subject unable to undergo an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Head trauma resulting in a period of unconsciousness lasting longer than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of fetal alcohol syndrome or other neurodevelopmental disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Recent exposure to radiation (i.e., PET from other research) which when combined with&#xD;
             this study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
