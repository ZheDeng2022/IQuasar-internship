      Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease with a growing prevalence worldwide. Currently&#xD;
      available therapies for type 2 diabetes have various limitations and are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, gastrointestinal side effects or edema and heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new and promising class of drugs are the gliptins. Several efficacy studies demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant improvement of HbA1c with gliptins. In addition, gliptins improved fasting as&#xD;
      well as prandial glucose levels and did not induce weight gain. Due to these positive&#xD;
      metabolic effects in combination with a very small spectrum of side effects gliptins might&#xD;
      very well be part of the standard therapy for type 2 diabetes in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart form surrogate parameters like reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose&#xD;
      levels or improvement of HbA1c, the effect of gliptins on micro- and macrovascular function&#xD;
      and cardiovascular outcome has not been the primary focus of current studies. Diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus is strongly associated with microangiopathy and macroangiopathy and is a strong&#xD;
      independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. Endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction which plays a crucial role in the atherosclerotic process is commonly observed in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus and already prediabetes and has - amongst other factors -&#xD;
      been linked to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. Taken into account that gliptins&#xD;
      reduce hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic peaks by preventing inactivation of GLP-1, which&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease with a growing prevalence worldwide, affecting 171&#xD;
      million people in 2000 and an expected 366 million people in 2030 [1].. Currently available&#xD;
      therapies for type 2 diabetes have various limitations and are associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia, weight gain, gastrointestinal side effects or edema and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new and promising class of drugs are the gliptins. Gliptins act by inhibiting the enzyme&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is responsible for the rapid inactivation of&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) - an incretin hormone of the gut [2-4], thereby enhancing and&#xD;
      prolonging the effects of GLP-1. GLP-1 - member of the incretin hormones - is released into&#xD;
      the blood after meal ingestion and stimulates the insulin secretion in a glucose dependent&#xD;
      manner. This accounts for the marked prandial insulin response, which prevents prandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. Several efficacy studies demonstrated a significant improvement of HbA1c with&#xD;
      gliptins. In addition, gliptins improved fasting as well as prandial glucose levels and did&#xD;
      not induce weight gain. Due to these positive metabolic effects in combination with a very&#xD;
      small spectrum of side effects gliptins might very well be part of the standard therapy for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart form surrogate parameters like reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose&#xD;
      levels or improvement of HbA1c, the effect of gliptins on micro- and macrovascular function&#xD;
      and cardiovascular outcome has not been the primary focus of current studies. However,&#xD;
      infusion of GLP-1, the incretin hormone affected by gliptins has been reported to ameliorate&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from coronary artery disease [5] and it was&#xD;
      recently shown that infusion of GLP-1 into healthy human subjects increases both normal and&#xD;
      ACh-induced vasodilatation [6]. In studies on rats with diabetes, GLP-1 infusion nearly&#xD;
      re-established their normal vascular tone [7] and there are further data from experimental&#xD;
      animals that indicate a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on endothelial function [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with microangiopathy and macroangiopathy and is a&#xD;
      strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality [9].&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction which plays a crucial role in the atherosclerotic process is commonly&#xD;
      observed in patients with diabetes mellitus and already prediabetes and has - amongst other&#xD;
      factors - been linked to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. Taken into account that&#xD;
      gliptins reduce hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic peaks by preventing inactivation of GLP-1,&#xD;
      which exerted beneficial effects on the endothelium in previous studies it is of major&#xD;
      interest whether therapy with gliptins improves endothelial function of the micro- and&#xD;
      macrovasculature and thereby might prove to affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      diabetic patients in the long term. The retina offers the unique opportunity to directly&#xD;
      visualize and investigate the microvasculature in vivo [10-14].&#xD;
