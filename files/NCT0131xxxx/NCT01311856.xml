      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked questions about your physical&#xD;
      activity to make sure you are eligible. If you are found to have any pre-existing medical or&#xD;
      dietary conditions that may prevent you from participating in this study, you will be asked&#xD;
      to have your physician complete a form about your health conditions. You will only be allowed&#xD;
      to participate in this study if he or she feels it is safe for you to engage in moderate&#xD;
      physical activity. After physician clearance, if applicable, you will be scheduled for study&#xD;
      visits at the Behavioral Research and Treatment Center (BRTC) at MD Anderson where you will&#xD;
      complete tasks to measure your physical functioning ability. Information about your cancer&#xD;
      and treatment history will be collected from your medical records as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the week before your first visit to the BRTC, you will complete the following tasks at&#xD;
      home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will wear an accelerometer and record your physical activities and exercise in a&#xD;
           daily diary. An accelerometer is a small device that you wear on your waist during the&#xD;
           day. It records how active you are. The accelerometer and diary will be mailed to you&#xD;
           ahead of time, and a study staff member will call you to remind you when to start&#xD;
           wearing the accelerometer and recording information in the daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires that ask about any usual physical activities you may&#xD;
           participate in, your health history, your quality of life, your social support, and your&#xD;
           confidence for changing your eating and exercise behavior. The questionnaires will be&#xD;
           mailed to you with the accelerometer and diary. You will complete the questionnaires at&#xD;
           home when you have time. These questionnaires should take you no longer than about 30&#xD;
           minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within a week of your first visit to the BRTC, you will complete 2 online &quot;24-hour diet&#xD;
           recalls&quot;, 1 during a weekday and the other on a weekend day. One of the diet recalls&#xD;
           will be done during your first visit to the BRTC and the other will be done at your&#xD;
           home. This involves completing an online questionnaire that asks about what you eat and&#xD;
           drink. You will report everything you have consumed in the last 24 hours (from midnight&#xD;
           to midnight). A study staff member will call you and tell you when to complete each&#xD;
           24-hour diet recall. Each phone call should last no longer than about 5 minutes,&#xD;
           depending on if you have any questions for the study staff member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will bring the accelerometer, daily diary, and completed questionnaires with you to your&#xD;
      first visit to the BRTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your first visit to the BRTC, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete any of the questionnaires that you may not have had time to complete&#xD;
           at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete 5 simple performance tests that are designed to measure your aerobic&#xD;
      function, lower body strength, upper body strength, agility (ability to move quickly),&#xD;
      balance, and endurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test your aerobic fitness, you will complete a 2 minute step test. You will step in&#xD;
           place. You must lift your leg up to midway between the knee and hip bone with each step.&#xD;
           Your goal is to complete as many steps as possible within 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test your lower body strength, you will complete a 30 second chair-stand test. You&#xD;
           will rise to an upright standing position from a fully seated position and then return&#xD;
           to a fully seated position. You will repeat this as many times as you can within 30&#xD;
           seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test your upper body strength, you will complete a timed arm-curl test. You will hold&#xD;
           a dumbbell in each hand and slowly curl your arm up towards your shoulder, then slowly&#xD;
           lower it until your arm is extended. You will repeat this with your other arm. You will&#xD;
           complete this as many as you can within 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test your agility and balance, you will complete the &quot;8 foot up-and-go test.&quot; For&#xD;
           this test, you will sit in a chair facing a cone that marks exactly 8 feet from the&#xD;
           chair. You will start the test sitting in the chair. When instructed to start, you will&#xD;
           stand up and walk as fast as you can around the cone (without running or hitting the&#xD;
           cone) and return to a fully seated position in the chair. You will repeat this test 2&#xD;
           times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, you will complete a 6-minute walk test to measure your endurance. To complete&#xD;
           this test, you will walk as fast as you can in an indoor hallway for 6 minutes. The&#xD;
           distance you walk will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study staff member will instruct you on how to complete each of these tests correctly and&#xD;
      safely. You will be given a chance to practice each test, except for the 6 minute walk test.&#xD;
      If you have any physical problem or condition that you think may interfere with completing&#xD;
      any of the tests, you should tell the study staff member right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, you will complete a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to evaluate&#xD;
      body composition. The DEXA scan exposes your body to radiation. The radiation you will&#xD;
      receive is about a 10th of the radiation of a chest x-ray. If you are female, you will be&#xD;
      asked if you are pregnant. If you state that you are not pregnant, you will receive the DEXA.&#xD;
      If you are not sure if you are pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test done. If you&#xD;
      are pregnant, you will not be able to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit to the BRTC should take approximately 2 1/2 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet and Phone Intervention Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed your first visit to the BRTC, you will be randomly assigned (as in a&#xD;
      toss of the dice) to either the internet-based intervention group or the phone-based&#xD;
      intervention group. Each intervention program will take 6 months to complete. Two (2) out of&#xD;
      3 participants will be assigned to the internet group, and 1 out of 3 participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to the phone group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the Internet Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given instructions on how to access the diet and exercise information online&#xD;
           (www.WalkingSpree.com) that will help you to monitor the amount of fat grams and&#xD;
           calories you eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will participate in a discussion group online that will be led by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be able to email questions directly to the study staff at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also receive personalized reports about your progress in meeting the diet and&#xD;
           exercise recommendations every 6 weeks by email from the study staff. This is to help&#xD;
           you to stay on track with the exercise and diet recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the Phone Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a fat gram and calorie counter to help you to monitor your eating&#xD;
           habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a binder of printed materials with information to help increase your&#xD;
           exercise behavior and eat a more healthy diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive 1 counseling phone call each week for the first 3 weeks, then 1 call&#xD;
           every 2 weeks for one month, and then 1 call each month for 4 months after that. Each&#xD;
           phone call should last about 15-30 minutes. The calls will be recorded and reviewed by&#xD;
           the research staff to make sure that the meetings are covering the program content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also receive personalized reports about your progress in meeting the diet and&#xD;
           exercise recommendations every 6 weeks by mail from the study staff. This is to help you&#xD;
           to stay on track with the exercise and diet recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a pedometer, which is a small device you wear on your belt that counts&#xD;
           the number of steps you take. You will need to wear the pedometer all day (from when you&#xD;
           wake up to when you go to sleep). You will need to record your daily steps either online&#xD;
           or in the binder, depending on which group you are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive resistance bands, which are long, flexible, rubber bands with handles&#xD;
           on each end that are used for resistance training. You will be given instructions with&#xD;
           pictures, either online or in the binder, that tell and show you how to use the&#xD;
           resistance bands correctly and safely. If you have any questions about using the&#xD;
           resistance bands, you should email the study staff or call the study counselor,&#xD;
           depending on which group you are assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a portion guidance plate, which you are asked to use while eating to&#xD;
           help you learn correct portion sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be provided with recommended goals for your exercise, diet, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have been on study for 14 weeks, questionnaires will be mailed to you to complete&#xD;
      at home and mail back to the study staff. The questionnaires will ask about your level of&#xD;
      physical activity, quality of life, and personal beliefs related to exercising and eating a&#xD;
      healthy diet. The questionnaire should take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete 9 online surveys before your intervention sessions while you are on&#xD;
      study. These surveys will ask for information about your exercise and eating habits, as well&#xD;
      as your personal beliefs related to changing exercise and dieting behavior. This information&#xD;
      will help the study staff to give program related information that is specifically designed&#xD;
      for you. The surveys should take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a second study visit 6 months after the first visit. During the week before&#xD;
      your second visit to the BRTC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will wear an accelerometer for a week, record your physical activities and exercise&#xD;
           in a daily diary, and complete the same questionnaires. The accelerometer, daily diary,&#xD;
           and questionnaires will be mailed to you ahead of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also complete 2 more online &quot;24-hour diet recalls&quot; within a week of your second&#xD;
           visit. A study staff member will call you and tell you when to complete each diet&#xD;
           recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will bring the accelerometer, daily diary, and completed questionnaires with you to your&#xD;
      second visit to the BRTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your second visit to the BRTC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete any of the questionnaires that you may not have had time to complete&#xD;
           at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure, weight, and waist and hip measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 5 simple performance tests and a DEXA scan (after testing negative&#xD;
           for pregnancy, if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for up to 6 months after your first visit to the BRTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
