    <textblock>
      Approximately 216, and up to 240, healthy males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old,&#xD;
      inclusive, will be enrolled over a 5-month period into this multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, controlled Phase I study. Subjects who meet the entry criteria for the study&#xD;
      and provide informed consent will be randomized 2:1 between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted&#xD;
      vaccine and placed into one of 6 groups (see table) to receive two doses of an intramuscular&#xD;
      subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg given&#xD;
      with the adjuvant AS03 or diluent (N=216, up to 240). All eligible subjects will receive 2&#xD;
      doses separated by approximately 21 days.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, Phase I study in healthy male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an intramuscular subvirion inactivated monovalent&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005) virus vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur&#xD;
      administered at different dosage levels (3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg) given with the AS03 adjuvant&#xD;

             first vaccination, or planned medication with analgesic or antipyretic in the week&#xD;

             receipt of Dose 1 that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or&#xD;
             appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere with&#xD;
             the evaluation of responses or is not generally seen in &quot;normal, healthy subjects&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received systemic, prescription medications for the treatment of chronic medical&#xD;
             conditions, unless such use is on a PRN (as needed) basis only since receipt of Dose&#xD;
             1. Non-PRN use of systemic, over-the-counter medications and PRN systemic,&#xD;
             prescription medication may be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they&#xD;
             pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of&#xD;
             immunogenicity/reactogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications;&#xD;
             vitamins; and contraceptives are also permitted.&#xD;

             such medication if the need arises. However, pre-medication is to be discouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or confinement for&#xD;
             danger to self or others since receipt of Dose 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New occurrence or new awareness of Guillain-Barré Syndrome since receipt of Dose 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved or continuing solicited or unsolicited Grade 2 or greater severity&#xD;
             adverse events, including reactogenicity events, that have occurred since receipt of&#xD;
             Dose 1 without a clear, alternative etiology. Unresolved or continuing Grade 1 adverse&#xD;
             events are permissible unless, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or&#xD;
             appropriate sub-investigator, they would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of responses or are not generally seen in &quot;normal, healthy&#xD;
             subjects&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade 2 or greater severity clinical safety lab values (according to the toxicity&#xD;
             table, Section 11.1.1.2) that do not return to Grade 1 or less prior to the second&#xD;
             vaccination. If the clinical safety lab values return to Grade 1 or less, vaccination&#xD;
             should be rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination - see&#xD;
             Section 10.3.3. Subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory&#xD;
             adverse event since receipt of Dose 1 should be excluded from receipt of second&#xD;
             vaccination. Subjects who had a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory adverse&#xD;
             event prior to first vaccination will be evaluated by the site principal investigator&#xD;
             and DMID Medical Monitor to determine receipt of second vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4&#xD;
             degrees F, within 3 days prior to the second vaccination. Vaccination of subjects&#xD;
             should be deferred until acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 100.4 degrees F, has resolved. If resolution occurs, vaccination should be&#xD;
             rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination - see Section&#xD;
             10.3.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emergence of Grade 2 or greater severity signs or symptoms since receipt of Dose 1&#xD;
             that could confound or confuse assessment of vaccine reactogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any new clinical findings since receipt of Dose 1, which in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would compromise the safety of&#xD;
             the subject or would interfere with the evaluation of responses or successful&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan to travel outside the U.S. in the time between the second vaccination and 21 days&#xD;
             following the second vaccination.&#xD;
