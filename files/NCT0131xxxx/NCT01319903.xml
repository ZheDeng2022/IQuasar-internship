  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel humanized monoclonal antibody CaCP29 was developed to control the inflammatory&#xD;
      response to various stimuli in humans and espacially during sepsis. Purpose of this phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial in healthy human males is to investigate various parameters concerning safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of CaCP29 and assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute inflammatory innate host response, as being present during the development of&#xD;
      sepsis and various other acute inflammatory diseases, represents a powerful mechanisms which&#xD;
      can lead to destruction of host tissue and severe organ dysfunction. CaCP29 was developed to&#xD;
      lower the complement mediated acute inflammatory response and thereby control the extend of a&#xD;
      strongly activated often times self-destructive inflammatory response by controlling&#xD;
      activation of a key inflammatory mechanism.&#xD;
