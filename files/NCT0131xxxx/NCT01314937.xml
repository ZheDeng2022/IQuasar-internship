  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, over 2 billion people suffer from worm infections in developing countries. These&#xD;
      infections are especially damaging to the health of children, resulting in both short-term&#xD;
      and lifelong disability. Older children with worm infections are more likely to be stunted,&#xD;
      underweight, vulnerable to other illnesses and perform poorly in school compared to&#xD;
      non-infected children. Large-scale deworming programs in school-age children are therefore&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO also recommends deworming of&#xD;
      preschool-age children (as of 12 months of age) in these areas; however, the benefits of&#xD;
      deworming, especially in the 12-24 month age group, have been inadequately studied. This&#xD;
      knowledge is urgently needed as studies show that all children have a similar potential for&#xD;
      healthy growth and development, provided that appropriate nutrition and health interventions&#xD;
      are given in the critical window of opportunity before the age of two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are proposing to undertake a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine the effect of deworming program for improving growth and development in children&#xD;
      between 12 and 24 months of age. Our results will provide solid rigorous evidence on if,&#xD;
      when, and how often, deworming should be integrated into routine child health care packages&#xD;
      provided by Ministries of Health in the 130 countries in the world where worm infections are&#xD;
      endemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, over 2 billion people suffer from worm infections (hookworm, Ascaris and&#xD;
      Trichuris, collectively referred to as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs)) in developing&#xD;
      countries. STHs contribute to the overwhelming burden of poverty and deprivation in areas&#xD;
      where adverse health, social, economic, education and other related factors predominate. STH&#xD;
      infection in childhood results in short-term and lifelong disability, including malnutrition&#xD;
      (e.g. underweight, stunting and wasting), cognitive impairment and increased susceptibility&#xD;
      to other infection, among others. Mass deworming programs in school-age children are&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO also recommends deworming of&#xD;
      preschool children (as of 12 months of age) in endemic areas; however, the benefits of&#xD;
      deworming on improving growth and development, especially in the 12-24 month age group, have&#xD;
      been inadequately studied. This knowledge is crucial because, with appropriate nutrition and&#xD;
      health interventions, all children have a similar potential for healthy growth and&#xD;
      development, provided that such interventions occur in the critical window of opportunity&#xD;
      before the age of two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this double-blind randomized controlled trial will assess the benefit of deworming&#xD;
      (mebendazole), integrated into routine child health care visits in a highly STH-endemic area&#xD;
      (Iquitos, Peru), on the primary outcome of weight gain. Timing, frequency and impact of&#xD;
      deworming will be considered. A total of 1760 children will be recruited at their routine&#xD;
      12-month check-up visit and randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: Group 1&#xD;
      will receive usual care and mebendazole (single dose 500 mg) at their 12-month visit and&#xD;
      usual care and a placebo tablet at their 18-month visit; Group 2 will receive usual care and&#xD;
      a placebo tablet at their 12-month visit and usual care and mebendazole at their 18-month&#xD;
      visit; Group 3 will receive usual care and mebendazole at both their 12-month and 18-month&#xD;
      visit; and Group 4 will receive usual care and placebo at both their 12-month and 18-month&#xD;
      visit. Usual care will consist of age-appropriate immunizations, supplements and other&#xD;
      Peruvian Ministry of Health-recommended interventions. All children will be followed up to&#xD;
      their 24-month visit and all will be given mebendazole at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcomes include length gain, motor and cognitive development and STH&#xD;
      prevalence and intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving child health is a priority area in global health research and a focus of the&#xD;
      Millennium Development Goals. Early preschool-age children are at the most critical stage of&#xD;
      growth and development and have been neglected in deworming programs. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      the results will inform evidence-based policy on the provision of an integrated health&#xD;
      package for young children in endemic areas and ultimately contribute to the reduction of&#xD;
      health inequities in this vulnerable group.&#xD;

    <description>Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection will be assessed from stool samples provided by participants.
