      To compare the efficacy of Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) to CyberKnife stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with locally recurrent hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) after TACE.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most deadly cancer in the world. It is primarily&#xD;
      seen in areas where hepatitis is endemic, such as Asia, but other risk factors include&#xD;
      alcoholic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain the only curative options. However, more&#xD;
      than 80% of patients present with unresectable disease. For these patients with unresectable&#xD;
      tumors, a variety of treatment options are available, including transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radioactive microspheres, microwave&#xD;
      coagulation, laser-induced thermotherapy, and percutaneous alcohol injection, all of which&#xD;
      have similar survival rates. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable HCC is a&#xD;
      relatively new treatment option made available because of significant improvements in&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging and radiation delivery techniques. Although follow-up is limited, results&#xD;
      show encouraging local control rates. Some investigators have combined TACE with fractionated&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy as a means of intensifying local therapy, with evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACE remains the dominant mode of local therapy for unresectable HCC. However, recurrence&#xD;
      rates are high. Because SBRT is rapidly becoming an accepted local therapy for hepatic&#xD;
      lesions, its role in treating HCC needs to be further defined. Moreover, once patients have&#xD;
      recurred after initial TACE, it is unclear if additional TACE will be as effective or if&#xD;
      another mode of local therapy such as SBRT would be preferable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a multicenter randomized study comparing TACE vs. SBRT using CyberKnife&#xD;
      for locally recurrent HCC. Locally recurrent HCC will include lesions that persist, progress&#xD;
      or recur minimum 3 months after initial TACE.&#xD;
