      This study seeks to determine the rate of thromboembolic complications (blood clots),&#xD;
      including death attributed to thromboembolic disease, when anticoagulation (blood thinner)&#xD;
      therapy is withheld from pregnant patients suspected of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after a&#xD;
      whole-leg compression ultrasound shows no DVT. Patients are followed for three months after&#xD;
      the ultrasound to determine if a blood clot is diagnosed during that time.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIM To determine the rate of thromboembolic complications (including death&#xD;
      attributed to thromboembolic disease) in pregnant patients suspected of deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) when anticoagulation therapy is withheld on the basis of a negative whole-leg&#xD;
      compression ultrasound examination (whole-leg CUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the leg is challenging due to the great variability&#xD;
      of clinical presentation and the lack of sensitivity of noninvasive tests. This is&#xD;
      particularly true for pregnant patients, who have been excluded from most major studies of&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies for DVT. Ironically, pregnancy is considered a major risk factor for&#xD;
      DVT, making evidence-based diagnosis in this patient group particularly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study performed at LDS Hospital, found that a single, whole-leg compression ultrasound&#xD;
      could safely exclude the diagnosis of suspected, symptomatic, first-episode deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis of the leg. A subsequent metanalysis of studies of the same technique confirmed&#xD;
      this finding, but observed that the utility of this strategy in pregnant patients required&#xD;
      further study, as only 57 of the over 4,500 subjects in the pooled metanalysis were pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, better information regarding the performance of diagnostic testing for suspected&#xD;
      DVT in pregnant patients is needed. If whole-leg compression ultrasound proves adequately&#xD;
      sensitive in this patient group, this will be a significant step in simplifying the&#xD;
      diagnostic process for deep vein thrombosis, and will confirm the diagnostic strategy most&#xD;
      commonly used presently by physicians at Intermountain Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective clinical cohort study (&quot;management study&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 268 sequentially-enrolled pregnant patients evaluated for suspected symptomatic deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis of the leg, reporting to the Intermountain Medical Center Peripheral Vascular&#xD;
      Laboratory. Vascular technicians will pre-screen patients for study entry with a simple&#xD;
      questionnaire. Those meeting screening criteria will then be interviewed by the study&#xD;
      coordinator to verify they meet inclusion criteria, have no reason for exclusion, and provide&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and medical history information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information relevant to the study will be obtained from the Study Coordinator&#xD;
      following informed consent during the initial study interview. Query of the Intermountain&#xD;
      Healthcare electronic medical record will also be performed at entry. Relevant information&#xD;
      will be included on a standardized Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent documents, Case Report Forms and relevant source documents from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record will be obtained, placed in a study binder and stored according to&#xD;
      the policies of the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research clinician will perform a brief clinical assessment, including adequate information&#xD;
      to calculate the LeFT clinical prediction score, which has been evaluated in a prior study.&#xD;
      Patients will then proceed to performance of whole-leg compression ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Testing for Venous Thrombosis Whole-leg CUS will be performed on all patients. A&#xD;
      standardized technique will be used for the CDU examination, which is identical to the&#xD;
      protocol used clinically by the Intermountain Medical Center Peripheral Vascular Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compressibility of the veins will be assessed. The results will be categorized as normal if&#xD;
      all imaged venous segments are fully compressible, as abnormal if a noncompressible segment&#xD;
      is identified, or as inadequate for interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the vascular technologist develops suspicion of isolated iliac DVT (based on absence of&#xD;
      phasic respiratory flow or complete absence of flow in the common femoral vein by Doppler,&#xD;
      but with normal compression) the referring physician and principal investigator will be&#xD;
      contacted immediately by telephone. Further evaluation (usually by an alternate imaging&#xD;
      modality) will be ordered at the discretion of the referring physician according to best&#xD;
      clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation will be performed by experienced vascular surgery staff according to protocols&#xD;
      currently in use at Intermountain Medical Center. Findings will be redacted to specific data&#xD;
      fields by the interpreting surgeon according to a form generated for this purpose, and&#xD;
      entered onto a Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interobserver variability will be limited by using a priori criteria for a positive and&#xD;
      negative study. Interobserver agreement for this technique has been found to be high in a&#xD;
      prior study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the result of initial whole-leg CUS is normal (no DVT identified), anticoagulation will be&#xD;
      withheld, regardless of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the result of testing is abnormal (DVT identified), the patient will be referred to the&#xD;
      treating clinician for usual management at the discretion of the clinician. This group will&#xD;
      not be followed for study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects whose results are classified as inadequate for interpretation will have reasons&#xD;
      logged and be excluded from analysis. They will receive further management according to the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up Patients with a negative whole-leg CUS will undergo three months of&#xD;
      clinical follow-up, a strategy used in many diagnostic trials for DVT.2 Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to return immediately to our emergency department if they have symptoms or signs&#xD;
      of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). A study clinician will assess them at 3 months by&#xD;
      telephone interview using a standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients contact the study team with symptoms suspicious for DVT or PE, they will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a study clinician in the Thrombosis Clinic (symptoms of DVT), or referred to&#xD;
      emergent care for evaluation (symptoms of PE). Participants' treating clinicians are also&#xD;
      free to obtain any medically appropriate diagnostic testing for suspected DVT or PE during&#xD;
      the follow-up period. A letter will be sent to referring physicians explaining the protocol&#xD;
      and emphasizing that any appropriate diagnostic testing for suspected DVT or PE may be&#xD;
      performed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up assessment, an interval history will be taken with emphasis on specific&#xD;
      symptoms (including leg pain, tenderness and swelling, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and&#xD;
      syncope), hospitalization, interval evaluation for DVT or PE and use of anticoagulants. For&#xD;
      all patients who die, the cause of death will be determined from autopsy or by independent&#xD;
      clinical review if autopsy cannot be obtained. If at follow-up a patient identifies symptoms&#xD;
      suspicious for DVT or PE that have not previously been clinically evaluated, they will be&#xD;
      scheduled for an in-person evaluation with a physician in the Intermountain Medical Center&#xD;
      Thrombosis Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to information obtained from the patient during the follow-up visit, a&#xD;
      comprehensive review of the patient's Intermountain electronic health record will be&#xD;
      performed to look for evidence of diagnostic testing for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism or use of anticoagulant medications. Additionally, the study coordinator presently&#xD;
      receives alerts of all positive diagnostic tests for DVT and PE performed in the facility&#xD;
      daily. This list will be reviewed for study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the follow-up assessment will be entered on a Case Report Form by study staff.&#xD;
      This form will be added to the study binder by the study coordinator and information appended&#xD;
      to the database by the data entry clerk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed to estimate the event rate of thromboembolic disease and death&#xD;
      attributable to thromboembolic disease in the normal cohort during the three-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. An exact 95% confidence interval that excludes a rate of VTE of 3% or greater will be&#xD;
      defined as clinically acceptable, in accordance with previous trials of DVT diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will report analysis of outcomes both on a per-protocol and intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis in the event of protocol violation (i.e. receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation despite&#xD;
      negative whole-leg ultrasound, without objective evidence of a thrombotic complication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of withdrawal of participation, affected subjects will be suppressed from&#xD;
      analysis (i.e. analysis will be performed on a per protocol basis), or in the event that&#xD;
      isolated iliac DVT is diagnosed following vascular technologist suspicion. Isolated iliac DVT&#xD;
      diagnosed after additional imaging resulting from technologist suspicion will be analyzed as&#xD;
      an additional outcome variable, and the rate of this diagnosis reported with a corresponding&#xD;
      exact 95% confidence interval. Use of intention-to-treat analysis could bias results of the&#xD;
      study in the case of withdrawn subjects as they would, by definition, not complete the&#xD;
      defined follow-up period and would not have ascertainment of the primary study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjudication of Outcomes A panel of three independent physicians with established expertise&#xD;
      in venous thromboembolism will be named to adjudicate all suspected events of DVT or PE, and&#xD;
      all diagnostic tests for these occurring during the follow-up period. Simple majority will&#xD;
      resolve disputes. All deaths will be adjudicated as to whether attributable to PE or another&#xD;
      cause by the same group of adjudicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological Issues and Avoidance of Bias Entering consecutive patients into the study will&#xD;
      avoid selection bias. To avoid bias during the initial testing period, we have established&#xD;
      pre-defined criteria for negative and positive studies. Further diagnostic testing on&#xD;
      patients with negative results will not be undertaken unless dictated by new or progressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients with a negative whole-leg CUS will not be treated and therapy will be&#xD;
      given to all patients with positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic suspicion bias will be avoided by objectively testing all patients who return&#xD;
      during follow-up with symptoms or signs suggestive of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism. Interpretation bias will be avoided by obtaining independent interpretation of&#xD;
      follow-up testing in patients with suspected disease by independent adjudicators. The&#xD;
      adjudicators will be blinded to the results of the initial ultrasound and the cohort to which&#xD;
      the patient belongs. All deaths will be independently reviewed. The adjudicators will be&#xD;
      blinded to the cohort to which the patient belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality will be maintained by keeping the patient identity log separate from&#xD;
      the database, which will use only unique numerical identifiers. Complete data tracking will&#xD;
      be assured by comparison of enrollment log and database by independent reviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for age, weight, height, trimester (weeks gestation), symptoms at&#xD;
      presentation (pain, tenderness, duration of symptoms), clinical conditions (recent surgery,&#xD;
      recent hospitalization, cancer, congestive heart failure, recent immobilization, cellulitis,&#xD;
      superficial phlebitis and family history of thromboembolic disease) and the LeFT variables&#xD;
      (including leg circumference) will be calculated to characterize the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The event rate of thromboembolic complications and death from thromboembolic disease will be&#xD;
      calculated for patients with negative whole-leg CUS; both per-protocol and by&#xD;
      intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of isolated iliac DVT detected after vascular technologist suspicion will be&#xD;
      reported as a separate calculation with corresponding exct 95% confidence interval&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sided confidence interval for the event rate (objectively verified venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism) will be calculated for the observation cohort by exact methods. If this&#xD;
      confidence interval excludes the commonly accepted threshold event rate of 3%, we will&#xD;
      conclude that the diagnostic strategy is clinically valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also describe the clinical characteristics of clots (e.g. venous distribution) and&#xD;
      other endpoints when those data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 268 patients who meet eligibility criteria was chosen so that an exact 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval would exclude an event rate of venous thromboembolism in the observation&#xD;
      cohort of 3%. Excluding an event rate of 3% is the commonly accepted standard by which&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies are deemed clinically acceptable.&#xD;
