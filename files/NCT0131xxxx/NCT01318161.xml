  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the industrialized world (12% of all&#xD;
      cancers). In Sweden, 6000 new cases of colorectal cancer are reported each year, and almost&#xD;
      half of these cases result in death. Several recently published retrospective studies show&#xD;
      that regional anaesthesia (RA) can reduce cancer-related mortality following surgical&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal, breast and prostate cancers and malignant melanoma. If these results&#xD;
      are true, then the choice of perioperative pain management is as beneficial, or even better,&#xD;
      than the current oncological therapies. This theory needs to be investigated in a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized and controlled trail.&#xD;

      An application was sent to the Regional Ethics Committee at the Linköping University Hospital&#xD;
      and the study was approved recently. Informed consent will be obtained from 300 patients (ASA&#xD;
      status 1-3) in the age group 40-80 years who are undergoing elective surgery for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. The exact type of cancer, its staging, degree of spread to proximal or distant sites&#xD;
      and the pathologic type of cancer will be recorded. Patients on chronic narcotic analgesic&#xD;
      medication, those with known immunologic diseases, those with known allergy to LA and those&#xD;
      where epidural catheter placement is contraindicated will be excluded. This study will be a&#xD;
      multi-centre study in Central Sweden. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated random number: Group E - Epidural anaesthesia (EDA) or&#xD;
      Group P - Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and surgery will be standardized, other than for group randomization. Surgical&#xD;
      management of patients in the hospitals will also be standardized. Postoperative parameters&#xD;
      will include pain intensity, rescue analgesic (morphine) consumption, surgical complications&#xD;
      (e.g., re-operation, surgical site infection, or bleeding), other perioperative complications&#xD;
      (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, cardiac complications, or chest infections), cancer recurrence&#xD;
      diagnosed by CT or MRI (done yearly over 5 years) and mortality, both cancer-related and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. In addition, blood will be taken preoperatively for analysis of the&#xD;
      following inflammatory and immunological markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF will be determined in peritoneal fluid and in serum during surgery. HIF-1A will be&#xD;
      determined by immunohistochemistry and microRNA measurements in normal and neoplastic colonic&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the microRNA mi21 will be analyzed in by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR&#xD;
      in colon adenocarcinomas and adjacent non-cancerous tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTC in whole blood (in 5-7.5 ml) will be measured with the CellSearch System, according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer´s instructions, and the Cell Tracks Analyzer II (Cristofanilli M et al. N&#xD;
      Engl J Med 2004:351:781-91).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory mediator assay-ELISA Patient serum or EDTA/Heparin plasma will be assessed for&#xD;
      cytokine levels by a Luminex multiplex assay (Human Inflammation 12-Plex kit; GM.CSF, IFN-g,&#xD;
      IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-a and VEGF from R&amp;D system) and PGE2&#xD;
      levels will be measured by an ELISA kit from Cayman Chemicals Company. In addition, markers&#xD;
      of systemic inflammatory response, including CRP, white blood cell count, differential count&#xD;
      and total platelet count, will also be measured before and after surgery.&#xD;
