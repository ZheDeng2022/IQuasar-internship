  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relation between bone mineral&#xD;
      density of lower limbs exposed to vibration and the muscle strength gain in the knee&#xD;
      extensors and flexors, and a relation serum sclerostin level and the muscle strength gain in&#xD;
      the knee extensors and flexors in healthy young adult women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty healthy young adult women are planned to include in this study. The participants&#xD;
      meeting the criteria were randomized into two groups: the training group (20 cases) and the&#xD;
      Control group (20 cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole-body vibration (WBV) training group will be trained on a WBV platform (Power Plate)&#xD;
      5 times a week for 4 weeks period. Participants will be asked to stand upright on WBV&#xD;
      platform. Training volume and training intensity will be low at the beginning but progressed&#xD;
      slowly according to the overload principle. The training volume will be increased&#xD;
      systematically over the 4-week training period. The training intensity will be increased by&#xD;
      increasing the amplitude (2-4 mm) and the frequency (40 Hz) of the vibration. The subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to report negative side effects or adverse reactions in their training diary.&#xD;
      In the Control group, sham stimulus will be performed by WBV platform 5 times a week for a 4&#xD;
      weeks period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma sclerostin level and, the right and left knee flexor and extensor muscles strength&#xD;
      will be measured before and after training period. Isokinetic torque will be measured with&#xD;
      the Biodex (Biodex System 3 PRO Multijoint System Biodex Medical Inc. Shirley/NY&#xD;
      USA)extremity-testing system. The right and left lower limbs bone mineral density (BMD) and&#xD;
      muscle strength will be measured before training period. The BMD will be evaluated by bone&#xD;
      densitometer (Norland XR-46 DXA, USA). Sclerostin levels will be measured by human sclerostin&#xD;
      ELISA kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest muscle electrical activity of right and left knee flexor and extensor muscles will&#xD;
      be evaluated at pre-vibration, post- vibration and, during vibration. The rest muscle&#xD;
      electrical activity will be measured by Powerlab (data acquisition system, ADInstruments,&#xD;
      Australia) device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. Vibration-induced bone formation is neuronally&#xD;
      regulated. Vibration can also effectively enhance muscle strength and power. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that vibration increases muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. Attempts to&#xD;
      explain vibration-induced increases in EMG activity were based on the tonic vibration reflex.&#xD;
      Tonic vibration reflex activates the muscle spindles, thereby enhancing the excitatory drive&#xD;
      reflex of the alpha motoneurons. On the contrary, it was shown that the vibration treatment&#xD;
      did not enhance the muscle spindle sensitivity and led to presynaptic inhibition of muscle&#xD;
      spindle group Ia afferents. As an alternative to tonic vibration reflex, the recently&#xD;
      described bone myoregulation reflex has been suggested to potentially explain the increased&#xD;
      muscle strength and electrical activity induced by vibration. Based on the bone myoregulation&#xD;
      reflex, bone is sensitive to mechanical stimuli and can send mechanical input signals to&#xD;
      central nervous system and so can neuronally regulate the muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cyclic mechanical loading to the bone stimulates the osteocytes. According to bone&#xD;
      myoregulation reflex, the more the osteocytes are stimulated by the cyclic mechanical&#xD;
      loading, the increase occurring in the muscle strength and activity may be more. The rate of&#xD;
      osteocytes stimulated by vibration may be determined with serum sclerostin level. Sclerostin,&#xD;
      the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine knot-secreted&#xD;
      glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Sost/sclerostin levels have been&#xD;
      reported to be reduced by mechanical stimulation.&#xD;
