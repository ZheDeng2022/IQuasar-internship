  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-grade gliomas are the commonest primary malignant brain tumours in adults, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 5000 people per year in the UK. Standard treatment comprises a combination of&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however this condition remains incurable and the&#xD;
      average survival is approximately 18 months from diagnosis. There are a number of reasons for&#xD;
      this. Firstly these tumours are highly invasive and involve important areas of brain making&#xD;
      it impossible to remove them surgically or cure them with radiotherapy. In the majority of&#xD;
      cases the tumour recurs within 2 to 3cm of the original site of tumour removal. Secondly, due&#xD;
      to the presence of a barrier between the bloodstream and the brain, when drugs designed to&#xD;
      kill tumour cells (chemotherapy) are given intravenously or orally, they frequently do not&#xD;
      reach the tumour at a sufficient dose to have a beneficial effect. As the chemotherapy dose&#xD;
      has to be very high for a sufficient dose to reach the tumour, drug-related side-effects are&#xD;
      common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies demonstrate that glioma tumour cells are sensitive to a number of&#xD;
      different chemotherapies, including carboplatin. When given intravenously however,&#xD;
      carboplatin does not reach a sufficient concentration in the tumour to have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect. However, studies have shown that carboplatin can be infused directly into the brain&#xD;
      at a concentration that is highly toxic to tumour cells, but not to normal brain tissue.&#xD;
      Using very small tubes implanted around the tumour, the investigators are able to infuse&#xD;
      carboplatin reliably and repeatedly into the area where tumours typical recur. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators intend to evaluate the safety of this approach and determine the optimal&#xD;
      dose of carboplatin to administer. It is hoped that this study will also provide evidence of&#xD;
      improved survival for patients with high-grade glioma.&#xD;
