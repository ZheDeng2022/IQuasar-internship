      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chronic leg ulcers are a complication of many blood disorders such as sickle cell disease,&#xD;
      thalassemia, and other red blood cell disorders. In these disorders, red blood cells break&#xD;
      down earlier than normal, which researchers suspect may cause or contribute to the&#xD;
      development of leg ulcers; however, the exact cause is unknown, and current therapies are not&#xD;
      very effective. Researchers are interested in determining if a research cream made with&#xD;
      sodium nitrite, a substance that is known to increase blood flow by dilating blood vessels,&#xD;
      may speed up the healing of skin ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of topical sodium nitrite cream as a treatment for&#xD;
      chronic leg ulcers in individuals with sickle cell disease or other red blood cell disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease or another red cell&#xD;
      disorder and have had a leg ulcer for more than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,&#xD;
           and an examination of the ulcer, including x-ray of the leg(s) with the ulcer and swabs&#xD;
           from the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be scheduled for a 5-day inpatient stay at the Clinical Center, with&#xD;
           the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1 and 2: Participants will have blood draws, a wound assessment, ultrasound of the&#xD;
           affected leg, imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging and infrared photography),&#xD;
           thermo-patch application to monitor temperature changes, measurements of blood flow in&#xD;
           the skin, and questionnaires about pain and quality of life. An optional skin biopsy may&#xD;
           also be conducted with samples taken near the skin ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3: Participants will have one ulcer treated with the topical cream. Frequent blood&#xD;
           draws will be conducted before application and then regularly for up to 6 hours after&#xD;
           application of the cream. Thirty minutes after the research cream is applied,&#xD;
           participants will have imaging studies of the treated leg and measurements of pain&#xD;
           levels and blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 4: Participants will have a blood draw and temperature recordings taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5: Participants will have the research cream applied and the same imaging studies as&#xD;
           before, and will be discharged for care at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the following 3 weeks, participants will come to the clinical center twice a week to&#xD;
           have the research cream applied to the leg ulcer and tests performed by the study&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the fourth and final week, participants will return for additional cream treatment&#xD;
           sessions, imaging studies, blood draws, and other tests as directed by the study&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participation will end in the following week (week 5). Subjects will come for a&#xD;
           final visit one month after the end of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Leg ulcerations have long been identified as a serious and debilitating complication of SCD&#xD;
      and even the first SCD patient described in North America in 1910 had leg ulcerations. The&#xD;
      prevalence varies, being low before 10 years of age, and in genotypes other than SS, and it&#xD;
      is influenced by geographical location, with an occurrence as high as 75 percent of SS&#xD;
      patients in Jamaica, and 8-10 percent in North America. The etiology of chronic ulcers in SCD&#xD;
      and other hemolytic disorders is unknown, mechanical obstruction by dense sickled red cell,&#xD;
      increased venous pressure, bacterial infections, abnormal autonomic control with excessive&#xD;
      vasoconstriction when in the dependent position, degree of anemia with decrease in oxygen&#xD;
      carrying capacity, and in situ thrombosis, have all been proposed as potential contributing&#xD;
      factors. Recent studies have reported increased incidence of leg ulcers in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. Our group has pioneered the notion of an association between the&#xD;
      hemolytic phenotype and leg ulcers. Current treatment options for leg ulcerations, including&#xD;
      antibiotics, compression bandages, dressing changes, Unna boots, silver and zinc oxide gauze,&#xD;
      skin grafts and maggot therapy rely mostly on bacterial containment, stimulation of&#xD;
      granulation formation and decrease of venostasis. Pathological changes in the&#xD;
      microcirculation associated with ulceration are not addressed. Nitric oxide metabolism has&#xD;
      been the focus of our branch research over the past several years. We know that it mediates&#xD;
      essential biological processes, including vasodilatation, wound healing, and angiogenesis and&#xD;
      has antimicrobial activity. Moreover, NO has an antiplatelet effect and influences several&#xD;
      growth factors involved in endothelial homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a Phase I study of a topical cream containing escalating doses of sodium nitrite,&#xD;
      a local donor of NO when in the presence of heme, as a novel approach to the therapy for&#xD;
      chronic leg ulcers in hemolytic disorders. The primary objectives are to evaluate topical&#xD;
      sodium nitrite cream s safety and tolerability in patients with sickle cell disease or other&#xD;
      hemolytic disorders and chronic leg ulcers and to determine the optimal concentration of the&#xD;
      study drug that is tolerated. Subjects will be treated at the Clinical Center for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefit will be a durable resolution or improvement of the leg ulcer. Possible side&#xD;
      effects include hypotension and methemoglobinemia, secondary to sodium nitrite absorption for&#xD;
      the ulcerated skin. Safety measures will be used and pharmacokinetics analysis of sodium&#xD;
      nitrite absorption in this setting will be obtained. As a secondary endpoint, we will study&#xD;
      the biology of leg ulcer formation in patients with hemolytic disorders, its pathological&#xD;
      appearance on a skin biopsy, and the role of microvascular changes in its formation and&#xD;
      (possibly) resolution. Sophisticated and novel studies of blood flow and temperature changes&#xD;
      during sodium nitrite application, as well as macrovascular appearance on MRI will allow for&#xD;
      a better understanding of ulcer formation. This may lead to novel approaches to the therapy&#xD;
      of ulcer in hemolytic and non-hemolytic disorders, such as diabetes and decubitus ulceration.&#xD;
