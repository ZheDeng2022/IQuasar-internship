  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with&#xD;
      Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) refractory to conventional treatment using a&#xD;
      randomised trial design with delayed start in one arm. Abatacept will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously to participants at a dose based on body weight at the screening visit followed&#xD;
      by six follow-up treatments (Active treatment arm). Abatacept will also be administered&#xD;
      intravenously to participants at a dose based on body weight starting at 3 months followed by&#xD;
      six follow-up treatments (Delayed-onset treatment arm). The International Myositis Assessment&#xD;
      and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) preliminary definition of improvement (DOI) will be used&#xD;
      for assessment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb pilot study with a randomised delayed treatment design. Half of the&#xD;
      patients will be randomised to treatment with abatacept from week 0 (Active treatment arm)&#xD;
      and half to start active treatment after 3 months (Delayed-onset treatment arm). The&#xD;
      open-label study will not include placebo, but the efficacy outcome assessors will be blinded&#xD;
      to treatment arm. The study will be conducted at three sites (Karolinska University Hospital&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden; King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS), London, United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK); and the Institute of Rheumatology Prague, Prague, Czech Republic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible between ages 18 and 80 years and must have active disease after&#xD;
      treatment with glucocorticoids (≥0.5 mg/kg/day for ≥1 month), in combination with at least&#xD;
      one other immunosuppressive drug, methotrexate (minimum dose 15 mg/week) or azathioprine&#xD;
      (minimum dose 100 mg/day) for at least 3 months. Concomitant methotrexate or azathioprine&#xD;
      will be allowed, with stable doses for ≥1 month prior to inclusion in the study. Active&#xD;
      disease is defined as persisting or worsening muscle weakness (Manual Muscle Test (MMT)-8&#xD;
      bilaterally &lt;150) or low endurance measured by Functional Index for myositis (FI-2) &lt;20% of&#xD;
      upper value,15 together with at least one other sign of active disease: elevated (above upper&#xD;
      limit of normal) serum levels of muscle enzymes, inflammation in a recent muscle biopsy (&lt;1&#xD;
      month) or on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings consistent with inflammation, or&#xD;
      active extramuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the number of responders, defined according to the International&#xD;
      Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) preliminary definition of improvement&#xD;
      (DOI),16 after treatment with abatacept for 6 months. IMACS DOI is defined as relative&#xD;
      improvement by ≥20% in three of any six core set measures, with no more than two core set&#xD;
      measures worsening by ≥25%, which cannot be MMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include the number of responders in the delayed-onset arm compared&#xD;
      with active treatment arm at 3 and 6 months, and the change in individual components of the&#xD;
      IMACS core set measures for disease activity and in the muscle endurance as tested by FI-2,&#xD;
      in the delayed-onset arm compared with active treatment arm at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

          1. Patients with definite or probable polymyositis or dermatomyositis diagnosed according&#xD;
             to the diagnostic criteria by Bohan and Peter (30,31).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For polymyositis a muscle biopsy is required that confirmed this disease (performed at&#xD;
             any time before the start of the study) and to exclude other conditions unless a&#xD;
             patient is positive for myositis specific or myositis associated autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Polymyositis will be included after a judicial process by the three PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inflammatory active disease based on persisting or worsening muscle weakness, MMT &lt;&#xD;
             150 or low endurance, FI -2 &lt; 20% of upper value together with at least one other sign&#xD;
             of active disease: elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes (CK, LD, ASAT, ALAT, above&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Malignancy associated myositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrolment or prior to start of study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of Child Bearing age who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to&#xD;
             avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for 10 weeks after the last infusion&#xD;
             of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,&#xD;
             hematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, ophthalmologic or&#xD;
             cerebral disease with the exception of those symptoms that are a manifestation of&#xD;
             polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Concomitant medical conditions that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator might place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a history of cancer within the last five years (other than non-melanoma&#xD;
             skin cell cancers cured by local resection). Existing non-melanoma skin cell cancers&#xD;
             must be removed prior to dosing. Patients with dermatomyositis need to be screened for&#xD;
             malignancies according to routine procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who have a history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse. Subjects&#xD;
             currently taking methotrexate who admit to consumption of more than an average of 1&#xD;
             alcoholic drink per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with any serious bacterial infection (such as pneumonia, other renal&#xD;
             infection and sinusitis), unless treated and resolved with antibiotics or chronic&#xD;
             bacterial infection (such as pyelonephritis and chest infection with bronchiectasis)&#xD;
             in the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with active tuberculosis requiring treatment within the previous 3 years.&#xD;
             Subjects with a positive PPD at screening will not be eligible for the study unless&#xD;
             they completed treatment for latent TB and have a negative chest x-ray at enrolment. A&#xD;
             PPD response that is equal to or greater than 10 mm should be considered a positive&#xD;
             test, although more conservative criteria may be applied as determined by the clinical&#xD;
             circumstance and investigator according to published guidelines and/or local standards&#xD;
             endorsed by the medical society. Quantiferon assay may replace PPD testing and&#xD;
             patients are excluded from the study if the test is positive. Quantiferon positive&#xD;
             patients who completed treatment for latent tuberculosis according to the local&#xD;
             guidelines may be considered for enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with herpes zoster that resolved less than 2 months prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with evidence (as assessed by the Investigator) of active or latent bacterial&#xD;
             or viral infections at the time of potential enrolment, including subjects with&#xD;
             evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Significant toxicities associated with concomitant or previous immunosuppressive&#xD;
             Therapy and anti-TNF therapy that would preclude subjects from participating and&#xD;
             completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with clinically apparent immunodeficiency syndrome, (IgA deficiency alone is&#xD;
             not an exclusion criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with any of the following laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hgb &lt; 8.5 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC &lt; 3,000/mm3 (3 x 109/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;
                  place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects previously treated with rituximab: B cell levels are less than lower limit of&#xD;
             normal as measured by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For all patients who have received prior rituximab, a normal CD19 B cell count must be&#xD;
             documented at the time of screening for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) syndrome (to minimize the risk of&#xD;
             including patients with high frequency of CD28 null T cells) that may not benefit from&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
