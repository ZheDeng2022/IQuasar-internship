  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the study is to explore the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab in combination&#xD;
      with dexamethasone (O-dex regimen) in patients with refractory/relapsed CLL. Moreover, the&#xD;
      hypothesis is that this approach will be able to achieve at least the same response rates&#xD;
      compared with R-dex regimens (historical controls; manuscript submitted to Leukemia), while&#xD;
      maintaining lower toxicity profile.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, phase II study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of ofatumumab added to dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be given for a minimum of 3 cycles, until the best response, or up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 6 cycles. After completion of the treatment phase in all patients, survival and&#xD;
      disease status assessments will be performed in 1 month post treatment, and then every 2&#xD;
      months for 3 years. The patient will be followed-up in the study for 3 years if there is no&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and schedule Cycle 1: Ofatumumab: 300 mg as an i.v. infusion on day 1 of the cycle&#xD;
      Ofatumumab: 2000 mg as an i.v. infusion on days 8, 15, 22; Dexamethasone: 40 mg/day p.o.,&#xD;
      days 1-4 and 15-18; Cycles 2 to 6 (cycles every 28 days): Ofatumumab: 1000 mg i.v. infusion&#xD;
      on day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the cycle; Dexamethasone: 40 mg/day p.o., days 1-4 and 15-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be assessed according to the IWCLL guidelines. The investigator assessment of&#xD;
      response and progression will be considered primary for all endpoints described in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by: adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall response rate (CR, CRi, PR rates)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity, tolerability, adverse events (these events will be assessed by investigator and by&#xD;
      the independent reviewers at the key time-points) Overall survival Progression-free survival&#xD;
      Time to response and duration of response Time to progression and time to next therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other/Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory molecular genetic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and pharmacologic markers&#xD;
