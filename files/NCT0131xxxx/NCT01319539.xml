  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage I-III breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess for a decrease in phosphorylated (phospho)-protein kinase B (Akt) (Ser^473)&#xD;
      levels in tissue after a pre-surgical trial of weekly MK2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) (2 doses)&#xD;
      in patients with operable invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effects of MK2206 on the immunohistochemical expression of other&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway biomarkers on pre-and post-MK2206 tumor&#xD;
      tissue, such as phospho-S6 kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling following MK2206 use with reverse-phase&#xD;
      protein microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore whether phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit&#xD;
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutations demonstrate different modulation of PI3K/Akt-pathway signaling as&#xD;
      compared to tumors with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore whether MK2206 alters PI3K/Akt pathway signaling differently in hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-negative tumors, as compared&#xD;
      to triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate whether tumor proliferation, as measured by Ki-67 staining of breast tumor&#xD;
      cells, is reduced in patients taking MK2206 pre-surgically and correlate Ki-67 modulation&#xD;
      with changes in PI3K/AKT signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine safety and tolerability of MK2206 in patients with early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To collect fasting blood for evaluation of predictive markers of drug effect, such as&#xD;
      markers in the insulin growth-factor receptor pathway (i.e., fasting insulin, c-peptide,&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-1, and IGF binding protein [BP]-1 and 3), as well as&#xD;
      modulation of phospho-markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days -9 and -2, and undergo segmental&#xD;
      resection or total mastectomy on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
