  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies demonstrate that patients have improved immediate recovery characteristics&#xD;
      following desflurane anesthesia compared to other volatile agents, including sevoflurane.&#xD;
      There is limited evidence in the literature to suggest that patients undergoing sevoflurane,&#xD;
      compared to desflurane anesthesia, may suffer from limitation in function and cognitive&#xD;
      ability for an undetermined, but prolonged period of time following surgery. These&#xD;
      differences are not explained pharmacokinetically and may be a result of a direct neurotoxic&#xD;
      effect of sevoflurane. An unresolved question is the time required for the ability to return&#xD;
      to complex tasks, such as driving, following anesthesia. Commonly, patients are advised not&#xD;
      to drive or make important decisions for 24 hours following anesthesia, but this is not&#xD;
      well-studied and proscribed on an empiric, rather than scientific, basis with very limited&#xD;
      data available.This study will better define recovery characteristics and characterize the&#xD;
      severity and duration of cognitive impairment following sevoflurane or desflurane anesthesia&#xD;
      after brief outpatient urologic surgery in elderly females using tests of cognitive ability&#xD;
      coupled with performance on a driving simulator and cognitive task tests to objectively&#xD;
      measure not only testing performance, but also cognitive effort in performing these tests.&#xD;

      Following IRB-approved consent, 60 patients were be randomized (63 patients to be enrolled&#xD;
      accounting for a &lt;5% screen failure and &lt;5% dropped patient rates) to receive either a&#xD;
      desflurane or sevoflurane-based anesthetic for pelvic floor repair. The selection of the&#xD;
      anesthetic gas (sevoflurane or desflurane) was determined by computer generated&#xD;
      randomization. Only the Anesthesiologist or the CRNA knows which gas has been administered to&#xD;
      the subject. All the investigators and the co-investigator who collected the research data&#xD;
      were blinded to the gas selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects were identified during the clinic visit in the Urology Department in&#xD;
      Hahnemann University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the surgery, the study investigator who is a medical doctor asked the&#xD;
      subjects to perform a baseline cognitive task tests to determine the baseline thinking&#xD;
      process. The detailed description of the cognitive task is as following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE): (10-15 minutes) This is a 30-item measure of global&#xD;
           cognition (Folstein, Folstein &amp; McHugh, 1975) that tests orientation to time and place,&#xD;
           object naming, repetition, attention, recall, and following complex commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trail Making Test Part A and Part B: Part A (3 minutes) of this measure (Army Individual&#xD;
           Test Battery, 1944; Reitan &amp; Wolfson, 1985) is a test of visual attention where the&#xD;
           subjects must draw lines on a page connecting 25 consecutive number as quickly as&#xD;
           possible. Part B (5 minutes) requires the subject to alternately sequence numbers and&#xD;
           letters randomly distributed on a page into their ascending and alphabetical order as&#xD;
           quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Digit Symbol Coding: (2 minutes) This subtest of the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997) consists&#xD;
           of nine digit-symbol pairs followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the subject&#xD;
           must write down the corresponding symbol as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R): (8 minutes) Memory for verbal information&#xD;
           will be assessed with this list learning task assessing immediate and delayed recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stroop Color and Word Test: (5 minutes) This test (Stroop, 1935; Golden, 2002) measures&#xD;
           cognitive control by asking subjects to suppress a habitual response in favor of an&#xD;
           alternate response. Participants are shown a word and asked to name the color in which&#xD;
           the word is written Total time expected for cognitive task tests is 28-33 min. If the&#xD;
           patients' were able to drive and have been driving for at least one year, they were&#xD;
           required to perform driving simulation. After performing the baseline cognitive task&#xD;
           tests, baseline driving simulation (15 minutes) on the driving simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline Cognitive Task Test and Virtual Driving Training session, the subjects&#xD;
      underwent their planned surgery. The selection of the anesthetic gas was determined by a&#xD;
      computer generated randomization list. The anesthesiologist or the CRNA in charge of the&#xD;
      subject administered anesthesia. The investigators and the subjects were blinded to the&#xD;
      anesthetic gas given. At the conclusion of the surgery, the anesthetic gas was shut down and&#xD;
      the co-investigator was called into the OR to document the time the subjects take to open&#xD;
      their eyes after the cessation of the gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 minutes after discontinuation of the anesthetic gas, the subjects were asked to repeat&#xD;
      the same sets of cognitive task tests (28-33 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      And, at 2 hours after the surgery, the subjects repeated the cognitive tasks test (28-33 min)&#xD;
      and the driving simulation (20 min) for patients who were able to drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next day of the surgery, the co-investigator had a telephone conversation with the&#xD;
      subjects who were discharged home after the surgery. Modified Telephone Interview for&#xD;
      Cognitive Status (TICS-M) was used to collect data (10 minutes). This is a 13-item telephone&#xD;
      interview (Welsh, Breitner, &amp; Magruder-Habib, 1993) for late-life cognitive assessment that&#xD;
      includes tests of orientation, attention, working memory, praxis, sentence repetition, naming&#xD;
      to verbal description, recent memory, word opposites, and an additional immediate and delayed&#xD;
      recall of a 10-word list. The subjects' participation in the study ended after this follow-up&#xD;
      telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were followed for the duration up to 28 hours. The follow-up and&#xD;
      participation in this study ended after 24-28 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, end of&#xD;
      participation or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 30 days.&#xD;
