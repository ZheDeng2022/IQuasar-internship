      The aim of the study is to assess the accuracy of real-time perfusion imaging pattern of&#xD;
      pancreatic focal lesions visualized by contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (CEH-EUS) for the differential diagnosis between chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer in a prospective multicenter design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with focal pancreatic masses evaluated by CEH-EUS and&#xD;
      EUS-FNA. The diagnosis is usually unknown in the moment of the initial evaluation, the&#xD;
      patients being included based on a suspicion of focal pancreatic masses after transabdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, CT or MR examinations. However, after a complete evaluation, a final diagnosis&#xD;
      will be reached based on the combination of EUS-FNA cytology/pathology, surgical pathology&#xD;
      and minimum 12 months follow-up.&#xD;

      Ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction with contrast specific imaging techniques are&#xD;
      increasingly accepted in clinical use for diagnostic imaging. The study of the pancreas is a&#xD;
      new and promising application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US), including&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS). The technique is not indicated to improve&#xD;
      the detection of pancreatic lesions, but to improve the delineation and differential&#xD;
      diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. One of the fluoro-gas-containing contrast agents used in&#xD;
      CE-US and CE-EUS is Sonovue®, which consists of phospholipids-stabilized bubbles of&#xD;
      sulfurhexafluoride (SF6). Sonovue® is isotonic, stable and resistant to pressure, with a&#xD;
      viscosity similar to blood. It does not diffuse into the extravascular compartment remaining&#xD;
      within the blood vessels until the gas dissolves and is eliminated in the expired air (blood&#xD;
      pool contrast agent). The safety profile of SonoVue showed a very low incidence of side&#xD;
      effects; it is not nephrotoxic and the incidence of severe hypersensitivity is similar to&#xD;
      other magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents. Moreover, Sono-Vue is approved for clinical&#xD;
      use in EU countries. The blood supply of the pancreas is entirely arterial, making&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced examinations feasible and readily available. Based on the European&#xD;
      Federation Societies of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines and recommendations,&#xD;
      updated in 2008, two phases were defined for CE-US and CE-EUS of the pancreas: an&#xD;
      early/arterial phase (starting from 10 to 30 seconds) and a venous/late phase (from 30 to 120&#xD;
      seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distinguishing pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other pancreatic masses remains challenging&#xD;
      with current imaging techniques. The specificity of the discrimination between benign and&#xD;
      malignant focal pancreatic lesions was found to be 93.3% using power Doppler&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced EUS (PD-CE-EUS) compared with 83.3% for conventional EUS. The hypovascular&#xD;
      aspect of lesions under PD-CE-EUS seemed highly sensitive and specific (higher than 90%) for&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma in several published studies. During PD-CE-EUS examinations the ultrasound&#xD;
      frequency returned to the transducer is the same with that transmitted, but the method is&#xD;
      associated with artifacts resulting from turbulent flow (flash and overpainting). At CE-EUS,&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma is typically hypoenhanced compared to the adjacent pancreatic tissue in&#xD;
      all phases. Furthermore, the lesion size and margins are better visualized, as well as the&#xD;
      relationship with peripancreatic arteries and veins. Focal lesions in chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      are reported to have similar or hyper enhancement features as compared to the normal&#xD;
      pancreatic parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dedicated contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS techniques (based on a low mechanical index) are&#xD;
      recently available in new EUS systems. The harmonic frequencies returned during CEH-EUS are&#xD;
      different from those transmitted by the transducer and are the result of non-linear&#xD;
      oscillations of the microbubbles. The image obtained is an addition of the signal created by&#xD;
      the distortion of the microbubbles and the tissue-derived signal. This can be optimized by&#xD;
      using low MI, which allows minimum bubble destruction and complete &quot;subtraction&quot; of the&#xD;
      tissue derived signal, obtaining a high resolution continuous real-time assessment of the&#xD;
      microvascularization during the contrast uptake period (real-time perfusion imaging). CEH-EUS&#xD;
      allows a more precise location of vascular structures within the parenchyma and focal&#xD;
      abnormalities, with better delineation of pancreatic lesions than EUS, especially in the&#xD;
      cases where air or fat causes artifacts and insufficient visualization of the pancreatic&#xD;
      parenchyma. An initial pilot study described an experimental technique of CEH-EUS based on a&#xD;
      linear prototype EUS scope, a low mechanical index (0.08 - 0.25) and a 2nd generation&#xD;
      contrast agent (Sono-Vue), which allowed the visualization of early arterial phase and late&#xD;
      parenchymal phase enhancement of the pancreas. Another pilot study demonstrated both&#xD;
      real-time continuous images of finely branching vessels of the pancreas and intermittent&#xD;
      homogenous parenchymal perfusion images, by using a radial prototype EUS scope, a low&#xD;
      mechanical index (0.4) and a 2nd generation contrast agent (Sono-Vue). Several other research&#xD;
      groups already reported the feasibility of CEH-EUS with low mechanical index. The&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 88%, 89%,&#xD;
      and 88.5% in one study and 80%, 91.7%, and 86% in the other study. However, the data is still&#xD;
      limited and a prospective, multicentric blinded study would certainly be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is prospective, blinded and multi-center, comparing contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CEH-EUS) results for the detection and characterization of&#xD;
      focal pancreatic masses, in comparison with the gold standard represented by pathology. The&#xD;
      study will be performed with the approval of the institutional board review of each center.&#xD;
      The study protocol will be uploaded on ClinicalTrials.gov, the registry of federally and&#xD;
      privately supported clinical trials conducted in the United States and around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is already approved by the ethical committee of the University of Medicine and&#xD;
      Pharmacy Craiova, Romania (attached). According to EFSUMB (European Federation Societies for&#xD;
      Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology) guidelines published in 2008, second-generation contrast&#xD;
      agents are also approved in the E.U. for ultrasound examinations, including liver and&#xD;
      pancreas examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a suspicion (clinical, US, CT/MR) of pancreatic masses should undergo EUS,&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS and EUS-elastography, as well as EUS-FNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS with EUS-guided FNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol of EUS with EUS-FNA should include linear EUS instruments with complete&#xD;
           examinations of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor characteristics (echogenicity, echostructure, size) will be described as well as&#xD;
           presence / absence of power Doppler signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS-FNA will be performed in all pancreatic masses with at least three passes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All examiners should be blinded for the results of pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEH-EUS procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A two panel image with the usual conventional gray-scale B-mode EUS image on the right&#xD;
           side and with the contrast harmonic image on the left side will be used, according to&#xD;
           pre-established presets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A low mechanical index procedure (dynamic wide-band contrast harmonic imaging mode) will&#xD;
           be used, with a mechanical index of 0.08-0.25 and corresponding powers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The starting point of the timer will be considered the moment of intravenous contrast&#xD;
           injection (Sonovue 4.8 mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CEH-EUS will be performed during usual EUS examinations, with the whole movie (T0-T120s)&#xD;
           recorded on the embedded HDD of the ultrasound system, for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to minimize human bias, all post-processing and computer analysis of digital&#xD;
           movies will be performed within the coordinating IT Center, with all programmers and&#xD;
           statisticians being blinded to the clinical, imaging and pathological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-elastography procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional EUS elastography movie of 30 seconds should be saved on the embedded HDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following settings will be used for EUS elastography: examination frequency is&#xD;
           usually set at 7.5 MHz, while preinstalled system settings are used in all patients:&#xD;
           reject (2), E-smoothing (2), persistence (3), and E-dynamic range (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final diagnosis The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be based on the clinical&#xD;
      information (history of alcohol abuse, previous diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus), as well as a combination of imaging methods (ultrasound, CT and EUS). At least&#xD;
      four criteria of chronic pancreatitis during EUS will be considered for the positive&#xD;
      diagnosis. The diagnosis of chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis will always be confirmed by&#xD;
      surgery or by a follow-up of at least six months used to exclude malignancy in the patients&#xD;
      that will not be operated on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive cytological diagnosis will be taken as a final proof of malignancy of the pancreas&#xD;
      mass. The diagnoses obtained by EUS-FNA will be further verified either by surgery or during&#xD;
      a clinical follow-up of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology samples obtained from duodeno-pancreatectomies or caudal pancreatectomies done with&#xD;
      curative intent, as well as microhistological fragments obtained through EUS-FNA biopsy will&#xD;
      be processed by paraffin embedding with usual colorations (haematoxylin-eosin), with&#xD;
      subsequent immune-histochemistry at the discretion of the participating centers pathologists&#xD;
      in order to exclude neuroendocrine tumors / pancreatic metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed-up for at least six months through clinical examination,&#xD;
      biological exams and transabdominal ultrasound, eventually with a repeat spiral CT / EUS&#xD;
      after six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All results will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
      Differences between the patients with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis will&#xD;
      performed by the two-sample t-test (two independent samples). Since this parametric method&#xD;
      makes assumptions about normality and similar variances, we will initially perform both the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk W normality tests and verify the equality of variances&#xD;
      assumption with the F test. In the case of the two-sample t-test, we will also perform the&#xD;
      non-parametric alternative given by the Mann-Whitney U test, since in some instances it may&#xD;
      even offer greater power to reject the null hypothesis than the t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since with more than two groups of observations it is far better to use a single analysis&#xD;
      that enables us to look at all the data in the same time, we will also perform the one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) method with the same baseline assumptions. A p-value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy&#xD;
      of CEH-EUS +/- will be determined in comparison with the final diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated number of patients included is at least 210, based on at least 10 centers with&#xD;
      at least 20 patients each, which will be enrolled in an 18 months period. The power analysis&#xD;
      was based on the following assumption: in order to use the powerful t-test for independent&#xD;
      samples, a sample size equaling 105 patients in each group is sufficient to provide 95%&#xD;
      statistical power to detect a difference of 5% in mean, for a type I error alpha = 0.05, and&#xD;
      the population standard deviation = 10%. The difference in mean was based on previously&#xD;
      published data which report an accuracy of approximately 80-85% for EUS-FNA, and 90% for&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced EUS.&#xD;
