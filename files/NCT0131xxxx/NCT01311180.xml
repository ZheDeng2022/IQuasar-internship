  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensoril - Extracts of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha in Ayurvedic Medicine) have shown&#xD;
      potent anti-stress, cortisol lowering, GABAergic, serotonergic and antioxidant properties in&#xD;
      animal and human studies. Furthermore, controlled, single site human studies have shown the&#xD;
      anxiolytic potential of WS extracts.The present study is a Phase II Double-Blind, Parallel&#xD;
      Group, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial of Sensoril® for Patients with&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Sensoril® for patients with moderate or greater severity of symptoms associated&#xD;
      with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Efficacy endpoint in this study will be determined by a statistically&#xD;
      significantly greater improvement from baseline to endpoint in total Hamilton Anxiety Scale&#xD;
      scores in the Sensoril® treated group versus those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints in this study will assess if Sensoril® treatment rather than placebo&#xD;
      results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Greater response rates (≥ 50% improvement in HAM-A total scores from baseline to last&#xD;
           value)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Greater remission rates (HAM-A total scores ≤ 7) at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Greater improvement from baseline to week 8 in HAM -A psychic and somatic anxiety&#xD;
           cluster scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Greater improvements on CGI - severity scores from baseline to last value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A higher percentage of subjects rated as &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; on the&#xD;
           CGI - Improvement subscale at the last value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels will be assessed between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
           These biomarkers are indices of stress and it is hypothesized that improvement in levels&#xD;
           of these stress indices will favor the Sensoril® treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patient reported outcomes for sleep and calmness will be assessed between the two&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoints will be determined by assessments of adverse and serious adverse events,&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs, EKG, and clinical laboratory measures. Clinical measures&#xD;
      with laboratory defined reference ranges and vital signs will be assessed.&#xD;
