    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a serious health problem that has increased dramatically&#xD;
      worldwide due to the high and increasing prevalence of obesity. Medical management of T2DM is&#xD;
      of limited success. Because not well controlled T2DM patients are in high risk of blindness,&#xD;
      cardiovascular accident and end staged disease, T2DM has become a major health burden for&#xD;
      society. Recent data on the relative effectiveness of gastrointestinal metabolic surgery&#xD;
      played as bariatric surgery in the remission of T2DM, suggests that it may be significantly&#xD;
      more effective than current medical treatment. In considering that less than half of the T2DM&#xD;
      patients can achieve satisfactory treatment goal under current medical treatment,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal metabolic surgery shall play an important role in T2DM treatment in the&#xD;
      future. However, the indication for metabolic surgery and clinical predictors of success are&#xD;
      not clear now. These clinical predictors can help us to choose appropriate not-well&#xD;
      controlled T2DM patients to receive metabolic surgery and reduce dverse health outcomes in&#xD;
      those patients.&#xD;

      The present research proposal is designed to assess the clinical predictors of success in&#xD;
      T2DM patients who receive metabolic surgery for the treatment of their diabetes. This study&#xD;
      will recruit 200 obese T2DM patients who receive gastrointestinal metabolic surgery in our&#xD;
      center and follow up them for one year. The Inclusion criteria are those with T2DM more than&#xD;
      6 months, age between 18 to 65 and HbA1C &gt; 8%. All the pre-operative clinical parameters will&#xD;
      be collected prospectively, including C-peptide and stimulated C-peptide. The genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism of these patients will also be analyzed and collected. The success of T2DM&#xD;
      remission will be assessed at 12 months after metabolic surgery will be composite endpoint of&#xD;
      CVD risk factor resolution; specifically, the proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt; 6.5%. The&#xD;
      clinical predictors will be analyzed by uni-vriate and muti-variate analysis. In the first&#xD;
      year project, we will included 100 patients and will include another 100 patients at the&#xD;
      second year. This project will apply for the budget of 1st year.&#xD;
