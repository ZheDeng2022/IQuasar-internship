  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major factor in the respiratory health of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) subjects is the prevalence&#xD;
      of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rate in CF&#xD;
      patients increases with age and by age 18 years approximately 85% of CF patients in the US&#xD;
      are infected. Liposomal amikacin for inhalation (Arikace™) was developed as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for chronic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo controlled study is to determine whether Arikace™&#xD;
      is effective in treating chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis subjects. The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects in clinics in the US,&#xD;
      Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Subjects will be randomized to 590 mg Arikace™ or&#xD;
      placebo and will receive treatment for 28 days followed by a 56 day safety follow-up period.&#xD;
      The subjects will be required to visit the clinic 8 times (including the Screening visit)&#xD;
      over a period of approximately 3 months. No overnight stays at the clinic will be required.&#xD;
      At the completion of the TR02-109 protocol, subjects who have consented and meet study safety&#xD;
      criteria may enroll in the long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study of 590 mg of&#xD;
      Arikace™ (under a separate protocol TR02-110).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from mutations in the cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Patients with CF manifest pathological&#xD;
      changes in a variety of organs that express CFTR. The lungs are frequently affected often&#xD;
      resulting in chronic infections by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and airway&#xD;
      inflammation. Treatment of chronic lung infections is one of the principal goals of CF&#xD;
      therapy. Arikace™ (liposomal amikacin for inhalation) is a sustained-release formulation of&#xD;
      amikacin encapsulated inside nanoscale liposomal carriers designed for administration via&#xD;
      inhalation. It is hypothesized that the sustained-release pulmonary targeting and biofilm&#xD;
      penetration properties of this formulation will have several advantages over current&#xD;
      therapies in treating CF patients with chronic lung infection caused by Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study has been designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of Arikace™ in treating CF patients with chronic&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 590 mg of&#xD;
      Arikace™ or placebo once daily using a PARI Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 28 days of treatment and will then be followed for safety for 56 days. Total study&#xD;
      duration is up to 102 days (~3 months) including an up to 18 day Screening period. Subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy bi-weekly throughout the study.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Arikace™ in blood, sputum and 24-hour urine will be determined in a&#xD;
      subgroup of study subjects who consent to PK evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the TR02-109 protocol, subjects who have consented and meet study safety&#xD;
      criteria may enroll in the long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study of 590 mg of&#xD;
      Arikace™ (under a separate protocol TR02-110).&#xD;
