      Introduction Kikuchi's disease (KD) is a histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis that was&#xD;
      described for the first time in Japan in 1972 almost simultaneously by Kikuchi and&#xD;
      Fujimoto1-2. KD is a self-limited necrotizing lymphadenitis and occurs predominantly in&#xD;
      females between 20 and 30 years old. Its main presentation is cervical lymphadenopathy. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of KD is based on clinical manifestation, fine-needle aspiration cytology or&#xD;
      excision biopsy. The pathological characteristics include patchy paracortical&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytic aggregates with variable karyorrhexis and absence of granulocytic&#xD;
      infiltration. Antibiotics are not helpful symptoms remit within six months spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As KD is a benign and self-limiting disease, proper diagnosis may help avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      treatment. KD can be easily confused clinically, pathologically, and radiologically with&#xD;
      malignant lymphadenopathy, especially lymphoma. Several reports have described the CT&#xD;
      characteristics of KD3-4, including enlarged, multiple lymph nodes that are homogeneously&#xD;
      enhanced without evidence of gross necrosis. The CT appearance of Kikuchi's disease may be&#xD;
      variable, thus mimicking lymphoma4. In previous work, the ultrasound appearance of KD has not&#xD;
      been well-described and has been compared to lymphoma. In this study, we compared the&#xD;
      sonographic characteristic of Kikuchi's disease and malignant lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods From November 2007 to September 2009, sonograms of twelve case notes&#xD;
      with pathological diagnoses of Kikuchi's disease and twelve patients with malignant lymphoma&#xD;
      were studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sonograms were performed by the same sinologist (L-J Liao) using an ATL HDI 5000 with a&#xD;
      high-resolution 7.5- to 12-MHz real-time linear-array transducer (Philips Ultrasound,&#xD;
      Bothell, WA, USA). Morphological US parameters were thoroughly evaluated and recorded on the&#xD;
      Marosis PACS system (Marotech Inc., Seoul, South Korea). The lengths of short and long axes&#xD;
      of enlarged lymph nodes were measured and recorded. The shape of the lymph node was&#xD;
      determined by the short axis to long axis ratio (S/L ratio). The nodal border was assessed&#xD;
      for sharpness. Echogenicity of the lymph nodes was compared with that of adjacent muscles.&#xD;
      Swelling of the surrounding tissues that presented with hyperechoic rims was assessed. The&#xD;
      nodes were considered matted when a number of lymph nodes were clustered together. The&#xD;
      internal architecture of lymph nodes was examined for the presence of heterogeneous&#xD;
      micronodular pattern or reticulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test and X 2 test were used to calculate the significance of the difference in&#xD;
      gray-scale features. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to calculate the significance of the&#xD;
      difference in nodal size and short- to long-axis ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suppose that basic ultrasonographic characteristics (size, shape, rims, matting, and&#xD;
      micronodular echotexture) help in the differentiation of cervical lymph nodes in patients&#xD;
      with Kikuchi's disease and lymphoma. A precise diagnosis of KD is possible avoiding&#xD;
      unnecessary biopsies or aggressive treatment.&#xD;
