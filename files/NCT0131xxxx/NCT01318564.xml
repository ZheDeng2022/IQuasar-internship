      The goal of this clinical research study is to test an investigational type of packaging for&#xD;
      diabetes drugs called &quot;unit-dose packaging.&quot; Researchers want to learn if unit-dose packaging&#xD;
      can help patients with Type II diabetes to take their drugs on the proper schedule.&#xD;

      Study Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people find it difficult to take drugs on the proper schedule. For this reason,&#xD;
      researchers want to learn if a different kind of drug packaging can help patients take their&#xD;
      drugs more easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In unit-dose packaging, each pill is packaged in its own plastic bubble (called a &quot;blister&quot;)&#xD;
      on a package that has a calendar on it. This is designed to make it easier to keep track of&#xD;
      when the pills should be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will keep taking the same&#xD;
      drugs that you are taking now. You will also keep taking those drugs on the same schedule&#xD;
      that your doctor prescribed. The specific &quot;study drugs&quot; you may be taking are metformin,&#xD;
      lisinopril, enalapril, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You have an equal&#xD;
      chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive their study drugs in unit-dose packages (also called &quot;reminder blister&#xD;
      packages&quot;) from Visit 1 to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive their study drugs in pill bottles from Visit 1 to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection on Pill Usage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are electronic sensors on each blister package and pill bottle. If you are using&#xD;
      blister packages (Group 1), the sensors will record the dates and times that you remove pills&#xD;
      from the blisters. If you are using pill bottles (Group 2), the sensors will record the dates&#xD;
      and times that you open the bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that you do not remove the pills too early before your dose (for example, the&#xD;
      night before), so that the proper time is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should return the empty blister packages or bottles to the clinic at each study visit.&#xD;
      When you return the empty packaging, researchers will be able to collect the data that the&#xD;
      sensors recorded (times and dates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 and after Month 3, you will complete a questionnaire. It includes questions about&#xD;
      your overall health, daily activities, and moods. There are also questions about how you take&#xD;
      your drugs and how you feel about your diabetes drugs such as metformin. This questionnaire&#xD;
      should take about 30-45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will record the results of your routine blood sugar level tests performed on Day&#xD;
      1 and after Month 3. Researchers will also record the results of your routine cholesterol&#xD;
      level blood tests on Day 1 and after Month 3. The purpose is to learn how the drugs may&#xD;
      impact your health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit your blood pressure will be measured 3 times. This will take about 15 min. If&#xD;
      your questionnaire responses show that you may be having emotional difficulties or&#xD;
      depression, you will receive contact information for the counseling staff in case you would&#xD;
      like to speak with a counselor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Databases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your questionnaire and blood test data will be kept confidential and will only be used for&#xD;
      this study. The same is true for the pill/package usage data recorded by the electronic&#xD;
      sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be entered into password-protected databases. In the databases, your name&#xD;
      and other identifying information will not be used. Instead, your study identification (ID)&#xD;
      number will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaire after Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Unit-dose packaging is an FDA-approved type of packing for&#xD;
      certain other drugs. At this time and for these particular drugs, unit-dose packaging is only&#xD;
      being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
