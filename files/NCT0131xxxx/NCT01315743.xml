      The goal of this exploratory pilot study was to develop and test the acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of an innovative alternative high school-based intervention to prevent further&#xD;
      weight gain and/or promote weight loss among a sample of ethnically and economically diverse&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

      The goal of this exploratory pilot study was to develop and test the acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of an innovative alternative high school-based intervention to prevent further&#xD;
      weight gain and/or promote weight loss among a sample of ethnically and economically diverse&#xD;
      adolescents. The proposed study will use a group randomized trial design and target boys and&#xD;
      girls, ages 15-20 years old, attending six alternative high schools in the Minneapolis-St&#xD;
      Paul metropolitan area. Alternative high schools are public or private schools that offer a&#xD;
      nontraditional educational experience for at-risk students, such as dropouts, expelled&#xD;
      students, truants and hard to reach learners who have not succeeded in regular school&#xD;
      systems. Although low levels of physical activity (PA) and unhealthy dietary practices,&#xD;
      behaviors regarded as a primary cause of the overweight/obesity epidemic among youth, are&#xD;
      prevalent among teens attending alternative schools, school-based programs targeting these&#xD;
      behaviors have not been tested and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three schools were randomized to the intervention/treatment condition and three schools to a&#xD;
      minimal intervention/comparison condition. Social Cognitive Theory and ecological theory&#xD;
      provided the theoretical basis for the multi-component intervention, which included 1) a&#xD;
      classroom-based experiential curriculum that incorporated school, family and community-linked&#xD;
      activities to promote physical activity, healthy eating and limited television viewing, 2)&#xD;
      environmental modifications of food and beverage offerings and physical activity&#xD;
      opportunities at school and 3) a teacher-guided, youth-directed health advisory council to&#xD;
      promote and support physical activity, healthy eating and limited television viewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student and school-level measurements were taken at baseline, 6 months post randomization and&#xD;
      at the completion of the 18 month intervention. Student-level measures included a&#xD;
      self-administered psychosocial survey, the 3-day Previous Day Physical Activity Report and&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels of students as measured by an Actigraph&#xD;
      accelerometer. School-level measures assessed the availability of physical activity&#xD;
      opportunities and healthy foods at school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adolescents attending alternative high schools will report high participation&#xD;
      rates and a high degree of satisfaction with a multi-component school-based intervention&#xD;
      targeting students' PA, diet and TV viewing practices.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because this research is a group randomized trial, eligibility criteria were based&#xD;
        primarily on school characteristics rather than student characteristics. Schools eligible&#xD;
        for recruitment were required to: 1) identify as either an area learning center (ALC),&#xD;
        alternative learning program (ALP) or contracted alternative, 2) be open year around (a&#xD;
        requirement for all state ALCs; an option for ALPs), 3) enroll 11th and 12th grade&#xD;
        students, 4) project a September 2006 enrollment of 75 students, 5) require student&#xD;
        attendance on campus at least 10 hours/week and 6) have access to an indoor facility for&#xD;
        physical activity. Therefore, all students attending a participating school were eligible&#xD;
        to take part in the study and exclusion will occur only in case of parental or student&#xD;
        denial of consent. Students and parents/guardians of students who were not fluent in&#xD;
        English were not included in measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Alternative programs that serve primarily pregnant and disabled teens&#xD;
        or function exclusively as day treatment programs for juvenile offenders were not eligible&#xD;
        to participate in this study.Students and parents/guardians of students who were not fluent&#xD;
        in English were not included in measurement.&#xD;
