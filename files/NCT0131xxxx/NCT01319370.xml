    <textblock>
      The current study aims to show efficacy of twice daily application of 5% Minoxidil Topical&#xD;
      Foam (MTF) formulation compared to placebo in the temple region of male patients with&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia after 24 weeks as well as to gain long-term data on the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of 5% MTF in male subjects with AGA in temple and vertex region, over a period of 2&#xD;
      years. Objective and subjective efficacy measures will be compared to baseline. Moreover, all&#xD;
      patients will get the equal treatment and measurements in the vertex region to enable&#xD;
      comparison of the efficacy of 5% Minoxidil Topical Foam in the temples not only to baseline&#xD;
      but also to vertex region. Additionally safety assessments will be performed throughout the&#xD;
      whole study.&#xD;
