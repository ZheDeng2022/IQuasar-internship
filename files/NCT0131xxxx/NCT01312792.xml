      The investigators Study Hypothesis is introduction of modified IMCI guideline for managing&#xD;
      severe pneumonia in first level health facilities will result in 40% increase in the&#xD;
      appropriate management (appropriate case management at the first level facility and referral&#xD;
      compliance by the caregivers) of severe pneumonia cases in the intervention arm compared to&#xD;
      the comparison arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMCI was implemented in Bangladesh in 2001. Bangladesh adapted the generic IMCI clinical&#xD;
      guidelines which recommend that children with one or more danger signs, or any other severe&#xD;
      condition, as identified by the health worker of the first level facility will be referred&#xD;
      urgently. Although the quality of care achieved in ten IMCI facilities in Matlab, Bangladesh&#xD;
      was assessed as high ( El Arifeen 2004) the rates of compliance with referral found to be&#xD;
      low. In 2002-03 the compliance rates were less than 37% and had decreased to 17% by the end&#xD;
      of 2003 (El Arifeen S, unpublished data). In many settings, children who are referred do not&#xD;
      actually attend hospital, which severely limits their appropriate care. This is mainly&#xD;
      because the higher level facilities are geographically inaccessible; financial and social&#xD;
      constraints also prevent care givers to comply with the referral advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Govt of Bangladesh is presently planning to modify the current IMCI guideline. The&#xD;
      modified guideline recommends that treatment of all severe pneumonia cases without danger&#xD;
      signs unless there is another severe classification will be done at the first level facility.&#xD;
      In 2004 the Govt. of Bangladesh in collaboration with ICCDR,B carried out a pilot study in&#xD;
      rural Bangladesh (Chowdhury, El Arifeen et al. 2008) to assess the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a modified IMCI clinical management guideline for children with severe pneumonia aged&#xD;
      2months - 5 years. The study concluded that appropriate management of severe pneumonia at&#xD;
      local level could not only save lives but represent a major cost decrease through reduction&#xD;
      of referral, treatment and admission costs. Another research conducted in Pakistan, a&#xD;
      randomized equivalency trial revealed that community management of pneumonia through home&#xD;
      treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin was just as effective as current hospital based&#xD;
      treatments for severe pneumonia (Hazir et al. 2008). Although all of these findings are very&#xD;
      encouraging, none of the study really focused on the immediate outcomes of the IMCI such as&#xD;
      improved care seeking, adherence of the health providers and household caregivers to the&#xD;
      algorithmic protocol and understanding the barriers and facilitators to the use of this&#xD;
      protocol. Moreover, these studies were conducted in controlled research settings and&#xD;
      therefore do not provide adequate understanding of the challenges and potential of&#xD;
      implementing IMCI in routine health systems. So there is need to carry out research in actual&#xD;
      community settings to understand what components of this modified guideline will work in&#xD;
      'real life situations' taking into account all the challenges and constraints faced by health&#xD;
      systems of developing countries like Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of our study are to assess adherence of service providers to the&#xD;
      modified IMCI guideline for managing severe pneumonia among under-5 children and care-givers'&#xD;
      compliance with referral advice given by the health providers after initial care-seeking for&#xD;
      under-5 children with severe pneumonia. The secondary objectives will be to measure the&#xD;
      resulting changes in the care-seeking pattern for childhood pneumonia due to the introduction&#xD;
      of modified IMCI guideline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two MNCS programme upazilas will be purposively selected for this study in consultation with&#xD;
      GoB and partners. The likely districts from where the two upazilas will be selected are&#xD;
      Sherpur and Gopalganj. Twenty unions (average population of about 20,000) will be identified&#xD;
      from the selected upazilas and randomly assigned to intervention or comparison arms. The&#xD;
      intervention and evaluation will continue for 15 months. This will be a cluster randomized&#xD;
      trial. Of the 20 selected study unions, 10 unions will be randomly assigned to intervention&#xD;
      and 10 to comparison, that is, about 200,000 population (~40,000 households) in each arm.&#xD;
      Each geographically delimited union has a Union Health and Family Welfare Centre (UHFWC) and&#xD;
      family welfare centre (FWC), servicing the population residing within it. Health providers on&#xD;
      the intervention arm will be trained regarding modification in the IMCI guideline. The&#xD;
      training will not address any other aspect of the IMCI Training. Training on standard IMCI&#xD;
      guideline will only be given to the health providers of both the arms, if not received&#xD;
      before. Figure 1 (source: Chowdhury et al 2008) describes the modified and standard IMCI&#xD;
      guideline. Under the modified guideline a sick child aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia&#xD;
      should be referred only if it accompanies with danger signs, stridor or any other sign or&#xD;
      symptoms of other severe classification. All other children with severe pneumonia should be&#xD;
      treated at the first level health facility with oral antibiotic (amoxicillin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unions belonging to the comparison arm will continue following the standard IMCI&#xD;
      guideline. To measure the outcome of the interventions, the study will involve the following&#xD;
      methods: Health facility survey including health providers' survey; extraction and review of&#xD;
      health facility service records for provider compliance; routine surveillance for collection&#xD;
      of information on care-seeking for childhood pneumonia; tracking and structured interview of&#xD;
      severe pneumonia cases seen at facilities Details of the MNCS intervention package and&#xD;
      delivery systems can be found in Annex I. All the MNCS upazilas have also already implemented&#xD;
      facility-based IMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs in the study protocol are listed drugs of Bangladesh Government. The Study will&#xD;
      ensure adequate and timely supplies of all drugs and other minimum essential logistics in all&#xD;
      health facilities in the study area. The health facilities will be monitored on an ongoing&#xD;
      basis by field supervisors, who will visit each facility once a month.&#xD;
