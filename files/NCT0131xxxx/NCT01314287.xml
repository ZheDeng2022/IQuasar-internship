    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia causes small areas of lung to collapse (referred to as atelectasis) and&#xD;
      many strategies are used to prevent or reverse this, but these strategies only temporarily&#xD;
      improve lung function and do not persist into the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) where&#xD;
      atelectasis may still be present. One possible explanation for this is that coughing&#xD;
      occurring at the end of the anaesthesic may cause atelectasis to occur. Over 70% of patients&#xD;
      cough when their breathing tube is removed as they emerge from the anaesthetic, and our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the presence of the breathing tube prevents a normal cough from occurring&#xD;
      and may worsen atelectasis. This study will use alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2)as&#xD;
      a measure of how well the lungs are oxygenating the blood. This will be measured 30 minutes&#xD;
      before the end of the anaesthetic as a control measure of the patient's lung function, and&#xD;
      again 60 minutes after the patient has woken up, and the change compared with the amount of&#xD;
      coughing observed as the patient emerges from the anaesthetic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study which hopes to answer the question of whether the amount of&#xD;
      coughing that occurs when a patient emerges from anaesthesia has a negative impact on the&#xD;
      ability of the lung to transfer oxygen to the blood in the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU).&#xD;
      The patients' involvement starts 45 minutes before the anticipated end of surgery when a&#xD;
      standard lung recruitment manoevre will be performed. Fifteen minutes later a 2ml blood&#xD;
      sample is taken from the arterial catheter which was placed at the beginning of surgery. From&#xD;
      this, together with routinely monitored clinical data, the alveolar/arterial oxygen&#xD;
      difference (AaDO2) is calculated. The AaDO2 is used as a measure of the degree of impairment&#xD;
      of the lung's ability to fully oxygenate the blood. Next, as the patient wakes up from the&#xD;
      anaesthesia, an observer (who is not involved in the clinical care of the patient) will&#xD;
      record the amount of coughing that occurs. Assessment of coughing will involve recording:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time spent coughing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of coughs before and after removing the breathing tube Postoperative care&#xD;
           will be routine with oxygen given as required. 1 hour after removal of the tracheal tube&#xD;
           a second arterial blood sample is taken from the arterial catheter whilst the patient is&#xD;
           breathing 40% oxygen and once again the AaDO2 is calculated. Following the second blood&#xD;
           sample the subject's involvement with the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation no stipulations are made regarding the anaesthetic technique to be used,&#xD;
      which is left entirely at the discretion of the anaesthetist with clinical responsibility for&#xD;
      the patient. In the last 30 minutes of the operation, the patient's artificial ventilation&#xD;
      will be with an oxygen concentration of 40% and a set 'positive end expiratory&#xD;
      pressure'(PEEP). Other than that, anaesthetists will be free to wake the patient up by their&#xD;
      own preferred method. Also, if at any time the responsible anaesthetist feels the adjustment&#xD;
      of the ventilation is required in order to act in the patient's best interest, the patient&#xD;
      will be removed from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded will include sex, age, ASA grade (a measurement of the patients' fitness&#xD;
      for an anaesthetic), height and weight, whether or not the patient is a smoker and whether&#xD;
      the patient has any lung disease. At the end of surgery, the operation performed and its&#xD;
      duration will be recorded. These data are required to characterise the population of patients&#xD;
      studied and allow comparison with other research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No medication or perioperative treatment need be withheld or modified as a consequence of the&#xD;
      patient being enrolled in the study. There is no requirement for starting any addition&#xD;
      medication as a consequence of the study. Patients may withdraw at any time by withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, in which case all subject data will be destroyed and only the fact that consent was&#xD;
      withdrawn will be documented. The anaesthetist with clinical responsibility for the patient&#xD;
      may withdraw the patient from the study at any time, in which case the reason for withdrawal&#xD;
      will be documented on the data collection form and any data collected will be kept until&#xD;
      study completion.&#xD;
