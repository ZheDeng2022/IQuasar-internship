  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Algisyl-LVR™ device. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate Algisyl-LVR™ employed as a method of left ventricular&#xD;
      augmentation and restoration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Algisyl-LVR™ will be&#xD;
      injected into the myocardium under direct visualization during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the concept that direct mid left ventricular (LV) intramyocardial&#xD;
      injections of Alginate hydrogel implants into the free wall of the failing LV will reduce LV&#xD;
      size, restore LV shape, lower LV wall stress and improve global LV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Efficacy Endpoint of the study is the change in Peak VO2 (maximum oxygen uptake)&#xD;
      from baseline to 6 months of follow-up. The Primary Safety Endpoint of the study is to&#xD;
      estimate the 30 day mortality associated with the implantation of the Algisyl-LVR device&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that there is a statistically significant difference in change&#xD;
      in Peak VO2 from baseline to 6 month follow-up when the medically managed arm is compared to&#xD;
      the Algisyl-LVR arm, i.e. the Algisyl LVR arm is superior to medical management.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group evaluation of the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of Algisyl-LVR in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic&#xD;
      origin. The evaluation for primary efficacy endpoint (Peak VO2) at 6 months will be&#xD;
      investigator-blinded. The primary safety endpoint, while not blinded, is 30 day all-cause&#xD;
      mortality and an objective assessment. The remaining study endpoints will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of the device through the evaluation of functional, structural, biochemical, and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic evaluations at 6 and 12 months. Evaluation of adverse events and these&#xD;
      assessments will also provide evidence of the safety profile of the device in patients with&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-enrollment baseline patient evaluation will include clinical assessment, assessment of&#xD;
      New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, blood tests, chest x-ray,&#xD;
      echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing, submaximal exercise testing, and quality of life assessments. Blinded&#xD;
      central evaluation will be performed for measures of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, blood&#xD;
      tests, Holter Monitors and cardiac imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written patient informed consent has been obtained and verification of eligibility,&#xD;
      patients who meet the selection criteria will be randomized. All patients must be on stable,&#xD;
      evidence-based therapy for heart failure. Patients assigned to the Investigational Device&#xD;
      group will have the Algisyl-LVR™ device (implants) administered during a surgical procedure.&#xD;
      For patients randomized to the investigational device group, the investigator will make every&#xD;
      attempt to minimize the time between randomization and surgery (i.e, no more than 7 to 10&#xD;
      days). Patients will be considered part of the study cohort as soon as they have been&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either the Treatment or Control group. This time point will also be&#xD;
      considered as the start of follow-up. For patients allocated to the Investigational Device&#xD;
      group, the starting point of follow-up for surgical mortality and surgical complications will&#xD;
      start as of the date when the surgical procedure is performed (or attempted). The acute&#xD;
      response to device implant will be monitored intraoperatively via continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiographic cardiac monitoring, arterial pressure lines, transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE), and pulmonary artery catheter. Patients receiving the investigational&#xD;
      device are expected to remain hospitalized for 5 to 14 days. Patients assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will continue on standard medical therapy (without the investigational device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up in this study is divided into two phases. During the first phase, referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;efficacy phase&quot;, repeat testing of patient functional and cardiac structural parameters&#xD;
      will be conducted at follow-up visits scheduled at 3 months and 6 months, and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter. Follow-up testing will be supplemented by a 30 day (post randomization) telephone&#xD;
      contact with all patients. The efficacy phase of the trial will end on a common closing date&#xD;
      after a minimum of 6 months of follow-up (i.e., after the last patient enrolled has been&#xD;
      completed the 6 month visit). At that point data analysis will be performed and an initial&#xD;
      study report will be generated. Following completion of the efficacy phase, long-term&#xD;
      monitoring will continue through each patient's 24-month visit. This second phase is referred&#xD;
      to as the &quot;extended follow-up phase&quot;. During this phase, data collection will be focused on&#xD;
      long-term safety and will be conducted at 6-month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's randomized to the control group and completing the 12 month visit will be provided&#xD;
      the option of enrolling in Clinical Study LSH-11-001: An Open Label Rollover Trial for&#xD;
      Patients Randomized to the Control Group of Study LSH-10-001. Patients must continue to meet&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria as stated in Study LSH-10-001 to be eligible for Study&#xD;
      LSH-11-001.&#xD;
