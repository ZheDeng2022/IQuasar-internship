      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a group of disorders related to problems with the&#xD;
      secretion of certain hormones, which can lead to reproductive and other issues in women.&#xD;
      Frequent complications of PCOS include irregular menstruation, development of ovarian cysts,&#xD;
      and insulin resistance. The adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidney, are involved in&#xD;
      the production of certain hormones and the regulation of steroid levels in the blood, and may&#xD;
      be affected in women with PCOS. Researchers are interested in studying possible connections&#xD;
      between the adrenal glands and PCOS in young women who have been diagnosed with PCOS and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers with normal menstrual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate possible connections between adrenal gland steroid hormone secretion and&#xD;
      polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women between 16 and 29 years of age who have been diagnosed with PCOS, or who are&#xD;
           healthy volunteers with normal menstrual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to discontinue the use of oral contraceptives or any other&#xD;
           medications that alter steroid hormone production for at least 1 month before the start&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests. All participants will also have a pelvic (ovarian) ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be admitted to the hospital for a 1-week testing period, which&#xD;
           will involve the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular blood draws for two 2-hour periods (late evening and early morning) to measure&#xD;
           hormone levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood draws with a dose of corticotropin to test the body's adrenal function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormone level measurement following regular doses of dexamethasone (a drug that controls&#xD;
           the function of the adrenal gland)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily urine collection for 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other studies, such as imaging studies of the adrenal glands, may be conducted as&#xD;
           required by the study researchers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders presenting with&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism in adolescents and young women. The etiology of this condition remains&#xD;
      unknown, despite its many identified links to insulin resistance, hypertension and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, as well as its potential connection to the various forms of congenital adrenal&#xD;
      hyperplasia (CAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adrenal glands are the only source in the body of adrenocortical steroids. In normal&#xD;
      physiology, the pituitary hormone ACTH regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids, while the&#xD;
      secretion of mineralocorticoids is controlled by the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to&#xD;
      these two steroids, the adrenal gland secretes lesser amounts of intermediate metabolites of&#xD;
      these steroids, as well as the sex-steroids DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone,&#xD;
      estrogen, and estrone. Dysregulated secretion of any of these hormones can be caused by the&#xD;
      development of hyperplasia of the adrenocortical tissue, which may be mild and lead to&#xD;
      specific clinical syndromes depending on the identity of the secreted hormones. Bilateral&#xD;
      adrenocortical hyperplasia (BAH) is now an increasingly diagnosed cause of adrenal&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that there is a subgroup of patients with PCOS who actually have non-CAH primary&#xD;
      forms of BAH. To investigate this possibility, we propose to study the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) over the next 2 years in 120 young girls and women&#xD;
      (ages 16 to 25 years) that we will compare to 30 age- and race-matched normal females.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited primarily (although not exclusively) from a busy New York City&#xD;
      clinic run by the Pediatric Endocrine Division at the Infants and Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Brooklyn at Maimonides and SUNY Downstate. All patients will undergo standard testing of the&#xD;
      HPAA including oral low- and high-dose dexamethasone (DEX)-suppression testing (Liddle s&#xD;
      test). Paradoxical rise of cortisol and/or other steroid metabolites in response to DEX is&#xD;
      considered a sensitive test for the diagnosis of BAH. Patients with such responses will be&#xD;
      molecularly investigated for the known causes of BAH (GNAS, PRKAR1A, PDE11A, PDE8B and other&#xD;
      mutations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal of this study is to identify any possible contributions of the BAH phenotypes&#xD;
      and genotypes to the pathophysiology of PCOS, a yet unknown factor in the etiology of this&#xD;
      multifaceted disorder. The second goal is to perform a comparative analysis of the expression&#xD;
      of large sets of genes in cells of these patients using gene arrays and other genetic&#xD;
      analyses. This study will generate important information about the molecular pathways that&#xD;
      are affected in this subgroup of patients with PCOS. Thirdly, this study will also allow for&#xD;
      the collection of DNA from affected and non-affected relatives of the patients to perform&#xD;
      genetic studies and identify causative genetic defects. Finally, the study is expected to&#xD;
      lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic methods for at least certain forms of PCOS.&#xD;
