      The purpose of this study is to examine if the correct use of antibiotics, as well as the&#xD;
      application of one-day-treatment, in the therapy of periodontal diseases. The population of&#xD;
      treated patients (184) are divided in 4 groups; Group 1: Metronidazole + mechanical treatment&#xD;
      in one day, Group 2: Placebo + mechanical treatment in one day Group 3: Metronidazole +&#xD;
      mechanical treatment on day 1 and 21 Group 4: Placebo + mechanical treatment on day 1 and 21&#xD;
      End points, BOP, Plaque, PPD, CAL, RAL, Microbiology will be recorded on all sites at 3&#xD;
      months, 1 -, 3 -, and 5 years post-treatment&#xD;

      This is a clinical research project in the odontologic special field; periodontology.&#xD;
      Periodontitis affects &gt; 50% of all persons over 40 years-of-age, whereof 5 - 10% is prone to&#xD;
      loose one or more teeth due to the disease. In Norway, less than 40% of the periodontal&#xD;
      treatment costs are carried (refunded) by the public. The proportion of personal expenses vs.&#xD;
      public spending depends on how serious the periodontitis is diagnosed, and on the individual&#xD;
      treatment provided. In addition comes expenses connected to the restoration of the dentition&#xD;
      when teeth are lost as a consequence of the disease, and therefore the social, personal and&#xD;
      economical consequence of serious tooth loss can be devastating to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and established knowledge Periodontal disease is a family of bacterial infections&#xD;
      characterized by the destruction of periodontal supporting tissues. The bacterial flora at&#xD;
      the diseased sites is complex, counting &gt; 500 different species in the subgingival dental&#xD;
      plaque. Three main hypotheses exist in explaining the infectious nature of periodontal&#xD;
      disease; the non-specific infection hypothesis (Theilade 1986), the specific infection&#xD;
      hypothesis (Slots and Rams 1991, Loesche 1992) and the ecological plaque hypothesis (Marsh&#xD;
      1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental biofilm is an important factor in periodontal health and disease (review: Socransky&#xD;
      and Haffajee 2002), and is a more correct wording for the term plaque. Most biofilms are&#xD;
      biologically compatible with health, as their formation is influenced by the selective&#xD;
      pressure of the host organism. It is also of great practical interest that bacteria organized&#xD;
      in biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics as compared to those in a planktonic state.&#xD;
      In the development of dental biofilms, the host receives bacteria with different properties&#xD;
      from close relatives and others, depending on the living conditions (Tinoco et al 1998). If&#xD;
      there are pathogenic bacteria among these, the possibility for developing periodontitis&#xD;
      increases (Preus et al 1995). This indicates that periodontal treatment must be aimed at&#xD;
      breaking the ecology of the pathogenic biofilm, and then increase the organisms' ability to&#xD;
      perform its selective pressure, following treatment, in the making of a new biofilm low of,&#xD;
      or free from pathogenic microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Treatment strategies have so far aimed at preventing or retarding the progression&#xD;
      of the disease through mechanical, non-specific treatment, and we have succeeded to a certain&#xD;
      extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scaling and root planing (SRP) is the standard treatment, aiming to mechanically reduce the&#xD;
      number of bacteria present on the affected root surfaces. Representing a non-specific form of&#xD;
      treatment to a non-specific infection, it has proven effective in most cases and short follow&#xD;
      ups(Hill et al 1981, Pihlstrøm et al 1983, Lindhe et al 1984, Becker et al 1990, Kaldahl et&#xD;
      al 1993). However, recurrence rate is fairly high, suggesting that these diseases are&#xD;
      life-long traits. Also, a small - still significant - group of patients shows remaining&#xD;
      inflammation and continuous destruction of periodontal support despite adequate oral hygiene&#xD;
      and proper mechanical treatment (Lang et al 1986, Greenstein &amp; Caton 1990, Walker et al 1993,&#xD;
      Bragd et al 1987, Renvert et al 1990, Haffajee et al 1991, Grossi et al 1994, Slots and Rams&#xD;
      1991, Socransky and Haffajee 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scaling and root planing (SRP) and Adjunctive systemic antibiotics have been suggested in&#xD;
      order to prohibit such remaining destructive infection (Van Winkelhoff et al 1996). The&#xD;
      antibiotic should preferably be chosen based on microbiological diagnoses and the suggested&#xD;
      pathogenic bacterial resistance profile (Mombelli AW &amp; van Winkelhoff AJ 1997, Preus &amp; Laurel&#xD;
      2003). However, such treatment has been reported with varying effects in clinical studies&#xD;
      (Joyston-Bechal et al 1986, Lindhe et al 1983a, Lindhe et al 1983b, Bain et al 1994, Tinoco&#xD;
      et al 1997, Ciancio et al 1982, Chavez et al 1995, Mahmod &amp; Dolby 1987). Thus, adjunct&#xD;
      antibiotics seem as effective/ineffective in reducing the number of recurrent infection as&#xD;
      SRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally the antibiotic is administered at the end of the mechanical treatment, covering&#xD;
      sometimes more - sometimes less - of the treatment period. Bearing in mind the biofilms'&#xD;
      ability to resist antibiotics, it is clear that in dental biofilms, the bacteria are not&#xD;
      easily/not at all affected by treatment where antibiotics are involved. This possibly&#xD;
      explains why SRP and adjunct antibiotic treatment - according to the literature - does not&#xD;
      give a better result than SRP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SRP and Full-mouth disinfection (FDIS) has been introduced to increase the success rate of&#xD;
      SRP. FDIS is an adjunct therapy whereby scaling and root planing is performed within a 48&#xD;
      hour time frame to reduce the possibility for re-infection of the treated root surfaces.&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine is used as a disinfectant in addition to the mechanical treatment. In a series&#xD;
      of pilot studies on FDIS (Quirynen et al 1995, 1999, 2000, 2006, Bollen et al 1996) reported&#xD;
      amazingly good results. On the other hand, Apatzidou et al a, b, c, (2004), Koshy et al&#xD;
      (2005) and Wennström et al (2005) could not find any improvement from FDIS over conventional&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New treatment strategy Non-specific part; Traditional SRP to reduce the bacterial load and&#xD;
      disrupt/destroy the biofilm, but reduce the size of &quot;the window of opportunity&quot; for&#xD;
      re-infection by scaling /removing biofilms in all sites (healthy/not healthy) within 8 hours.&#xD;
      All sites are scaled, healthy or diseased. Additional FDIS to reduce amount of bacteria in&#xD;
      the oral cavity to levels possible to handle for the antibiotic to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific part; Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy adjunctive to SRP/FDIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-establishing a beneficial and protective biofilm: FDIS and rinsing with CHX and brushing&#xD;
      tongue with CHX gel for 7 days after treatment. Change tooth brush the day of treatment to&#xD;
      restrict possible re-inoculation from this, that particular day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis There is no difference in long term clinical and microbiological outcome&#xD;
      between groups of patients treated with SRP/FDIS and SRP with or without Metronidazole.&#xD;
      Treatment outcome is measured by the recurrence rate on an individual as well as on a group&#xD;
      level. (see definitions at end-point evaluation - p6), at included sites at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
      years of follow up. &quot;No difference&quot; is consistent with nil-hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: This calculation is based on the end point &quot;attachment level (AL)&quot;, either&#xD;
      it is measured on roentgenograms (RAL) or clinically (CAL) which again is the measurable&#xD;
      basis for &quot;recurrence of periodontal disease&quot; = further loss of attachment after treatment.&#xD;
      Based on results from similar published studies we assume that the standard deviation of AL&#xD;
      in each treatment group will be approximately 1.5 mm. A two-sample t-test will be applied&#xD;
      when comparing average AL in two treatment groups at a given time point, with a 5%&#xD;
      significance level. Further, we consider differences in average AL between two treatment&#xD;
      groups to be clinically significant if it is at least 1.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have at least 80% probability to demonstrate a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in average AL between two treatment groups, given that the true difference is at&#xD;
      least 1.0 mm, at least 36 patients must be available for statistical analysis in each group.&#xD;
      We expect that about 10% of the patients will drop out of the study during the 5 years&#xD;
      follow-up period, but we cannot exclude the possibility of a drop-out rate as high as 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 44 patients should be included in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      176 (i.e.180) males and females 30 - 60 years-of-age referred to specialist clinic in Bø in&#xD;
      Telemark. No interactive diseases with periodontal disease and willing to participate by&#xD;
      signing an informed consent. Patients should have &gt;4 pockets 5 - 8mm deep, bacterial&#xD;
      diagnosis which indicates the use of Metronidazole only (to prohibit differences due to&#xD;
      antibiotic choice). Included patients should not have known allergy or ill-reaction to this&#xD;
      drug. Microbiological diagnosis will be performed by PCR and culture and a second&#xD;
      microbiological &quot;shadow-test&quot; will be performed at a parallel microbiological service. The&#xD;
      primary microbiological diagnosis will be based on both culture and PCR on samples obtained&#xD;
      by curettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy (appendix 2 - Time Table) Patient will be screened, and their oral hygiene will be&#xD;
      brought up to standard by hygienist (TP). Eligibility, Indexes and microbiological diagnosis&#xD;
      will then be recorded by project leader (HP). If willing to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      patients will randomly be assigned to the 4 different groups by secretary/ project&#xD;
      coordinator (N). Group 1; One-day SRP/FDIS with antibiotics, Group 2; One-day SRP/FDIS with&#xD;
      placebo, Group 3; SRP over 2 weeks (scaling day 1 and 14) with antibiotics, Group 4; SRP over&#xD;
      2 weeks (scaling day 1 and 14) with placebo. Treatment at baseline will be performed after&#xD;
      protocol (TP)l, and maintenance controls with recording of indexes and microbiological&#xD;
      diagnosis will be performed at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 year post-treatment (HP). All data,&#xD;
      Measurements, microbiological diagnoses and response to questionnaires will be sent to&#xD;
      CodeBookMaster (PG) following each measuring session. Reliability testing of the measurer&#xD;
      (HP) every 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology I; Microbiological diagnosis will be performed for treatment and for follow up.&#xD;
      This will be done at a clinical laboratory (Telelab, Skien) which offers a service for Oral&#xD;
      microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology II: Concomitantly with every sample taken and processed an parallel sample will&#xD;
      be obtained in PBS. These samples will be processed at a by Dr Gunnar Dahlen in Gothenburg&#xD;
      using chequerboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Point evaluation - Choice of Method/indexes Periodontal disease is an inflammatory,&#xD;
      infectious disease which destroys tooth attachment including bone and fibres. Treatment is&#xD;
      aimed at halting or retarding this destruction. At 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years the CAL and RAL&#xD;
      as a parameter for periodontal disease and PD/BoP as parameters for inflammation will be&#xD;
      evaluated and statistically treated between the groups. Pocket Depth (PD) and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BoP) are only surrogate parameters as the disease is defined as &quot;loss of attachment&#xD;
      which includes bone&quot;. Periodontitis is measured in CAL or on Xrays = RAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since periodontal disease seems to recur after 3 - 4 years, we have suggested a 5 year&#xD;
      follow-up-study. Blinding I: To the Project Leader who is the one who performs all&#xD;
      measurements, the randomization to groups will be hidden since it is the research Coordinator&#xD;
      (N) who does this. N will also keep track of time schedules, appointments etc. A separate&#xD;
      record with the patient names and study number (1 - 160) will be kept by N locked down in a&#xD;
      separate cabinet for such patient records. At measuring appointments the measurements are&#xD;
      sent by N to the code book master who will log all measurements into SPSS program for&#xD;
      statistical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding II: To the patient as well as the hygienist, the mechanical treatment the patient&#xD;
      gets will be revealed since it is physically impossible to hide the fact that some are&#xD;
      treated in one day, others in 14 days. However, the placebo/antibiotic treatment ensures&#xD;
      blinding of both patient and hygienist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus total blinding will only apply to the project leader/measurer.&#xD;
