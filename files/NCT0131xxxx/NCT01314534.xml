      Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare syndrome, sporadic dominant condition with a frequency of 1 /&#xD;
      35000 (between 20 and 25 new children by year in France). Five cardinal criteria have been&#xD;
      described for this diagnosis: postnatal growth retardation, mild to moderate mental&#xD;
      retardation, skeletal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic abnormalities and characteristic facial&#xD;
      dysmorphism. Moreover, a large number of other symptoms are described in KS. Each year, new&#xD;
      symptoms are reported in the international literature but without their true frequency or&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of patients. However, these criteria are not always&#xD;
      present in patients and there is no major or minor criteria for establishing the diagnosis.&#xD;
      Nowadays, knowledge of this syndrome is still very fragmentary. At the date of the creation&#xD;
      of the network, no molecular basis has been identified for the SK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to create a national network of geneticists including 18 centers labeled&#xD;
      &quot;developmental defects&quot; and / or mental retardation in France gathered in Federation&#xD;
      Development Centers labeled anomalies (the FECLAD, Head, Professor A VERLOES, Hospital Robert&#xD;
      Debré, Paris). We will also rely on Kabuki Syndrome Association that gives us logistical&#xD;
      support with families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the French Kabuki syndrome network of (FKSN) is to establish a national&#xD;
      network to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. create a census for the duration of the search for French patients with SK (expected&#xD;
           number of patients = 110) for&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  determining epidemiological and morphological parameters,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  determine the true frequency of clinical symptoms and identify new ones,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  identify complications of the disease to improve the care of patients in the hope&#xD;
                of a better prognosis of the disease and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  performing a radiological study by Voxel based morphometry MRI type (N. BODDAERT,&#xD;
                HOPITAL Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris)&#xD;
&#xD;
           And&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. perform genetic research to identify the genetic bases of SK using CGH-array&#xD;
           (Comparative Genomic Hybridization ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RFSK will be responsible for recruiting and evaluating patients with SK, the data&#xD;
      collection and informed consent from patients for participation in the project and the&#xD;
      establishment of rules for management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also perform MRI Voxel based morphometry in a small cohort of 10 patients aged 8 to&#xD;
      15 years to identify abnormal brain region distribution in patients with abnormal SK. The&#xD;
      cohort of patients will be paired with SK-age compared to a historical control cohort and the&#xD;
      cohort of patients with SK will be in uniform after the completion of IQ-type test&#xD;
      WISC-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (tests performed routinely in all center for&#xD;
      each patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RFSK will also be responsible for collecting blood samples with informed consent of&#xD;
      patients for molecular studies. These samples will be centralized in the CRB's Hospital&#xD;
      Necker-Enfants Malades (Head: Prof. CORINNE ANTIGNAC) for the establishment of lymphoblastoid&#xD;
      lines and bases of white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the lack of standard methodology of studies of candidate genes relevant in the&#xD;
      rare disease, we will take genetic research, using these samples to identify the genetic&#xD;
      basis of KS using array CGH high density (44000 clones) on an AGILENT platform (Dr. D&#xD;
      SANLAVILLE, Lyon). This research, already used successfully in other sporadic dominant rare&#xD;
      diseases (such as CHARGE syndrome), we may help to identify an anomaly INFRACYTOGENETIQUE to&#xD;
      locate the gene responsible for SK.&#xD;
