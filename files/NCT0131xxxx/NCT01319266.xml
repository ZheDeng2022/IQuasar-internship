  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, severe and end stage renal disease) compared with subjects with normal renal&#xD;
      function on the pharmacokinetics of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group pharmacokinetic and safety study to assess&#xD;
      the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe and end stage renal&#xD;
      disease [ESRD])on the pharmacokinetics of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet&#xD;
      at a single dose of 45 mg as compared with subjects with normal renal function. The study&#xD;
      consists of a screening visit within 28 days before study drug administration (visit 1),&#xD;
      followed by a single-dose administration period including a 144-hour pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
      period (visit 2) with a final assessment after the final pharmacokinetic sample is collected&#xD;
      or upon early withdrawal, and a follow-up visit 48 to 72 hours after the last discharge from&#xD;
      the study center (visit 3). Subjects will be categorized into either the control group with&#xD;
      normal renal function or one of the four groups of subjects with varying degrees of renal&#xD;
      impairment. Up to 12 subjects in each of the 4 renal impairment groups and up to 16 subjects&#xD;
      with normal renal function will be enrolled to achieve the targeted minimum of 8 subjects in&#xD;
      each renal impairment group and 10 subjects with normal renal function completing the study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will check in to the study center on day -1. Subjects who continue to meet&#xD;
      the criteria for enrollment will receive a single dose of the hydrocodone bitartrate&#xD;
      extended-release tablet on day 1. Subjects will receive one 50-mg tablet of naltrexone&#xD;
      hydrochloride to block opioid receptors and minimize opioid related adverse events&#xD;
      approximately 15 and 3 hours before and approximately 9 and 21 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration. Blood and urine samples will be collected just before study drug&#xD;
      administration and over a 144-hour period after study drug administration. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed throughout the study by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory test results, vital signs measurements,12-lead ECG findings, physical examination&#xD;
      findings, SpO2 findings, and use of concomitant medications. Subjects who complete all&#xD;
      scheduled visits will have final procedures and assessments performed prior to discharge from&#xD;
      the study center after pharmacokinetic sampling is complete. All subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      return for a follow-up visit.&#xD;

             medication will be permitted within 2 hours before or after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects with renal impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or&#xD;
             protocol-specified contact for medical issues, will introduce an additional risk&#xD;
             factor or interfere with the study objectives and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has evidence of an unstable clinically important medical condition other&#xD;
             than impaired renal function.&#xD;
