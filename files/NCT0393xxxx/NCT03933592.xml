      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most painful devastating surgical incisions is post-thoracotomy pain which can&#xD;
      occur secondary to skin incision, damage to serratus anterior and intercostal muscles, rib&#xD;
      retraction and injury of the intercostal nerves (1). It leads to pulmonary complications in&#xD;
      the short term and chronic post-thoracotomy pain in the long term (2). The thoracic epidural&#xD;
      is usually used as the reference analgesic approach for controlling thoracotomy pain (3) but&#xD;
      it carries several risks and limitations (4). Serratus anterior plane block is performed by&#xD;
      blocking the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves (5) and can be a possible&#xD;
      alternative to epidural block with lesser risks (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work This study aims at comparing the effect of serratus plane block versus&#xD;
      thoracic epidural in patients undergoing thoracotomy for lung cancer surgery regarding pain&#xD;
      control and possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors suggest that this technique is easy to perform, safe, effective with lesser side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A randomized controlled study. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval of the institutional board ethical committee, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken from the patients undergoing the study. Sixty patients between 20 to 60 years old&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic surgery will be included in the study and randomly allocated into one of&#xD;
      the two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (I) 30 patients: will receive 10 mL bolus of levobupivacaine 0.25% 30 mint before skin&#xD;
      incision followed by an infusion of 5 ml/hour of 0.125% levobupivacaine after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (II) 30 patients: will receive 30 ml bolus of 0.25% levobupivacaine 30 mint before skin&#xD;
      incision followed by an infusion of 5 ml/hour of 0.125% levobupivacaine after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative assessment will be conducted as standard (Complete blood count, liver,&#xD;
      and kidney function tests, coagulation profile and chest x-ray) in addition to pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the holding area, all the patients will be monitored by standard monitoring&#xD;
      (ECG, Pulse oximetry and non-invasive automated arterial blood pressure). Then all patients&#xD;
      will be pre-medicated with midazolam (3-5 mg intravenous) after fixation of 20 G cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group I: thoracic epidural inserted at a low thoracic level in sitting position then test&#xD;
      dose will be administered to detect any complications, then a bolus of 10 ml of 0.25%&#xD;
      levobupivacaine 30 mint before skin incision followed by an infusion of 5 ml/hour of 0.125%&#xD;
      levobupivacaine after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group II: after induction of anesthesia and Patients will be placed in the lateral&#xD;
      position with the diseased side up. A linear ultrasound transducer (10-12 MHz) will be placed&#xD;
      over the mid-axillary region of the thoracic cage in a sagittal plane. The rib will be&#xD;
      counted inferiorly and laterally until the fifth rib is identified in the mid-axillary line.&#xD;
      The following muscles will be identified easily overlying the fifth rib: the latissimus dorsi&#xD;
      (superficial and posterior), teres major (superior) and serratus muscle (deep and inferior).&#xD;
      The needle (22- G, 50 - mm Touhy needle) will be introduced in-plane with respect to the&#xD;
      ultrasound probe targeting the plane superficial to the serratus muscle. Under continuous&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance a bolus of 30 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine 30 mint before skin incision.&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, the surgeon will put the catheter deep to serratus muscle and get&#xD;
      it out with chest tube and fix it followed by an infusion of 5 ml/hour of 0.125%&#xD;
      levobupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative: by bolus dose for both groups. To ensure adequate analgesia throughout the&#xD;
      operation all patients will be closely observed and upon the appearance of signs of&#xD;
      inadequate analgesia e.g. increase in heart rate or systolic blood pressure 20% above the&#xD;
      baseline, fentanyl rescue doses of 0.5µ/kg will be supplemented and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative: by continues infusion for both groups. All patients will have Intravenous&#xD;
      paracetamol every 8 hours. Morphine 5mg intravenous will be given when the visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS) pain score becomes &gt;3 as rescue analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on the previous paper (7) estimating the difference in&#xD;
      pain score at 24 h between 2 groups will be 2±2.1. Using power 80% and 5% significance level&#xD;
      of 18 patients in each group will be sufficient to be able to reject the null hypothesis that&#xD;
      the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal. This number is to be&#xD;
      increased to 21 in each group to correct for non-parametric usage. Sample size calculation&#xD;
      was achieved using Power and Sample Size Calculation Software Version 3.1.2 (Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) win&#xD;
      statistical package version 17. Parametric demographic data will be analyzed using student's&#xD;
      t-test, Qualitative data will be compared using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact as&#xD;
      appropriate. Numerical data will be described as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median&#xD;
      and range as appropriate. While qualitative data will be described as frequency and&#xD;
      percentage. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
