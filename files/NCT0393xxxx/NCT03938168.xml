    <textblock>
      11-20% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery develop chronic abdominal pain. Adhesions are&#xD;
      a common cause of chronic pain following surgery. Adhesions develop after up to 90% of&#xD;
      laparotomies and 70% of laparoscopic surgeries. Obviously, not all adhesions cause pain. It&#xD;
      is still poorly understood why adhesions cause pain in some patients, while other patients&#xD;
      with adhesions experience no pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we explore possible mechanism through which adhesions might cause pain. For&#xD;
      this purpose we will assess expression of molecular mediators (such as TRPV-1, SP, and the&#xD;
      neurokinin receptor), histological characteristics, and fecal microbioma that might be&#xD;
      associated with pain.Expression of these factor will be compared to sample from 30 patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain attributed to adhesions, and 30 patients undergoing a reoperation with&#xD;
      adhsiolysis for reasons unrelated to pain.&#xD;

      Introduction and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      11-20% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery develop chronic abdominal pain. Adhesions are&#xD;
      the most common cause of chronic abdominal complaints after surgery. Chronic pain from&#xD;
      adhesions has devastating consequences for quality of life, and one in three patients with&#xD;
      pain from adhesions is opioid dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesions develop after up to 90% of laparotomies and 70% of laparoscopic surgeries.&#xD;
      Obviously, not all adhesions cause pain. It is still poorly understood why adhesions cause&#xD;
      pain in some patients, while other patients with adhesions experience no pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study we demonstrated that in selected patients adhesion-related pain can&#xD;
      effectively be treated by operation with adhesiolysis and application of an adhesion barrier.&#xD;
      However, almost 50% part of patients with adhesion-related pain are not considered a&#xD;
      candidate for surgical treatment, for various reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the mechanisms that contribute to development of pain in patients with adhesions&#xD;
      could provide novel targets for medical therapies. These could greatly benefit many patients&#xD;
      suffering from adhesion- related pain. Two factors that might explain why some patients with&#xD;
      adhesions develop chronic pain are activation of molecular mechanisms involved in chronic&#xD;
      pain and stimulation of nerve fibers present in adhesions. Specifically type C nerve fibres&#xD;
      are associated with development of neuropathic pain. Further we will also explore differences&#xD;
      in microbioma, which has recently been demonstrated to have an important role in a variety of&#xD;
      abdominal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesion formation at the molecular level involves a complex interaction of mediators. One&#xD;
      such mediator that might link adhesion formation to nociception is the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      peptide substance P.(1) Substance P in turn is mediated by Transient Receptor Potential&#xD;
      Vanilloid (TRPV1), which is known to be upregulated in many conditions associated with&#xD;
      chronic pain. There is currently much research in developing new analgesics targeting this&#xD;
      receptor. Previous studies have shown that nerve fibres can be present in adhesive tissue.&#xD;
      Presence of such fibres, and especially type C fibres might be responsible for a neuropathic&#xD;
      type of pain. Stimulation of TRPV1 might also activate type C nerve fibre endings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify and compare expression of molecular mediators (such as TRPV-1, SP, and the&#xD;
      neurokinin receptor) and histological characteristics of adhesions from patients with&#xD;
      postoperative adhesions with and without chronic abdominal pain. Comparison of microbioma in&#xD;
      fecal samples between patients with adhesions with and without chronic abdominal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients eligible for adhesiolysis because of chronic adhesion-related pain. Patients are&#xD;
      recruited at the RadboudUMC, MUMC+ and Pantein hospital departments of surgery. These are&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain after previous abdominal surgery who have been selected for&#xD;
      operative treatment after evaluated with CineMRI. CineMRI is used to map adhesions. This&#xD;
      technique has been established to provide insight in localization of adhesions in relation to&#xD;
      the pain, and risk of bowel injury based on extensiveness of adhesions. The control group&#xD;
      will comprise of 30 patients undergoing an abdominal reoperation during which adhesiolysis&#xD;
      has to be performed for reasons other than chronic adhesion-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery patients are requested to take a stool sample. During surgery histological&#xD;
      samples of adhesions will be taken during adhesiolysis in both groups. In the control group&#xD;
      histological samples of adhesions will only be taken if it does not require extension of the&#xD;
      incision and if it is not accompanied with additional risk of intraoperative complications&#xD;
      other than necessary for their planned surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome mRNA expression levels of TRPV1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (qPCR) compared between patients with and without chronic pain. Secondary outcomes are TRPV1&#xD;
      protein levels (measured by Westernblot), SP, and neurokinin expression, and the amount and&#xD;
      types of nerve fibres found at histological assessment. Further we will explore microbioma in&#xD;
      feca samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking fecal and histological samples for this study does not result in additional operative&#xD;
      risk. Adhesiolysis is often performed during any type of abdominal reoperation. Histological&#xD;
      samples in controls are only taken from adhesions that are easily accessible and not from&#xD;
      dense adhesions in close proximity to bowel or other vulnerable organs. No additional&#xD;
      adhesiolysis apart from biopsy will be performed.&#xD;

        Chronic abdominal pain after surgery is a frequent condition.(13) At present the&#xD;
        RadboudUMC, MUMC+, and Pantein hospital departments of surgery annually evaluate 60-80&#xD;
        patients each for chronic pain by cineMRI. Between 30-40 of these patients are expected to&#xD;
        undergo surgical treatment. Yearly between 600-700 patients will undergo an elective&#xD;
        abdominal reoperation at the participating departments of surgery. Thus there is ample&#xD;
        surgical volume for this study.&#xD;
