      Conventional hemodialysis is essential for the treatment of ESRD patients by reducing serum&#xD;
      concentration of uremic toxins and correcting fluid overload. Nevertheless, HD removes almost&#xD;
      exclusively low-range uremic toxins. Convective methods might reduce complications associated&#xD;
      to molecules of medium-range molecular weight. On-Line Hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is the&#xD;
      result of the combination between convection and diffusion, this modality allows better&#xD;
      clearence of middle-range molecules, and protein bound molecules with better hemodynamic&#xD;
      tolerance, but at higher cost. In order to solve this problem the middle cut-off membranes&#xD;
      were developed, achieving cleareance of molecules between 15,000 to 40,000 Da with low&#xD;
      albumin loss. To our knowledge no study has ever evaluated the use of middle cut-off&#xD;
      membranes on OL-HDF. This is a prospective, experimental study which will include 12 patients&#xD;
      with ESRD that receive OL-HDF treatment on the National Institute of Cardiology &quot;Ignacio&#xD;
      Chavez&quot; OL-HDF Unit. They will be divided in 4 groups: high flux HD, extended HD (HDx),&#xD;
      OL-HDF, and OL-HDF with medium cut-off membrane.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kidney Disease Improved Global Outcomes (KDIGO) defines Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), as&#xD;
      a decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.72 m2SC, associated with&#xD;
      structural or functional abnormalities in a period greater than three months. CKD it's&#xD;
      classified in 5 stages based con GFR and albuminuria . Stage 5 is considered the end stage,&#xD;
      and it's also known as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), in this stage usually the patients&#xD;
      require some kind of renal function replacement (RFR), otherwise CKD will cause the death of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico the principal cause of CKD is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2), closely followed by&#xD;
      Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH), according to the 2012 National Survey of Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition (ENSANUT) from Mexico there are 6.4 million adults with DM2, and 22.4 million&#xD;
      adults with SAH. In Mexico the prevalence of patients currently receiving RFR it's unknown,&#xD;
      but based in different sources we estimate that 129 thousand patients have ESRD, and only 60&#xD;
      thousand receive some kind of RFR therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico (based on data published by the Mexican Institute of Social Security), 41% of the&#xD;
      dialysis patients are on hemodialysis (HD). ESRD patients on HD have a greater incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes which cause an important impact on survival. This increase on&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes can be explained by the high prevalence in this population of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, as well as adverse outcomes associated with uremia such&#xD;
      as chronic inflammation, and bone mineral disease vascular calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uremic toxins are clasiffied according to their molecular weight in low-range molecules (&lt;&#xD;
      500 Da), middle-range molecules (500 Da - 60 kDa), hydrosoluble molecules, and protein bound&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional hemodialysis is essential for the treatment of ESRD patients by reducing serum&#xD;
      concentration of uremic toxins and correcting fluid overload. Nevertheless, HD removes almost&#xD;
      exclusively low-range uremic toxins. Convective methods might reduce complications associated&#xD;
      to molecules of medium-range molecular weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-Line Hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is the result of the combination between convection and&#xD;
      diffusion, this modality allows better clearence of middle-range molecules, and protein bound&#xD;
      molecules with better hemodinamic tolerance. The ES-HOL study showed that OL-HDF with&#xD;
      post-filter sustitution patients had lower mortality in comparision with conventional HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convection can be poorly efficient when there´s disturbances on blood flow, time of dialysis,&#xD;
      and low dialyser quality, to solve this kind of issues newer dialysers with better cut-offs&#xD;
      had been developed, with this new dialysers one can achieve better clearence and greater&#xD;
      sustitution volumes. This new dialysers allow clearence of middle-range and protein bound&#xD;
      molecules like inflamatory mediators in sepsis, and light weigth chain immunoglobulins.&#xD;
      Nevertheless this new dialysers cause high protein loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to solve this problem the middle cut-off membranes were developed, achieving&#xD;
      cleareance of molecules between 15,000 to 40,000 Da with low albumin loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently our knowledge on uremic toxins has grown importantly, this increase in knowledge is&#xD;
      due in part to the creation of international collaboration groups such as the European Uremic&#xD;
      Toxin Work Group (EuTOX), which has recently described over 130 uremic toxins. Also urea&#xD;
      metabolomics had made important contributions describing the metabolism of uremic toxins in&#xD;
      plasma. One study used metabolomics to evaluated over 80 HD sessions, showing an important&#xD;
      description of the metabolism of uremic toxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge no study has ever evaluated the use of middle cut-off membranes on OL-HDF.&#xD;
      This study aimes to show that the combination of OL-HDF with middle cut-off membranes can&#xD;
      achieve a higher cleareance of middle-bound molecules in comparison to regular OL-HDF with&#xD;
      out affecting the nutritional status of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a prospective, experimental study which will include 12 patients with&#xD;
      ESRD that receive OL-HDF treatment on the National Institute of Cardiology &quot;Ignacio Chavez&quot;&#xD;
      OL-HDF Unit.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients incapable of finishing a dialysis session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 patients will be included, they will be divided in 4 groups: high flux HD, extended HD&#xD;
      (HDx), OL-HDF, and OL-HDF with medium cut-off membrane. All sessions will be performed in a&#xD;
      5008S CorDiax that enables HD and OL-HDF, we will use an FX CorDiax 80 dializer (effective&#xD;
      area 1.8 m2) for OL-HDF and conventional HD, and the Theranova 400 dializer (effective area&#xD;
      1.7 m2)for OL-HDF with medium cut-off membrane, and HDx. Every patient will be in each of the&#xD;
      4 groups, and they will receive 3 sessions in each group. Every session will have a duration&#xD;
      of 240 minutes with a Qb of 300 mL/min. Blood samples will be drawn in every session at the&#xD;
      following time points 5, 30, 60, 120 180, and 240 minutes, every blood sample will consist of&#xD;
      4-6 mL of EDTA plasma; this volumen would include 0.5 mL for biobanking, blood will be drawn&#xD;
      from the arterial, and venous outlet, and a dialysate sample will be drawn in every time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will we packed, refrigerated and send to the Renal Research institute Lab, for uremic&#xD;
      toxins metabolomics analysis, as well as middle-range uremic molecules, such as Beta 2&#xD;
      mycroglobulin, albumin, vitamin B12, myoglobin, Cystatin C, Urea Nitrogen, and Uric Acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will have a full nutritional assesment before the first session, and after the&#xD;
      third session of every modality; the assesment will include electric bioimpedance for&#xD;
      determination of ECW/TBW, and phase angle, dinamometry, nutritional plan, and MIS&#xD;
      (Malnutrition Inflammation Score) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis we will use the software STATA 13.0. Quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      analized with Shapiro-Wilk, Student T will be used for group comparations. We will consider a&#xD;
      p value of significance of less than 0.05.&#xD;
