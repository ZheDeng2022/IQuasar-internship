      The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of Better Living After Stroke through&#xD;
      Technology (BLAST) to help stroke survivors and family members return back to their&#xD;
      productive and meaningful lives by proactively 1) helping them set their activity goals using&#xD;
      ACS, 2) assessing their behavioral/functional capabilities using FBP, 3) recognizing symptoms&#xD;
      indicative potential secondary stroke risks, 4) engaging support from online/community&#xD;
      resources, and 5) offering tailored self-management recommendations using evidence-based&#xD;
      strategies on how to achieve their activity goals and avoid secondary stroke based on their&#xD;
      capabilities, stroke-related symptoms and available social resources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, which is the leading cause of disability, cognitive impairment and death in the US,&#xD;
      imposes significant financial and personal burden. Although the residual effects of stroke&#xD;
      affect many aspects of life, many aspects are not addressed by traditional rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatments. In particular, persons with mild stroke, typically defined as a stroke with no or&#xD;
      slight motor impairment and a high level of independence in basic activities of daily living,&#xD;
      often experience emotional problems, subtle but significant cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      decreased participation in productive, social and leisure activity. Despite these problems,&#xD;
      persons with mild stroke are typically discharged to home without further referral to health&#xD;
      or rehabilitation services other than follow-up with primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application is in response to RFA PA-11-335 (Lab to Marketplace: Tools for Biomedical&#xD;
      and Behavioral Research), a special 2-year Phase I SBIR program to accelerate the translation&#xD;
      of behavioral research from academic to the marketplace. The project is based on the&#xD;
      extensive research that developed and tested reliable and valid measures of activity&#xD;
      participation (Activity Card Sort, or ACS) and cognitive skills supporting performance of&#xD;
      simple and complex functional tasks (Functional Behavior Profile, or FBP). These measures&#xD;
      have been used to guide treatments to help persons with mild cognitive impairment and their&#xD;
      families support functional independence. These measures and the results of other studies&#xD;
      will be used to build a dynamic online self-management tool designed to help persons with&#xD;
      mild stroke develop individualized strategies that will support optimal recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of Better Living After Stroke through&#xD;
      Technology (BLAST) to help stroke survivors and family members return back to their&#xD;
      productive and meaningful lives by proactively 1) helping them set their activity goals using&#xD;
      ACS, 2) assessing their behavioral/functional capabilities using FBP, 3) recognizing symptoms&#xD;
      indicative potential secondary stroke risks, 4) engaging support from online/community&#xD;
      resources, and 5) offering tailored self-management recommendations using evidence-based&#xD;
      strategies on how to achieve their activity goals and avoid secondary stroke based on their&#xD;
      capabilities, stroke-related symptoms and available social resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke survivors and family using the BLAST system are expected to have 1) better life&#xD;
      satisfaction as measured by the Overall Recovery item of the Stroke Impact Scale; 2)&#xD;
      increased activity as measured by Activity Card Sort; 3) better problem-solving and task&#xD;
      performance as measured by Functional Behavior Profile; and 4) fewer caregiver concerns as&#xD;
      measured by the Stroke Caregiver Needs Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) to evaluate the acceptability of BLAST ; and 2) to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      effect of BLAST on self-efficacy, participation, and community reintegration.&#xD;
