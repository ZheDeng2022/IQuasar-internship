  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study evaluating the safety, clinical pharmacology and clinical&#xD;
      activity of TNB-383B, a BCMA x CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory MM who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy. The study&#xD;
      consists of 2 portions, a monotherapy dose escalation (Arm A) and a monotherapy dose&#xD;
      expansion (Arm B). Arm A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD profiles of&#xD;
      escalating doses of single-agent TNB-383B, administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W), in&#xD;
      approximately 85 subjects. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose,&#xD;
      (RP2D) is identified in Arm A, Arm B will be initiated to further characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of the MTD/RP2D dose of&#xD;
      TNB 383B monotherapy in approximately 48 subjects.&#xD;
