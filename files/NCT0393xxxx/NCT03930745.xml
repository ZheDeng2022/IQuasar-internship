    <textblock>
      A Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study screening approximately 600&#xD;
      adult females, aged 18-55, with a goal to enroll approximately 250 participants to achieve&#xD;
      200 evaluable participants at the test of cure (TOC) visit. The study is designed to&#xD;
      determine the clinical efficacy of an investigational product (IP), TOL-463 Insert, in&#xD;
      suppressing Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis (RBV) when administered to women who have a history&#xD;
      of RBV and have been successfully cleared of their current Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) infection&#xD;
      administering 500 mg of oral metronidazole, twice a day for 7 days or another CDC-recommended&#xD;
      BV treatment. Patient participation will be approximately 100 days while the study is&#xD;
      conducted at 4 sites within the United States. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of a twice-weekly application of TOL-463 vaginal insert in&#xD;
      suppression of BV in women with a history of RBV following successful induction with oral&#xD;
      metronidazole or a CDC-recommended BV treatment.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study screening approximately&#xD;
      600 adult females, aged 18-55, with a goal to enroll approximately 250 participants to&#xD;
      achieve 200 evaluable participants at the test of cure (TOC) visit. The study is designed to&#xD;
      determine the clinical efficacy of an investigational product (IP), TOL-463 Insert, in&#xD;
      suppressing Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis (RBV) when administered to women who have a history&#xD;
      of RBV and have been successfully cleared of their current Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) infection&#xD;
      administering 500 mg of oral metronidazole, twice a day for 7 days or another CDC-recommended&#xD;
      BV treatment. Patient participation will be approximately 100 days while the study is&#xD;
      conducted at 4 sites within the United States. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of a twice-weekly application of TOL-463 vaginal insert in&#xD;
      suppression of BV in women with a history of RBV following successful induction with oral&#xD;
      metronidazole or a CDC-recommended BV treatment. Secondary objectives of the study are: 1) to&#xD;
      evaluate the time to BV recurrence as defined by clinical criteria, 2) to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence of vaginal symptoms over study participation, 3) to evaluate acceptability of a&#xD;
      twice-weekly application of TOL-463 vaginal insert in suppression of BV, and 4) to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of TOL-463 vaginal insert compared to placebo, including the incidence of&#xD;
      secondary vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). The null hypothesis for the comparison is that&#xD;
      there is no difference in cure rates between treatments, with a two-sided alternative.&#xD;
