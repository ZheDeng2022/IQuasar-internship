  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the efficacy of a newly developed functional exercise&#xD;
      device (FitMi Plus) for people in the chronic stage after a stroke compared to the FitMi&#xD;
      Basic (i.e. without functional exercises). FitMi Plus combines objects commonly used during&#xD;
      activities of daily living with sensors that can track and record the patient's direction and&#xD;
      degree of movement as they perform specific functional tasks described on a computer.&#xD;

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement).&#xD;
Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:&#xD;
3) Performs test normally 2) Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty&#xD;
1) Performs test partially 0) Can perform no part of test</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tests resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity. Scores range from 0-4, with 6 choices.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Pain Scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. The scale ranges from 0) &quot;no pain&quot; to 10) &quot;worst possible, unbearable pain&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, One-Month Post-Treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants wear a custom-designed wrist-mounted actigrapher (the MiGo, which uses wrist-worn accelerometers to monitor functional use of the upper extremity activity) for a 24 hour period to assess changes in functional activity levels.</description>
