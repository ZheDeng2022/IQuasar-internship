  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the effects (good and bad) of adding copanlisib to the usual&#xD;
      therapy of fulvestrant and abemaciclib in treating patients with hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      and HER2 negative stage IV breast cancer. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for the&#xD;
      hormones estrogen or progesterone. These cells are hormone receptor positive and they need&#xD;
      estrogen or progesterone to grow. This can affect how the cancer is treated. Hormone therapy&#xD;
      using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Abemaciclib and copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Adding copanlisib to the usual therapy of fulvestrant and abemaciclib&#xD;
      may work better than giving fulvestrant and abemaciclib alone in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of fulvestrant + abemaciclib + copanlisib hydrochloride&#xD;
      (copanlisib) (FAC) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if FAC is superior to fulvestrant + abemaciclib (FA) using progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) as an endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR = partial response [PR] + complete response&#xD;
      [CR]) and clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + CR + stable disease [SD] &gt;= 6 months) of FAC&#xD;
      versus (vs.) FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the median PFS between FAC and FA arms in the following subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Tumor PIK3CA/PTEN altered (PIK3CA mutation or PTEN mutation/PTEN loss). IIb. Tumor&#xD;
      PIK3CA/PTEN not altered (wild-type PIK3CA and PTEN and without PTEN loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIc. Tumor phosphorylated (p)AKT levels (above or below the median). III. To assess whether&#xD;
      triplet therapy with FAC inhibits AKT phosphorylation, reduces cyclin D1, and is more&#xD;
      effective than FA in inhibiting Rb phosphorylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether the combination of abemaciclib and fulvestrant affect the copanlisib&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the median PFS in the following molecularly defined subgroups treated with&#xD;
      either FAC or FA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Tumor PIK3CA mutation vs. not. IIb. Tumor PTEN mutation/PTEN loss vs. not. IIc.&#xD;
      Circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) PIK3CA mutation vs. not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IId. CtDNA PI3K/PTEN mutation vs. not. IIe. CtDNA ESR1 mutation vs. not. III. To assess&#xD;
      baseline and treatment induced changes in various cancer associated pathways, including but&#xD;
      not limited to PI3K, MAPK, ER, cyclins, CDKs and CDK inhibitors; and to correlate with&#xD;
      treatment response and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate baseline and treatment induced changes in breast cancer intrinsic subtypes&#xD;
      (PAM50), and PI3K messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signature and expression of candidate&#xD;
      genes with treatment response and benefit from adding copanlisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate ctDNA mutations at baseline and over time for response predictors at baseline,&#xD;
      and clonal evolution associated with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To correlate ctDNA mutation profiles with tumor sequencing, and correlate baseline ctDNA&#xD;
      mutations, particularly in components of the PI3K pathway with treatment response, and&#xD;
      correlate early changes in ctDNA variant allele frequencies (VAFs) with PFS, assess emergent&#xD;
      resistant mutations at progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess resistance mechanisms to FA and FAC at baseline and at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To examine the molecular effects of FA and FAC on tumor and circulating markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To analyze tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at baseline, during treatment, and at disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To assess whether copanlisib affects abemaciclib pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I two part, dose-escalation study of copanlisib hydrochloride and&#xD;
      abemaciclib, followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I (PART A): Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on&#xD;

      twice daily (BID) on on days 2-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients&#xD;
      also receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 2 and 16 of cycle 1, and on day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I (PART B): Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15 or days 1 and 15 (depending on dose level) and abemaciclib PO twice daily BID for 5 days&#xD;
      each week (2 days off). Patients also receive fulvestrant IM on days 2 and 16 of cycle 1, and&#xD;
      on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (FAC): Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride as in phase I. Patients also receive&#xD;
      abemaciclib PO BID as in phase I part B and fulvestrant IM on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of copanlisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity and teratogenic effects have&#xD;
             been observed in nonclinical studies and PI3K inhibitors as well as other therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 6 months after the last dose of copanlisib. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of&#xD;
             copanlisib administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document (or&#xD;
             legally authorized representative, if applicable). Patient must agree to research team&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of treated brain metastases are allowed in the phase I portion&#xD;
             of the trial provided there is no disease progression symptomatically and by imaging&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to registration AND if the patient is off steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients enrolling to the randomized phase 2 portion of the study, prior treatment&#xD;
             with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or fulvestrant, or a PI3K inhibitor in the metastatic setting&#xD;
             is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive therapy is not allowed while on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors, or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the randomized phase 2 portion of the study, patients with brain metastasis or a&#xD;
             history of brain metastasis are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For the phase 1 portion of the study, patients with progressive brain metastases&#xD;
                  should be excluded because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
                  progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
                  neurologic and other adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.,&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a&#xD;
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
                  consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions&#xD;
                  with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if&#xD;
                  the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be&#xD;
             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening. If a patient is on chronic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed&#xD;
             dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
             Short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or&#xD;
             equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment&#xD;
             non-infectious pneumonitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury (as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator) within 28 days before start of treatment, or have not recovered from&#xD;
             major side effects, open biopsy within 7 days before start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 2), unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, new-onset angina, uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical&#xD;
             management, seizure disorder requiring medication, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months before start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident&#xD;
             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism&#xD;
             within 3 months before the start of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden&#xD;
             cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proteinuria &gt;= grade 3 as assessed by a 24-hour (h) protein quantification or&#xD;
             estimated by urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5 on a random urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding diathesis. Any hemorrhage or bleeding event &gt;= grade 3 within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the start of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or concurrent condition of interstitial lung disease of any severity and/or&#xD;
             severely impaired lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of having received an allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture not due to breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active, clinically serious infections &gt; grade 2 (Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 5.0)&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Concurrent diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has undergone blood or platelet transfusion &lt; 7 days prior to start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with copanlisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with copanlisib. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV). All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV&#xD;
             up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus lab panel.&#xD;
             Patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (HBcAb) will be eligible if they are negative for HBV DNA, these patients&#xD;
             should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody&#xD;
             will be eligible if they are negative for HCV RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients on combination antiretroviral agents that are strong CYP3A4&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers and who are unwilling or unable to change to antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapies without such interactions are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with copanlisib, abemaciclib, and fulvestrant.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of, or current autoimmune disease are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or&#xD;
             preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition&#xD;
             resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea&#xD;
