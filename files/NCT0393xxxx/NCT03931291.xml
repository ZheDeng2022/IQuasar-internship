      A multi-center, open label, Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      APR-246 in combination with azacitidine as maintenance therapy after allogeneic HSCT for&#xD;
      patients with TP53 mutant AML or MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prescreened for TP53 mutant AML or MDS before they have a HSCT. In order to&#xD;
      proceed with APR-246 and azacitidine treatment, engraftment must be confirmed between Day 30&#xD;
      to Day 100 post-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APR-246 will be administered on Days 1-4, with azacitidine on Days 1-5, of every 28 day&#xD;
      cycle. Patients may receive a maximum of 12 cycles.&#xD;
