  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) is characterized by abnormalities in the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system in the body. The autonomic nervous system controls and regulates body&#xD;
      functions such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has shown that patients with POTS have higher cardiovascular and adrenergic&#xD;
      activating autoantibodies (AAb), which likely changes the normal make-up of POTS. There are&#xD;
      autoantibodies that have been suggested by a few reports of their presence in POTS, but their&#xD;
      role different aspects of POTS is unknown. The study will look at the body's responses in&#xD;
      patients with POTS. The crossover study design is to have half of the patients will start&#xD;
      with sham followed by active stimulation and half will start by active followed by sham&#xD;
      stimulation. It is anticipated that results will provide a potential therapeutic approach&#xD;
      based on the understanding of POTS.&#xD;
