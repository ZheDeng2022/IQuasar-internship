  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because adolescents and young adults face markedly increased HIV risk yet frequently do not&#xD;
      test, we propose to complete the Mobile Augmented Screening (MAS) tool designed to increase&#xD;
      HIV testing, and to facilitate linkage to care and ongoing prevention education. This tool&#xD;
      will help clinicians address undiagnosed youth HIV, and enable young patients to receive much&#xD;
      needed treatment and avoid unknowingly transmitting infection. Our product is designed to&#xD;
      help existing program staff reach an increased number of clients; and to improve public&#xD;
      health by encouraging reluctant young patients to accept important HIV testing and care they&#xD;
      may otherwise decline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our randomized trial will evaluate HIV test rates among participants who complete a&#xD;
      tablet-based intervention, the Mobile Augmented Screening tool (MAS), compared to&#xD;
      participants in a treatment as usual (TAU) condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will approach 350 emergency department (ED) patients aged 13 - 24 years.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into the intervention or TAU condition. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or TAU condition, stratified by patient age&#xD;
      (13-17 and 18-24). Within each of these age strata, permuted blocks randomization with&#xD;
      varying block sizes will be employed to ensure balance and concealment of allocations prior&#xD;
      to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized into the intervention condition will watch a 5-minute video&#xD;
      on a tablet computer, and the tablet will ask intervention participants if they would like an&#xD;
      HIV test. Possible responses will be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Participants who are randomized into TAU&#xD;
      will be offered HIV tests by research staff. All participants in both conditions who agree to&#xD;
      HIV testing will be tested by hospital staff in the location where they are receiving&#xD;
      treatment. All participants who test will receive their results in person from ED staff&#xD;
      before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial outcome will be percentages of patients, by treatment group, who test for&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Emergency Department patients aged 13 - 24 years will be eligible for the study if they&#xD;
        are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  awake&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to provide consent as determined by ED staff&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  understand written and spoken English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not intoxicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not known to be HIV positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not a prisoner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have not already agreed to test for HIV during their current ED visit (this will&#xD;
             include patients who decline HIV testing offered by hospital staff and patients who&#xD;
             are not yet offered HIV testing; potential differences in test rates among&#xD;
             participants who decline vs. those who have not previously been offered an HIV test&#xD;
             will be explored as a secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria include patients who are prisoners, patients who are asleep/unconscious,&#xD;
        unable to provide consent as determined by ED staff, do not understand written and spoken&#xD;
        English, are intoxicated, are known to be HIV positive, have already agreed to an HIV test&#xD;
        during their current ED visit, have been categorized by ED staff as altered mental status&#xD;
        or are presenting to the ED for a psychiatric problem. Additionally, the proposed research&#xD;
        will exclude patients if medical records indicate hospital staff have categorized the&#xD;
        patient as most urgently in need of medical care.&#xD;
