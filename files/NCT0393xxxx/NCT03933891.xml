      Portal hypertension is the end-stage fatal complications of liver cirrhosis. Decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis patients can pass through transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to&#xD;
      effectively prevent bleeding and refractory ascites. However, the occurrence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and liver function failure, infection, bleeding again are main lethality&#xD;
      postoperative complications after TIPS. The accurate TIPS shunt is necessary to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of complications and improve the patients' survival rate and survival quality.&#xD;
      Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is standard to evaluate TIPS preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative hemodynamic change and is also the most important the predictors of&#xD;
      decompensation and varicose vein bleeding of liver cirrhosis. Whether there is a kind of&#xD;
      noninvasive monitoring method can guide TIPS accurate shunt and evaluate the prognosis of&#xD;

      Portal hypertension is the end-stage fatal complications of liver cirrhosis. Decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis patients can pass through transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to&#xD;
      effectively prevent bleeding and refractory ascites. However, the occurrence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and liver function failure, infection, bleeding again are main lethality&#xD;
      postoperative complications after TIPS. The accurate TIPS shunt is necessary to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of complications and improve the patients' survival rate and survival quality.&#xD;
      Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is standard to evaluate TIPS preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative hemodynamic change and is also the most important the predictors of&#xD;
      decompensation and varicose vein bleeding of liver cirrhosis. Whether there is a kind of&#xD;
      noninvasive monitoring method can guide TIPS accurate shunt and evaluate the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a high soft tissue resolution, time and spatial&#xD;
      resolution, abdominal MRI can noninvasively, dynamically detect the liver, spleen, portal&#xD;
      system functions, the changes of portal system hemodynamics, blood supply of liver tissue,&#xD;
      perfusion and liver cell function, etc. Magnetic resonance 4D-flow imaging, can accurately&#xD;
      measure the portal vein system blood vessels and shunt channels, blood volume, flow velocity&#xD;
      parameters of blood flow can be detected. Recent studies have confirmed that the 4D-flow&#xD;
      technology can accurately, long-term follow-up monitoring TIPS preoperative, postoperative&#xD;
      portal vein blood flow, which have better sensitivity and more accurate than ultrasound to&#xD;
      detect blood flow. Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging of the liver can quantitatively&#xD;
      obtain liver tissue microcirculation status, monitor portal vein and hepatic artery blood&#xD;
      perfusion, the liver perfusion has a significant correlation with Child-Pugh score and degree&#xD;
      of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Compared with the traditional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging contrast agents, liver specific contrast agents have small renal toxicity,&#xD;
      uptake by liver cell specificity, recent studies have found that magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      with liver cell specificity contrast agents have significantly correlated with the stage of&#xD;
      fibrosis of the liver and liver function, and has been used in the clinical staging of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      elastography (MRE) is a new imaging technology in recent years and a unique image method. As&#xD;
      a noninvasive and quantitative method to detect elastic properties of the organ. Plenty of&#xD;
      research results showed that in patients with liver cirrhosis, liver and spleen of elasticity&#xD;
      have significant correlation with the degree of portal hypertension. So far, a variety of&#xD;
      functional imaging methods grade and guide prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, which have&#xD;
      been confirmed to have significant clinical value. MRE has been written for the latest&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to analyze the liver function and survival of liver cirrhosis patients after&#xD;
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, advanced magnetic resonance techniques are&#xD;
      used before and after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Researchers will combine&#xD;
      a variety of advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, long-term and dynamic monitor&#xD;
      TIPS preoperative and postoperative liver function, blood flow, perfusion, the change of&#xD;
      tissue elasticity, and analysis the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, hemorrhage, hepatic&#xD;
      failure and survival rate with MRI changes. Finally, Researchers will develop a new&#xD;
      predictive index, guide TIPS precision shunts, evaluate a variety of the value of imaging&#xD;
      technology in the application of patients with TIPS to find the most sensitive technology,&#xD;
      and discover the correlation between MRI function parameters with patient's survival. In&#xD;
      order to analyze the liver function and survival of liver cirrhosis patients after&#xD;
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, advanced magnetic resonance techniques are&#xD;
      used to evaluate liver function, blood flow, elasticity, perfusion of before and after&#xD;
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.&#xD;
