  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to determine the optimum dose of ropivacaine, a local anaesthetic, that&#xD;
      provides regional anaesthesia with no or minimum adverse effects (i.e. hypotension) when&#xD;
      given spinally in healthy full term tall parturients scheduled to undergo caesarean section&#xD;
      under combined spinal / epidural anaesthesia (CSEA). The participants' height threshold is&#xD;
      based on a local anthropometric research, which included over 2000 people. According to the&#xD;
      above research the investigators calculated the female height distribution and decided to&#xD;
      include in the study those distributed in the upper quartile (75th to 99th percentile). The&#xD;
      female height distribution of the upper quartile ranges from 167 to 184 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are adverse effects related to the anaesthetic technique (hypotension,&#xD;
      discomfort, nausea, vomiting and pruritus), the speed of installation and the duration of the&#xD;
      regional block (both sensory and motor), blood gas analysis of the newborn umbilical blood as&#xD;
      well as newborn Apgar score and lastly the mothers' degree of satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective non randomized double-blinded trial in which a specific algorithm for&#xD;
      the local anaesthetic dose will be adopted (up-down sequential allocation). A written&#xD;
      informed consent will be required by all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perioperative management of all participants will follow standard clinical protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of ropivacaine for each parturient is determined by the response of the previous&#xD;
      participant to a higher or lower dose according to the sequential distribution algorithm&#xD;
      (up-down sequential allocation). Specifically, the dose of ropivacaine for each parturient&#xD;
      (except for the first) will fluctuate by 0.375 mg depending on the success (decrease by 0.375&#xD;
      mg) or failure (increase by 0.375 mg) of the spinal anaesthesia of the previous parturient&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The local anaesthetic dose of the first participant will be determined&#xD;
      by a short pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose-response relationship of&#xD;
      subarachnoid (spinal) administered ropivacaine to healthy tall parturients scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo elective caesarean section under combined subarachnoid / epidural anaesthesia (CSEA)&#xD;
      with co-administration of a fixed dose of fentanyl. The dose-response relationship will be&#xD;
      described by determining ED50 (Effective Dose 50) and MLAD (Minimum Local Anaesthetic Dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The height threshold of the participants is based on the study &quot;National Anthropometric&#xD;
      Research: Effectiveness of Ergonomic Measurements and Applications.&quot; By G. Scroumbelos,&#xD;
      University of Piraeus. Based on the female height distribution of the previously mentioned&#xD;
      Anthropometric Research, we chose the upper quartile (75th to 99th percentile) as an&#xD;
      inclusion criterion in our study, which ranges from 167 to 184 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are spinal induced hypotension, speed of installation and duration of&#xD;
      sensory and motor blockade, blood gas analysis of the umbilical circulation of the newborn,&#xD;
      Apgar score of the newborn, adverse effects related to the anaesthetic technique (discomfort,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, pruritus) and the degree of maternal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective non randomized double-blinded trial in which a specific algorithm for&#xD;
      the local anaesthetic dose will be adopted (up-down sequential allocation, described below).&#xD;
      A written informed consent will be required by all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perioperative management of the participants follows standard clinical protocols.&#xD;
      Specifically, conventional non-invasive monitoring consisting of five lead&#xD;
      electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and automatic oscillometric cuff blood pressure is used.&#xD;
      A low-dose spinal via the needle-through-needle combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique is&#xD;
      employed. With the patient in the sedentary position, the O3-O4 intervertebral space is&#xD;
      located, followed by skin antisepsis and topical lidocaine infiltration. The loss of&#xD;
      resistance technique is used in order to locate the epidural space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of ropivacaine for each parturient is determined by the response of the previous&#xD;
      participant to a higher or lower dose according to the sequential distribution algorithm&#xD;
      (up-down sequential allocation). Specifically, the dose of ropivacaine for each parturient&#xD;
      (except for the first) will fluctuate by 0.375 mg depending on the success (decrease by 0.375&#xD;
      mg) or failure (increase by 0.376 mg) of the subarachnoid anaesthesia of the previous&#xD;
      parturient enrolled in the study. A fix dose of fentanyl (15 mcg) will also be&#xD;
      co-administered to all participants. The dose for the first participant will be tailored to&#xD;
      the results of a preliminary empirical study of a small number of parturients not enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of subarachnoid anaesthesia. Successful subarachnoid anaesthesia is defined as (1) an&#xD;
      adequate sensory block at the level of T6 or higher within 15 minutes of the spinal injection&#xD;
      of the local anaesthetic and opioid, (2) no need for a supplementary dose (rescue dose) of&#xD;
      local anaesthetic given epidurally for at least 50 minutes after subarachnoid infusion&#xD;
      (maternal pain intensity measured by a Visual Analog Scale, VAS ≤ 3), (3) and the onset of&#xD;
      surgery 15 minutes after spinal injection of the local anaesthetic and opioid. In the case of&#xD;
      successful subarachnoid anaesthesia, the dose of the spinally administered ropivacaine for&#xD;
      the next participant decreases by 0.375 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of subarachnoid anaesthesia. Unsuccessful subarachnoid anaesthesia is defined as (1)&#xD;
      VAS &gt; 3 and (2) the need for a rescue dose (ropivacaine 0.5% 3-5 ml given epidurally) once&#xD;
      within 50 minutes after the spinal infusion. In this case, the dose of the spinally&#xD;
      administered ropivacaine for the next participant increases by 0.375 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion from the study. The participant will be excluded from the study if (1) VAS &gt; 3 and&#xD;
      (2) there is a need for two or more rescue doses administered epidurally within 50 minutes&#xD;
      after subarachnoid infusion or (3) there is a need to switch to general anaesthesia. In this&#xD;
      case, the same dose of ropivacaine is repeated for the next parturient enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the study protocol, two anaesthetists are required to conduct the study: a study&#xD;
      supervisor who sets the dose of the local anaesthetic for the next participant according to&#xD;
      the sequential distribution algorithm (see above) and performs the technique and an&#xD;
      anaesthetist responsible for recording the study parameters and for the clinical management&#xD;
      of the parturient, blinded to the administered dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific algorithm will be employed for prevention and treatment of spinal induced&#xD;
      hypotension, which includes co-hydration with crystalloids (10ml.kg-1) and use of&#xD;
      vasopressors (phenylephrine and ephedrine). The algorithm is in agreement with the latest&#xD;
      guidelines on the management of hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      (&quot;International consensus statement on the management of hypotension with vasopressors during&#xD;
      caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia.&quot; Anaesthesia. 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis. The sequential distribution methodology described by&#xD;
      Dixon and Massey (up-down sequential allocation) is applied for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Bibliographic data suggests that &quot;up-down sequential allocation&quot; gives reliable results with&#xD;
      a sample size of 20 to 40 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed using the Stata ™ software (Version 10.1 MP, Stata&#xD;
      Corporation, College Station, TX 77845, USA).&#xD;
