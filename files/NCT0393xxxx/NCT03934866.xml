    <textblock>
      The SUMMIT Study will enrol 25,000 participants in order to investigate how cancer screening&#xD;
      can be improved and delivered. The SUMMIT Study has two main aims: the first is to clinically&#xD;
      validate a blood test for detecting multiple cancers at an early stage. The second is to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of delivering a low-dose CT (LDCT) screening service for lung cancer&#xD;
      to a high-risk population in North Central and East London.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SUMMIT Study is a prospective, observational, cohort study. Its aim is to clinically&#xD;
      validate a blood test for the early detection of multiple types of cancer, and to deliver&#xD;
      LDCT screening for lung cancer to an at-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMIT plans to enrol 25,000 participants aged 55-77 years, from participating general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP) practices in North Central and East London. The participants enrolled will&#xD;
      be people who are at high-risk for lung cancer due to a significant smoking history based on&#xD;
      validated risk scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with significant smoking histories will be offered a clinical Lung Health Check&#xD;
      (LHC), which includes a brief respiratory consultation including questions about respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms and medical history, smoking cessation advice and referral where required, and&#xD;
      certain relevant clinical measurements (blood pressure, spirometry, height, and weight).&#xD;
      Those persons who are eligible for participation based on specific validated risk scores may&#xD;
      then be offered participation in the SUMMIT Study. Electronic informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained if they decide to take part. Consented participants will provide a blood sample,&#xD;
      complete a confidential electronic questionnaire and have an LDCT scan at the same visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return for two further annual visits, and some participants may&#xD;
      return for additional scans if clinically indicated (nodule management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any LDCT result is suspicious for cancer, the participant will be referred to their local&#xD;
      hospital (type 2 Site) via an urgent referral pathway to the relevant MDT. If a participant&#xD;
      is diagnosed with lung cancer, that participant will no longer continue in the&#xD;
      active/interventional part of the study but will be followed for clinical outcomes via the&#xD;
      Type 2 site completion of eCRF and registry data. If the suspicious lesion is found to be&#xD;
      benign, the participant can continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one randomisation round carried out during this study. All participants with a&#xD;
      negative LDCT at the baseline visit who have not been diagnosed with lung cancer since that&#xD;
      visit will return for an LHC at approximately 12 months. At the 12-month visit, this group&#xD;
      will be randomised either to have an LDCT or no LDCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if an urgent referral was after the Y0 LDCT scan, the participant will not be&#xD;
      included in the randomisation at Y1, and will receive LDCT at Y1 and Y2.&#xD;
