  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Micro-ultrasound is a novel real-time imaging modality which maintains the clinical workflow&#xD;
      of conventional ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, while potentially maintaining a similar&#xD;
      ability to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) to MRI. This prospective&#xD;
      trial aims to compare micro-ultrasound to mpMRI in detection of csPCa in the biopsy naïve.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from a large randomized clinical trial (clinical trials.gov ID NCT02079025),&#xD;
      suggests that micro-ultrasound system is more sensitive than conventional&#xD;
      transrectal-ultrasound (TRUS) to detect prostate cancer (PCa). the PRI-MUS (prostate risk&#xD;
      identification using micro-ultrasound) scoring system was developed and validated to assess&#xD;
      the risk of prostate cancer for targeted biopsy with the micro-ultrasound platform, similar&#xD;
      to the PIRADS scoring system for suspicious areas on mpMRI. This project will compare&#xD;
      micro-ultrasound imaging modality to the current gold-standard imaging for prostate cancer,&#xD;
      mpMRI. By applying both modalities to the same patients, the investigators will provide a&#xD;
      direct comparison of their screening abilities in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative&#xD;
      predictive value and positive predictive value. It will build evidence to demonstrate that&#xD;
      micro-ultrasound may replace MRI/Fusion biopsy in these patients.This project aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the micro-ultrasound 1) provides more sensitive initial biopsy, reducing the&#xD;
      need for repeated procedures, thus lowering the rate of severe sepsis and the number of&#xD;
      cancers found after local or regional progression, and 2) reduces the need for mpMRI&#xD;
      following initial biopsy.&#xD;

        Patients who are referred to confirm negative or positive for diagnosis of prostate cancer&#xD;
        based on SOC biopsy, with superior resolution imaging devices. Referral may be indicated in&#xD;
        the setting of increased PSA, abnormal DRE and/or abnormality of other serum or urinary&#xD;
        tests specific for prostate cancer, for example PHI (Prostate Health Index) and PCA3. The&#xD;
        current golden standard imaging for prostate cancer is mpMRI.&#xD;
