  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VA MapTrek is a mobile-phone-based web application that allows participants to take a virtual&#xD;
      walk in interesting locations around the world while tracking their progress against the&#xD;
      progress of other veterans on an interactive map. Steps are counted using a&#xD;
      commercially-available triaxial accelerometer (e.g., Fitbit), and users see their progress&#xD;
      overlaid on Google Maps. The objective of this study is to report activity levels to&#xD;
      veterans, thereby encouraging them to walk more. Once participants know how to text and use&#xD;
      Google maps, no additional training is needed. VA MapTrek does not require a special app, so&#xD;
      there are no logins or passwords to remember. Simply registering one's Fitbit and mobile&#xD;
      phone at an initial enrollment meeting suffices.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consented participants will be provided with a Fitbit and instructed to wear it all day,&#xD;
      every day for the next 9 weeks (The first few participants may require an additional week or&#xD;
      two of wear as we will not begin the first MapTrek race until we have at least 5 participants&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. They will be told this upon enrollment.). The enrollment process is&#xD;
      expected to take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, depending on group assignment and&#xD;
      participant familiarity with using Fitbits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This, plus an exit survey (given via text message or phone, whichever the participant&#xD;
      prefers), will be the extent of participation for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the intervention group will be instructed on how to use MapTrek, the virtual&#xD;
      walking race, and will also be given an instruction packet to refer to later. Data collected&#xD;
      during the first week from the Fitbit will be used to compute baseline activity level. This&#xD;
      baseline data will be used to place participants into an appropriate initial race group.&#xD;
      Participants are placed into groups with other individuals who are active at a similar level,&#xD;
      so that groups will be competitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each virtual walking race will begin on Monday morning and end on Saturday night. Results of&#xD;
      each race will be announced on Sundays. Depending on their performance each week, group&#xD;
      assignment may change. Participants will compete in 8 week-long races over the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 2-4 text messages per day including a daily status report and a&#xD;
      link to view the race. They will also periodically receive challenge messages. If a&#xD;
      participant completes a challenge, they will be awarded bonus steps to help move them along&#xD;
      the route quicker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To win a race, a participant must be furthest along on the route at 11:59 pm on Saturday.&#xD;
      There is a leaderboard within MapTrek that helps participants determine their standing within&#xD;
      each race. Participants are allowed to choose the screen name displayed on the leaderboard so&#xD;
      that they may remain anonymous if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, the following data will be collected about all participants: first and last&#xD;
      name, last 4 of social security number (for consent documentation and to look up records in&#xD;
      CPRS), age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, height, weight, body mass index, blood&#xD;
      pressure, zip code, current medications, and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study (9 weeks), the following data will be collected about all&#xD;
      participants: height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, current medications, and&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study (9 weeks), participants will be contacted via text message or phone&#xD;
      call (based on their preference at baseline) to complete an exit survey. This survey will&#xD;
      take approximately 10 minutes to complete. All participants will be contacted up to 3 times&#xD;
      to complete the exit survey. If they cannot be reached, they will be considered lost to&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

    <description>Veterans in the intervention group receive a Fitbit and access to VA MapTrek, an interactive text-messaging platform. The only equipment needed is a Fitbit (we provide) and a smartphone (required to enroll). Each week, Veterans are assigned to a virtual walking route. Each day, they receive a text message with a link to the current route. The link will take them to a map where they can see their progress and the progress of others. A leaderboard provides information on how many steps each participant has taken. Throughout each race, participants will randomly receive challenge text messages. Completing a challenge awards bonus steps to propel their character along the map.</description>
