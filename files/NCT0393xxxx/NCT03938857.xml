      Multicenter, double blind randomized controlled trial of fentanyl vs. fentanyl +&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine as the initial regimen for maintenance of sedation in&#xD;
      mechanically-ventilated, critically ill children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the opioid-sparing effect of dexmedetomidine when administered with&#xD;
      fentanyl to mechanically ventilated, critically ill children. Study drug or placebo will be&#xD;
      administered with fentanyl, which will be titrated to achieve sedation scores consistent with&#xD;
      response to light touch. Plasma samples and bedside assessments for pain, sedation, and&#xD;
      delirium will be collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of sedation&#xD;
      regimens in critically ill children. Testing the hypothesis of mean daily fentanyl dose&#xD;
      through day 7 of mechanical ventilation will be reduced by â‰¥25% by the addition of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine to fentanyl therapy. This trial will involve multiple clinical sites.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur by individual and investigators will be blinded to study/treatment&#xD;
      arm. The statistical analysis will account for center effects, participant characteristics&#xD;
      (including post-surgical state), and changes over time to minimize bias. In addition, PIs and&#xD;
      study coordinators will undergo training to standardize assessment procedures. The study will&#xD;
      randomize participants to receive placebo (fentanyl standard of care) titrated to&#xD;
      sedation+saline placebo (bolus+infusion) or one of the following 3 Dexmedetomidine treatment&#xD;
      arms in a sequential cohort fashion: Cohort 1: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation +&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.2 mcg/kg/hr infusion); Cohort 2: Fentanyl SOC&#xD;
      titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.5mcg/kg/hr infusion); and,&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load +&#xD;
      0.7mcg/kg/hr infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis is planned for this trial.&#xD;

    <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The SBS is a 6-point scale that ranges from +2 to -3 with -3. Scores that are more negative reflect a more sedated state (-3). Scores that are more positive reflect a more agitated state (+2). Zero is awake and easily calmed.</description>

        <title>Sedation Based on the State Behavior Scale (SBS) Relative to Fentanyl Plasma Concentrations (Cmax)</title>
        <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The SBS is a 6-point scale that ranges from +2 to -3 with -3. Scores that are more negative reflect a more sedated state (-3). Scores that are more positive reflect a more agitated state (+2). Zero is awake and easily calmed.</description>

          <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The SBS is a 6-point scale that ranges from +2 to -3 with -3. Scores that are more negative reflect a more sedated state (-3). Scores that are more positive reflect a more agitated state (+2). Zero is awake and easily calmed.</description>

        <title>Sedation Based on SBS Scale Relative to Dexmedetomidine Plasma Concentrations (AUC)</title>
        <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The SBS is a 6-point scale that ranges from +2 to -3 with -3. Scores that are more negative reflect a more sedated state (-3). Scores that are more positive reflect a more agitated state (+2). Zero is awake and easily calmed.</description>

          <title>Sedation Based on RASS Scale Relative to Dexmedetomidine Plasma Concentrations (Cmax)</title>
          <description>Characterize the exposure response relationships of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine when administered alone or in combination in children receiving mechanical ventilation. PK is known to be altered in children compared to adults, and in those with critical illness. Characterization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships can improve dose optimization when dose may not be equivalent to plasma exposure and related effect. The RASS scale is a 10-point scale that ranges from -5 to +4 with -5=unarousable and +4=combative. Zero means the patient is alert and calm.</description>
