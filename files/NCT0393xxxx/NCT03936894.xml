  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canakinumab is an anti-interleukin 1 beta (IL1β) antibody approved for use in young children&#xD;
      with familial Mediterranean fever, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and&#xD;
      TNF-receptor associated periodic fever syndrome. This study is a pilot trial to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of canakinumab on clinical safety and potential clinical efficacy as demonstrated&#xD;
      by short-term changes in select serum biomarkers in a sample of young boys with DMD who are&#xD;
      most likely to have high levels of muscle inflammation. Steroid naive DMD subjects aged&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 2 years old to less than 6 years old will receive a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous dose of canakinumab and undergo safety and serum biomarker monitoring for 30&#xD;
      days. The first 3 subjects will receive 2 mg/kg and if well tolerated, the second 3 subjects&#xD;
      will receive 4 mg/kg.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, single ascending dose study to assess safety and to evaluate&#xD;
      short-term changes in biomarkers. The first 3 boys will receive canakinumab at a dose of 2&#xD;
      mg/kg, and the second 3 will receive a dose of 4 mg/kg. The study is comprised of four&#xD;
      visits: a screening visit with baseline lab assessment, treatment day, a 10-14 day&#xD;
      post-treatment evaluation with safety labs, and a 30 day post-treatment evaluation with&#xD;
      safety labs. There will be a phone assessment on day 3-5 after treatment to screen for any&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will screen for clinical AEs and SAEs. If dose escalation (4 mg/kg) must&#xD;
      be terminated due to dose-limiting toxicities, the remaining subjects may be enrolled to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of canakinumab at the lower dose level (2 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One blood draw will occur after consent at least 48 hours prior to treatment day and on days&#xD;
      10-14 and 30 after the canakinumab injection to screen for laboratory abnormalities and&#xD;
      collect serum for biomarker analysis. After obtaining consent, prior to treatment, 2 red top&#xD;
      and 1 purple top 4 cc tubes will be obtained for screening labs and serum biomarker&#xD;
      collection. Tuberculosis screening (Quantiferon-Gold) will use 4 blood tubes (grey, yellow,&#xD;
      purple, green) with 1 cc of blood in each. At the following 2 visits with blood draws, two&#xD;
      red top and one purple top collection tubes of 4 cc will be collected per subject. For red&#xD;
      top blood collection tubes, one tube will be sent to the clinical lab for safety lab&#xD;
      processing. The second tube will be processed in the research lab for serum biomarkers.&#xD;

             drug administration];&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings&#xD;

             determine reproducibility. In addition, subjects may be rescreened if ineligible due&#xD;
             to a transient condition which would prevent the subject from participating, such as&#xD;
             an upper respiratory tract infection or injury.&#xD;
