  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the risk of cardiovascular events associated with the&#xD;
      use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in comparison with the use of&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out separate population-based cohort studies using health care&#xD;
      databases in seven Canadian provinces and the United Kingdom. The study cohort will be&#xD;
      defined by the initiation of a SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor after SGLT2 inhibitors&#xD;
      entered the market. Patients will be followed up until the occurrence of a cardiovascular&#xD;
      event. The results from the separate sites will be combined by meta-analysis to provide an&#xD;
      overall assessment of the risk of cardiovascular events in users of SGLT2 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors will be associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of cardiovascular events in comparison with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE)&#xD;
      associated with the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in comparison&#xD;
      with the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common-protocol approach will be used to conduct retrospective cohort studies using&#xD;
      administrative health care data from seven Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia,&#xD;
      Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) and the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Briefly, the Canadian databases include&#xD;
      population-level data on physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge&#xD;
      abstracts, and dispensations for prescription drugs. The data in Ontario will be restricted&#xD;
      to patients aged 65 years old and older. The CPRD is a clinical database that is&#xD;
      representative of the UK population and contains the records for patients seen at over 680&#xD;
      general practitioner practices in the UK; these data will be linked to the Hospital Episode&#xD;
      Statistics (HES) database, which contains in-hospital diagnosis and procedure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a prevalent new-user cohort design (Suissa et al., 2017). In each&#xD;
      jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a source population that includes all patients&#xD;
      who received an antidiabetic medication (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4&#xD;
      inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,&#xD;
      meglitinides, insulin, or combinations of these drugs) between January 1, 2006 and June 30,&#xD;
      2018 (or the latest date of data availability at each site). From this source population, a&#xD;
      study cohort including all patients who received a prescription for a SGLT2 inhibitor or&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitor on or after the date of the first dispensing (or prescription in CPRD) of a&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitor in each jurisdiction and on or before June 30, 2018 (or latest date of data&#xD;
      availability at each site) will be created. Study cohort entry date will be defined by the&#xD;
      SGLT2 dispensation date or the corresponding dispensation date for a DPP-4 inhibitor in the&#xD;
      matched exposure set. Patients will be followed until the occurrence of an event (defined&#xD;
      below), death, end of healthcare coverage (plus 30 days), or end of the study period,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. Patients will be eligible to enter the cohort twice, a first time&#xD;
      with a DPP-4 prescription and a second time with a SGLT2 prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure will be defined as a prescription for a SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor on the&#xD;
      date of cohort entry. DPP-4 inhibitors will serve as the reference category as both classes&#xD;
      are second- to third-line therapy, and DPP-4 inhibitors have no known association with the&#xD;
      outcome. Analyses will be conducted using an as-treated approach. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      until drug discontinuation or the initiation of the other study drug. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be MACE, defined as a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or&#xD;
      cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes will include the individual endpoints of MACE,&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prevalent new-user design with time-based exposure sets, each user of a SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor will be matched to a DPP-4 inhibitor user on the number of prior antidiabetic&#xD;
      medication classes and on time-conditional propensity score. Cox proportional hazards models&#xD;
      will be used to estimate site-specific adjusted hazards ratios (HR) and corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidential intervals (CI) for each outcome of interest among patients exposed to a SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor in comparison to those exposed to a DPP-4 inhibitor. As secondary analyses, the&#xD;
      MACE and heart failure outcomes will be stratified by age (â‰¥70 and &lt;70 years), sex, prior&#xD;
      insulin use, and SGLT2 molecule. The MACE composite outcome will be stratified by history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and the heart failure outcome by history of heart failure.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of study results and address&#xD;
      some of the study limitations. Meta-analyses of the site-specific results will be performed&#xD;
      using random effects models.&#xD;
