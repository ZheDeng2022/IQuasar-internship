  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare foot care knowledge, behaviour and glycaemic control&#xD;
      in patients at increased risk of diabetic foot ulcers. Participants will receive either usual&#xD;
      diabetic foot care education and follow-up as per evidence-based guidelines or usual care and&#xD;
      follow-up, supplemented with an educational video and weekly foot alerts via a phone&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recommended that patients who are at moderate or high risk of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)&#xD;
      are seen by a healthcare professional for foot review every 2-6 months. Yet, diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers remain the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation with an amputation&#xD;
      occurring every 20 secs. This suggests that additional information and prompts, as well as&#xD;
      regular follow-up, are required. Additionally, long term diabetic foot complications&#xD;
      including loss of protective pain sensation are related to poor glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single blinded randomised study aims to determine if weekly foot alerts (a total of 12&#xD;
      alerts cycled over 12-months), delivered by the MyU phone application in combination with&#xD;
      usual education routes and follow-up, improves patient foot care behaviour and foot care&#xD;
      knowledge. Using standardized questionnaires at baseline and 12-months. Furthermore, does the&#xD;
      frequency of viewing/engaging in foot alert content influence foot care knowledge and&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine: 1) if individuals who receive 7-foot review&#xD;
      appointments in a 12-month period have better foot care knowledge and behaviour when compared&#xD;
      to those seen less frequently regardless of educational route. 2) Baseline and 12-months&#xD;
      HbA1c blood test will be measured to establish if any changes occurred between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The investigators hypothesized that participants randomised to the&#xD;
      intervention group (Phone app) will have improved foot care knowledge and foot health&#xD;
      behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 100 patients with a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard operating procedure based on established diabetic foot screening tools will be&#xD;
      used to ensure the inter-rater reliability of foot assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational material will go through back translation to ensure the accuracy of the content.&#xD;
      Feedback on content, meaning and usability of the English and Arabic documents from a sample&#xD;
      of 10 participants will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain investigator blinding the participants will be escorted to the video viewing room&#xD;
      by a research coordinator.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the adapted Diabetic Foot Care Knowledge test (Pollock et al. 2004 and Rheeder et al. 2008) score between baseline and 12-months in the two groups This 12-question test has a maximum score of 12, and a minimum score of 0. Each correct answer is given one point, where a low score denotes low knowledge and high score denotes high knowledge. For each group a mean will be calculated and significance of differences will be tested using the students two tailed unpaired T-Test.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in foot care behaviour as measured by the SDSCA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>SDCS questionnaire includes a number of domains which evaluate different aspects of patient behaviour performed during the previous week. Each domain has one or more questions that are marked between 0-7. The domains are:&#xD;
Foot care: total of 9 questions with maximum score 9x7 = 63, the greater the score the better the behaviour&#xD;
Diabetes Management: 4 questions in diabetes management, maximum score 4x7 = 28, the greater the score the better the behaviour&#xD;
Smoking habits: number of cigarettes per day, the greater the number the worse the behaviour&#xD;
These measures allow formulation of a composite reflection in changes in the patient's behaviour between baseline and 12-months in the two groups. Differences will be tested using the students two-tailed unpaired T-Test.</description>
