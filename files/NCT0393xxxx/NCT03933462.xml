  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Jet nebulizers have been the standard delivery system for aerosolized medications commonly&#xD;
      prescribed to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients; however, these devices&#xD;
      are inefficient and require an external pressurized gas source to operate. Vibrating mesh&#xD;
      nebulizers have a significantly higher efficiency of delivering drugs to the lung compared to&#xD;
      conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers because of the high fine particle fraction created&#xD;
      by the rapid vibration. This post-market study will investigate the potential benefits of a&#xD;
      vibrating mesh nebulizer compared a standard jet nebulizer. The study will include stable,&#xD;
      ambulatory COPD patients who are currently using a jet nebulizer system. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to use each device for a period of 30 days. Patient preference and changes to quality&#xD;
      of life will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Participants will be contacted by designated study site staff. Participants may be&#xD;
      pre-screened through medical records over the phone to assess potential eligibility. A&#xD;
      screening script will include a general review of key inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Participants that are interested will be scheduled for a screening visit at the clinical&#xD;
      office.&#xD;

    <description>Device preference after 60 days of device use as determined by the nebulizer satisfaction questionnaire in stable ambulatory Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.&#xD;
The nebulizer satisfaction questionnaire is an 11 question survey developed to determine device satisfaction. 10 questions are answered on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best. The last question in the survey is in regards to device preference and is only asked at the end of the study.</description>

    <description>Change in quality of life scores (mean difference) after 30 days of each device use compared to baseline as determined by the Chronic Respiratory disease Questionnaire - Self-Report (CRQ-SR). The scores for each question in each dimension are simply added together. Using a seven-point scale for the responses, the minimum and maximum scores for each dimension are as follows: Minimum score Maximum score (Worst function is 1) (Best function is 7)</description>

Difference in modified Borg score from pre-nebulizer to post-6MWT for each device. This is a scale that asks you to rate the difficulty of your breathing. It starts at number 0 where your breathing is causing you no difficulty at all and progresses through to number 10 where your breathing difficulty is maximal.</description>

    <description>The InnoSpire Go is a handheld, single patient use, vibrating mesh nebulizer system designed to aerosolize liquid medications for respiratory disease. The device operates continuously once initiated and automatically switches off once the medication has been delivered. The device may be used in pediatric and adult populations, as permitted by the prescribed medication, and is suitable for use in home environments or hospital/clinic settings.</description>

    <description>Jet Nebulizers are the standard delivery system for aerosolized medications. A nebulizer breaks up medical solutions into small droplets suspended in air (aerosol) so that they may be delivered to the patient's airways for respiratory therapy.</description>

        <description>Device preference after 60 days of device use as determined by the nebulizer satisfaction questionnaire in stable ambulatory Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.&#xD;
The nebulizer satisfaction questionnaire is an 11 question survey developed to determine device satisfaction. 10 questions are answered on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best. The last question in the survey is in regards to device preference and is only asked at the end of the study.</description>

The change in the modified Borg score following nebulizer use, where the visit's pre-nebulizer Borg score will be used as the baseline for this endpoint. Difference in modified Borg score from pre-nebulizer to post-6MWT for each device. This is a scale that asks you to rate the difficulty of your breathing.

The change in the modified Borg score following nebulizer use, where the visit's pre-nebulizer Borg score will be used as the baseline for this endpoint. Difference in modified Borg score from pre-nebulizer to post-6MWT for each device. This is a scale that asks you to rate the difficulty of your breathing. It starts at number 0 where your breathing is causing you no difficulty at all and progresses through to number 10 where your breathing difficulty is maximal.</description>

            <description>The InnoSpire Go is a handheld, single patient use, vibrating mesh nebulizer system designed to aerosolize liquid medications for respiratory disease. The device operates continuously once initiated and automatically switches off once the medication has been delivered. The device may be used in pediatric and adult populations, as permitted by the prescribed medication, and is suitable for use in home environments or hospital/clinic settings.&#xD;
