      Recently the new concept of &quot;mechanical power&quot; has been proposed. It refers to the amount of&#xD;
      energy per minute that is transferred to the lung by the ventilator. The generation of this&#xD;
      form of energy would include both parameters that were previously proposed to be possible&#xD;
      causes for lung damage and new parameters that had not been taken into account until now,&#xD;
      such as the flow rate or the respiratory rate, without forgetting the individual&#xD;
      characteristics of each ventilated subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to know the value of the mechanical power in the&#xD;
      patient connected to mechanical ventilation, in a volume control model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This value will be calculated from electronically provided data using the simplified formula&#xD;

      Introduction and justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years the investigators have witnessed an important technological&#xD;
      developement in the field of mechanical ventilation. Along with the technological advances,&#xD;
      the better understanding of the respiratory physiopathology has shown that mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation &quot;per se&quot; can lead to deleterious effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the search for those variables which are responsible for the developing of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) has become an important goal in this field. In fact,&#xD;
      the investigators are witnessing the nearly exponential increase in the publication of&#xD;
      studies that have tried to associate the different parameters that intervene in mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation with the injury to the lung structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the new concept of &quot;mechanical power&quot; has been proposed. It refers to the amount of&#xD;
      energy per minute that is transferred to the lung by the ventilator. The generation of this&#xD;
      form of energy would include both parameters that were previously proposed to be possible&#xD;
      causes for lung damage and new parameters that had not been taken into account until now,&#xD;
      such as the flow rate or the respiratory rate, without forgetting the individual&#xD;
      characteristics of each ventilated subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12J/min has been stablished experimentally as the energy threshold from where changes in the&#xD;
      lung that can lead to VILI begin to appear. Nevertheless, the true issue would be to get to&#xD;
      know the best way to normalize the mechanical power value. However, it seems reasonable to&#xD;
      think that the values of energy originating VILI in experimental animal models and in humans&#xD;
      are different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, in spite of the wide range of monitoring systems that the investigators have, the&#xD;
      investigators still don´t know the real mechanical power that the investigators are&#xD;
      transmitting to our patients. The different research teams that have deepened into the&#xD;
      subject have seen themselves forced to infer their results from retrospective data and from&#xD;
      very selected samples of patients immersed in different studies. As one of the first steps in&#xD;
      the way of a better understanding of the impact of &quot;mechanical power&quot;, the investigators&#xD;
      believe it is justified to develope a descriptive and observational study to get to know the&#xD;
      real mechanical power value the investigators ventilate our patients in the ICU with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical guides and recommendations aimed at improving ventilation basing on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the different pathologies in order to minimize VILI do exist, but the fact&#xD;
      remains that the threshold of mechanical power in mechanical ventilation is still unkown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the present study is that the mechanical power received by the&#xD;
      patients who need mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unis is greater tan the&#xD;
      threshold that has been established by experimental models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators think that mechanical power varies considerably depending on the&#xD;
      current and previous pathology of the patient and the days on mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting on the previous hypothesis, the main objective of the current study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Know the value of the mechanical power in the patient connected to mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      in a volume control model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This value will be calculated from electronically provided data using the simplified formula&#xD;
      by Gattinonni et. Al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the epidemiology of different modalities in ventilatory, not just VC, on the&#xD;
           basis of the collected variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the transmitted mechanical power varies depending on the pathology, on the&#xD;
           days on mechanical ventilation or on the reason that leads to the need for mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of a ventilatory mode which allows spontaneus breathing, the investigators can&#xD;
           see the variability of the plateau pressure and if the investigators can infer its value&#xD;
           in the calculation of mechanical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the driving pressure and the ventilatory ratio of ventiled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish differences among the main analysed parameters depending on the type of&#xD;
           critical carea area studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional, observational, prospective and analytical study. The variables of the study&#xD;
      will be collected on a fixed date as agreed with the participating ICU. These variables will&#xD;
      be registered during the period of time between 8 am to 15 pm on the 21st of November 2019,&#xD;
      in order to adjust to the normal working routine at an intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that are hospitalised in a critical care unit and on mechanical ventilation on&#xD;
      the 21st of November 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients hospitalised in a crital care unit who are on invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, whatever the cause.&#xD;
