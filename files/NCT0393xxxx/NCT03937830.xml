    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Most people with&#xD;
      advanced HCC survive an average of 6 to 9 months. Researchers are evaluating a combination of&#xD;
      treatment drugs to delay the progression of HCC; aiming to help people with HCC live longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the 6-month progression-free survival in people with advanced HCC treated with&#xD;
      bevacizumab, durvalumab, and TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with intermediate or advanced HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have tests&#xD;
      to evaluate their hearts as well as blood and urine. A CT and/or MRI scans will be done&#xD;
      during the study. If a prior tumor sample is not available; participants may undergo a&#xD;
      biopsy. They may undergo an endoscopy of their esophagus and stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs in 21-day cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatment drugs will be injected into a vein every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have an interventional treatment procedure done by interventional radiology&#xD;
      under sedation; chemotherapy beads will be infused into artery branches in the liver.&#xD;
      Participants may have to stay in the hospital for 24 hours for observation, after this&#xD;
      procedure. This interventional procedure may be done more than once during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may need to repeat some of the screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have to stop taking some of their cancer treatment drugs during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue on the study until their cancer progresses or until the side&#xD;
      effects of the treatment drugs are not tolerable....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer&#xD;
           related death with a median survival of 6-9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is relatively uncommon and includes cancers of the&#xD;
           gallbladder and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal system, although periampullary&#xD;
           tumors are often considered part of this group as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A class of agents that in the recent years has been at the epicenter of immunotherapy&#xD;
           approaches in gastrointestinal malignancies are the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against&#xD;
           the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 )&#xD;
           subclass. Durvalumab inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to&#xD;
           programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CD80. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies directly target tumor&#xD;
           cells and are expected to have less adverse events in comparison with anti-PD-1&#xD;
           antibodies that target effector T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremelimumab is a-uman IgG2 mAb directed against CTLA-4. Tremelimumab blocks the&#xD;
           inhibitory effect of CTLA-4, and therefore enhances T cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood capillaries, which is a complex&#xD;
           process that promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other proangiogenic&#xD;
           factor expression, thus enhancing metastasis. Inhibition of VEGF function by bevacizumab&#xD;
           can lead to the inhibition of the new blood vessels formation surrounding a tumor, and&#xD;
           consequently arrest the tumor growth by depriving essential nutrients and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TACE has been shown to induce anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early phase studies have shown that anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab in combination&#xD;
           with TACE decreases neovascular formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have previously shown that locoregional therapies can be safely combined with immune&#xD;
           checkpoint blockade. There are also preclinical data suggesting that anti-VEGF therapy&#xD;
           may target myeloid cells with suppressor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced HCC&#xD;
           BCLC stage B treated with bevacizumab, durvalumab, tremelimumab and TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the 6-month PFS in patients with BTC and HCC BCLC stage C treated with&#xD;
           bevacizumab, durvalumab and tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathological confirmation of HCC or BTC or histopathological confirmation of&#xD;
           carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics which, together&#xD;
           with the pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,&#xD;
&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This is an open label Phase II trial conducted to evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
&#xD;
      durvalumab, bevacizumab and tremelimumab combined treatment in patients with advanced HCC&#xD;
      BCLC stage C or BTC and efficacy of durvalumab, bevacizumab, tremelimumab and TACE combined&#xD;
      treatment in patients with advanced HCC BCLC stage B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially 3-6 patients with HCC BCLC Stage C or BTC will be enrolled into safety run-in&#xD;
           of Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           1 to determine the safety of combined treatment of durvalumab, bevacizumab and&#xD;
           tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once safety has been determined, subsequent patients with HCC BCLC Stage C and BTC will&#xD;
           be enrolled in Arm 1 and patients with HCC BCLC Stage B will start enrollment into Arm&#xD;
           2,&#xD;
&#xD;
      consistent of durvalumab, bevacizumab, tremelimumab and multiple TACE procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Treatment will continue until progression or unbearable toxicity.&#xD;
