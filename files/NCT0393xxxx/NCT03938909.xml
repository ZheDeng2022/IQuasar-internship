    <textblock>
      There is a long history of research into body fluid biomarkers in neurodegenerative and&#xD;
      neuroinflammatory diseases. However, only a few biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are&#xD;
      being used in clinical practice. One of the most critical factors in biomarker research is&#xD;
      the inadequate linkage of biological samples with data from medical records, environmental&#xD;
      exposure, lifestyle information and other medically relevant information. In this context the&#xD;
      biobanks are an invaluable resource for medical research and, in particular, for the&#xD;
      identification of biomarkers. This project aims to enstablish a biobank for Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis that allow to collect periodically, at each follow up, clinical data, tissues such&#xD;
      as blood and cerebrospinal fluid and DNA, RNA, proteins, from patients afferent at the Centre&#xD;
      for the Study and Cure of Multiple Sclerosis in Neurological Institute &quot;Neuromed&quot;, Pozzilli,&#xD;
      Isernia. The samples stored in this biobank are examined by quantization of a potential&#xD;
      innovative biomarker focused on the formation of circulating mitochondrial DNA. Fragments of&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are released outside the cell and they appear to persist in&#xD;
      extracellular ﬂuids as circulating, cell-free, mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This occurs during acute inﬂammation, which anticipates the neurodegenerative process. Thus,&#xD;
      an increase in inﬂammatory cells in the affected regions is expected to add on mtDNA release&#xD;
      into the CSF. Thus, ccf-mtDNA may represent a powerful biomarker for disease screening and&#xD;
      prognosis at early stage, although its biological role may extend to generating the&#xD;
      neurobiology of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify a technique that allows to isolate, the mitochondrial DNA circulating from&#xD;
           different biological tissues (Droplet Digital PCR, Real Time PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use different technologies to quantify the presence of circulating mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use circulating mitochondrial DNA as a biomarker of neurodegenerative and / or&#xD;
           neuroinflammatory pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to understand the tissue specific origin of circulating mtDNA for both&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. . We believe that our current knowledge on cell&#xD;
      free circulating mtDNA is in a rather exploratory phase with a potential for the future to&#xD;
      rewrite the pathology of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality such as inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions, autoimmune disorders, cancer, heart disease, stroke and injury.&#xD;

      To date, the specific causes of multiple sclerosis (MS) remain uncertain, and in its&#xD;
      pathogenesis an interaction between environmental and genetic factors has been implicated&#xD;
      leading to inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS). Epidemiological studies conducted in ethnic groups of families, twins, half sibs and&#xD;
      conjugate pairs support a genetic component to this process. The risk for monozygotic twins&#xD;
      is 300-times, and for first-degree relatives 20-50-times higher than for an individual in the&#xD;
      general population of Northern-European origin with a prevalence rate of 0.1. The&#xD;
      transmission patterns observed are not compatible with an autosomal dominant, recessive or&#xD;
      X-linked inheritance. MS is a complex trait disorder, defined by several genes, each exerting&#xD;
      small effect, and in an interaction with the environment. Phenotypic expressions of MS&#xD;
      suggest the involvement of complex mechanisms with features of autoimmunity and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. The currently approved disease modifying drugs are mainly targeted towards&#xD;
      the inflammatory components, but exert a limited effect on neurodegeneration in MS. The&#xD;
      cognitive impairment can be an early feature of the demyelinating disease process, and in a&#xD;
      few cases dementia has been documented in the absence of severe neurological signs. There are&#xD;
      some correlation between disease subtype and cognitive impairment: in fact, it is well known&#xD;
      that cognitive impairment occurs more frequently and is more severe in patients with&#xD;
      progressive rather than in relapsing-remitting MS. Impairment of cognitive domains such as&#xD;
      memory, mental processing speed attention and executive function can occur from the early&#xD;
      stage of the diseases and tend to worsen over time. Moreover, the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders&#xD;
      observed in MS are not fully understood. White matter abnormalities alone cannot fully&#xD;
      explain the extent of clinical symptoms in MS, including cognitive impairment. Furthermore,&#xD;
      several MRI techniques have shown the involvement of gray matter in MS and the association&#xD;
      between gray matter damage, physical disability and cognitive impairment. Therefore,&#xD;
      biomarkers that reliably capture the different aspects of disease heterogeneity are needed,&#xD;
      and might help to better understand MS disease aetiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis,&#xD;
      to predict response outcome to treatments, and to develop new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, there is increasing effort to develop molecular diagnostic markers that meet&#xD;
      requirements like easy accessibility e.g., from blood, high specificity and sensitivity, low&#xD;
      costs and applicability by laboratories with standard equipment. Several blood, plasma, or&#xD;
      serum MS biomarkers have been proposed to meet these criteria. In order of this the&#xD;
      circulating markers are represented, in addition to the classic serum markers, also by the&#xD;
      cells and by free circulating nucleic acids (DNA, RNA). In recent years, among the&#xD;
      circulating nucleic acids, a possible role of mitochondrial DNA has emerged as a biomarker in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of numerous pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, mtDNA is significantly smaller when compared with nuclear DNA (16.569bp vs. 3.2&#xD;
      billion bp), and it possesses only 37 genes, among which 13 encode proteins belonging to the&#xD;
      respiratory electron transport chain. Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA is devoid of protective&#xD;
      histones and sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms, which makes it vulnerable to genotoxic&#xD;
      stimuli including oxidative stress. In fact, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are&#xD;
      generated around mtDNA during oxidative phosphorylation occurring in mitochondria. Such an&#xD;
      oxidative environment contributes to a high susceptibility of mtDNA to mutagenesis. In fact,&#xD;
      mtDNA possesses roughly a 10- to 200-fold higher rate of mutagenesis than nuclear DNA under a&#xD;
      comparable oxidative stress environment. This may be detrimental for those&#xD;
      high-energy-demanding and post-mitotic cells including neurons and myocytes, which are mostly&#xD;
      sensitive to altered respiratory chain activity and ROS-mediated damage yielded by mtDNA&#xD;
      changes. Such a specific vulnerability of mtDNA determines the occurrence of a detectable&#xD;
      amount of mitochondrial DNA fragments, which are released into the bloodstream as&#xD;
      circulating, cell-free fragments (ccf-mtDNA). These correspond to double-stranded DNA&#xD;
      molecules, which are biologically fragmented into both short (lower than 1 Kb) and long (up&#xD;
      to 21 kb) segments. The high rate of mtDNA fragmentation is key in generating ccf-mtDNA,&#xD;
      though it remains unclear whether mtDNA is released due to a disruption of the plasma&#xD;
      membrane or it is actively extruded from the cell. For instance, oxidative stress or other&#xD;
      stimuli can damage cell integrity, while producing apoptosis or necrosis, which in turn lead&#xD;
      to mtDNA extrusion from the cell or release into the blood. Nonetheless, even in baseline&#xD;
      conditions when the plasma membrane is intact, fragments of mutated mtDNA could be&#xD;
      compartmentalized within cytosolic organelles and then released extracellularly. This latter&#xD;
      mechanism would guarantee the preservation of mitochondrial function by removing&#xD;
      dysfunctional mutated DNA fragments. This is supported by recent work from C. elegans&#xD;
      neurons, which expel dysfunctional mitochondria when exposed to neurotoxic stress.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the biological role of ccf-mtDNA and its fragments is still controversial and it&#xD;
      needs to be fully understood. In fact, DNA fragments may act as toxic molecules, which in&#xD;
      turn impair mitochondrial function and cell membrane, and could also act on cell integrity&#xD;
      and tissue repair. This is largely bound to the established, yet double faceted, involvement&#xD;
      of mtDNA in innate immunity and inflammation. In fact, similar to bacterial DNA, mtDNA&#xD;
      possesses non-methylated CpG sites, which once released in either cytosol or extracellular&#xD;
      space behave as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate innate immunity and&#xD;
      inflammation. This occurs via specific biochemical cascades involving the binding of mtDNA to&#xD;
      Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and subsequent activation of the stimulator of interferon genes&#xD;
      (STING) pathway. These are key in generating inflammatory responses including antimicrobial&#xD;
      immunity and neuro-immunological disorders. In fact, DAMPs accumulation activates resident&#xD;
      macrophages and fosters tissue infiltration by leukocytes. As for most molecules involved in&#xD;
      the immune response, the bulk of evidence concerning the measurement of ccf-mtDNA and its&#xD;
      role in physiology and disease stems from studies carried out outside the CNS. In fact,&#xD;
      ccf-mtDNA has been analysed in various clinical conditions like neoplasia, trauma,&#xD;
      infections, stroke and cardiovascular diseases, where it has been tested as diagnostic and&#xD;
      predictive biomarker. Only recently, mtDNA started being evaluated in neurological disorders.&#xD;
      In line with the higher resistance of mtDNA to nuclease-dependent degradation compared with&#xD;
      nDNA, mtDNA persists as ccf-mtDNA within extracellular ﬂuids including the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNS disorders featuring a strong inﬂammatory response are characterized by elevated plasma&#xD;
      mtDNA level. In fact, elevated CSF ccf-mtDNA occur in relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and PMS.&#xD;
      RRMS is characterized by an acute inﬂammatory response, which precedes neurodegeneration.&#xD;
      Thus, the increase in ccf-mtDNA observed in RRMS is a direct consequence of increased&#xD;
      activation of inﬂammatory cells. These cells release mtDNA in addition to nDNA, into the CSF.&#xD;
      A persistent inflammatory reaction may recruit circulating immune cells while triggering a&#xD;
      systemic response through the activation of mtDNA-induced inflammatory pathways. In this way,&#xD;
      a vicious circle occurs where inflammatory cytokines and ROS may induce further damage to&#xD;
      mitochondria and mtDNA. In this scenario, elevated ccf-mtDNA concentration in MS may reflect&#xD;
      early, active inflammatory activity, which eventually culminates in mitochondrial damage,&#xD;
      neural loss and brain atrophy. In this condition, the measurement of ccf-mtDNA concentration&#xD;
      configures as a potential biomarker for acute inflammatory stress. Whether this phenomenon is&#xD;
      specific for MS or it rather reflects a generic neuro-inflammation still needs to be&#xD;
      investigated. Since mitochondrial damage occurs in active MS lesions, mtDNA in the CSF could&#xD;
      reflect its role as a DAMP. Considering mtDNA as a DAMP in MS, may explain the &quot;inside-out&#xD;
      theory&quot; which suggests that inflammation is secondary to a primary intrinsic process within&#xD;
      neurons or other cells such as oligodendrocytes. This neuro-immune concept consists in the&#xD;
      formation of intracellular compounds, which trigger biochemical cascades leading to immunity&#xD;
      activation (inflammasome) which once released from the cell recruit in turn a focal immune&#xD;
      response. In this scenario, the &quot;inside&quot; mtDNA fragment would be the inflammatory stimulus,&#xD;
      which clusters the intracellular cascade leading to a molecular complex, which triggers the&#xD;
      immune response. Once such a complex is exposed &quot;out&quot; of the cell, immunity is strongly&#xD;
      activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, ccf-mtDNA may be a potential biomarker of cell death and non-specific tissue injury,&#xD;
      and in the near future, it is supposed to become an innovative diagnostic tool in early stage&#xD;
      screening and prognosis of several disorders.&#xD;
