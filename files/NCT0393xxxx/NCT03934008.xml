  <brief_summary>

      This study will assess the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based tool in&#xD;
      addressing vaccine hesitancy expressed by parents or caregivers of children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order for vaccines to be effective and protect communities from diseases, a large majority&#xD;
      of individuals need to be vaccinated to protect those who do not respond to the vaccine and&#xD;
      those who cannot be vaccinated. While vaccine hesitancy has been noted as a growing problem&#xD;
      among parents, there are few evidence-based strategies for providers to utilize to discuss&#xD;
      vaccination with these parents. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop effective&#xD;
      communication tools to increase parental confidence in vaccines. A tool based on the&#xD;
      principles of motivational interviewing (a goal-oriented, collaborative counseling style) may&#xD;
      be effective in addressing this need. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the impact&#xD;
      of a motivational interviewing-based (MI-based) tool on pediatric vaccination rates through&#xD;
      assessment of changes in the percentage of patients achieving the goal of completion of all&#xD;
      recommended doses in children 6 years of age and younger. Secondary aims include determining&#xD;
      the impact of the motivational-interviewing based tool on parental health beliefs regarding&#xD;
      vaccines and the impact of the training on provider knowledge and confidence in using&#xD;
      motivational interviewing.&#xD;

    <description>The MOTIVE tool incorporates the principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and provides a flowchart approach in which parental health beliefs have a corresponding MI-based strategy to further explore and/or address the hesitancy. The tool was developed from interviews with pediatricians and pediatric pharmacists, a review of the literature focusing on vaccine health beliefs, and the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) Survey Tool. The tool was reviewed by multiple providers and feedback was provided on its usability in clinical practice when interacting with vaccine-hesitant parents and/or caregivers. The tool was then modified based on this feedback. Pediatric providers will complete four educational sessions on vaccine hesitancy, MI, and the use of the MOTIVE tool in clinical practice prior implementation.</description>
