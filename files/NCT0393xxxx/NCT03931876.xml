    <textblock>
      The present study is a first in human study of an avibactam prodrug to be administered&#xD;
      orally. Avibactam is the β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) component of the intravenous antibiotic&#xD;
      AVYCAZQR (ceftazidime avibactam), approved in the US in 2015 to treat resistant Gram-negative&#xD;
      infections. Avibactam is a non-β-lactam BLI without intrinsic antibacterial activity.&#xD;
      Avibactam binds covalently with bacterial β-lactamases thereby preventing hydrolysis and&#xD;
      inactivation of the partner β-lactam antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arixa and others have shown that that avibactam (the product of AV-006) restores the&#xD;
      susceptibility of many oral β-lactam antibiotics against broad panels of clinical&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates that produce β-lactamases.&#xD;
