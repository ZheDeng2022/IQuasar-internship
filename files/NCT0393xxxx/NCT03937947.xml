  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whilst deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is common following traumatic brain injury (TBI), optimal&#xD;
      timing and safety of pharmacological prophylaxis is uncertain. Paradoxically the harm&#xD;
      associated with the occurrence of is also unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational pilot that aims to define the incidence of proximal DVT in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe TBI. It seeks prospectively to determine if there is an&#xD;
      association between DVT and outcome. It also seeks to explore possible associations between&#xD;
      the occurrence of DVT and the incidence of lung injury and/or ventilator associated&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is common following trauma and patients with TBI are at&#xD;
      increased risk. In studies of TBI that screened for DVT in the proximal lower limb veins, the&#xD;
      incidence is between 14 and 18%. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (PT) may be effective in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of DVT following TBI. However, there is a reluctance to commence it&#xD;
      due to concerns about the risk of intracranial haematoma expansion and contusion enlargement.&#xD;
      PT is therefore often delayed, exposing patients to potential risks and complications of DVT.&#xD;
      Recent systematic reviews could not answer the question of when to commence PT as no high&#xD;
      quality randomised controlled trials addressing this question have been conducted. The latest&#xD;
      edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines could not make a recommendation on this&#xD;
      issue . A Delphi exercise involving the investigator's network of United Kingdom(UK)&#xD;
      Eurotherm3235 study centres found that the leading concern of specialists in UK neurocritical&#xD;
      care, that they felt required further study, was when to commence PT following moderate to&#xD;
      severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paradoxically however, despite these concerns over the use of PT in this population of&#xD;
      patients, evidence of harm associated with the confirmed presence of proximal DVT is not yet&#xD;
      convincing. This has additional significance as without clear evidence of harm associated&#xD;
      with DVT complicating TBI, trials to address the questions of safety and efficacy of earlier&#xD;
      use of PT are difficult to design and unlikely to attract the necessary funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a search of a trauma registry of patients at risk of DVT who underwent venous screening,&#xD;
      in TBI patients the occurrence of DVT was associated with increased ventilator days (Mean&#xD;
      (SD), 18.0 (14.9) vs. 9.3 (7.9) days for DVT vs. no DVT, p=0.014) and ICU length of stay&#xD;
      (23.0 (14.5) vs. 13.1 (9.8) days for DVT vs. no DVT, p=0.006). Similar results were seen in a&#xD;
      post hoc analysis of the EPO TBI trial. This was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the&#xD;
      effect of erythropoietin (EPO) verses placebo on outcome following TBI. Repeated lower limb&#xD;
      screening for the presence of DVT was conducted as part of the protocol. Both ventilator days&#xD;
      (Median (IQR) 11 (6-17) vs. 8 (4-14) days for DVT vs. no DVT, p&lt;0.001) and ICU length of stay&#xD;
      (17 (11-22) vs. 12 (6-19) days DVT vs. no DVT, p&lt;0.001). Good neurological outcome at 6&#xD;
      months was significantly less frequent in those that developed DVT (45.4 vs. 57.9% DVT vs. no&#xD;
      DVT, p=0.01). Whilst these findings are clinically important they are the result of&#xD;
      retrospective and post hoc analysis. They therefore require to be prospectively validated if&#xD;
      they are to be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible explanation for an increase in ventilator dependency and ICU length of stay&#xD;
      could be the occurrence of undiagnosed pulmonary emboli causing acute lung injury (ALI). The&#xD;
      occurrence of ventilation perfusion mismatching, deterioration in arterial partial pressure:&#xD;
      fraction inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2) and radiological changes on chest x-ray, being&#xD;
      interpreted as evidence of pulmonary infection. This is supported by local audit data from&#xD;
      June to October 2017 which found that 37% of brain injured patients had a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and were treated with antibiotics but lacked&#xD;
      subsequent microbiological confirmation. It is also possible that small pulmonary emboli&#xD;
      might predispose to pulmonary infection, explaining why the incidence of ventilator&#xD;
      associated pneumonia (VAP) remains high in this population (40%, in the same local audit)&#xD;
      despite the adoption of measures which have lowered VAP rates in other critically ill patient&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Brain &quot;cross-talk&quot; could link evidence of ALI to a negative impact on neurological&#xD;
      outcome in these patients. A disproportionate increase in mortality in patients with TBI and&#xD;
      ALI has been reported. This was greatly in excess of deaths attributable to pulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction. Similarly, in animal models, ALI was found to be associated with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, and biomarker/histological evidence of neuronal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, potentially multi centre, observational pilot study that aims to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of DVT after TBI. Patients admitted to an ICU within 72 hours of&#xD;
      suffering a TBI will be eligible for inclusion. The study will run for 2 years with a 16&#xD;
      month recruitment period. Based on current activity in Edinburgh the investigators estimate&#xD;
      that 50 to 60 patients will be eligible for recruitment over the course of the study. In&#xD;
      order to ensure satisfactory recruitment, the investigators will also approach centres that&#xD;
      have expressed an interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent is obtained for the patient to be enrolled in the study, a compression&#xD;
      ultrasound scan (USS) of both legs will be carried out as soon as possible so that the first&#xD;
      USS is completed within 72 hours of injury. USS will be repeated on alternate days up to Day&#xD;
      10 from injury. Daily data collection will include information on the use of mechanical and&#xD;
      pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, ventilator dynamics including FiO2 and PaO2, chest X ray&#xD;
      reports, clinical and microbiological diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia,&#xD;
      ventilator days and ICU and hospital length of stay. The Modified Oxford Handicap Scale will&#xD;
      be completed for all patients on day 28, hospital discharge or death whichever is sooner&#xD;
      Patients will then be followed up at 6 months by the study team, at which time an extended&#xD;
      Glasgow Outcome Scale Questionnaire will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An amendment to the protocol is also being prepared to include assessment of blood&#xD;
      coagulation by standard laboratory testing and viscoelastic methods.&#xD;
