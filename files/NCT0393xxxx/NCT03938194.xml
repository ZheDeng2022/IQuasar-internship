      Introduction Men with enlarged prostates commonly experience lower urinary tract symptoms and&#xD;
      may go on to develop complications such as acute urinary retention (AUR). Surgery is the&#xD;
      standard treatment option required to remove the enlarged prostates and to rectify such&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) was first performed over 80 years ago and is still&#xD;
      regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) in&#xD;
      prostates between 30 and 80ml. While TURP results in an improvement in symptoms,&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and long-term complications can include postoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      urinary retention, incontinence, urethral strictures, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory&#xD;
      dysfunction. Aquablation, a novel minimally invasive water ablation therapy combining image&#xD;
      guidance and robotics (AQUABEAM®, Procept BioRobotics, Redwood Shores, CA, USA) for the&#xD;
      targeted and heatfree removal of prostate tissue is one of the efforts in the development of&#xD;
      new technology in recent years to replicate the effectiveness of TURP and at the same time&#xD;
      with an improved safety profile. In this study, investigators plan to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of Aquablation in the management of AUR secondary to BPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method 20 participants are expected in this study. After patients consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study, they will go through Aquablation under general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
      The ablation is delivered by transurethral means. After the procedure, subject is expected to&#xD;
      go home on the following day. Subject will be assessed 3 months and 6 months after the&#xD;
      procedure. Follow-up assessment includes blood tests, prostate ultrasound and urodynamic&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) is a non-malignant growth of the prostate gland that can&#xD;
      lead to a range of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and in some cases eventually leading&#xD;
      to retention of urine. In patients failing to wean off catheter after retention of urine due&#xD;
      to BPE, surgical intervention is the standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical intervention options have evolved from electrosurgical resection to the use of&#xD;
      lasers for enucleation and ablation. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) was first&#xD;
      performed over 80 years ago and is still regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the treatment of&#xD;
      BPE in prostates between 30 and 80ml. While TURP results in a statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms score and and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), perioperative&#xD;
      morbidity and long-term complications can include postoperative bleeding, urinary retention,&#xD;
      incontinence, urethral strictures, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction.&#xD;
      Aquablation, a novel minimally invasive water ablation therapy combining image guidance and&#xD;
      robotics (AQUABEAM®, Procept BioRobotics, Redwood Shores, CA, USA) for the targeted and&#xD;
      heat-free removal of prostate tissue is one of the efforts in the development of new&#xD;
      technology in recent years to replicate the effectiveness of TURP and at the same time with&#xD;
      an improved safety profile. Safety and feasibility of Aquablation in the management of benign&#xD;
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have been proven successful in both canine model and human. Since&#xD;
      then, two other prospective non-randomized trials demonstrated that the surgical ablation of&#xD;
      the prostate using Aquablation had achieved significant and immediate improvement of&#xD;
      functional voiding parameters as well as symptomatic improvement. Two randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials comparing Aquablation against TURP found that Aquablation had produced a similar&#xD;
      improvement in LUTS as TURP, with a better side-effect profile. AQUABEAM® is currently a FDA&#xD;
      approved equipment for the ablation of prostate tissue. It is being used in US as well as in&#xD;
      Europe and New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, all studies focused on the application of Aquablation in patients with LUTS only&#xD;
      secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). In this study, investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of Aquablation in the management of another facet of BPH,&#xD;
      which is retention of urine.&#xD;
