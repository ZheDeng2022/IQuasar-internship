  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare 2 groups in nulliparous women undergoing cervical ripening for&#xD;
      induction of labor. The study hypothesis is that outpatient cervical preparation with a foley&#xD;
      catheter can reduce the induction of labor (IOL) time interval from admission to delivery by&#xD;
      50%. A 30 ml transcervical foley catheter is a safe mode of cervical preparation in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting, as concluded in Diederen et al, Sciscinoe et al, and Kelly et al.&#xD;
      Findings from studies on nulliparous, term, singleton vertex (NTSV) showed patients can be&#xD;
      applied to a wide variety of maternity unit sizes as discussed by Main et al. No previous&#xD;
      study has evaluated the effectiveness of outpatient cervical preparation in the NTSV&#xD;
      population by PUBMED search. Further, no previous study has assessed patient satisfaction&#xD;
      cervical preparation in the outpatient setting and no previous study has evaluated whether&#xD;
      outpatient cervical preparation has an impact on the length of stay and cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization. This study will explore these important questions with the goal of improving&#xD;
      current practices in labor induction to be more patient-centered, pragmatic, and&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Each participant who is offered an induction of labor from the University of California (UC)&#xD;
      Davis Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics will be screened for inclusion criteria. If the&#xD;
      participant meets inclusion criteria the participant will be given general information about&#xD;
      the study and asked if they would like to participate. If so, research coordinators will meet&#xD;
      the participant either during the current clinic visit or a subsequent clinic visit to&#xD;
      consent and enroll the participant in the study. During this meeting, the participant will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to Group 1 or Group 2 by using randomization.com and subject number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be given an appointment for fetal monitoring and transcervical foley&#xD;
      catheter placement at the Antenatal Testing Unit of the UC Davis Ambulatory Care Center. This&#xD;
      may be a same-day appointment. Once the participant presents for her appointment, participant&#xD;
      will undergo a routine cervical examination, and routine ultrasound examination for fetal&#xD;
      presentation and deep vertical pocket. The participant will also have vitals taken and&#xD;
      undergo a brief interview with a provider to rule out rupture of membranes, significant&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding, and other perinatal concerns. In order to undergo outpatient cervical&#xD;
      preparation, the participant must meet the following criteria: Bishop's score &lt;6 on cervical&#xD;
      exam; Normal deep vertical pocket; Cephalic presentation; Negative standard interview to&#xD;
      screen for vaginal bleeding, rupture of membranes, labor, and pre-eclampsia; and Blood&#xD;
      pressure below 160 bpm systolic and 110 bpm diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant meets the above criteria for outpatient cervical preparation, a 30 mL&#xD;
      transcervical foley catheter will be placed. If the participant does not meet criteria,&#xD;
      participant will be sent to Labor and Delivery for possible admission. The participant may&#xD;
      elect to receive pain medication intramuscularly for pain management before or after foley&#xD;
      catheter placement. After catheter placement the participant will undergo a nonstress test&#xD;
      (NST), and if there is no evidence of tachysystole or non-reassuring fetal well-being,&#xD;
      participant will be discharged home with a prescription for tylenol. Upon discharge home, the&#xD;
      participant will receive instructions on keeping catheter on gentle traction and walking. The&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to return once the foley is expelled, or after 24 hours with&#xD;
      the foley in place. The participant will also leave with return precautions including rupture&#xD;
      of membranes, vaginal bleeding, decreased fetal movement, labor, severe pain, and signs or&#xD;
      symptoms of preeclampsia. As a safety measure, the participant will be counseled to call an&#xD;
      24 hour advice nurse line if participant experiences any of the following: Severe pain or&#xD;
      discomfort (greater than 8 out of a 10 point scale); Vaginal bleeding; Loss of fluid;&#xD;
      Contractions more than 5 minutes apart; Decreased fetal movement; Fevers or chills; Severe&#xD;
      headache; Abdominal pain under right rib area; and Spots in vision or blurry vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining procedures in this group will follow the standard Labor and Delivery hospital&#xD;
      procedures at UC Davis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Control The participant will be admitted to Labor and Delivery. The remaining&#xD;
      procedures in this group will follow standard Labor and Delivery hospital procedures at UC&#xD;
      Davis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects is 10-14 months after Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board approval. Approximately 30-40 participant are admitted each month to UC Davis&#xD;
      Labor and Delivery. On average, half of these participants are nulliparous. If approximately&#xD;
      5- 10 participants are recruited to each group each month, it will take 10-14 months to reach&#xD;
      the goal number of subjects. The duration of an individual subject's participation in the&#xD;
      study will be from time of foley catheter insertion (Group 1) or hospital admission time&#xD;
      (Group 2) to the time of hospital discharge. Electronic medical records will be accessed&#xD;
      during and after this time period only pertaining to the participant's labor including&#xD;
      intrapartum and postpartum complications. In addition, participants will be asked survey&#xD;
      questions at the time of study enrollment and on postpartum day 1. The estimated date for the&#xD;
      investigators to complete this study is two months after enrollment has ended.&#xD;
