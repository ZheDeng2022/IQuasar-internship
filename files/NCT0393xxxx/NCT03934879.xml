      This study, Physical Exercise and Contributors to Academic Performance among Adolescents with&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), aims to expand our understanding of the impact of regular&#xD;
      physical exercise on improvement in academic performance. The investigators will focus on the&#xD;
      use of affordable, portable, and achievable interventions that can be easily shared and&#xD;
      incorporated into other academic and home settings. The study will examine the use a regular&#xD;
      vigorous exercise program for helping students with ASD reduce body mass index and improve&#xD;
      executive function, motor performance, sensory responsiveness, and mood. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a collaborative arrangement with an area school to conduct an 18-month exploratory&#xD;
      pilot study of 30 middle- and high-school aged students (12 to 18 years old) with ASD, who&#xD;
      are returning participants or are new to participating in the Fit Club at Gateway Academy.&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the changes elicited by participation in this type of exercise&#xD;
      program will support the formation of adult life skills, impacting on long-term quality of&#xD;
      life for individuals with ASD and children with other conditions.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) typically have social impairment, have&#xD;
      difficulty making decisions and problem solving (executive function) and have impaired motor&#xD;
      performance. As a result, they are less likely to even live independently, be employed, go to&#xD;
      college or get married. Few effective interventions have been found to help with the complex&#xD;
      problems of people with ASD who are unable to establish independent lives. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to begin the examination of using a regular physically challenging exercise program to&#xD;
      support development of executive function (EF) and motor skills among children and young&#xD;
      adults with ASD to improve academic behaviors and participation in adult activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to having social, EF and motor problems, children and young adults with ASD often&#xD;
      participate in limited physical activities, enjoy them less than do typically developing (TD)&#xD;
      children, are less motivated to participate in physical activities than TD children,&#xD;
      experience weight gain from medications, and encounter problems with reduced physical fitness&#xD;
      and obesity. Lack of interest or motivation to exercise may make it difficult for them to&#xD;
      comply with daily physical activity recommendations. As a result, these students are less&#xD;
      likely to be involved in physical activity, enjoy fewer types of leisure activities, and&#xD;
      experience limited relationships with peers, which eventually contribute to lower levels of&#xD;
      participation in adult activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of Physical Activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive processes in TD individuals. It has a&#xD;
      positive influence on symptoms seen in children and adolescents with ASD, including&#xD;
      experiencing reductions in stereotypical behaviors, improved sensory skills and social&#xD;
      responsiveness, improved concentration and memory, weight reduction, improved motor skills,&#xD;
      improvement in executive function and a reduction in repetitive behaviors. Many of these&#xD;
      skills are necessary for adult tasks such as driving, test-taking, employment, and engaging&#xD;
      in other purposeful adult activities. The mechanism of improvement in these cognitive&#xD;
      functions as a result of physical exercise is thought to be caused by increased cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow, up-regulation of neuroprotective growth factors, and the cardiovascular benefits&#xD;
      of exercise, which lead to an improvement in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. It is not&#xD;
      clear, however, if the amount of effort during exercise is related to the improvement in&#xD;
      cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: Participation in activities is how children and young adults develop an&#xD;
      understanding of the expectations of society and gain the physical and social skills needed&#xD;
      to function and flourish, it plays an important role in a child's or young adult's social&#xD;
      development, and it influences long-term mental and physical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood: Having ASD may lead to psychosocial impairments, including depression, anxiety, stress,&#xD;
      and low self-esteem. For example, Shtayermman (2008) reported that 50% of study participants&#xD;
      with Asperger syndrome had made a suicide attempt, while Paquette-Smith, Weiss, and Lunsky&#xD;
      (2014) determined that &quot;36% suicide attempt rate reported in their sample of 50 adults with&#xD;
      Asperger Syndrome was much higher than the national average of 4.6% over a lifetime in the&#xD;
      general population&quot;. Using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), components of&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being will be assessed in this cohort of children during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory Responsiveness: Children and young adults with ASD demonstrate unusual sensory&#xD;
      responses to stimuli more frequently than do typically developing peers or those with other&#xD;
      developmental disorders. In a study comparing children with and without ASD, atypical sensory&#xD;
      responsiveness patterns greater than one standard deviation from the mean were found in up to&#xD;
      95% in children with ASD, compared to 12 to 25% of children without ASD in the various&#xD;
      sensory domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gateway Academy: For this study, the investigators will partner with Gateway Academy, a&#xD;
      private school that utilizes innovative approaches to learning, physical fitness, and social&#xD;
      awareness, and enrolls approximately 55 students of middle to high school age with social and&#xD;
      academic challenges, the majority of whom have an ASD diagnosis. Gateway Academy developed a&#xD;
      Fit Club fitness program seven years ago modeled after an exercise program developed by&#xD;
      Ratey. In addition, a second school, closely matched to Gateway Academy functional levels,&#xD;
      has communicated an interest in participating in the second stage of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, 10 to 15 new students join Gateway Academy who have not participated in an&#xD;
      organized, mandatory exercise intervention (Fit Club). With this study, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to examine the impact of the Fit Club intervention by comparing students new to the Fit&#xD;
      Club intervention throughout the school year, and also by tracking returning students on a&#xD;
      range of factors, including BMI, executive function, motor skills, sleep patterns, and&#xD;
      classroom behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct an 18-month exploratory pilot study of 30 middle- and&#xD;
      high-school aged students (12 to 18 years old) with ASD, who participate in, or are new to&#xD;
      participating in the Fit Club at Gateway Academy. Engagement in exercise and response to&#xD;
      exercise will be constantly monitored for participants. Other participant data will be&#xD;
      collected three times, once at baseline, at the end of the school year, and at the beginning&#xD;
      of the next school year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will adhere to the Fit Club fitness program protocol. All students will&#xD;
      rotate through each fitness module, which includes spin class, Pilates, strengthening&#xD;
      exercises (weight training), basketball, running and rhythm, and cardio fitness. Students&#xD;
      will meet five days per week during their first class of the day for 35 minutes and&#xD;
      participate in two randomly assigned modules for two week periods. After 2 weeks, they&#xD;
      participate in 2 different modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine how students new to the fitness program compare to their returning&#xD;
      peers in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness, motor skills, mood, and activity&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To quantify the changes in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness motor&#xD;
      skills, and mood after participation in a fitness program after one and two semesters for new&#xD;
      and returning students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To determine if greater physical effort is correlated with greater improvement&#xD;
      in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness, motor skills, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: To determine if leisure activity participation patterns vary across ages of&#xD;
      students and change after two semesters of participation in a fitness program.&#xD;

      Evaluation/Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from students will include factors that affect academic performance, including measures&#xD;
      of EF, sensory responsiveness, and motor skills. Physiological statistics such as height and&#xD;
      weight will be collected to calculate Body Mass Indices (BMI) for each participant over the&#xD;
      course of the study. To achieve the greatest validity, assessments have been selected that&#xD;
      obtain the perspectives from several sources: parent/LAR report, teacher report and direct&#xD;
      observation. Parent, student, and teacher questionnaires will be administered online. All&#xD;
      students, teachers, and parents will be able to use computers with access to the internet.&#xD;
      Observation assessments will be conducted by graduate occupational therapy students from the&#xD;
      University of Texas Medical Branch. A FitBit® activity tracking wristband with a heart rate&#xD;
      monitor and wireless syncing capabilities will be worn by participants and will be used to&#xD;
      track resting and peak heart rate, calories burned, steps taken, and sleep quality. Outcome&#xD;
      constructs and performance measures are listed below.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the potential to change policy regarding physical education for students&#xD;
      with ASD. If the results of this study show a strong relationship between the level of&#xD;
      physical exertion and improvements in factors affecting academic performance, it will suggest&#xD;
      adding more physically exerting activities to school curricula for students with ASD. The&#xD;
      positive impact of physical exercise has been observed in previous studies, but this study&#xD;
      may help to clarify the relationship between effort during exercise and improvements in the&#xD;
      factors that support academic performance. The investigators may also gain understanding of&#xD;
      the duration and effort of exercise necessary to see improvements in these factors, and&#xD;
      whether the benefits are sustained. Examination of regression from non-adherence over the&#xD;
      summer will help clarify the necessity of continuous participation. If a relationship is&#xD;
      found between effort and the factors supporting academic performance, it will help to better&#xD;
      identify options for interventions to improve those factors in students with ASD.&#xD;
      Participation data will build a better understanding of leisure activity participation&#xD;
      patterns in adolescents with ASD that will help to guide intervention.&#xD;
