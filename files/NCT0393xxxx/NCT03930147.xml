  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASV mode of ventilation is an automatic mode with closed-loop control used for mechanical&#xD;
      invasive ventilation in intubated patients. It has been studied in adult patients but not in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This interventional physiology study will include 40 children on mechanical invasive&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of ASV in children and compare&#xD;
      physiologic values on ASV mode to Pressure-Control and Pressure-Support mode of ventilation&#xD;
      regarding the participant is on active or passive ventilation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic values will be monitored on different modes of ventilation in a randomized order.&#xD;
      Each participant will be his own control regarding the different modes of ventilation.&#xD;
      Monitoring will be done during 90 minutes for each mode of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have two different phases of ventilation. The first one is the passive phase&#xD;
      (participant does not trigger the ventilator cycle sustainly) in which ASV and&#xD;
      Pressure-Control Ventilation will be performed in a randomized order. The second phase will&#xD;
      be the active ventilation phase (participant does trigger the ventilator cycle sustainly) in&#xD;
      which ASV and Pressure-Support Ventilation will be performed in a randomized order.&#xD;

In each phase, two different modes of ventilation will be performed in a randomized order and will be monitored (Pressure-Control Ventilation and ASV during the passive ventilation phase, Pressure-Support Ventilation and ASV during the active ventilation phase). Washout periods will be performed between the different modes of ventilation.</intervention_model_description>
