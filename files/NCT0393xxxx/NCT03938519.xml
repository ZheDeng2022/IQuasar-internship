      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample size has been calculated according to population of dentists recorded in the&#xD;
           Egyptian Dental Syndicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keeping in mind the difficulty in obtaining registered dentists' names and postal&#xD;
           addresses, unreliable postal system and anticipated low response rate to a postal&#xD;
           survey, it was decided to deliver and collect the questionnaires by hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prepare the questionnaire, a review of the literature was performed and the variables&#xD;
           were determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires have been created in two forms according to the Type of Image receptor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Form A will be for Dentists who use Film Packets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Form B will be for Dentists who use Digital receptors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire includes a covering letter with an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cover letter provided in both English and Arabic, explaining the MSc research&#xD;
           project and details of the project supervisor. The cover letter stated that by&#xD;
           completing the questionnaire the participating dentists would be giving their voluntary&#xD;
           consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources / Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the questions will be answered with either yes, no or an open alternative. For&#xD;
           some of the questions several answers will be given; others were designed as an array of&#xD;
           claims using a rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires will be distributed randomly and manually on multiple refresher courses&#xD;
           and congresses throughout the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary by a personal interview. The interview involved the author asking the&#xD;
           dentists questions directly and noting down the replies without any elaboration or&#xD;
           further explanation of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forms of Questionnaires will be distributed according to dentist's choice in the first&#xD;
           question which will be asked orally about the type of receptor is used during routine&#xD;
           practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paper based questionnaire will be distributed in envelope and returned to the researcher&#xD;
           closed non marked to ensure confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective Data Analysis will be performed after the Questionnaires being collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty&#xD;
           of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The guidelines were derived from the American Dental Association 2006 recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing potential sources of bias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bias of selection: Questionnaires will be distributed randomly and manually on multiple&#xD;
           refresher courses and congresses throughout the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bias of Performance: Paper based questionnaire will be distributed in envelope and&#xD;
           returned to the researcher closed non marked&#xD;
