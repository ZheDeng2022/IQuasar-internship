  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a disturbance in attention and awareness that occurs over a short period of time.&#xD;
      Delirium is common in critically ill patients, and poor sleep quality in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) often worsens delirium. We aim to lower delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      by using ramelteon, which is a drug used to improve sleep at night.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many pharmacologic agents have been studied to reduce delirium in high risk patients, but the&#xD;
      data has not shown significant or clinically important outcomes. These agents also have more&#xD;
      side effect profiles such as arrhythmia and QT prolongation. Ramelteon is an effective drug&#xD;
      to improve sleep quality and has a low side effect profile. Improved sleep quality and&#xD;
      reduced delirium in ICU population will lead to improved acute and long-term outcomes of the&#xD;
      patients and lower delirium-related healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that those receiving ramelteon will have a higher rate of delirium- and&#xD;
      coma-free days, on average, than those receiving placebo. We also hypothesize that those&#xD;
      receiving ramelteon will have lower Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit-7&#xD;
      (CAM-ICU-7) scores than those receiving placebo, and that the reduction from baseline will be&#xD;
      greater for those receiving ramelteon than those receiving placebo. In addition, those&#xD;
      receiving ramelteon will be in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and hospital fewer days&#xD;
      than those receiving placebo. Those receiving ramelteon will have more sleep-time and fewer&#xD;
      awakenings than those receiving placebo (as defined by the actigraph device). In addition,&#xD;
      those receiving ramelteon will have higher subjective quality of sleep than those receiving&#xD;
      placebo on patient-reported sleep evaluation questionnaire. Lastly, those receiving ramelteon&#xD;
      will suffer less from post-intensive care syndrome compared to those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day, investigator(s) will identify patients who meet criteria on chart review and these&#xD;
      patients will be approached for consent. Consent will be obtained by patient or surrogate&#xD;
      decision maker as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, investigator will call pharmacy investigational service to provide&#xD;
      patient information/patient study ID for randomization and medication allotment. Pharmacy&#xD;
      investigational services will be informed whether the patient is mechanically ventilated or&#xD;
      not (this is a subgroup that will require randomization in the urn randomization design).&#xD;
      Patient's data will be recorded on REDcap including patient ID and delirium assessment. A&#xD;
      sign will be placed at the door of the patient's room to identify patient as a study subject&#xD;
      and to notify that the study subject should not be given ramelteon, melatonin, or fluvoxamine&#xD;
      by the primary medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, patients in Ramelteon group will receive 8 mg of Ramelteon capsule nightly&#xD;
      at 9 pm and placebo group will receive the placebo capsule. Ramelteon and Placebo capsules&#xD;
      will be indistinguishable from each other, even when opened to be administered via&#xD;
      nasograstric or orogastric tubes. Medication administration will continue throughout the&#xD;
      hospital stay, with maximum of 30 days, every night until death or discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital. If a patient's code status changes to comfort measures only, study drug&#xD;
      administration will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An actigraph unit will be placed on patient's wrist for continuous non-invasive measurement&#xD;
      of rest and activity to estimate sleep measures. The actigraph unit will be removed from the&#xD;
      patient when the patient is discharged from the ICU. The data from the actigraph will then be&#xD;
      extracted and analyzed by Action W software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by investigator daily for delirium using the Confusion Method&#xD;
      Assessment for the ICU-7 (CAM-ICU-7). For patients who are on mechanical ventilation or on&#xD;
      sedatives, all sedative medications will be held if the primary medical team approves.&#xD;
      CAM-ICU-7 will be performed for each patient at the time of maximal awakening and after&#xD;
      sedation (continuous infusion and as needed doses) is held for at least 30 to 60 minutes. For&#xD;
      those patients that are able to participate, they will complete Richmond-Campbell Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire (RCSQ), which is a two minute questionnaire, to assess their previous night's&#xD;
      sleep. The CAM-ICU-7 and RCSQ assessments will continue throughout the hospitalization after&#xD;
      ICU discharge, until discharge from the hospital or up to 30 days. Patients will not be&#xD;
      monitored upon discharge from the hospital (ie. discharged to nursing home, skilled nursing&#xD;
      facility, home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted via telephone to conduct two surveys to assess post-intensive care&#xD;
      quality of life at 1-, 3-, and 6-months after ICU discharge. Telephone Interview for&#xD;
      Cognitive Status (TICS) will be used to assess for cognitive impairment, and&#xD;
      EuroQol-5Dimensions (EQ-5D) will be used to assess for health quality including mobility,&#xD;
      self-care, activity level, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will have two faculty membersfrom the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep&#xD;
      Medicine at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University as data safety monitoring&#xD;
      members for this study in the event a study-related adverse event occurs.&#xD;
