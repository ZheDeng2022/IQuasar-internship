    <textblock>
      The limited data available suggest that exposure to weight-based stigmatization leads to&#xD;
      overeating and increased desire for food. In the present study, overweight and obese&#xD;
      individuals (BMI from 25-35 kg/m2) who are generally healthy will be randomized to read a&#xD;
      weight-stigma article or control article and subsequently scanned to collect fMRI data. These&#xD;
      procedures will be employed to accomplish two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the neural mechanisms involved in exposure to weight stigma on&#xD;
      central control of appetite in overweight and obese individuals. To accomplish this aim we&#xD;
      will collect fMRI data in study participants when viewing food and scenery pictures after&#xD;
      being exposed to either a weight-stigma or control article. In addition, participants will&#xD;
      complete validated questionnaires to measure perceived weight-stigma experiences and social&#xD;
      support for eating and physical activity. Hypothesis: After reading an article depicting&#xD;
      weight stigmatization, when shown pictures of food in the fMRI scanner, overweight/obese&#xD;
      individuals that perceive themselves as having experienced higher levels of weight stigma and&#xD;
      lower levels of social support, will have higher activations of brain regions that control&#xD;
      appetite and food reward (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, insula) and reduced&#xD;
      activations in brain areas that regulate self-control and decision making (prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      and cingulate cortex respectively) compared to a control group that reads a non-weight stigma&#xD;
      article.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the relationship between activity in appetitive and self-control&#xD;
      brain regions and self-reported, eating-related behavior. To accomplish this aim,&#xD;
      participants will also complete questionnaires that measure self-reported food intake&#xD;
      motivation (dietary restraint, disinhibition and hunger), appetitive responses, and mood.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Higher activations in appetite and reward regions and lower activations in&#xD;
      self-control brain regions will be correlated with higher levels of dietary disinhibition,&#xD;
      hunger/appetite, and dietary restraint.&#xD;

      Introduction Over two-thirds of Americans are either overweight or obese (Fryar et al., 2016)&#xD;
      and thus the search for therapeutic strategies for the overweight/obesity epidemic is key. As&#xD;
      much as 20% of overweight/obese individuals also report having weight stigma experiences&#xD;
      (Levy and Pilfer, 2012) and may experience stigmatization repeatedly over the course of their&#xD;
      lifetimes. Weight stigma, as defined by Araiza and Wellman (Araiza and Wellman, 2017), is the&#xD;
      social depreciation and condemnation of individuals with higher body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging data from two recent review articles demonstrate that the negative impact of weight&#xD;
      stigma experienced by overweight and obese individuals occurs on the physiological,&#xD;
      psychological, and behavioral levels (Vartanian and Porter, 2016; Wu and Berry, 2018). Weight&#xD;
      stigma could actually lead to overconsumption of food and eating disorders such as binge&#xD;
      eating (Wott and Carels, 2010; Almeida et al., 2011) which can further exacerbate the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic. For example, the more participants perceived themselves as experiencing weight&#xD;
      stigma, the more calories they selected (Araiza and Wellman, 2017) or consumed (Major et al.,&#xD;
      2014) and the more poorly they performed on cognitive tests (Araiza and Wellman, 2017) when&#xD;
      they read an article depicting discrimination against individuals with higher body weight&#xD;
      compared to a control group. In the Major et al. study, women who perceived themselves as&#xD;
      being overweight consumed 80 calories more of a high-calorie snack which translated to a&#xD;
      magnitude of effect of 47%. Perceived weight stigma has also been shown to be positively&#xD;
      correlated with emotional and rigid restrained eating as well as predicting weight gain over&#xD;
      a ten-week period (Wellman et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, individuals with higher body weights are more affected when put in situations&#xD;
      that remind them more of weight stigmatization (Major et al., 2014; Hunger et al., 2015),&#xD;
      though not everyone may respond in the same manner. While data exist to show the negative&#xD;
      impacts of weight stigma of overweight/obese individuals on eating behavior, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of data regarding the effect of exposure to weight-stigma content on the neural&#xD;
      control of appetite and self-control in overweight/obese individuals. The so-called&#xD;
      'appetitive network' is centered around the following interconnected brain regions: the&#xD;
      amygdala and hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and adjacent ventromedial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (VMPFC), the striatum, and the insula. These areas of the brain are normally activated&#xD;
      during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies where food cue reactivity is&#xD;
      assessed, and the activity is regulated by peripheral signals of energy balance, current&#xD;
      hunger, and personality traits (Dagher, 2012). Furthermore, how these neural control measures&#xD;
      correlate with self-reports of weight stigma experiences, social support for eating behavior&#xD;
      and physical activity, food intake motivation (dietary restraint, disinhibition and hunger),&#xD;
      mood and appetite require further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a cross-sectional study of overweight/obese, generally healthy subjects.&#xD;
      After having completed a telephone prescreening test to determine eligibility for the study,&#xD;
      subjects will be invited to the Brain Imaging Center (BIC) at the University of Missouri for&#xD;
      a one-time research visit lasting approximately three hours. The subject will report to the&#xD;
      BIC in the fasted state. The sequence of events during this test visit is outlined in Figure&#xD;
      1 and is described in detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival at the BIC, the subject will be screened for eligibility for MRI research&#xD;
      following the standard University of Missouri screening protocol. The subject will then be&#xD;
      taken through the informed consent process and then testing will begin. Informed consent is&#xD;
      performed in a quiet, closed office and the subject will be given ample time to discuss the&#xD;
      study and ask questions. Anthropometric measurements (weight and height), as well as a finger&#xD;
      prick glucose measurement, is preformed and subsequently, the subject is asked to fill out a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires (appetite/ mood, social support, weight stigma experiences,&#xD;
      Three-Factor Eating questionnaire). Research staff are present to answer any questions the&#xD;
      subject may have about the surveys. Then, the subject will read their assigned weight-stigma&#xD;
      or control article (randomization to either the control or weight stigma article condition&#xD;
      will be done before data collection commence). One of the questionnaires (appetite/mood) is&#xD;
      repeated after reading the article just prior to scanning, and also again after scanning is&#xD;
      over. The subject then undergoes fMRI scanning followed by a final repeat of the&#xD;
      appetite/mood survey and a finger stick for glucose measurement. Upon completion of all the&#xD;
      test procedures, the subject is debriefed as to the purpose of the article and told that the&#xD;
      article was fictional.&#xD;
