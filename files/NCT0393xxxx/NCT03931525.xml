      This study aims to explore the effects of fractional Radiofrecuency (RF), as well as&#xD;
      demonstrate the performance of the new semi-ablative radiofrequency model in the treatment of&#xD;
      stretch marks. This research is a randomized, controlled clinical trial where 32 female&#xD;
      patients complaining of glutes and / or abdomen striations. The participants were divided&#xD;
      into two equal groups, G1 and G2. G1 will be treated at 30-day intervals, and subdivided into&#xD;
      2 subgroups: G1A, 8 patients with striations in the abdomen; and G1B, 8 patients with gluteal&#xD;
      striations. The G1A and G1B groups will be divided into 2 subgroups of 4 people each, where&#xD;
      one group will be treated with Fractional RF associated to drug delivery, and the other&#xD;
      group, with only Fractional RF, without the application of drug delivery. The same rule of&#xD;
      subdivisions will occur in G2, G2A and G2B, however, the interval between applications will&#xD;
      be every 15 days. The treatment area will be divided into a rectangle 10cm high by 10cm wide.&#xD;
      For evaluation, the contralateral side will be used as a control, using Photogrammetry and&#xD;
      histological analysis as a resource, which will be collected through the punch skin fragment&#xD;
      of the infraumbilical and gluteal region, performed by a specialized physician.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stretch marks are characterized by common dermatological conditions, being aesthetically&#xD;
           unpleasant, disturbing especially women of different age groups. Analyzing the&#xD;
           histological aspect, they present as atrophic lesions that disperse collagen and elastic&#xD;
           tissue, in addition to reducing the presence of skin cells such as keratinocytes,&#xD;
           melanocytes and fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is noted that the striations may be distributed locally or numerously, disposed&#xD;
           parallel to one another and perpendicular to the skin cleavage lines. At the beginning,&#xD;
           the striae appear erythematous-violet, thin and may generate pruritus, characterizing&#xD;
           its inflammatory phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the inflammatory phase passes, the striations develop into an atrophic condition,&#xD;
           they acquire a whitish appearance, almost pearly, becoming wider, due to the rupture of&#xD;
           elastic and collagen fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dermatofunctional physiotherapy already has several resources to treat these effects,&#xD;
           such as therapeutic ultrasound, cryolipolysis, radiofrequency, low intensity laser and&#xD;
           high intensity focused ultrasound. RF heating is commonly used to cause shrinkage of&#xD;
           dermal collagen and induce stimulation of fibroblast cells that produce a new collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Radiofrequency is a non-invasive treatment, which leads to better circulatory and&#xD;
           nutrient supply, tissue hydration, increased oxygenation, acceleration of elimination of&#xD;
           catabolites, lipolysis, contraction of the connective tissue promoting reorientation of&#xD;
           collagen fibers and increase in as well as soft tissue regeneration, and is indicated&#xD;
           for patients with mild to moderate skin flaccidity, to improve the facial and body&#xD;
           contour, to attenuate furrows and ridges, to moderate retraction of the fibers, and to&#xD;
           increase the thickness and density of the epithelial tissue. sub-mental area and neck&#xD;
           and treatment of gynoid lipodystrophy, like all equipment of deep thermo therapy, causes&#xD;
           a great cellular excitation, leading to an accentuated caloric expenditure, while we&#xD;
           will be promoting an expressive improvement of localized fat or cellulite in the&#xD;
           circulatory part promoting a important vasodilatation, but when there is fibrosis very&#xD;
           early, rapid preheating with radiofrequency is recommended initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fractional RF is another possibility for the treatment of cutaneous aging. It is a&#xD;
           procedure that emits waves that reach the deeper layers of the skin, generating energy&#xD;
           and strong heat, but keeping the surface cooled and protected. the procedure reaches the&#xD;
           depth of 100 microns, that is, it reaches the papillary dermis, where it causes ablation&#xD;
           and coagulation of surrounding proteins by residual thermal damage. This both leads to&#xD;
           contraction of existing collagen fibers and stimulates the formation of new fibers,&#xD;
           making them more efficient in supporting the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After discovering the advantages of fractionation applied to some forms of light for&#xD;
           skin rejuvenation, several other researches have been done, and today we have different&#xD;
           types of laser, radiofrequency and infrared devices that use this property as a way to&#xD;
           keep treatments safer and effective. The development of RF fractionation was then&#xD;
           initiated. In the fractured form this feature can be used ablatively and sub ablatively,&#xD;
           where tissues suffer less trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is still a lot to be studied about this new therapeutic resource, and the&#xD;
           literature on the subject is very scarce. For this reason, this research aims to&#xD;
           elucidate and increase the knowledge about Fractional RF. Through histological analysis&#xD;
           and other data, we seek to ensure and clarify the effects of Fractional Radiofrequency&#xD;
           at the dermal and epidermal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GENERAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Investigate the effects of Fractional Radiofrequency in the treatment of striae of the&#xD;
           abdominal and gluteal regions associated or not with the active permeation (Drug&#xD;
           Delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the effects of Fractional Radiofrequency on the dermal tissue in the&#xD;
                abdominal and gluteal regions of women, associated or not with the drug permeation&#xD;
                (Drug Delivery), through the histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demonstrate the performance of Fractional Radiofrequency equipment in the treatment&#xD;
                of stretch marks in the abdominal and gluteal regions of women in different&#xD;
                treatment periods (15 and 30 days), when or not associated with drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identify the performance of Fractional RF equipment in the treatment of stretch&#xD;
                marks in abdominal and gluteal regions in different treatment periods (every 15 and&#xD;
                30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The application of Fractional Radiofrequency does not interfere in the treatment of&#xD;
                stretch marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The application of Fractional Radiofrequency interferes in the treatment of stretch&#xD;
                marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The permeation of assets associated with fractional RF interferes with the&#xD;
                treatment of stretch marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Asset permeation associated with Fractional RF does not interfere with the&#xD;
                treatment of stretch marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 CHARACTERIZATION OF STUDY AND SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research is characterized as a randomized clinical trial in which 32 female&#xD;
           volunteers will be selected, whose main complaint is the appearance of stretch marks in&#xD;
           the abdominal area and gluteal areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 LOCATION OF THE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participats will be assisted in an outpatient dermatological and physiotherapy&#xD;
           treatment appropriately structured for the proposed study, containing electrical network&#xD;
           compatible with the fractional RF equipment used, an appropriate environmental cooling&#xD;
           system for the proper functioning of the machine, and good hygiene and lighting&#xD;
           conditions, according to the provisions of the local Sanitary Surveillance, will be in&#xD;
           the clinic of physiotherapy, located at Av. Antônio Basílio - Lagoa Seca / Natal-RN&#xD;
           owned by Dr. Eneida Carreiro.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MATERIALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fractional RF Equipment, Artis model, manufactured by Tone Derm will be used. A tape&#xD;
           measure of the brand Fiber, a scale of the mark Glicomed, a device of Plicometria and a&#xD;
           device of ultrasonografia of high frequency (12MHz), a punch of procedure, camera of the&#xD;
           mark Canon. For the application of the assets will be used the Concept TI Strill&#xD;
           Monodose Fluid manufactured by Mezzo Dermocosmetics, registered in Anvisa nº&#xD;
           25351.379480 / 2018-17, composed by water, Edta, Hydroxyacetophenone, 1,2 - Hexanediol,&#xD;
           Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Glycine Soy Glycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Citric&#xD;
           Acid, Sh-Polypeptide-5, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Rutin, Palmitoyl&#xD;
           Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Phaseolus Lunatus Seed Extract, Bulbine&#xD;
           Frutescens Leaf Juice, Bht.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 PROCEDURE METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During treatment the participants will be treated with fractional radiofrequency, G1&#xD;
           will be applied at 30-day intervals and subdivided into 2 GA groups. Abdomen with 8&#xD;
           patients and GB gluteal with 8 patients, the GA and GB groups were divided into 2&#xD;
           subgroups of 4 people each, 1 group with application of drugdelivery and 1 group without&#xD;
           the application of drugdelivery. G2 will be applied at 15-day intervals and subdivided&#xD;
           into 2 GC groups. Abdomen with 8 patients and gluteal GD with 8 patients, the GC and GD&#xD;
           groups were divided into 2 subgroups of 4 people each, 1 drug application group and 1&#xD;
           group without the application of drug delivery. The drug consists of a solution rich in&#xD;
           cell growth factors and the investigators will be applied after the intervention with&#xD;
           Fractal Radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following modulation parameters will be used in the Fractional Radiofrequency&#xD;
           equipment: Deep application mode, amplitude: 100% - ON time: 50 mseg - OFF time: 5 mseg&#xD;
           - Pulsed mode - Pulse: 1mseg. In the gluteus and abdomen will be treated using -&#xD;
           specific radiofrequency tips fractioned with the &quot;fork&quot; electrode (A distance between&#xD;
           perforations of about 1 to 2 mm must be observed). The areas where the needle will&#xD;
           penetrate will be cleaned with 70% alcohol before the procedure, the applications in the&#xD;
           abdomen and gluteus will occur on the right side, the left side will not receive any&#xD;
           radiofrequency treatment, being therefore used as a control, where later participants&#xD;
           will be invited to treat the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the histological analysis, two patients from group G1 (abdomen and gluteus) and two&#xD;
           patients from group G2 (abdomen and gluteus), a sample of the superficial tissue through&#xD;
           a punch 3 mm in diameter, will be removed. The procedure will be under local anesthesia&#xD;
           and performed by a medical plastic surgeon in order to minimize the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RISKS AND BENEFITS OF RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Radiofrequency apparatus is registered with ANVISA, the treatment is considered safe&#xD;
           by the FDA and duly legalized its use in Brazil. Even if it is a new technique, the&#xD;
           researchers will be assisted by a technician responsible for the machine during the&#xD;
           entire treatment period to avoid any technical problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The risks include the use of anticoagulants and liver problems (previously questioned in&#xD;
           the initial interview with the patient during the first evaluation). If so, the&#xD;
           participant will be excluded from the survey. Other risks are hyperemia of the skin due&#xD;
           to the mechanism of application of the equipment that will be smoothed by the control&#xD;
           and questioning at the beginning of the application and the patients must be with&#xD;
           preserved sensitivity, by having the metal applicators, it can scratch, but this will be&#xD;
           avoided with the inspection of the device before the application and with the speed of&#xD;
           the moderate application, if it occurs the patient would receive all the necessary care&#xD;
           and assistance to heal. The risk of burns will be reduced by controlling the&#xD;
           temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the patient submitted to punch the risk is scar formation and fibrosis in the area&#xD;
           where the skin fragment will be collected, but in order to avoid these complications the&#xD;
           removed fragment will have the smallest possible size so that it is minimally&#xD;
           perceptible and the procedure will be performed by physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event of any complications, we will provide the necessary assistance, including&#xD;
           coverage of expenses, compensation for any damages resulting from research procedures,&#xD;
           duly substantiated by specific consultations and examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The benefits of this research are related to the improvement of the striae in the&#xD;
           treated region. As the literature cites, as well as increasing self-esteem of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After histological study, a statistical analysis will be performed to compare the degree&#xD;
           of organization of the collagen and elastic fibers between the different treatment&#xD;
           groups. A descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of the data will be performed&#xD;
           through SPSS 19.0 (StatisticalPackage for the Social Science - Version 19.0). The&#xD;
           normality of the date will be observed by the Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test. For the&#xD;
           comparison between groups whose parametric form data will be applied the one-way anova&#xD;
           test for intergroup comparison. The significance level of 5% (p &lt;0.05) will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected at the end of the study that the differentiated effects for conventional and&#xD;
      Radiofrequency equipment in the dermal tissue will be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to evaluate the Fractional Radiofrequency effects as well as the&#xD;
      parameters to be used, seeking to confirm what the literature cites in relation to its&#xD;
      physiological effects. A more detailed analysis of the whole process after the application is&#xD;
      sought, not yet clearly described by scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional Radiofrequency is expected to increase the increase of collagen fibers, preventing&#xD;
      the process of natural skin aging and improving the appearance of stretch marks.&#xD;
