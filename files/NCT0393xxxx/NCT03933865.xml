    <textblock>
      This is an outpatient randomized within subject placebo-controlled human laboratory&#xD;
      investigation of analgesia (as assessed with quantitative sensory testing; QST) from ketamine&#xD;
      alone and in combination with hydromorphone in buprenorphine maintained participants. The&#xD;
      goals of this project are to characterize the analgesic, subjective, and physiologic effects&#xD;
      of ketamine combined with hydromorphone in patients on buprenorphine maintenance for opioid&#xD;
      use disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will have 8 sessions where they will receive two IM injections.The dose&#xD;
      of ketamine will be manipulated (0 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg) across sessions. The dose of&#xD;
      hydromorphone will either be 0 mg or 8 mg. Therefore, participants will be exposed to&#xD;
      ascending doses of ketamine with and without hydromorphone. Order of study medications will&#xD;
      be randomized for each participant by an un-blinded statistician and transmitted securely to&#xD;
      study pharmacist in charge of medication administration. This study will provide unique&#xD;
      information on optimal hydromorphone-ketamine dosing strategies for acute pain management. in&#xD;
      buprenorphine maintained patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will take place 17 hours after the last buprenorphine dose (trough levels) to&#xD;
      control for time since last dose. Sessions will be held on a dedicated unit for human&#xD;
      subjects clinical research at Zuckerberg San Francisco General and include two IM injections&#xD;
      of study medication given 15 minutes apart by blinded nursing staff. Study sessions will each&#xD;
      last approximately 5 hours. Sessions will take place 1-2x weekly and must be separated by at&#xD;
      least 72 hours to allow for drug wash-out. QST outcomes will be measured at baseline, as well&#xD;
      as 15, 75, 135, and 195 minutes after injection #2 for each session. In addition, abuse&#xD;
      liability outcomes will be measured at baseline (if required) and at 15, 75, 135, and 195&#xD;
      minutes after injection #2 for each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn to evaluate baseline buprenorphine /norbuprenorphine levels. Then, PK&#xD;
      analyses will be done for ketamine, norketamine and hydromorphone. Blood will be drawn at&#xD;
      baseline as well as 15, 75, 135, and 195 minutes after injection #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be analgesia as assessed by QST. The use of various QST measures which&#xD;
      assess acute anti-nociception as well as central modification of pain processing will allow&#xD;
      us to evaluate whether overall analgesia results from blocking of nociceptor signaling and/or&#xD;
      changes to central pain facilitation to better understand the mechanism of&#xD;
      ketamine-hydromorphone combinations.&#xD;
