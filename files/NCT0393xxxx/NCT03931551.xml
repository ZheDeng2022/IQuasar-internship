      This open-label, multicenter, single arm, two cohorts, Simon's Two-Stage minimax design,&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial will assess the efficacy of olaparib in combination with trastuzumab&#xD;
      in patients with HER2-positive ABC with gene alterations in HRR DNA pathway. To be included&#xD;
      in the cohort A of the study, patients must exhibit germinal deleterious mutations in BRCA1&#xD;
      or BRCA2 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have histologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast&#xD;
      with evidence of advanced disease, and at least one measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1.&#xD;
      Patients will have a documented history of progression on HER2-directed therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer with not limits on prior therapies of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or trastuzumab-lapatinib in advanced scenario, and at least one regimen of chemotherapy&#xD;
      including trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accrual goal will be a total of 20 patients&#xD;
