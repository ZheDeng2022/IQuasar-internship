  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is amongst the foremost challenges facing policy makers in Thailand,&#xD;
      accounting for considerable death, disability and healthcare expenditure. Under Thailand's&#xD;
      strong primary health system, medical management of diabetes is widely available. However,&#xD;
      control of blood glucose and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, and regular screening&#xD;
      for early detection of complications remain low due to a lack of services for education and&#xD;
      counselling to support behavioural changes necessary for good self-management of the&#xD;
      condition. A substantial literature documents the effectiveness of Diabetes Self-Management&#xD;
      Education (DSME) programs for improving diabetes outcomes, although little high-quality data&#xD;
      are available in Thailand, and traditional delivery models (health-professional led&#xD;
      one-to-one or small-group sessions) are unlikely to be scalable in Thailand given current&#xD;
      human resource and budgetary constraints. Thus, a low-cost DSME program will be developed&#xD;
      with a scalable delivery model for roll-out within the Thai primary care system. The&#xD;
      intervention will be based on behaviour-change and social support theories, delivered in&#xD;
      monthly group meetings by lay health workers or nurses, and aided by a suite of short films&#xD;
      to introduce key topics and stimulate discussion. 21 primary care units will be randomised to&#xD;
      offer to those with diabetes diagnosed within the first three years. DSME will be delivered&#xD;
      by lay health workers, nurses (for comparative effectiveness), or usual care. After 12&#xD;
      months, glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk scores will be compared between the three&#xD;
      arms. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed, also process and policy evaluations to produce&#xD;
      best-buy recommendations for the Thai Ministry of Public Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health and economic consequences of Type 2 diabetes mellitus are largely attributable to&#xD;
      its complications, which can be prevented or delayed by good disease control, achieved&#xD;
      through medical care and self-management. Diabetes Self- Management Education (DSME) programs&#xD;
      are effective and cost-effective, and part of standard care in high-income countries, but are&#xD;
      unavailable in Thai healthcare system, despite universal coverage of medical aspects of&#xD;
      diabetes care. Negative perceptions of educational programs, sustained by a lack of&#xD;
      high-quality local data, and concerns about burden on existing staff time and costs are&#xD;
      thought to be responsible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the focus on community-based education for chronic diseases in recent primary&#xD;
      healthcare reforms, it is timely to scale-up DSME in Thailand, if an affordable model of&#xD;
      delivery for a locally-tailored intervention can be found. The aim is to work in close&#xD;
      collaboration with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to develop, pilot and evaluate a&#xD;
      peer-based DSME program and delivery model. A final list of policy recommendations for&#xD;
      optimal integration into the Thai healthcare system will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify a scalable model for delivery of DSME across Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific project objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To design a prototype of the DSME intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To refine the intervention prototype and trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention under two&#xD;
           alternative modes of delivery (nurse-led and peer-led)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify the 'best buy' model for scale-up of DSME delivery in the Thai health&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that either model of DSME delivery will be effective and&#xD;
      cost-effective, but the peer-led model will be a more scalable option for the Thai health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two key research gaps in scientific literature that will be addressed are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of DSME programs in low- and middle-income countries,&#xD;
           specifically Thailand&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Role of peer programs in supporting complex behaviour change generally, and its&#xD;
           implementation in low- and middle-income settings specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main expected outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of a fully worked-up rapidly scalable model for DSME delivery in Thailand;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Capacity building of emerging Thai researchers and practitioners (nurses, village health&#xD;
           volunteers) in the science and delivery of complex behavioural interventions, which&#xD;
           could be expanded to other chronic conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term collaborative research links between UK and Thai researchers.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life measure that will also assess cost-effectiveness. Includes five quality of life question on mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain, anxiety / depression and a scale of 0 to 100 on how the person is feeling on that day.&#xD;
Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.</description>
