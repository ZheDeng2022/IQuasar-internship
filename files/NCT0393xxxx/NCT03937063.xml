  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study shall mainly help to better evaluate the performance the APDS device and secondly&#xD;
      it may help to assess the potential of the future alpha version of the device to be a useful&#xD;
      and effective for the detection of colon Polyps.&#xD;

      Primary objectives: To evaluate, in objective way, the usability of the future alpha version&#xD;
      of the APDS device by testing the sensitivity and specificity of its results achieved from&#xD;
      running it on the collected recorded videos of Colonoscopy screening tests of the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: When the APDS would be ready for field installation (Beta Version), to&#xD;
      install it in the Gastroenterology institute of the medical center, in order to evaluate, as&#xD;
      part of a continuation study, the physicians satisfaction from the APDS performance.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Half an hour from the end of the procedure for which the procedure report was filled-in</time_frame>
    <description>Each de-Identified procedure report is visually inspected immediately at the end of the procedure by an experienced team member who gives it binary score (0 or 1), 1 if it includes all the needed details about the polyps that were detected during the procedure, and 0 if does not include all the needed details about the polyps that were detected during the procedure.</description>

        Subjects shall be recruited by the investigator from within the investigator's patient&#xD;
        population of colonoscopy. In this study one site will participate and enroll not less than&#xD;
        200 patients and up to 300 subjects according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Each&#xD;
        subject (not less than 200 patients and up to 300 subjects) included will pass one regular&#xD;
        colonoscopy screening test which will be recorded in the way which is described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrolled subjects that did not complete the full course of the study will be replaced&#xD;
