      The aim of this study is to observe the efficacy, safety, postoperative pathological response&#xD;
      rate and survival benefit of immume checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 SHR1210 combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy of locally advanced resectable gastric and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In addition ，the investigators will explore the&#xD;
      relationship between the immunophenotype of gastric cancer and the efficacy and drug&#xD;
      resistance of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, and screen out biomarkers that can&#xD;
      predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy can not only improve&#xD;
      the surgical resection rate and postoperative pathological remission rate, but also prolong&#xD;
      the postoperative recurrence-free survival and benefit patients.Recent studies have confirmed&#xD;
      that immume point inhibitors PD-1 and CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody have a certain effect in&#xD;
      advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma which had experienced&#xD;
      multi-line treatment. Furthermore，the FOLFOX protocol is recommended as a new adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer.In order to further improve the surgical&#xD;
      resection rate and survival rate by improving the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the investigators selected&#xD;
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with FOLFOX neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced&#xD;
      gastric and gastroesophageal junctions Adenocarcinoma.The aim of this study is to observe the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, postoperative pathological response rate and survival benefit of immume&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 SHR1210 combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy of&#xD;
      locally advanced resectable gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In addition&#xD;
      ，the investigators will explore the relationship between the immunophenotype of gastric&#xD;
      cancer and the efficacy and drug resistance of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.&#xD;
