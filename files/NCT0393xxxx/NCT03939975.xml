    <textblock>
      The inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has shown promising antitumor&#xD;
      activity in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unfortunately, less than 20% of HCC have&#xD;
      response. The effect of PD-1 blockade and incomplete thermal ablation in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC is not yet clearly understood. This study aimed to analyze outcomes of advanced&#xD;
      HCC treated with anti PD-1 inhibitors in combination with incomplete thermal ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked as the third leading cause of cancer death both&#xD;
      worldwide and in the China. In the past decade, survivals of patients with advanced HCC or&#xD;
      those who have progressed diseases following locoregional treatments can be increased with&#xD;
      the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, the first evidence identified drug for HCC. Recent&#xD;
      clinical trials further verified some novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as regorafenib&#xD;
      and cabozantinib, and two programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      (ICIs), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, as useful therapies in second line setting following&#xD;
      sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade have shown an ORR of 15-17% and&#xD;
      median survival time of 12.9-15.0 months among patients with advanced HCC. Of these,&#xD;
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been accelerated approved as second-line treatment of&#xD;
      advanced HCC. Notably, patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease&#xD;
      control for 9.9-17months and still a large proportion of patients (81-83%) do not respond to&#xD;
      mono PD-1 blockade, which emphasizing the need to explore strategies to increase the efficacy&#xD;
      of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approach to expanding the benefit of ICIs may involve combinations with locoregional&#xD;
      therapy like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), such&#xD;
      treatments have been shown to boost tumor-specific T-cell response through release of TAAs&#xD;
      from HCC cells. The intent-to-treat population of this study was a subset of patients&#xD;
      receiving ongoing ICIs therapy for advanced HCC and is with stable disease or atypical&#xD;
      responses in different lesions of the same individuals.&#xD;
