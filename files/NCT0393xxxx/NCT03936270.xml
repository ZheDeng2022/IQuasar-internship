      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate 12 weeks progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      rate of Palbociclib plus Letrozole in ER/PR positive endometrioid or high-grade serous&#xD;
      ovarian cancer who have disease progression on second-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Letrozole (Femara®) is an oral non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is approved worldwide&#xD;
      for the treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. It is administered orally on a&#xD;
      continuous 2.5 mg daily dosing regimen and has a good toxicity profile. Palbociclib&#xD;
      (Ibrance®) is an active potent and highly selective reversible inhibitor of cyclin- dependent&#xD;
      kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). Palbociclib was approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (U.S. FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international&#xD;
      clinical trial PALOMA-2. It is administered orally on a dose of 125 mg per day in 4-week&#xD;
      cycles (3 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week off). This trial was based on preclinical&#xD;
      studies that showed a synergistic effect between targeting the ER and cyclin-D-CDK4/6-Rb&#xD;
      pathway. The principal toxicity was myelotoxicity but it was managed with appropriate&#xD;
      supportive care and dose reductions13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors used as&#xD;
      monotherapy to treat patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, we hypothesized that, as&#xD;
      Palbociclibe is active in this population and many ovarian cancer show ER/PR expression, its&#xD;
      combination with Letrozole can improve outcomes in ER/PR positive endometrioid or high-grade&#xD;
      serous Ovarian Cancer who have disease progression on second-line chemotherapy, similar to&#xD;
      what is seen in breast cancer studies.&#xD;
