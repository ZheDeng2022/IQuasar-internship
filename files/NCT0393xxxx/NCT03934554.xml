  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, the &quot;States General of Kidney&quot; have allowed to assess the situation concerning the&#xD;
      management of chronic kidney disease on the national territory. Ex-Languedoc-Roussillon has&#xD;
      emerged as one of the French regions with a high dialysis / transplant ratio compared to&#xD;
      other regions. Disparities in accessibility to the kidney transplant list were also very&#xD;
      important. In the ex-Languedoc-Roussillon Region, the number of patients on the renal&#xD;
      transplant list was lower than the national average (18.9 vs. 24.1%, respectively, according&#xD;
      to the REIN 2015 report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, the Regional Health Agency (ARS) ex-Languedoc-Roussillon, has published proposals to&#xD;
      improve the healthcare of the patient in chronic end stage renal failure, and accessibility&#xD;
      to the national waiting list for renal transplantation (CRISTAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase accessibility to the national waiting list for renal transplantation by improving&#xD;
      the patient's healthcare, our project is based on the creation of a reinforced exchanges&#xD;
      connexion between the hospital's nephrology services professionals, dialysis units and&#xD;
      liberal nephrologists. This will include having regular meetings between dialysis&#xD;
      nephrologists and CHU nephrologists. The proposals for this project were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to organize multidisciplinary consultation meetings between transplant and dialysis&#xD;
           professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to set up an exchange platform and communication tools built on the model of&#xD;
           telemedicine (COVOTEM), common to the nephrology departments of the University Hospital&#xD;
           Center, dialysis units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new device for the management of chronic end stage renal failure should increase the&#xD;
      number of patients on the national renal transplantation waiting list. It should also make it&#xD;
      possible to reduce the time between: firstly, the sending of the pre-registration file to the&#xD;
      transplantation at Montpellier University Hospital and registration, and secondly between&#xD;
      dialysis and registration.on waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this experiment will increase the number of registrations on the&#xD;
      National Kidney Transplantation Waitlist (CRISTAL). The implementation of this innovative&#xD;
      tool should facilitate communication between nephrologists dialysis centers and nephrologists&#xD;
      of CHU Montpellier, and accelerate the process of registration on the National Kidney&#xD;
      Transplantation Waitlist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this platform proves to be easy to use and if the project's evaluation criteria show&#xD;
      significant results, the platform could then be used to monitor patients in&#xD;
      post-transplantation. Indeed, the data of patients who perform an alternating follow-up would&#xD;
      be available for the referring nephrologists and for the transplant center. The further&#xD;
      development of the platform would allow to create a mode of communication via this platform.&#xD;

      Main Objective: Evolution of the number of patients, dialysed or not dialysed in the&#xD;
      ex-Languedoc-Roussillon Region, acceding during the year, to a pre-transplant assessment for&#xD;
      a registration on the national renal transplantation waiting list ( CRISTAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of patient waiting times for registration on the national renal&#xD;
           transplantation waiting list (CRISTAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For incident cases: Evolution of the time between dialysis, and the date of registration&#xD;
           on the transplant waiting list or the date of decision of temporary or definitive&#xD;
           contraindication by nephrologists CHU Montpellier .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of the delays between the date of reception of the pre-registration file by&#xD;
           the nephrology department of the University Hospital and the closing date of the file&#xD;
           (either a definitive inscription, a definitive contraindication or a temporary&#xD;
           contraindication &gt; 4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of the number of multidisciplinary consultation meetings performed without&#xD;
           videoconferencing and videoconferencing between the dialysis center and Montpellier&#xD;
           University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of exchanges between professionals involved in the course of care of the&#xD;
           patient in chronic end stage renal failure&#xD;
