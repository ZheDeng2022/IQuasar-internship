  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million people in the European Union (EU) suffer from chronic refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
      Their quality of life (QoL) is severely affected by seizures and by the adverse effect of&#xD;
      antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Several new AEDs have been introduced in recent years,&#xD;
      but their impact on the long-term outcome in these patients has been inadequately explored.&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the U.S. suggests that using a standardize toll to quantitate adverse&#xD;
      AED effects can improve outcome, but the general applicability of these findings is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) To assess prospectively AED utilization patterns in patients with refractory&#xD;
      epilepsy ; 2) to assess how such treatments and other variables correlated with seizure&#xD;
      control, adverse effects, and QoL in these patients; 3) to establish the impact of a&#xD;
      standardized evaluation of adverse effects on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The project included a core observational study and a randomized intervention in a&#xD;
      subcohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the core (observational) study, 1,000 consecutive refractory epilepsy patients were&#xD;
      enrolled and followed-up prospectively at 10 centres in Italy. The following parameters were&#xD;
      recorded at 0 (entry), 6, 12 and 18 months: (i) drug therapy; (ii) seizure frequency; (iii)&#xD;
      adverse events based on medical examination and non-structured interview; (iii) treatment&#xD;
      costs and, (iv) for patients above age 16, standardized questionnaires for adverse effects&#xD;
      (AEP), depressive symptoms (Becks Depression Scale, BDS), QoL (QOLIE-31) and clinical global&#xD;
      impression (CGI). The primary outcome (changes in QOLIE-31 scores) will be related to the&#xD;
      other variables measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized intervention, the subcohort meeting specific eligibility criteria (age &gt;16&#xD;
      years, no progressive disorder, AEP score&gt;=45 ) was randomized to two groups. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, AEP score results were made available to the physician at each visit,&#xD;
      while in the other group AEP scores were only made available at the end of follow-up. Primary&#xD;
      outcome were changes in AEP score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a prevalence of about 0.8% in the general population, chronic active epilepsy is the&#xD;
      most common serious neurological disorder and affects 3.7 million people in the EU alone.&#xD;
      While the majority of patients with epilepsy can be fully controlled by available&#xD;
      medications, about 40% fail to achieve seizure control. Refractory epilepsy is associated&#xD;
      with poor quality of life (QoL), due to the consequences of seizures, the burden of adverse&#xD;
      effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and associated comorbidities, especially depressed&#xD;
      mood. In addition to human suffering, refractory epilepsy entails major costs: observational&#xD;
      studies in Italy estimated an annual medical costs at 2,190 in adults, or 3,268 euros in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had a prospective design and mainly observational design (core study). A subgroup&#xD;
      of patients, participated in a randomized assessment (controlled study) of the impact of&#xD;
      utilizing a standardized tool for the assessment of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the core study, the study population was represented by 1,000 consecutive consenting&#xD;
      patients with refractory epilepsy seen as in- or outpatients at 10 major secondary/tertiary&#xD;
      referral centres in Italy. &quot;Refractory epilepsy&quot; was defined as &quot;the persistence of seizures&#xD;
      after adequate attempts with the maximally tolerated dosage of one or more appropriate&#xD;
      primary AEDs, excluding situations where a meaningful dose escalation was prevented by&#xD;
      allergic or idiosyncratic adverse reactions&quot; and at least one seizure during the previous 3&#xD;
      months while at steady state on the current treatment schedule. The degree of refractoriness&#xD;
      was classified into categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subcohort of patients included in the study took part in a randomized assessment of the&#xD;
      usefulness of providing the treating physician with a standardized assessment of the adverse&#xD;
      effect profile. The subcohort was represented by all patients enrolled in the core study who&#xD;
      met at the first assessment visit the following additional eligibility criteria: (i) age &gt;16&#xD;
      years; (ii) no progressive disorder; (iii) ability to complete the Adverse Profile AEP&#xD;
      questionnaire, and (iv) an AEP score &gt;=45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the core study, the approach was observational and the study did not interfere with&#xD;
      clinical management. All patients were treated as considered best by the attending physician.&#xD;
      Results of questionnaires were not made available to the treating physician until the end of&#xD;
      the study, except for the AEP questionnaire data that were fed back to the physician only for&#xD;
      a subgroup of patients included in the randomized assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized assessment, patients meeting eligibility were randomized to two groups. In&#xD;
      the intervention group, AEP score results were made available to the treating physician at&#xD;
      each assessment visit, while in the other group AEP scores were only made available at the&#xD;
      end of follow-up. Evaluations were identical to those carried out in the core study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for making available the AEP scores to the treating physician, the procedures used for&#xD;
      the collection and the handling of the information were identical in the core study and the&#xD;
      randomized assessment. Patients were seen in the clinic at the following times: 0&#xD;
      (enrolment), 6, 12 and 18 months. At the first visit, detailed information were collected&#xD;
      about demographics, medical history and current medical status. At this visit and at each of&#xD;
      the other visits, the following information were collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOLIE-31 scores (only patients aged &gt;16years), using the validated epilepsy-specific&#xD;
           questionnaire, which is the most widely used for QoL tool in epilepsy in different&#xD;
           countries;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BDI scores (only patients aged &gt;16years), using the validated inventory developed by&#xD;
           Beck (1961), shown to have reliability and sensitivity in different settings, including&#xD;
           refractory epilepsy ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AEP scores (only patients aged &gt;16years), using the epilepsy-specific validated scale&#xD;
           developed by prof. Baker ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 5 digit Global Impression Scale for clinical change, compiled separately by the&#xD;
           physician and by the patient/caregiver;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seizure frequency, by using seizure diaries compiled by patients and/or caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects, through general and neurological examination and non-structured&#xD;
           interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug treatment details (including, when available, serum AED levels), from the&#xD;
           prescriber and patient's interview, and drug load scores as described by prof. Deckers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Items to be used for cost calculations, based on patient's records of laboratory tests,&#xD;
           doctor's visits, specialist consultations, treatments, hospital admissions, and&#xD;
           day-hospital days during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration was 36 months.&#xD;
