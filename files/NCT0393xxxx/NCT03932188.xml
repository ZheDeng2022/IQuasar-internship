      This study assesses brain connectivity and function of individuals ages 13-25 at a prodromal&#xD;
      or early stage of a psychotic disorder. Participation involves approximately 3 hours of MRI&#xD;
      scanning and up to 6 hours of behavioral testing at Washington University School of&#xD;
      Medicine's campus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a devastating illness inflicting about 1% of the population worldwide.&#xD;
      Symptoms of schizophrenia include paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors, and&#xD;
      is associated with lifelong occupational and social disability. It typically develops in&#xD;
      adolescence or early adulthood, which are particularly formative periods in life when major&#xD;
      educational, vocational, and social life changes occur, and then the brain undergoes a&#xD;
      rearrangement of critical neural circuits. The &quot;prodrome&quot; is the period before the onset of a&#xD;
      psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia. Prodromal youth often have significant emotional&#xD;
      distress and social withdrawal, and family members may observe a concerning change in&#xD;
      behavior or school or work performance. Identifying those at clinical high risk for a&#xD;
      psychotic disorder is important, as early intervention can improve symptoms and functioning,&#xD;
      and could prevent the eventual development of a psychotic disorder. This study will focus on&#xD;
      individuals aged 13-25 years who have met criteria for a psychosis-risk syndrome (or&#xD;
      attenuated psychosis syndrome) or are at a very early stage (first 3 years after diagnosis)&#xD;
      of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Involvement will&#xD;
      be either 2 or 3 partial days at Washington University and will involve approximately 3 hours&#xD;
      of MRI scanning and up to 6 hours of behavioral testing. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      study the effect of genetics on the patterns of brain connectivity in various psychiatric&#xD;
      populations. DNA will be collected non-invasively from saliva and stored and processed in&#xD;
      Washington University facilities.&#xD;

    <description>The current project aims to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical characteristics. The investigator will use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to identify brain signatures that cut across psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia.</description>
