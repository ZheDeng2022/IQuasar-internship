  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greatest dropout rate of orthodontic treatments is pain, from the installation of the&#xD;
      elastomeric separators, to the exchange of wires and accessories. This process that presents&#xD;
      both physiological and psychological responses negatively affects patients' quality of life&#xD;
      due to the difficulty of chewing and biting. The sample will be comprised of individuals who&#xD;
      will receive elastomeric spacers on the mesial and distal surfaces of the upper first molars,&#xD;
      randomized into two groups, the group being irradiated with the low intensity laser, called&#xD;
      the experimental group, and the placebo group, simulated laser. In the installation of the&#xD;
      tabs, the experimental group will receive a single application in the mesial and distal&#xD;
      cervical portion and in the apical third of the molars. The energy delivered at each point&#xD;
      will be 2J, per vestibular and lingual, 6 points, totaling 12 J of energy per tooth. To&#xD;
      evaluate the perception of pain we will use the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA) after 1h, for all&#xD;
      groups. The gingival pockets cytokines will be collected with an absorbent paper cone for 30&#xD;
      seconds on both groups and compared between them by ELISA. It is expected that patients in&#xD;
      the irradiated group will have lower pain perception and less cytokines than in the placebo&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (pain measurement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>After an hour of installation of the separators, patients will respond to pain perception, being instructed to quantify their level of discomfort by measuring the VAS. The scale was converted into 11 points, 0 to 10, where 0 refers to the absence of pain and 10 levels of intolerable pain.</description>

    <measure>Change in IL-8 cytokine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>We will insert absorbent tissue cones at the sampling sites (gingival pockets), before and one hour after the insertion of the separators. The levels of cytokines will be analyzed by the ELISA interleukin kits method, strictly following the manufacturer's instructions, by the same examiner.</description>

    <description>In this study, immediately after the installation of the separators, the subjects of the experimental group will be submitted to photobiomodulation. The laser will be infrared, in continuous mode with wavelength of 808 nm. The tip will be positioned perpendicularly in the mucosa, without exerting pressure. At each point 2J of energy will be irradiated for 20 seconds, totaling 12J per tooth, 6J on the buccal side and 6J of the lingual side of the teeth.</description>
