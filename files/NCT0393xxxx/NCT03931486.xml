  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology and pathogenesis of acute Achilles tendon ruptures are complex and not fully&#xD;
      understood. It is well known that they are associated with pre-existing pathological&#xD;
      alterations, similar to the changes observed in tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study investigates if bacteria and collagen metabolism play a role in the&#xD;
      etiology of acute Achilles tendon rupture. During surgery, 20 patients will have taken two&#xD;
      biopsies from the ruptured part of the tendon and two biopsies from the healthy tissue of the&#xD;
      same tendon 2-4 cm proximal to the rupture, as a control.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the collagen turnover in Achilles tendons prior to a rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the relative collagen turnover in Achilles tendons the days immediately&#xD;
           after a rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the acute collagen protein synthesis rate in acutely ruptured Achilles&#xD;
           tendons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate if bacterial DNA is present in samples from the degenerative tissue in&#xD;
           acutely ruptured Achilles tendons compared with samples from the healthy tissue of the&#xD;
           ruptured tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tendon ruptures are severe injuries that potentially lead to reduced function, reduced&#xD;
      activity and sick leave. In younger, sports active individuals with strong tendons, an acute&#xD;
      traumatic event is usually needed to trigger a rupture. With age the tendons are exposed to&#xD;
      degenerative changes and can therefore rupture in everyday activities (spontaneously).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous tendon ruptures are complex and not fully&#xD;
      understood. It is well known that they are associated with pre-existing pathological&#xD;
      alterations, similar to the changes ob-served in tendinopathy. Recently, Dakin et al. found&#xD;
      that ruptured Achilles tendons show evidence of chronic (non-resolving) inflammation. The&#xD;
      condition might be a result of collagenolytic injury followed by failed tendon healing. Yet,&#xD;
      other theories are still highly debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many predisposing factors have been proposed to contribute to the pathological alterations of&#xD;
      tendons. Studies found that factors such as increasing age, dominant arm, history of trauma&#xD;
      and specific acromial anatomy are associated with rotator cuff tear. It is suggested that&#xD;
      spontaneous tendon ruptures, primary Achilles tendon, are related to systemic and injectable&#xD;
      steroids, fluoroquinolone use and some rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, studies have shown&#xD;
      possible associations between genetic factors and tendon injury. The mentioned factors may&#xD;
      influence the initiation and development of the patho-logical alterations that weaken the&#xD;
      tendons. However, it is certain there are other mechanisms and predis-posing factors that&#xD;
      need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heinemeier et al. found that the bulk of the collagen matrix of healthy human Achilles tendon&#xD;
      core is an essentially permanent structure that is laid down during height growth and has&#xD;
      limited turnover in adults. The findings were based on the 14C bomb pulse method, and&#xD;
      unpublished data from the same re-search group (using this method) indicates that an&#xD;
      abnormally high rate of collagen turnover precedes symptoms of tendon overuse&#xD;
      (tendinopathy)It is of great interest to investigate if increased collagen turno-ver&#xD;
      predisposes to tendon rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Rolf et al. demonstrated the presence of bacterial DNA in 25% of samples from&#xD;
      ruptured Achilles tendons. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the highly&#xD;
      conserved bacterial 16S rDNA gene in the tendons. This finding open the question, if&#xD;
      bacterial depositions play a role in the etiology of spontaneous tendon ruptures In order to&#xD;
      prevent tendon ruptures it is essential to improve our understanding of the etiology. A&#xD;
      better understanding may also lead to development of new therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate if bacteria potentially are contributing&#xD;
      to the etiology of acute Achilles tendon rupture, Additionally, we also investigate if tendon&#xD;
      ruptures are preceded by an in-creased collagen turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted as a cross-sectional study. Patients with acute rupture of the&#xD;
      Achilles tendon are included The study aims to include 20 patients with acute Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure for the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the day of inclusion, the patients will have taken a blood sample and ingest 150ml of&#xD;
           deuterium oxide (D2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the day of the surgery, the patient will meet 3 hours before the beginning of the&#xD;
           surgery. A bolus of stable isotope (15N marked proline tracer) will be injected and&#xD;
           afterwards continuous infused trough the antecubital vein. Blood samples are taken&#xD;
           before infusion starts, 30min after, 60min af-ter, 120min after and when the biopsies&#xD;
           are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the surgery, the patients will have taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Two biopsies from the stump end of the ruptured tendon or ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Two control biopsies 2-4 cm proximal to the stump end of the ruptured Achilles&#xD;
                tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies are taken by trained orthopedic surgeons. Every biopsy is taken during surgery&#xD;
      in an operating theatre. Before the beginning of the surgery a sterile table is prepared&#xD;
      containing three packs of sterile scalpels and forceps, and 8 containers for biopsies with&#xD;
      the patient's social security (CPR), the type of analysis and a continues number individually&#xD;
      describing each biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8 containers will hold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Biopsy from the stump end of the ruptured tendon for 16S rDNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biopsy from the stump end of the ruptured tendon for 14C bomb pulse method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biopsy from the stump end of the ruptured tendon for isotope analysis (deuterium oxide&#xD;
           and 15N marked proline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biopsy from the stump end of the ruptured tendon for mRNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biopsy from the ruptured tendon 2-4 cm proximal to the stump end for 16S rDNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biopsy from the ruptured tendon 2-4 cm proximal to the stump end for 14C bomb pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Biopsy from the ruptured tendon 2-4 cm proximal to the stump end for isotope analysis&#xD;
           (deuterium oxide and 15N marked proline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Biopsy from the ruptured tendon 2-4 cm proximal to the stump end for mRNA analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies from ruptured tendons&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achilles tendon:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsies are taken during open surgery. To prevent contamination of the biopsies the&#xD;
      following proce-dure is followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical rub and draping according to normal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin incision and dissection according to normal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. As the ruptured tendon is identified, a new pack containing a sterile scalpel and a&#xD;
           forceps is opened. The instruments are only used for taking the biopsy and does not get&#xD;
           in contact with the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2 biopsies, 10mm long, 1mm broad and 1mm deep, are taken from the degenerated tendon&#xD;
           tissue at the rupture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The first biopsy is placed in a container (for bacterial detection). On a sterile board,&#xD;
           the second bi-opsy is divided in three and placed in three different containers (one for&#xD;
           14C bomb pulse, one for isotope analysis (both deuterium oxide and 15N marked proline)&#xD;
           and one for mRNA). These contain-ers are frozen down to -80oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A second new pack containing a sterile scalpel and a forceps is opened and 2 biopsies 10&#xD;
           mm long, 1mm broad and 1 mm deep are taken 2-4 cm proximal to the rupture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The first biopsy is placed in a container (for bacterial detection) On a sterile board,&#xD;
           the second biopsy is divided in three and placed in three different containers (one for&#xD;
           14C bomb pulse, one for isotope analysis (both deuterium oxide and 15N marked proline)&#xD;
           and one for mRNA). These contain-ers are frozen down to -80oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contamination tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR and sequencing - Both a negative and a positive control is included in the test. Numbers&#xD;
      of cycles in positive samples will also be included in the interpretation. Exclusively&#xD;
      environmental bacterial species never been related to human disease are likely to be regarded&#xD;
      as contaminants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood culture - During surgery, blood a sample is send for culture to investigate if bacteria&#xD;
      were presented in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial cultures - Bacterial culture tests are conducted on all patients. The investigated&#xD;
      samples are taken with swaps from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients skin area over the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The blade of the used scalpel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swaps are collected in separate glass tubes and send to Department of Microbiology,&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospi-tal. The swaps are tested on multiple culture media for multiple species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of the analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each included patient, the 2 containers with biopsies for bacterial detection will get a&#xD;
      randomized continues number. These numbers can, via a key document (paper form), reveal if&#xD;
      the biopsy has been taken from the degenerative tissue or from the healthy tissue. The person&#xD;
      responsible for the analyze of the bacterial DNA has no access to the key document.&#xD;
&#xD;
