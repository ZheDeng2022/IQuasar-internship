  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Non-invasive ventilation at home for chronic respiratory failure due to different&#xD;
      etiologies has proven effective regarding mortality and quality of life. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      adherence to therapy still constitutes a clinical day-to-day problem. Physiological&#xD;
      monitoring has shown to improve adherence. We hypothesise that an additional behavioural&#xD;
      intervention delivered via mHealth tools, on top of usual care, can further enhance&#xD;
      therapeutical success alongside patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized single-blinded controlled trial with an intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      Intervention will consist of a multi-component based behavioural intervention delivered via a&#xD;
      mHealth tool, during a three-month period. Primary objective will be change in self-efficacy&#xD;
      towards non-invasive ventilation use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Based on a change of 0.5 units in the Self Efficacy in Sleep apnea&#xD;
      (SEMSA) questionnaire, a sample size of 30 subjects per study arm was calculated. It has been&#xD;
      anticipated a drop-out rate of 5%. Standard statistical analysis will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: we expect a positive change on the SEMSA score (reflecting better&#xD;
      self-efficacy) after three-month use. Indirectly, this enhancement should facilitate patient&#xD;
      adherence specifically via mask leak problems resolution. Also, we presume that the proposed&#xD;
      mHealth tool will be highly usable and accepted by the patients, leading to overall&#xD;
      satisfaction with the service provided.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The polio epidemics demonstrated the safety and efficacy of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to&#xD;
      decrease mortality. Since then, this therapeutic approach has been shown to reduce hospital&#xD;
      admissions, impact favourably on health-related quality of life (HRQL), improve sleep quality&#xD;
      and reduce mortality in patients with diverse chronic pathologies. This success has driven&#xD;
      the increase in prevalence of patients using home NIV in Europe, ranging from 4.5 to 20 per&#xD;
      100,000 adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of NIV at home has been proven to be cost-effective, but patients' adherence to&#xD;
      therapy has still potential to improve which should further enhance healthcare efficiencies&#xD;
      of the intervention. Optimization of physiological settings and monitoring can contribute to&#xD;
      enhance adherence by improving timely detection of problems such as mask leaks,&#xD;
      patient-ventilator asynchronies, etc. However, improvement of behavioural aspects such as&#xD;
      patient motivation and empowerment for self-management are also important factors to consider&#xD;
      when addressing adherence to respiratory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol seeks to explore the transfer of previous positive experiences on&#xD;
      behavioural interventions in other fields (i.e. physical activity into home-based NIV and, in&#xD;
      general, into respiratory therapies. Specifically, we will explore the concept of&#xD;
      self-efficacy. It is defined as the individual's perceived capability to perform the&#xD;
      particular behaviour. A person who does not believe in her or his own capability to perform a&#xD;
      desired action will fail to adopt, initiate, and maintain it. Self-efficacy is therefore seen&#xD;
      as the most influential motivational factor and the strongest predictor of behavioural&#xD;
      intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of self-efficacy to the problem of identifying predictors of BIPAP use&#xD;
      derives from the social cognitive theory concept of Bandura (Bandura's model). This model has&#xD;
      been widely applied in studies of the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of&#xD;
      health-promoting behaviors and consists of the concepts of perception of the risk to health,&#xD;
      expectations regarding treatment outcome (outcome expectancies), and the confidence or&#xD;
      volition to engage in the behavior (treatment self-efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside this well-defined behavioural concept, we also identify the role of information and&#xD;
      communication technologies (ICT) as a promising scenario to generate efficiencies by&#xD;
      enhancing coordination between stakeholders and contributing to improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the scenario is not still mature. Mainly, because of&#xD;
      lacking evidence in real-world scenarios for the capacity of ICT to escort behavioural&#xD;
      changes in chronic complex patients. It is widely accepted that, despite current limitations,&#xD;
      chronic complex patients are an ideal population where care coordination, patient and medical&#xD;
      staff satisfaction alongside patient empowerment are of utmost importance to produce health&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol intends to produce evidence on the capacity of a behavioural intervention&#xD;
      to increase patient empowerment for self-management and adherence to therapy accompanied by&#xD;
      an ICT tool interoperable with the information system of the healthcare provider. Moreover,&#xD;
      the intervention should generate high acceptability/satisfaction among patients, carers and&#xD;
      professionals. We fully acknowledge that if the expected results are achieved, the proposed&#xD;
      study shall be followed by long-term assessment of the impact of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The multicomponent intervention will comprise three aspects on-top of usual care: i) Motivational interview to assess patient's adherence profile and to raise the compromise with the behaviour change towards NIV, physical activity and nutritional habits; ii) Bi-directional interaction between the study participants and clinical staff delivered by the MyPathway app, where specific clinical problems regarding NIV will be addressed as they arise; and iii) Motivational messages and educational material delivered via the MyPathway app regarding changes in physical activity and/or nutritional habits. As part of the behavioural intervention, goal setting for NIV adherence and life-style changes will be introduced to the MyPathway app in order for the participants to follow the advice.</description>
