  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate a novel 3-fraction radiation regimen for participants undergoing&#xD;
      breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for early breast cancer that will: 1) significantly reduce&#xD;
      the duration of treatment and can be completed in one-week (5 working days) and 2) MRI-guided&#xD;
      radiotherapy (MRIdian) would limit the volume of normal tissue radiated and therefore&#xD;
      resultant toxicity. The hypothesis is that 3-fraction radiation therapy can be delivered&#xD;
      safely without compromising the therapeutic ratio. Participants can expect to be on study for&#xD;
      follow up up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will have a lead-in phase consisting of 10 patients, followed for 6-months from the date of completion of radiotherapy for the tenth patient. The second phase of accrual (20 patients) will commence only if three or fewer patients (3/10=30%) have CTCAE v 5.0 grade 3 or higher skin toxicity (radiation dermatitis) or Lövey et al. grade 3 or higher fat necrosis.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Physician Reported Cosmesis: 1-year</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1-year</time_frame>
    <description>The Harvard Cosmesis Scale will be used to report cosmesis at 1 year post treatment. The physician will report how the breast looks relative to original appearance or untreated breast (excellent, good, fair, poor). The physician answers 9 questions on a scale of 0-2 where 0 is none, 1 is present but does not affect cosmesis, 2 is present and affects cosmesis. Scoring is objective with lower scores indicating improved conditions.</description>
