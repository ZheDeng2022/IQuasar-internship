      This purpose of this study is to determine whether nasal delivery of heated and humidified&#xD;
      air for a period of 4 hours will improve the clearance of mucus from the lungs of patients&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mucus clearance will be measured using a&#xD;
      nuclear medicine imaging procedure called a mucociliary clearance scan. Humidified air (with&#xD;
      added oxygen if needed) will be delivered from the Fisher and Paykel myAirvo2&#xD;
      heater/humidifier through an Optiflow nasal cannula.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic bronchitis is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), along with&#xD;
      emphysema. COPD is associated with smoking, exposure to environmental pollutants, or&#xD;
      occupational exposures. In the airways mucus acts to trap inhaled toxins or pathogens. In a&#xD;
      healthy lung mucus is cleared by mucociliary and cough clearance. Mucociliary clearance&#xD;
      involves the synchronous motion of cilia underneath the mucus sheet that lines the airways.&#xD;
      This drives the mucus sheet out of the airways (like a conveyer belt) continually clearing&#xD;
      particulate and pathogens. In chronic bronchitis, mucus is overproduced due to toxic stimuli.&#xD;
      Mucus clearance may also be defective due to airway obstruction and insufficient cough. This&#xD;
      results in the accumulation of mucus that contributes to airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies for improving mucus clearance may decrease the degree of airway obstruction&#xD;
      experienced by COPD patients. Heated, high-flow, humidified air or oxygen may improve mucus&#xD;
      clearance by hydrating the mucus in the airways and may also help to increase airway patency.&#xD;
      A similar intervention was shown to improve mucus clearance in subjects with bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed nuclear imaging-based methods for measuring mucus clearance&#xD;
      from the lungs. These techniques have been applied to evaluate novel therapies for the&#xD;
      treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease. Here the investigators will apply these techniques&#xD;
      to determine whether treatment with heated-humidified air will improve mucus clearance in&#xD;
      subjects with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation involves 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study day 1 includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A conversation with a physician and completion of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulmonary function testing (including albuterol administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The completion of a series of questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study days 2 and 3 include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A urine pregnancy test (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Performance of a Co57 transmission scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The inhalation of a radiopharmaceutical (Technetium-99m sulfur colloid) from a nebulizer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lying flat in a nuclear medicine camera for 90 minutes while scans are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Remaining at the test center for a follow up scan approximately 2.5 hours later. This&#xD;
           scan will take 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Nasal delivery of heated humidified air (with supplemental oxygen if needed) at a rate&#xD;
           of 30 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, on one study day. This will be started&#xD;
           during the first 10 minutes of the 90 minute scanning period and continued for 4 hours.&#xD;
           One the other study day there will be no treatment so that a baseline measurement of&#xD;
           mucociliary clearance can be made. The order of the study days will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to refrain from using short-acting beta agonist (SABA) medications&#xD;
      for 6 hours prior to study days 2 and 3, and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or long-acting&#xD;
      muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) for 24 hours prior to study days 2 and 3.&#xD;
