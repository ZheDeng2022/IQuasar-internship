    <textblock>
      The current study is based on the use of transvaginal sonography in the evaluation of&#xD;
      oligohydramnios. Patients will be recruited after amniotic fluid index evaluation according&#xD;
      to transabdominal sonography. After obtaining informed consent, transvaginal sonography will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate and measure a possible amniotic fluid pocket that may precede the fetal&#xD;
      presenting part.&#xD;

      Background Normal amniotic fluid volume varies across gestation (Ounpraseuth 2017). Abnormal&#xD;
      amniotic fluid volume has been associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes (Shrem&#xD;
      2016). In clinical practice, the amniotic fluid volume is a component of the biophysical&#xD;
      profile which provides information on fetal well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transabdominal ultrasound is used to assess quantitatively the amniotic fluid volume, most&#xD;
      commonly by either the Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) or the Maximum Vertical Pocket (MVP)&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of the AFI method has been questioned in several studies, which have shown that an&#xD;
      abnormal test, low or high, is neither highly accurate nor predictive of adverse outcome.&#xD;
      Many pregnancies with normal AFI will be falsely characterized as abnormal, and a large&#xD;
      number with truly abnormal AFI will be missed (Magann 1994, Chauhan 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MVP measurement may be preferred over the AFI method. A 2008 systematic review of&#xD;
      randomized trials found that use of the AFI increased the rate of diagnosis of&#xD;
      oligohydramnios (RR 2.3), induction of labor (RR 2.1), and cesarean delivery for fetal&#xD;
      distress (RR 1.5) (Nabhan 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Hypothesis of the Study Recently, our group observed that when transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound is being performed to non-laboring pregnant women at term for other obstetrical&#xD;
      indications, there is a large amniotic fluid pocket above the internal cervical os and below&#xD;
      the fetal presenting part. Due to the unique location of this pocket, we hypothesized that&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound may provide better information than transabdominal ultrasound on&#xD;
      amniotic fluid volume, particularly in cases when suspecting abnormal low amniotic fluid&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maternal and fetal characteristics Data related to the fetomaternal antenatal,&#xD;
           intrapartum and postpartum course will be recorded prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound assessment Each eligible woman in the study population group will be asked to&#xD;
           undergo prenatal ultrasound examination twice. The first ultrasound examination is a&#xD;
           routine transabdominal ultrasound examination that is carried out to assess fetal growth&#xD;
           and well-being. This is to be continued with a second transvaginal ultrasound, with a&#xD;
           specific focus on the amniotic fluid pocket, that is; the distance in centimetres&#xD;
           between the fetal presenting part and the internal cervical os. The second transvaginal&#xD;
           ultrasound will be performed for the purpose of the study only, and by one other&#xD;
           research team member that is blinded to the first routine transabdominal ultrasound. The&#xD;
           entire length of the study, combining the transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds,&#xD;
           is expected to take on the average around 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Equipment and Safety Considerations In their 2011 statement, The International&#xD;
      Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ISUOG) and World Federation of&#xD;
      Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) consider ultrasonography to be safe for use during&#xD;
      clinical practice (ISUOG 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses and sample size For sample size calculation, and given a 20% rate of&#xD;
      induction of labor, of which 3% are due to abnormal low amniotic fluid volume&#xD;
      (oligohydramnios), a sample size of 1000 women is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the Study Considering the high volume of maternal care here at Rambam Health&#xD;
      Care Campus, and that every year there are around 5,000 births and nearly double routine&#xD;
      cares, the recruitment process for the current study is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Duration of the Study The recruitment for the study is expected to take place over&#xD;
      12 months with an additional 3-6 months after recruitment for data analysis before&#xD;
      publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding Women will be recruited while approaching Rambam Health Care Campus for their routine&#xD;
      obstetric care. Ultrasound examinations will be carried out using existing operational&#xD;
      ultrasound equipments within the obstetric department at Rambam Health Care Campus. For both,&#xD;
      the recruitment and the ultrasound examinations, no extra funding is currently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public Health Interest Identifying new ultrasound variables that can assist in quantifying&#xD;
      amniotic fluid volume, as the one suggested in the current study, is of great importance and&#xD;
      may provide invaluable information into the overall future care and decision-making around&#xD;
      the time of delivery, especially whether or not to induce labor in women with suspected&#xD;
      oligohydramnios. Thus, it may assist in creating future recommendations for pregnant women&#xD;
      and improved healthcare standards during the delivery process.&#xD;
