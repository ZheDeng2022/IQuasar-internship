  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has been recently approved for patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck. However, only a small percentage of patients experience&#xD;
      long-term control, necessitating new therapeutic strategies. Recently, it was shown&#xD;
      preclinically and in breast tumors that abemaciclib stimulates production of type III&#xD;
      interferons and hence enhances tumor antigen presentation. Abemaciclib also suppressed the&#xD;
      proliferation of regulatory T cells. These events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance&#xD;
      of tumor cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade.&#xD;
      Based on these data, a phase II trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck&#xD;
      cancer who are eligible for immunotherapy is proposed to investigate the combination of&#xD;
      abemaciclib with pembrolizumab. Tumor &amp; blood analysis for interferon gamma signature will be&#xD;
      explored as possible biomarkers.&#xD;

             the study and for 4 months following last dose of treatment. All female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7&#xD;
             days prior to study treatment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree&#xD;
