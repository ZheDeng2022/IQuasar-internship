  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard sleep study for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with&#xD;
      co-existing illness is by conducting an attended polysomnography (PSG) with more than 7&#xD;
      channels for recording physiological parameters in the sleep center, as recommended by&#xD;
      international guidelines. However the guidelines are more than 10 year old without update.&#xD;
      With the growing and aging of the population, there is a need to explore if portable&#xD;
      monitoring devices could be used in this group of population, so this group of patients can&#xD;
      be managed in a timely manner. Portable monitoring devices have been used widely in patients&#xD;
      without significant co-existing illness. These devices record at least 4 physiological&#xD;
      parameters for diagnosing OSA and can be performed in an unattended setting e.g. at home&#xD;
      because of the simplicity. This can shorten the waiting time for making a diagnosis using&#xD;
      PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty patients suspected of OSA, with stable co-existing illnesses, will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study. Informed consent will be signed before participation. They will be offered a&#xD;
      standard attended PSG in the sleep center. A portable monitoring device &quot;Nox T3&quot; will be&#xD;
      hooked up to the patients concurrently during the PSG.&#xD;
