    <textblock>
      IMAGISION aims to explore, in a cohort of patients referred for geriatric consultation for&#xD;
      neurocognitive evaluation, the contribution of functional neuroimaging (functional MRI and,&#xD;
      if possible, high resolution EEG) to geriatric expertise, associated with the performance of&#xD;
      a battery of neuropsychological tests in the evaluation of decision-making capacity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is during aging of patients, especially those with polypathological disorders and in whom&#xD;
      cognitive disorders appear, that the most complex and ethical questions arise. In this&#xD;
      context, these patients are frequently referred to geriatric consultations or memory centres&#xD;
      for a global assessment of their cognitive functions and life skills in order to optimize&#xD;
      their care and anticipate their medical and medico-social future. The assessment of&#xD;
      decision-making capacity is essential in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is no test that specifically explores this issue and, therefore, people's&#xD;
      decision-making abilities may not be properly estimated and may prevent some patients from&#xD;
      making decisions when they would be able to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, although the issue of decision-making has generally been explored from a&#xD;
      neuropsychological perspective in many studies, there is no specific test or score for&#xD;
      decision-making capacity, as it is a complex process. The question of decision-making&#xD;
      capacity in complex situations is therefore addressed by a multiple analysis of many&#xD;
      parameters, including different neuropsychological data, which are then synthesized by the&#xD;
      clinician in a standardized geriatric assessment to get an idea, among other things, of the&#xD;
      overall ability to make decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the difficulty of this and the ethical and societal issue, the research question&#xD;
      focuses on the contribution of neuroimaging technologies to the assessment of decision-making&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, several studies have explored the issue as part of the functional neuroimaging&#xD;
      study. The investigators note, in particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision-making studies were conducted using the EEG-High Resolution (EEG-HR) technique.&#xD;
           It is a technique for electromagnetic analysis of brain functions with excellent&#xD;
           temporal resolution and quite good spatial resolution. This allows, during functional&#xD;
           decision tests, a detailed analysis of the temporality of the activation of the frontal&#xD;
           and prefrontal areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional MRI (fMRI) is a neurological imaging technique whose main strength lies in&#xD;
           its spatial acuity. Thus, the performance of functional decisional tests under&#xD;
           functional MRI allows a detailed analysis of the recruitment of the different zones&#xD;
           between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the median ventromedian cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 2 neuroimaging techniques allowed a neuro-functional analysis of decision making, based&#xD;
      on the realization of more specific tests, modelling decision making. Among these models, the&#xD;
      Iowa Game Task and the Balloon Assessement Risk Task are frequently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, all these tests and explorations were conducted independently, and no studies&#xD;
      have investigated the contribution of a neurofunctional approach to patient decision-making&#xD;
      through complementary explorations in functional MRI and /or in EEG-HR as diagnostic tools as&#xD;
      part of an overall gerontological evaluation of decision making ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question that arises is therefore that of the development of diagnostic tools.&#xD;

    <description>The cohort data will be compared between patients identified as &quot; questionable ability &quot; according to the clinical evaluation (reference) and the neuroimaging evaluation, in order to see if the imaging allows to reclassify patients as &quot; able &quot;. A 10 % diagnostic gain in expected.&#xD;
Concerning functional neuroimaging (Balloon Analog Risk Task): The lack of activation of specific brain areas during period of interest will be considered as &quot;compatible with the ability to make decisions&quot; on neuro-functional imaging, while patients who do not activate the ROIs in the same situation will be considered as &quot;compatible with questionable decision-making ability&quot;.&#xD;
Concerning standardized geriatric assessment: At the end of the initial consultation, based on his clinical examination, interview and standardized neuropsychological assessment, the geriatrician will classify each patient either as &quot; preserved decision-making ability &quot; or &quot; questionable decision-making ability &quot;.</description>

    <description>The results of the functional neuroimaging tests will be analyzed in comparison with the neuropsychological tests performed, to verify the correlation between the results of the neuropsychological tests of decision-making ability and the results of the neuroimaging tests, and thus to identify, among the battery of tests used, those that are the most discriminating in the evaluation of decision-making ability</description>

    <description>The neuropsychological tests that will be carried out will allow to identify the stage of neurocognitive disorders in patients. These elements can be correlated with the analysis of decision-making abilities in order to demonstrate a correlation between neurocognitive disorders, their stage, and decision-making ability</description>
