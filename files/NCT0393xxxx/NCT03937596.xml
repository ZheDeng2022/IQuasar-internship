  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved treatment for depression. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test an adjunctive medication, D-cycloserine, in rTMS for depression&#xD;
      using a placebo-controlled design. D-Cycloserine is a partial N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor&#xD;
      (NMDAr) agonist, and therefore may enhance the effects of rTMS, however there is data to&#xD;
      support and refute this hypothesis. Using a double-blind design, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomize patients with Major Depressive Disorder to receive either daily low dose&#xD;
      D-cycloserine or placebo in conjunction with rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
      After 10 treatments (2 weeks), this double-blind period will conclude and all participants&#xD;
      will receive an additional 10 treatments (2 weeks) of rTMS without any adjuncts. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be improvement in clinician rated depressive symptoms at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating illness. For an unacceptable&#xD;
      proportion of patients, depressive symptoms remain impairing despite multiple treatments.&#xD;
      Increasingly, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are being explored as a means of&#xD;
      targeting specific brain regions and networks that are implicated in depression. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is the non-invasive stimulation technique with the&#xD;
      largest evidence base in MDD. Targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with rTMS&#xD;
      has proven an effective treatment for MDD, however as many as 2/3 of patients will not&#xD;
      experience substantial improvement. Adjunctive agents are a potential strategy to improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed study is to determine the efficacy of adjunctive D-cycloserine&#xD;
      with rTMS directed to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in acute Major&#xD;
      Depressive Episodes. The investigators propose to utilize a stimulation protocol called the&#xD;
      intermittent theta-burst protocol to study rTMS in conjunction with D-cyloserine using a&#xD;
      randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design with allocation concealment. Patients with&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder will be randomized to receive 1) rTMS+cycloserine, or 2)&#xD;
      rTMS+placebo in a 1:1 ratio for two weeks (10 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the 2-week blinded augmentation phase, patients will continue to receive&#xD;
      two weeks of rTMS without an augmentation agent or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be improvement in depression as measured by change in&#xD;
      Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). In addition, the investigators will also&#xD;
      be looking at the improvement of other clinical outcome measures, quality of life and changes&#xD;
      in brain functional dynamics, as assessed with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      and metabolites, as assessed by Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy.&#xD;
