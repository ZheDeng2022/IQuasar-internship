    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is a prospective cohort study. Chemotherapy alone will be proposed to&#xD;
      adult patients suffering from a &quot;low grade&quot; brainstem glioma subtype showing infiltrative,&#xD;
      non-threatening clinico-radiological progression. Patients will receive temozolomide at a&#xD;
      monthly standard dose of 150-200 mg/m2/j J1-J5, will be clinically evaluated every month and&#xD;
      will undergo radiological evaluation every 2 months. The duration of treatment will be 12&#xD;
      months. Then, the patients will be followed-up until progression, with clinical evaluations&#xD;
      and MRI performed every 2-3 months. At the time of recurrence, treatment with focal radiation&#xD;
      therapy will be administered (54 Gy in classical fractions).&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to assess the impact (objective response) of first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy in infiltrative non-enhancing adult brainstem gliomas that are progressing in an&#xD;
      infiltrative and non-threatening way. Upon progression, (radiotherapy) RT will be&#xD;
      administered. Main inclusion criteria are:18 years of age or older/Karnofsky's Index over 50&#xD;
      /Non-enhancing lesion at MRI/Histologically proven infiltrating pattern of brainstem glioma&#xD;
      except in case of formal contraindication to surgery determined via discussion of the case&#xD;
      with expert neurosurgeons during a national webmeeting ((GLIome du TRonc de l'ADulte group&#xD;
      (GLITRAD))/Clinical and/or radiological progression with an infiltrative but non-threatening&#xD;
      pattern, warranting antitumoral treatment. The treatment delivered will be Temozolomide at a&#xD;
      monthly standard dose of 150-200 mg/m2/day at day 1 to day 5 for a duration of treatment of&#xD;
      12 months. The study is a prospective single-arm phase II trial. Primary end point is&#xD;
      objective response rate (radiographic and clinical response) to Temozolomide according to&#xD;
      Response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria (RANO criteria). Secondary end points are&#xD;
      histological pattern of adult brainstem gliomas/Molecular pattern of adult brainstem gliomas/&#xD;
      Radiological pattern of adult brainstem gliomas based on standard and multimodal&#xD;
      MRI/Metabolic pattern of adult brainstem gliomas based on 18F-DOPA PET CT at initial&#xD;
      diagnosis and its change after treatment /Global survival/Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ-C30 with BN-20)/Tolerance to temozolomide/Volumetric velocity of the tumor growth&#xD;
      during follow-up before treatment from the initial MRI until the last MRI before beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment, established with sagittal cube FLAIR sequences/Volumetric velocity of the&#xD;
      tumor growth during follow-up during treatment of chemotherapy, established with sagittal&#xD;
      cube FLAIR sequences/Rate of objective response, stabilization and progression under&#xD;
      treatment obtained by combining the RANO criteria and the scores obtained on 3 scales (ataxia&#xD;
      measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), diet measured by the&#xD;
      Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and diplopia).A number of 60 patients should be enrolled.&#xD;
      THe duration of the study is 4 years.&#xD;
