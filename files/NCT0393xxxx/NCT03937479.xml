    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the dose response of RPL554 in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE that are still symptomatic despite&#xD;
      treatment with a stable background of tiotropium over 4 weeks of treatment. This study is&#xD;
      intended to support optimal dose selection for a Phase III program evaluating RPL554 as an&#xD;
      add-on treatment to standard of care therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose, parallel&#xD;
      group study to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of treatment with nebulized RPL554 (at&#xD;
      different dose levels) compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe CHRONIC&#xD;
      OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE on a stable background therapy of open-label tiotropium. The&#xD;
      study comprises seven visits: Pre-screening (Visit 0), Screening (Visit 1) and then a&#xD;
      Treatment Period consisting of Randomization (Visit 2), and weekly visits for 4 weeks (Visit&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed the SGRQ-C consisting of 40 items each weighted from 0 to a possible maximum of 100. Items 1-7 produced the symptoms score, 9-12 the activity score, and items 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 the impacts score. Each component sub-score was calculated as a percentage of the summed weights of each item out of the sum of the maximum possible weight for that component (range 0-100). The total score was calculated by summing the weights to all positive responses in each component, where a positive item indicated the presence of symptoms, expressed as a percentage (range 0-100). Higher scores indicated a worse outcome. The SGRQ-C was measured at Week 2 and 4 visits.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 49 study centers in the United States of America between 01 May 2019 and 15 November 2019. Overall, 416 adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a stable background therapy of open-label tiotropium were randomized and 413 patients received double-blind study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following Screening on Visit 1, eligible patients entered a 14-day run-in period, where they received tiotropium once daily. At Visit 2, patients were re-assessed for eligibility according to randomization criteria. Patients were randomized equally across 5 double-blind treatment groups (4 doses of RPL554 or placebo).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline to the Mean Weekly Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms of COPD (E-RS:COPD) Total Score at Weeks 1 to 4</title>
        <description>The E-RS scale consists of 11 questions, with 3 sub-domains of: breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms. The E-RS sub-domain score was calculated as the sum from the relevant questions. The E-RS:COPD scale has a scoring range of 0 to 40. Higher scores indicates severe respiratory symptoms. Baseline was the mean over the 7 days prior to first intake of study treatment. Scores were derived weekly as the mean over 7 days prior to the visit, using only days where data was recorded. The E-RS:COPD was measured by daily electronic diary (e-diary).</description>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire - COPD Specific (SGRQ-C) Total Score at Weeks 2 and 4</title>
        <description>Patients completed the SGRQ-C consisting of 40 items each weighted from 0 to a possible maximum of 100. Items 1-7 produced the symptoms score, 9-12 the activity score, and items 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 the impacts score. Each component sub-score was calculated as a percentage of the summed weights of each item out of the sum of the maximum possible weight for that component (range 0-100). The total score was calculated by summing the weights to all positive responses in each component, where a positive item indicated the presence of symptoms, expressed as a percentage (range 0-100). Higher scores indicated a worse outcome. The SGRQ-C was measured at Week 2 and 4 visits.</description>

        <title>LS Mean Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Questionnaire Total Score at Weeks 2 and 4</title>
        <description>The TDI is a questionnaire that focussed on 3 sub-domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Sub-domain score was calculated as the sum from the related questions. Total score was calculated as the sum of the sub-domain scores. The TDI measures the change in dyspnea severity from the baseline as measured by the baseline dyspnea index. It was rated by 7 grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>

        <title>LS Mean Patient Global Assessment of Change (PGAC) Questionnaire Total Score at Weeks 2 and 4</title>
        <description>The PGAC is a single question assessment to determine whether patients noticed a change in their breathing since the start of the study. Patients were asked to respond to a PGAC question asking, &quot;Compared with prior to the study start, how do you feel your breathing is?&quot; on a scale of '1=much worse' to '5=much better', with '3=no change'. Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a patient, or worsening in a patient, whether considered related to the study medication or not. All AEs which started after the first dose of study treatment or started prior to first dose of study treatment and worsened, based on the Investigator's assessment of severity, on or after first dose of study treatment were considered to be treatment-emergent. A serious adverse event is any adverse experience that: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or other important medical events.</description>
        <time_frame>TEAEs were collected from the first dose of study treatment up to 1 week after the final study visit at Week 4, approximately 5 weeks.</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. One patient who was randomized to RPL554 0.375 mg group was dispensed wrong treatment kit and received RPL554 3 mg.
