      This is a single-center pilot study of 20 patients with AML/MDS. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled following an informed consent between 6-20 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. Patients will receive weekly oral ONC 201 for a total of 52 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a single-center pilot study of 20 patients with AML/MDS. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled following an informed consent between 6-20 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. Patients will receive weekly oral ONC 201 for a total of 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are: 1. To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of ONC&#xD;
      201 maintenance therapy among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS), who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 2. To investigate&#xD;
      the impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for toxicities (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events, CTCAE version 5.0), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone&#xD;
      Marrow Transplant, FACT-BMT), and immunologic changes. We will specifically investigate the&#xD;
      impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells. We will also examine&#xD;
      changes in functional status (Karnofsky Performance Scale, KPS, instrumental activities of&#xD;
      daily living and short physical performance battery), rates of disease relapse and mortality.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of AML or MDS with at least one of the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             AML: High-risk AML as defined by the 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria (e.g. complex&#xD;
             karyotype with ≥3 changes), AML with high-risk mutations (e.g. TP53, RUNX1, or ASXL1&#xD;
             mutations), transplant being performed in second remission or beyond, or AML with&#xD;
             active disease or minimal residual disease positivity before or after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             MDS: MDS with high or very-high risk cytogenetic changes as used indefined by the&#xD;
             Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (e.g. complex karyotype with ≥3&#xD;
             changes),53 the presence of TP53 mutation, high-risk or very high-risk MDS not&#xD;
             responding to 4 cycles of hypomethylating agents, MDS progressing following initial&#xD;
             response, persistence of MDS after transplant, or transplant being performed in second&#xD;
             remission or beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receipt of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 6-20 weeks prior to&#xD;

             immunosuppressive agent for treatment of graft-versus-host disease within 4 weeks&#xD;

             but not biopsy-proven graft-versus-host disease, will not be considered an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of prednisone at a dose of ≥0.25 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of another&#xD;

             considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of&#xD;
             screening, no signs of infection progression are present. Progression of infection is&#xD;
             defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening&#xD;
             physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever&#xD;
