  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study designed to assess the safety and properties of a new oral&#xD;
      formulation containing the two most common cannabinoids used for medicinal purposes -&#xD;
      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD). The formulation is designed to disintegrate&#xD;
      sublingually in order to enhance absorption of these ingredients by circumventing first-pass&#xD;
      metabolism by the liver (and probably also by the intestinal mucosal cells) as well as&#xD;
      gastric acid degradation, thus allowing a rapid onset and more intensive pharmacological&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose, crossover, randomized, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study in healthy male adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixsteen (16) subjects will participate in the study. Each subject will undergo screening&#xD;
      procedures within 28 days prior to dosing, to assess his eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will participate in two dosing periods. They will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two administration sequences - AB or BA. In each period subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      clinic on the evening before dosing. On the next morning, under fasting conditions they will&#xD;
      receive one of the following administrations, according to a randomization list:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration A: A single tablet of Medical Grade Cannabis - Orally Disintegrating&#xD;
           Tablet (MGC-ODT) containing 5mg THC and 5 mg CBD (Test Formulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration B: Sativex® spray X 2 actuations (1 under the tongue and 1 inside the&#xD;
           cheek administered within 2 min) - Reference Product [Each 100 μL spray contains 2.7 mg&#xD;
           THC and 2.5 mg CBD, total per administration: 5.4 mg THC and 5.0 mg CBD] A taste&#xD;
           assessment questionnaire will be filled in by the subjects 2 minutes after drug&#xD;
           administration (immediately following water administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will be followed by Pharmacokinetic (PK ) blood sampling for 24 hours and Adverse&#xD;
      Events (AE) monitoring for the next 24 hours, at time points specified below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A washout period of at least 2 weeks is required between the dosings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of Study (EOS)/Safety Follow-up visit will take place 7-10 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
