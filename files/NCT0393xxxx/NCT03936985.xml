    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to validate a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program-based opioid risk&#xD;
      metric to discriminate between low, moderate, and high-risk opioid use disorder. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO ASSIST)&#xD;
      will be used as the gold standard instrument that defines patient risk levels. No&#xD;
      intervention or hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fatal overdose deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids has&#xD;
      continued to increase across the US-continuing to increase in 35 states from 2013-2017. Given&#xD;
      these persistent trends for adverse opioid-related outcomes in populations across the US, it&#xD;
      is critical to work to identify those who are at risk, deliver appropriate care that will&#xD;
      help prevent progression to more severe opioid-related outcomes, and provide referral and&#xD;
      treatment resources to those who suffer from opioid use disorder. Therefore, it is necessary&#xD;
      to expand the continuum of care to health care settings that previously may have been&#xD;
      underutilized. One underutilized resource for addressing the current opioid epidemic is&#xD;
      community pharmacies.The most important clinical tool pharmacists have available to identify&#xD;
      possible misuse of opioid medications is prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP),which&#xD;
      capture patient-level prescription dispensing information to inform monitoring, dispensing&#xD;
      decisions, and possible intervention.These tools are available in all US states and have the&#xD;
      potential to enable pharmacists to identify patients at-risk for opioid-related adverse&#xD;
      events, such as addiction and overdose. In light of the continued escalation of the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic nationally, combined with the promising opportunities afforded by the further&#xD;
      inclusion of community pharmacy settings for engaging patients with opioid-related risk, it&#xD;
      is important to evaluate whether current PDMP risk metrics correlate with clinically&#xD;
      validated opioid risk tools and if clinically meaningful risk cutoffs exist for PDMP risk&#xD;
      metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the concurrent validity of a PDMP-based opioid risk metric as a&#xD;
      clinical measure of high risk opioid use and establish clinically useful risk-level&#xD;
      thresholds relative to the widely validated gold standard of the World Health Organization&#xD;
      Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO ASSIST). This study is a one&#xD;
      group, cross-sectional, health assessment study. Participants who enroll in the study will&#xD;
      complete on-line surveys at a single time point. Approximately 1,523 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from approximately 15 community community pharmacies. Trained pharmacy staff will&#xD;
      inform potentially eligible participants, or individuals receiving at least one&#xD;
      prescription(s) for potentially eligible participants, of the survey opportunity. Patients&#xD;
      recruited will complete validated measures to assess opioid use and risk behaviors, substance&#xD;
      use, and physical and mental health. A series of a priori analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the validity of the PDMP-based opioid risk metric relative to the widely validated&#xD;
      gold standard WHO ASSIST and to identify cutoff thresholds. Correlational, regression, and&#xD;
      Cohen's Kappa statistical analyses will also be conducted to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between the risk metric and the WHO ASSIST.&#xD;
