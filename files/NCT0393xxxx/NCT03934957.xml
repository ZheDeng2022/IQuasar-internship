  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based&#xD;
      cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about&#xD;
      several risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A random sample of 45.000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general&#xD;
      population of Hamburg, Germany, will take part in an extensive baseline assessment at a&#xD;
      dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily&#xD;
      targeting cardiac, arterio-venous and cerebral function and structure including extensive&#xD;
      imaging examinations. The protocol includes self-ratings of life style and environmental&#xD;
      conditions, , dietary habits, physical activity, professional life, psychosocial context, ,&#xD;
      digital media use, medical and family history as well as health care utilization patterns.&#xD;
      The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the&#xD;
      identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the&#xD;
      core intention is to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude&#xD;
      of examination data, imaging data and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia will be&#xD;
      invited for a visit to conduct additional MRI examination either of heart or brain. Endpoint&#xD;
      assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations&#xD;
      and data from involved health and pension insurances.&#xD;
