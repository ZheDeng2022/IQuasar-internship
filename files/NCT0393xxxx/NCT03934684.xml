    <textblock>
      Kyprolis® (K; carfilzomib) was approved in India on 17 January 2017 as a prescription&#xD;
      medication in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) or with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) plus&#xD;
      dexamethasone (KRd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (RRMM) following 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-comparative, interventional phase 4 study is designed to fulfil the post-marketing&#xD;
      requirement to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Kyprolis on Indian subjects with&#xD;
      RRMM as per the locally approved label.&#xD;

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
