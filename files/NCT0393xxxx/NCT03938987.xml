    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures; children&#xD;
             (defined as 17 years of age or less) require guardian consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2; or Karnofsky &gt; 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age of 2 to 70 years at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A histologically or cytologically documented, CD19+ non-hodgkin's lymphoma or ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 1 measurable lesion or FDG-avid disease by positron-emission&#xD;
             tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for lymphoma patients; quantifiable evidence&#xD;
             of ALL in either peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Tumor tissue (archival or recent acquisition) must be available for correlative&#xD;
             laboratory studies (such as immunohistochemistry, and others).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At least 2 prior systemic therapies and patient must not be eligible for potentially&#xD;
             curative standard-of-care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate renal function (defined as Cockroft-Gault creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min)&#xD;
             and hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN; and AST/ALT &lt; 3x ULN) unless&#xD;
             directly related to malignant disease being treated for on study as demonstrated&#xD;
             either by PET/CT imaging or by biopsy and histopathologic confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate&#xD;
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she&#xD;
             is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit&#xD;
             ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
             The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male participants should agree to not donate sperm during study period (i.e. up to 2&#xD;
             years following CAR T-cell administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male participants with reproductive potential must agree to use medical approved&#xD;
             contraceptives during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study,&#xD;
             and are willing to follow study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior treatment with immunotherapy directly targeting T-cells (except anti-thymocyte&#xD;
             globulin [ATG]), CD19-directed antibody-based therapies (except blinatumomab), or&#xD;
             other gene therapy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received any investigational drug/anti-cancer therapy within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids (defined as &gt; 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent)&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to blood collection for CAR T-cell product manufacture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Salvage or debulking chemotherapy within 1 week prior to blood collection for CAR&#xD;
             T-cell product manufacture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior central nervous system (CNS) involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unresolved acute toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 Grade &gt;1 (or baseline, whichever is greater) from&#xD;
             prior anticancer therapy. Alopecia and other nonacute toxicities are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. An uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (including fever within 48 hours of screening), symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure (i.e., New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4), unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, clinically significant and uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Major surgical procedure within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection requiring&#xD;
             therapy, or positive tests for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C ribonucleic&#xD;
             acid (RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any vaccination against infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, varicella) within 4&#xD;
             weeks (28 days) of initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
