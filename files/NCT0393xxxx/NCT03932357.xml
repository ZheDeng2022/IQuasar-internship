      accuracy of CBCT in measuring soft tissue thickness by using a radiopaque material as the&#xD;
      real finding and measurements on pig jaws&#xD;

      -  Pig jaws will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft tissue surfaces were lightly covered with barium sulfate powder using a powder&#xD;
           spray. CBCT was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A periodontal probe and a rubber stop were used for the measurement of trans-gingival&#xD;
           probing thickness (TPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After that, flap were elevated, and actual thickness of soft-tissue (actual thickness,&#xD;
           AT) was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Analytical phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to assess soft tissue thickness and bone levels an electronic digital caliper&#xD;
           (Shenhan Measuring Tools Co., LTD, Shanghai) will used for measuring the transgingival&#xD;
           probing thickness on the pig jaws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A graduated Naber's probe will be used for measuring the transgingival probing&#xD;
           thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue thickness measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-observer variability was tested under the supervision of the director.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the measurement of radiographic thickness (RT), wet soft tissue surfaces were&#xD;
           covered with barium sulfate powder (SoloTop; Taejoon, Seoul, Korea), a radiopaque&#xD;
           material used as a contrast medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A probes and rubber stop were used for the measurement of transgingival probing&#xD;
           thickness (TPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A rubber stop was placed in contact with the surface to facilitate the measurement of&#xD;
           tissue thickness, and then TPT was measured with digital calipers. All measurements were&#xD;
           rounded to the nearest 0.01 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the measurement of actual thickness (AT), an incision was made onto each marked&#xD;
           area. After ï¬‚ap elevation, actual soft tissue thickness was measured using the same&#xD;
           method that was used for TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pig jaws will then be imaged with CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT scanning will be performed using a PROMAX R 3DMid CBCT device (Planmeca Oy,&#xD;
           Helsinki, Finland) with scanning protocol 90 kVp, 8 mA and 13.58 seconds exposure time&#xD;
           with a single 360 degree rotation ROMEXIS software. The jawes will be placed on the&#xD;
           horizontal plate of the device. The midline and mandibular position will be adjusted&#xD;
           using the laser guide&#xD;
