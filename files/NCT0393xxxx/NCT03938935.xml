    <textblock>
      Flexor tendon injuries are a common event as the tendons lie close to the skin and so are&#xD;
      usually the result of either lacerations such as those from knives or glass, from crush&#xD;
      injuries and occasionally they can rupture from where they are joined at the bone during&#xD;
      contact sports such as football, rugby and wrestling. Flexor tendon injuries are a&#xD;
      challenging problem for orthopaedic surgeons due to three main reasons. Firstly, flexor&#xD;
      tendon injuries of the hands are a clinical problem because they cannot heal without surgical&#xD;
      treatment, as the two ends need to be surgically brought together for the healing to occur&#xD;
      unlike other tendons including the Achilles tendon where it could be placed into plantar&#xD;
      flexion to heal. Secondly postoperative management needs to be carefully planned as&#xD;
      mobilisation has shown to be essential to prevent adhesions and improve gliding but this can&#xD;
      risk rupture. Lastly due to the unique anatomy of the tendons running through flexor tendon&#xD;
      sheaths to function, surgeons need to plan preventing increasing the bulkiness of the tendon&#xD;
      through its sheath, which is not always possible from scarring as this affects the functional&#xD;
      outcome of the tendon&#xD;
&#xD;
      -_ The ultimate goal of surgical intervention has remained constant: to achieve enough&#xD;
      strength to allow early motion, to prevent adhesions within the tendon sheath, and to restore&#xD;
      the finger to normal range of motion and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The successful repair requires minimal gapping at the repair site or interference with&#xD;
           tendon vascularity, secure suture knots, smooth junction of tendon end and having&#xD;
           sufficient strength for healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The strength of the core suture is one of the important factors for valid flexor tendon&#xD;
           repair. It is obvious that an increased strand number increases repair gap resistance&#xD;
           and strength&#xD;
