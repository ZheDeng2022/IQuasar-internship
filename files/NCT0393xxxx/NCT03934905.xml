  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiomyopathy is a major complication of doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, and 10-21% of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients receiving DOX experience compromised cardiac function. Recent&#xD;
      advancements have increased cancer survivorship but it remains clinically challenging to&#xD;
      mitigate the cardiotoxic side effects. Although there are several strategies used to reduce&#xD;
      the occurrence and severity of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, they are not particularly&#xD;
      effective. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies that prevent the&#xD;
      cardiotoxic effects of DOX but maintain its potency as a cancer therapy. Because the cellular&#xD;
      events responsible for the antitumor activity of DOX and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are&#xD;
      distinctly different, it may be possible to develop therapies that selectively mitigate&#xD;
      DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Thus, the investigators propose to test an adjuvant therapy that&#xD;
      combines the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) with DOX to attenuate DOX-induced&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. SFN activates the transcription factor Nrf2 and induces defense mechanisms in&#xD;
      normal cells. Furthermore, SFN inhibits carcinogenesis and metastases and enhances cancer&#xD;
      cell sensitivity to DOX, seemingly through Nrf2-independent mechanisms. SFN has also been&#xD;
      tested in several clinical trials, although never together with DOX. Our early animal studies&#xD;
      suggest that by activating Nrf2, SFN selectively protects the mouse and rat from DOX&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity, enhances survival and enhances the effects of DOX on cancer growth in a rat&#xD;
      breast cancer model. The investigators suspect that SFN affects DOX metabolism in cancer&#xD;
      cells to enhance tumor regression, or it may synergistically activate other key antitumor&#xD;
      mechanisms. Hence, SFN may improve the clinical outcome of cancer therapy by (1) attenuating&#xD;
      DOX cardiotoxicity and (2) enhancing the effects of cancer treatment on the tumor. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that SFN protects the heart from DOX-mediated cardiac injury without altering&#xD;
      the antitumor efficacy of DOX. In Aim 1, the investigators will conduct an early-phase&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine if SFN is safe to administer to breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      DOX chemotherapy. In Aim 2, the investigators will determine if SFN decreases DOX-induced&#xD;
      inflammatory responses and enhances Nrf2- and SIRT1-target gene expression in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Notably, transcript and protein signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) can predict cardiac function in patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators will also determine if SFN/DOX treatment activates Nrf2- and&#xD;
      SIRT1-dependent gene expression, alters the levels of biomarkers for presymptomatic&#xD;
      DOX-cardiotoxicity and mitigates the generation of cardiotoxic metabolites in PBMCs and&#xD;
      plasma. These studies will facilitate the development of SFN co-treatment as a strategy to&#xD;
      enhance the efficacy and safety of DOX cancer therapy.&#xD;

      Determine whether nutritional supplement sulforaphane (SFN) is safe to administer to breast&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy. The investigators have identified&#xD;
      biomarkers for presymptomatic detection of DOX cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients and&#xD;
      reported that SFN alleviates DOX-induced cardiac toxicity while maintaining its anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity in an animal model of breast cancer. SFN is in various stages of preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical trials against different types of cancer but its safety and effects on identified&#xD;
      markers have never been tested in patients treated with DOX. Sulforaphane is a generally&#xD;
      recognized as a safe (GRAS) compound and this compound is currently in 61 different clinical&#xD;
      trials including, Cystic Fibrosis, COPD, Melanoma, Breast and prostate cancer etc.&#xD;
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=sulforaphane&amp;pg=1). Avmacol Extra Strength,&#xD;
      (Nutramax Laboratories Consumer Care, Inc. Edgewood, MD 21040) an over-the-counter dietary&#xD;
      supplement containing broccoli seed and sprout extracts that is rich with sulforaphane, will&#xD;
      be used in this study. This is an FDA regulated trial using an investigational drug under IND&#xD;
      141682. Dose considerations were made on the basis of the ongoing clinical trial &quot;Effects of&#xD;
      Avmacol Extra StrengthÂ® in the Oral Mucosa of Patients Following Curative Treatment for&#xD;
      Tobacco-related Head and Neck Cancer&quot; (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03268993).&#xD;
      Furthermore, Avmacol Extra Strength has never been tested as an adjuvant to try and protect&#xD;
      the heart from DOXs harmful effects. . Therefore, the investigators are proposing to do an&#xD;
      early-clinical trial to assess SFN safety in DOX-treated patients and possibly prevent&#xD;
      DOX-cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that SFN protects the heart from DOX-mediated cardiac injury without&#xD;
      affecting its antitumor efficacy. Here, the investigators will test SFN in combination with&#xD;
      DOX-based chemotherapy for breast cancer; the investigators will assess its safety,&#xD;
      cardio-protective properties, and anti-cancer efficacy. The investigators will also examine&#xD;
      the effect of SFN on the expression of several biomarkers that indicate when a patient cannot&#xD;
      tolerate DOX.1 To test our hypothesis, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Demonstrate that co-administration of SFN protects the heart and is not associated&#xD;
      with toxicity or reduced tumor response in breast cancer patients undergoing DOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot clinical trial to assess the safety of SFN as a&#xD;
      co-treatment with DOX chemotherapy. Strategy: Up to seventy breast cancer patients prescribed&#xD;
      DOX chemotherapy will be consented then randomly assigned to receive either SFN or placebo&#xD;
      during DOX chemotherapy. This sample size includes an additional 10 participants to allow for&#xD;
      potential attrition. There will be a 50-50 chance of receiving SFN. The patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Breast Cancer Clinic (Dr. Jones and Philipovskiy) in the Southwest Cancer&#xD;
      Center at TTUHSC/UMC Lubbock. Cardiac function with echocardiography will be assessed and&#xD;
      compared between arms for evidence of substantive decrease in DOX cardiotoxicity with SFN&#xD;
      compared to placebo. Tumor size will also be compared (based on RECIST criteria) between&#xD;
      treatment arms. The investigators will monitor treatment-emergent symptoms, hematological&#xD;
      parameters of cancer therapy toxicity, and renal and hepatic function. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected to assay markers of cardiotoxicity, including B-type natriuretic peptide and&#xD;
      troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if SFN alters the levels of known biomarkers of DOX cardiotoxicity and&#xD;
      affects the expression of SIRT1- and Nrf2-target genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure changes in transcript and protein biomarkers of&#xD;
      pre-symptomatic DOX-cardiotoxicity in response to SFN, and will determine if SFN promotes&#xD;
      SIRT1- and Nrf2-dependent gene expression. Because Nrf2 upregulates certain detoxifying&#xD;
      enzymes, the investigators will measure the plasma levels of cardiotoxic metabolites,&#xD;
      doxorubicinol (DOXol). Strategy: Blood will be collected before the start of DOX chemotherapy&#xD;
      and after each treatment cycle to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and&#xD;
      prepare plasma. In lieu of tissue biopsies, PBMCs will be used to examine SIRT1 and Nrf2&#xD;
      activity and target gene expression. Multiplex arrays will be used to measure plasma cytokine&#xD;
      levels, and plasma DOX metabolites will be assessed with ultrahigh performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These experiments will provide initial evidence to&#xD;
      indicate that SFN activates SIRT1 and Nrf2 pathways in non-cancer tissue of breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This will be the first clinical study to assess the safety of SFN as a co-treatment&#xD;
      with DOX to mitigate cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Positive findings will be used&#xD;
      to justify a larger randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures Study Design. The investigators intend to include up to 70&#xD;
      DOX-naÃ¯ve women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with no&#xD;
      prior cardiac disease and who will receive DOX without Her-2 receptor antagonists (to&#xD;
      eliminate possibility of secondary side effects) as part of their clinical care. These&#xD;
      potential subjects will be recruited in a randomized, controlled, double blinded pilot study&#xD;
      comparing SFN to placebo. The study will be conducted at the Texas Tech University Health&#xD;
      Sciences Center, and University Medical Center. The trial will be approved by our local IRB&#xD;
      and registered at clinicaltrials.gov. UMC cancer center pharmacist Ajoke A. Tijani, RPh.&#xD;
      (Tijani@umchealthsystem.com) will receive placebo and test compound from supplier and will&#xD;
      dispense them to test subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be achieved with assignment of a subject ID to the study subject. The list&#xD;
      of subject IDs will be subsequently assigned either study drug or placebo using a randomizer&#xD;
      software such as (www.randomizer.org). The pharmacist dispensing the medication will be aware&#xD;
      of the study IDs in relation to the patient identity, in order to be able to dispense the&#xD;
      test drug or the placebo per their assigned status as test or control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug and Placebo. Processed SFN-rich extract will be purchased in form of caplets from&#xD;
      Nutramax Laboratories, Inc. 2208 Lakeside Blvd Edgewood, MD 21040. Caplets containing&#xD;
      SFN-rich broccoli sprout extracts or microcrystalline cellulose (placebo) also from Nutramax&#xD;
      Labs will be dispensed to participants in sealed bottles with instructions to keep them in a&#xD;
      household freezer. Size of the caplet will be about the size of a 1000 mg Vit C pill (about 2&#xD;
      cm in length). The participants will be dosed, based on weight, in a double-blind fashion&#xD;
      with identical appearing placebo or SFN caplets in a daily dose for 12 weeks of: two caplets&#xD;
      for individuals &lt;100 lb., three caplets for individuals 100-200 lb. and four caplets for&#xD;
      individuals &gt;200 lb. Avmacol Extra Strength or placebo will be prescribed by Dr. Jones and&#xD;
      Philipovskiy and will be dispensed by local pharmacy or study coordinators at TTUHSC/UMC&#xD;
      Lubbock. The investigators will be doing pill counts to make sure that volunteers have used&#xD;
      as directed. The investigators will measure the Sulforaphane level in plasma by&#xD;
      well-established method. 26 The drug and the placebo will be stored at the South West Cancer&#xD;
      Center pharmacy based on manufacturer based guidelines and dispensed to each participant at&#xD;
      their baseline visit then at DOX infusion visits 1, 2, and 3. Patients will be expected to&#xD;
      maintain at least an 80% adherence to the medication regimen, in the absence of prohibitive&#xD;
      toxicity. Adherence will be monitored through therapeutic drug level (Plasma sulforaphane&#xD;
      levels of 120 ng/ml) monitoring as mentioned above and pill counts. For subjects who do not&#xD;
      meet 80% compliance, they will be instructed on the importance of taking the pills as&#xD;
      directed, but if their next visit demonstrates less than 80% compliance, they will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. As long as participants complete their 4th cycle of DOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment the investigators will still use their study data during analysis. If&#xD;
      side effects are noted, patient will be asked to notify the study team of the same and will&#xD;
      be evaluated within a suitable time frame based on severity of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SFN is a safe natural isolate. Above doses (30mg/caplet) are considered adequate to maintain&#xD;
      intended therapeutic drug levels, while maintaining a simple study design and without&#xD;
      significant concerns for drug toxicity It has been used in several clinical trials from doses&#xD;
      ranging from 2-200 Âµmol/day for 2-28 weeks in 25-80 years old subjects without significant&#xD;
      side-effects or toxicity&#xD;
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=sulforaphane&amp;Search=Search), yet never in&#xD;
      combination with DOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Data for the primary endpoint (DOX cardiotoxicity) and other&#xD;
      binary outcomes will be summarized by treatment arm as number and proportion per arm. The&#xD;
      change in DOX-cardiotoxicity rate with SFN compared to placebo will be assessed with a&#xD;
      1-sided Z-test (see Sample-size justification). Tumor size, plasma cardiac biomarkers,&#xD;
      cardiac ejection fraction, DOX metabolite levels will be summarized by treatment arm and time&#xD;
      point as means and standard deviations and graphed as box plots and profile plots. The&#xD;
      investigators will adhere to ANOVA distributional assumptions so that appropriate data&#xD;
      transformations can be applied. Data for each continuous variable will be analyzed for&#xD;
      differences in group means at each time point with ANOVA or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon&#xD;
      non-parametric tests at each time point. These tests will employ a more-stringent alpha =&#xD;
      0.02 significance level to adjust for the multiple comparisons without overinflating type II&#xD;
      error. For subjects withdrawn from the study or do not complete the study for any reason, as&#xD;
      long as they completed their 4th cycle of DOX chemotherapy treatment the investigators will&#xD;
      still use their study data during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample-size justification. The number of subjects (35 per treatment arm; 70 total; the&#xD;
      investigators expect some attrition, which this sample size addresses) is based on the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, the rate of which was recently observed&#xD;
      at our previous institution (UAMS) to be ~25%1. The investigators expect that SFN will&#xD;
      decrease this to 5%. The cardiotoxicity rates for each arm will be compared via 1-sided&#xD;
      pooled-variance Z-test at an alpha = 0.10. The statistical power of this test, conducted as&#xD;
      described, needs to exceed 80% in order for our study to be generally recognized as having&#xD;
      adequate statistical power. Our sample size provides the 1-sided pooled-variance Z-test with&#xD;
      83.2% power at 10% alpha to detect the expected 20-point decrease in DOX-toxicity rates from&#xD;
      25% in the placebo arm to 5% in the SFN arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, will be obtained&#xD;
      before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.&#xD;
