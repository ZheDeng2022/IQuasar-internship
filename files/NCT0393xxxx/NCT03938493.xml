  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tube is a commonly used for general anesthesia in head and neck surgery. It is&#xD;
      necessary to place the endotracheal tube in the trachea of the patient and then inflate the&#xD;
      cuff with air. This is because the air-inflated cuff contacts the inner wall of the patient's&#xD;
      trachea to deliver oxygen through the tube. If the cuff does not inflate, oxygen will leak&#xD;
      through the space between the cuff and the patient's trachea. In addition, the risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia increases. Therefore, after placing the endotracheal tube in the patient's trachea,&#xD;
      the cuff is immediately inflated with air. However, when the cuff is inflated using an excess&#xD;
      of air, the cuff may pressurize the mucous membrane of the tracheal wall and cause ischemia.&#xD;
      Pressure in the over-inflated cuff was also found to be associated with post-operative sore&#xD;
      throat, vocal cord paralysis, and nerve damage. Therefore, appropriate amount of air should&#xD;
      be used to inflate the cuff into the air and adjust the pressure within the cuff to be within&#xD;
      the range of 20-30 cmH2O. The authors thought that the pressure in the cuff could be changed&#xD;
      during the operation due to various factors and that the pressure in the cuff should be&#xD;
      monitored continuously. In this study, the investigators will monitor the cuff pressure&#xD;
      during anesthesia and analyze the factors affecting the cuff pressure.&#xD;
