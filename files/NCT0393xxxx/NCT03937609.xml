      The aim of this study is to investigate whether intensive, personalized IFX dosing by using a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics driven dashboard system during the induction phase in patients with acute&#xD;
      severe UC leads to increased treatment success (as defined by clinical and endoscopic&#xD;
      response at week 6) as compared to the standard dosing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies performed in the AMC demonstrated that the patients with acute severe UC&#xD;
      receiving IFX are different from patients receiving IFX while in remission.(5) The clearance&#xD;
      of IFX is not only determined by demographic parameters (gender, body weight), blood&#xD;
      chemistry (CRP, albumin) and anti-drug antibodies, but also disease related variables play an&#xD;
      important role. Among others, we have demonstrated that faecal loss of IFX in ASUC patients&#xD;
      increases IFX clearance during the induction phase (3). Furthermore, increased expression of&#xD;
      TNF-α, the target of IFX, influences the clearance of IFX due to target mediated drug&#xD;
      disposition (TMDD). Active IBD with high tissue concentrations of TNF-α thereby acts as a&#xD;
      sink for anti-TNF-α antibodies (4). The PK of IFX has been mainly characterized during&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. Evaluation of factors that influence the clearance of IFX during&#xD;
      induction therapy will allow further optimization an individualization of IFX therapy in ASUC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, determination of IFX concentrations in the serum with an enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is time consuming; physicians often receive the results after as&#xD;
      many as 10-20 days. To allow for proactive adjustments in dosing, faster laboratory results&#xD;
      are required, preferably in a point-of-care setting. This test is now made available by&#xD;
      Bühlmann Laboratories (Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that in patients with acute severe UC an intensified and personalized&#xD;
      IFX dosing regimen using individual PK data from point of care tests as a rapid input to the&#xD;
      dashboard system during the induction phase will lead to improved clinical outcomes when&#xD;
      compared to standard dosing regimen.&#xD;
