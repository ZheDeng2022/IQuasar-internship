  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preference studies reveal how individuals trade-off the potential benefits, harms and&#xD;
      inconveniences of a treatment by determining the minimum benefits they judge sufficient to&#xD;
      make the treatment worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are especially relevant to adjuvant therapies where individuals must weigh up modest&#xD;
      survival benefits only realized in time by no recurrence of their cancer with side effects&#xD;
      predominantly experienced whilst on the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously it was reported, for example, that over 50% of women who had adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      for early breast cancer judged a 1% improvement in 5 year survival rates sufficient to make&#xD;
      it worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Larger survival benefits were required for longer duration adjuvant hormonal therapy where&#xD;
      over 50% of women required at least 5% improvement in 5 year survival rates to make it&#xD;
      worthwhile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endocrine therapy is generally proposed to all patients with endocrine positive early&#xD;
      breast cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence and death. Moreover several data support that&#xD;
      the prolongation of hormonal therapy (i.e. 10 years of hormonal treatment) is associated with&#xD;
      statistical improved outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the benefit related to hormonal therapy all women have to be treated&#xD;
      despite the fact that the data and analyses are unable to differentiate as to whether a small&#xD;
      prolongation in survival accrues to all women treated or a few patients survive who would&#xD;
      otherwise have died. Moreover the hormonal therapy is associated with side effects that may&#xD;
      impact the quality of life of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are more likely to accept treatment on the basis of presented relative rather than&#xD;
      absolute risks and so the question arises as to whether unrealistic improvements in outcome&#xD;
      are expected by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews with patients in the proposed trial will elicit the expected gains both in&#xD;
      terms of survival and life years and will be able to assess the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      considered an improvement of realistic size was sufficient to justify the treatment and the&#xD;
      prolongation of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies showed that choices are guided by the personal attitude to react and adapt to&#xD;
      traumatic events, individual resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important therefore to consider also the influence of these factors on the patients'&#xD;
      treatment preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, besides the elicitation of preferences, resilience and reaction to traumatic&#xD;
      events will be assessed thorough validated questionnaires.&#xD;
