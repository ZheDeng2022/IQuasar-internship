  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term of biliary tract cancer (BTC) or cholangiocarcinoma refers to all tumors that arise&#xD;
      from the biliary tract or the biliary drainage system, including the gallbladder. According&#xD;
      to the data from National Cancer Information Center in 2016, annual incidence of the cancer&#xD;
      in Korea is 6,685 (13.1 per 100,000 population) which corresponds to about 2.9% of all&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTC is one of the most prognostic cancer with less than 30% of 5-year survival rate and the&#xD;
      case with long-term survival can be possibly done with early detection of the cancer.&#xD;
      However, most of BTC is found in advanced stages due to the difficulty of early detection,&#xD;
      resulting in that the 5-year survival rate of the advanced BTC becomes less than 3%. More&#xD;
      than 50% of the patients depends on Gemcitabine based chemotherapy but response rate of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy remains around 30%. Thus, improving the survival rate with the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy is very limited and furthermore selection of second-line therapy is not easy.&#xD;
      For this reason, development of an alternative therapeutic agent is urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK (natural killer) cells are important cytotoxic innate immune cells that are involved in&#xD;
      the elimination of cancer cells. Two main NK cell subsets have been defined on the basis of&#xD;
      CD56 and CD16 expression: CD56^brightCD16- NK subset produces abundant cytokines including&#xD;
      interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α, whereas CD56^dimCD16+ NK subpopulation has&#xD;
      high cytolytic activity and releases the granules containing perforin and granzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various clinical studies have been conducted to treat cancers using NK cells worldwide&#xD;
      including Korea and therapeutic clinical results are shown for various cancers. The clinical&#xD;
      application of NK cells is carried out by culturing and activating the NK cells isolated from&#xD;
      blood of either patient (autologous) or blood donor (allogeneic). Recently, NK cell therapy&#xD;
      for cholangiocarcinoma has been successfully done (NCT03358849) with allogeneic NK cell,&#xD;
      showing safety and potential efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like T cells, a recent study with digestive cancer has shown that NK cells also express PD-1,&#xD;
      especially with more number of PD-1 in cancer patients than in healthy individuals,&#xD;
      suggesting that blocking PD-1 can be used as a potential strategy to increase the anticancer&#xD;
      activity of NK cells. Therefore, combined therapy with the immune-check point such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab can be useful in elevating the anticancer activity of NK cells.&#xD;
