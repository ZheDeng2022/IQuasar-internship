      Evaluation of an educational intervention for women with breast pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Problem -Symptomatic breast pain Study Objectives- The primary objective is to obtain&#xD;
      knowledge of women's perceptions of an educational video about breast pain, breast awareness&#xD;
      and self-examination and its impact on their confidence in self-management of breast pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives -proportion of women who report that the video&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Was informative&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Might have reassured them enough not to have needed to seek an appointment in secondary&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design- Prospective single-centre mixed methods study through semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews for Masters in Public Health thesis Trial Population -Women, aged 18-40, referred&#xD;
      to &quot;one-stop&quot; / rapid diagnostic breast clinic at The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) with&#xD;
      breast pain alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment target Until saturation, expected sample 10-15 Trial Design- Mixed methods study&#xD;
      using semi-structured interviews Primary endpoint -This is a qualitative study, with no&#xD;
      statistical primary end point.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of breast pain has been reported to be between 41-69% in clinical cohorts and&#xD;
      in the general population (1-4). The incidence of cancer in women with breast pain alone (ie&#xD;
      no lump or other, more concerning symptoms) is low, with published rates between 1 to 1.8%&#xD;
      (7-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the prevalence of breast pain increases linearly up to the age of 50 and then&#xD;
      decreases (4), thus women under 40 with a normal clinical examination do not require further&#xD;
      investigations and can be reassured in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, mastalgia is one of the most common symptoms in women referred to a breast unit&#xD;
      representing up to 69% of attendances (5-7). Consequently, women affected by breast pain are&#xD;
      up to 4.7 times more likely to have had a mammogram than asymptomatic women (6). ln order to&#xD;
      facilitate early breast cancer diagnosis there is a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an&#xD;
      appointment within 2 weeks) from primary care to specialist units. Recent increases in breast&#xD;
      urgent referrals have increased the pressure on already overstretched services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many strategies have been tried to manage the tension between the desire for early detection&#xD;
      of breast cancer, and avoiding unnecessary referral for normal breast sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although breast screening by self-examination or clinical examination has not been shown to&#xD;
      reduce breast cancer mortality in studies (10), breast awareness can be linked to early&#xD;
      detection that facilitates treatment and has the potential to reduce mortality (11).&#xD;
      Therefore, breast awareness and self-examination have become relevant parts of general breast&#xD;
      education promoting women's confidence to discern between normality and unusual changes&#xD;
      (12-17). Self-examination is not frequently taught in primary care and &quot;there is a need to&#xD;
      develop more innovative strategies to promote breast health awareness and early detection of&#xD;
      breast cancer in women&quot; (18). In this study, as part of a Masters in Health Policy, we are&#xD;
      investigating the impact of an educational video, here to be shown after a clinic&#xD;
      appointment, but with the potential to be distributed to general practitioners, and to&#xD;
      patients directly if favourably received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient recruitment 1.1 Initial visit to &quot;one-stop&quot;clinic Eligible patients who are&#xD;
           referred to the &quot;one-stop&quot; diagnostic clinic with breast pain alone and have completed a&#xD;
           clinical assessment will be given a patient information sheet inviting them to&#xD;
           participate in the study. They will be met by the interviewing clinician at the same&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Consent Consent will be sought by the clinician who will undertake the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention: educational video An educational video of approximately 10 minutes about&#xD;
           breast pain, self-examination and breast awareness will be shown to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Semi-structured interview A semi-structured, face-to-face interview will be then&#xD;
           undertaken. The principles of Grounded Theory will be used to guide the interview. All&#xD;
           of the interviews will be recorded and transcribed securely, only referencing the&#xD;
           patient according to their study number. Their name and hospital number will not be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of pre-planned, open questions will be asked. The core questions are related to the&#xD;
      topic of discussion - impressions related to the intervention and subsequent effect into&#xD;
      their previous concerns. Further questions will evolve in response to answers given by&#xD;
      earlier participants. The duration of the interview will depend on the extent of the answers&#xD;
      and any follow-up questions that derive later from earlier answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Acquisition and analysis The video show and interview will be undertaken in a private&#xD;
      room after routine clinical assessment. The interviewer will be the MSc student, a&#xD;
      medically-qualified breast clinician with an interest in breast pain, who has read the&#xD;
      relevant literature. The recorded interview and notes taken by investigator during the&#xD;
      interview are the only data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will run alongside data collection as an iterative process to inform further&#xD;
      sampling. The purpose of the analysis is to describe the participants' opinion and to develop&#xD;
      theoretical explanations for these. The interviews will be analysed by reading the&#xD;
      transcripts in detail and assigning codes to give meaning to segments of the text. Emerging&#xD;
      codes will be grouped into themes and discussed and then explored in subsequent interviews.&#xD;
      The analysis will be undertaken using the constant comparison technique of grounded theory&#xD;
      whereby data will be examined for differences and similarities within the themes, taking into&#xD;
      account the patient context. The initial codes will be modified and new codes added as the&#xD;
      project progresses. New data will be compared with previous interviews to identify the&#xD;
      similarities and differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Outcome This is a mixed methods study. As a result, we will have increased&#xD;
      knowledge of the perceptions of women presenting with breast pain about an educational video.&#xD;
      We will have some quantitative information about whether they find it informative and whether&#xD;
      it might lead them to avoid attending secondary care. It will guide the future management of&#xD;
      women with pain at the interface of primary and secondary care.&#xD;
