      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some groups of people have a high prevalence of asthma and allergic disease. Also, asthma and&#xD;
      allergic disease are often found in several members of the same family. Researchers want to&#xD;
      learn more about what factors might cause asthma, both genetic and environmental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build a collection of information to try to find genes that cause conditions and disorders&#xD;
      such as asthma and allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 99 of self-identified African, African American, or African Caribbean descent&#xD;
      who either have no history of asthma or wheeze or have a physician s diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with an interview by phone or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out a questionnaire about their general health and exposure to&#xD;
      allergens and smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a skin cell sample. Up to two samples will be taken from the inside&#xD;
      of the nose. A brush will be used to take the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a breathing test. They will be asked to blow forcefully 3 or more&#xD;
      times into a lung function machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have their blood and skin samples sent to a lab. DNA will be extracted from&#xD;
      the samples and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood and skin samples will be stored. Samples may be used in future research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a complex disease where the interplay between genetic factors and environmental&#xD;
      exposures controls susceptibility and disease progression. In the U.S., there remains an&#xD;
      epidemic of asthma that disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and creates a&#xD;
      major public health burden, especially among children. Asthmatics of African ancestry&#xD;
      continue to have more severe asthma and more severe clinical symptoms than their non-African&#xD;
      counterparts, but few studies have focused on this vulnerable group. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to expand our previous study, the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry&#xD;
      Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) to integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in&#xD;
      African Diaspora populations and by recruiting new participants. The protocol described&#xD;
      herein refers to the recruitment that will take place at the NIH Clinical Center as part of&#xD;
      the expansion of CAAPA (CAAPA2).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals age 18 to 99 of self-identified African, African American, or African Caribbean&#xD;
        ancestry who either have no history of asthma or wheeze (controls) or have a physician s&#xD;
        diagnosis of asthma. This study focuses exclusively on African ancestry individuals in&#xD;
        order to address a lack in the field of asthma research focusing on those of African&#xD;
        ancestry despite the greater disease burden experienced by these individuals. Enrollment&#xD;
        for the CAAPA2 study at the NIH CC will include only adults, while children will be&#xD;
        enrolled at other CAAPA2 sites, consistent with expertise at those sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First degree relative of enrolled study participant (as determined through responses&#xD;
             to a screening questionnaire to question on participation of parents, siblings, or&#xD;
             half-siblings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current and active smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive airway disease,&#xD;
             emphysema, chronic bronchitis, lung transplant, kyphoscoliosis, sarcoidosis,&#xD;
             bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             Crohn s disease, psoriasis, carcinoma of the lung, ciliary dyskinesia, lupus, or&#xD;
             active tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having any medical illnesses that would increase the risk that the participant would&#xD;
             incur by participating in the study, interfere with the outcomes of the study, or&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures (evaluated using Spirometry Screener.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or previous COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women: while study procedures are all minimal risk, the inclusion of pregnant&#xD;
             women is not necessary to address the research questions. Additionally, pregnancy may&#xD;
             affect some of our parameters of interest (particularly gene expression) in&#xD;
             unpredictable ways and the size of the growing fetus may introduce mechanical&#xD;
             challenges to optimal performance of pulmonary function tests at later stages of&#xD;
             pregnancy. Exclusion will be based on self-report during screening.&#xD;
