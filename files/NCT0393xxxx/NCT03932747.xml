  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin is the most external organ of our body and one of its main functions is to provide&#xD;
      protection in terms of possible infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration is related to the proper functioning of the skin, being more difficult the&#xD;
      appearance of wounds or cracks, which lead to the appearance of infections or other&#xD;
      dermatological alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin of the feet is thicker than in the rest of the body, due to the load it supports,&#xD;
      being more complicated to maintain it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study what is intended is to assess the effectiveness of different concentrations&#xD;
      of urea (5% and 20%) in the hydration of the foot&#xD;

      The measuring device of the Corneometer is constituted by a cylindrical probe, which contains&#xD;
      at its distal end two parallel circuits in the form of capacitors covered by a plastic&#xD;
      membrane. The probe should be placed perpendicularly on the surface of the skin. The pressure&#xD;
      exerted on it must always be the same, therefore the probe has an internal hydraulic&#xD;
      mechanism that, regardless of the pressure exerted by the manipulator, maintains a constant&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the probe is placed in the place of measurement and the pressure is exerted on the skin,&#xD;
      the circuit is closed and the conductance or capacitance is determined depending on the&#xD;
      device, in a fraction of a second. Usually, between 3 and 10 measurements are made for each&#xD;
      determination and entered in a computer record to obtain their averages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capacity of the condenser depends on the material, most of the materials increase the&#xD;
      capacity compared to the vacuum by a factor of more than seven (dielectric constant); Water,&#xD;
      however, increases the capacity by a factor of 81. Therefore, variations in the water content&#xD;
      in the skin produce strong modifications in the measuring range of the Corneometer CM 825.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Corneometer uses relative units proportional to the degree of corneal wetting. One AU&#xD;
      corresponds to 0.2-0.9 mg of water per mg of anhydrous stratum corneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out to young people (20 -26 years old) from Practicum I of the&#xD;
      Podiatry Clinic University of Plasencia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be those people who want to voluntarily participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who suffer from structural, functional or traumatic alterations that affect the&#xD;
      morphology and function of the lower limb, disorders that affect the skin, wounds, blisters&#xD;
      are excluded from the study. Those who do not fall within the age range of the study and who&#xD;
      have used creams or any type of lotion the night before on the feet are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, three randomized groups are performed, since each group will be treated with a&#xD;
      different cream: placebo, 5% urea cream and 20% cream. The investigator will be blinded as&#xD;
      well as the patients, since neither will know what cream is being applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the subjects participating in the study will be explained, the objectives of the&#xD;
      study and that for this need to perform a test using a non-invasive instrument that allows us&#xD;
      to detect the superficial hydration of participants skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, instructed to sign the informed consent, if so, participants are asked to accompany&#xD;
      us to a previously heated room and be accommodated in the podiatric chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patient is asked to answer some questions (Age, Name and surname). In&#xD;
      addition, the researcher will note the temperature and humidity in which the room is located&#xD;
      and the presence of hyperkeratosis on the sole of the patient's foot and area of appearance.&#xD;
      (Annex 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, before proceeding to the measurement, the patient is positioned barefoot with the&#xD;
      legs stretched over the legs, then the researcher passes a gauze impregnated in alcohol of&#xD;
      70% to eliminate possible remains that could interfere with the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After checking that the alcohol has evaporated, explore the sole of the foot and mark on our&#xD;
      data collection sheet, if at the points where participants are going to measure there is a&#xD;
      presence or not of hyperkeratosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case is going to measure 3 points of each foot that are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First metatarsal head&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fifth metatarsal head&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heel&#xD;
&#xD;
      These points are considered important because they serve as support for the foot when the&#xD;
      subject is standing, since they form the three basic points of foot support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out the hydration measurement, the investigators place the probe or head of the&#xD;
      Corneometer on the surface of the skin and exert pressure until the appearance of an acoustic&#xD;
      signal that indicates that the measurement has been recorded. This process is done 3 times in&#xD;
      each zone that they want to measure to obtain 3 records and thus reduce the margin of error&#xD;
      derived from the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To finish, the investigators will apply cream (placebo, urea 5% or 20%) depending on the&#xD;
      study group to which it belongs, and they will fit him and the investigators will measure&#xD;
      again in about three hours, taking the hydration of the three points mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the data of the participants have been registered, and the measurements coming from&#xD;
      the hydration, the resulting values are analyzed.&#xD;
