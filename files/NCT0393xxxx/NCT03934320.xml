      Multi-centre, non-randomised, non-controlled quasi-experimental study with nested qualitative&#xD;
      study and economic appraisal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the identification of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease in primary&#xD;
      care, caused by conditions such as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is a well-recognised&#xD;
      national priority to prevent morbidity and mortality by early effective intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of the new primary care FH&#xD;
      identification tool (FAMCAT) for identifying undiagnosed FH in routine primary care practice;&#xD;
      and to assess its appropriateness, acceptability and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer the following research questions (RQ):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the detection rate for new genetically-confirmed FH cases using the FAMCAT&#xD;
           algorithm?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the FAMCAT tool appropriate and acceptable to practitioners and patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How can the FAMCAT tool be optimised to improve identification of FH?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the potential cost-effectiveness of the FAMCAT tool compared with current&#xD;
           practice to identify patients with FH?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Can the FAMCAT intervention be improved?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What definitive study design and outcome measures are needed to provide robust evidence&#xD;
           on whether to introduce FAMCAT into primary care practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ(1) &amp; (3) will be answered by a quasi-experimental diagnostic accuracy study; RQ(2) &amp; (5)&#xD;
      answered by qualitative study; RQ (4) answered by economic appraisal and RQ(6) informed by&#xD;
      all previous studies.&#xD;
