  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current evidence, empagliflozin could reduce cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (T2DM). Anti-PCSK9 therapy (evolocumab) can reduce the&#xD;
      major cardiovascular events incidence in secondary prevention individuals, some of them&#xD;
      presenting T2DM. The beneficial effect of the combined use of these two agents in T2DM&#xD;
      remains unknown. Evaluating the effect of evolocumab on top of the best of care therapy for&#xD;
      T2DM, including empaglifozin, on endothelial function may indicate the existence of some&#xD;
      benefit related to cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;

      Study design: Randomized, parallel-group, open, comparative, prospective clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria will be: T2DM between 40 and 70 years old; adequate glycemic control;&#xD;
      (HbA1c 7 to 9%) after run-in phase; adequate blood pressure control (SBP ≤ 140 mm Hg);&#xD;
      maximal tolerated dose of statins and LDL-C between 70 and 100 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers' convocation -Investigators will announce in radio, television and newspapers&#xD;
      inviting volunteers with T2DM for this study. Those who contact us with an interest in&#xD;
      participating by email or whatsapp will be enrolled for the first telephone screening&#xD;
      evaluation. These volunteers will be contacted by phone and after a detailed explanation&#xD;
      about the objectives, procedures, and shared responsibilities between the parties those&#xD;
      willing to participate will be summoned to a Screening Visit (SV) in which inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be further verified. The screening FMD will be measured in this&#xD;
      occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-In - In the following two weeks after the screening visit, patients must return to&#xD;
      another consultation in which antidiabetic, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies&#xD;
      adjustment will be performed. The adjustment period must be ended at 16 weeks and if this is&#xD;
      not so patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-randomization exams - In the two weeks preceding the Randomization Visit, patients will&#xD;
      undergo laboratory tests (urea, creatinine, blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-col,&#xD;
      HbA1c, triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Phase - At the Randomization Visit (RV): Blood samples will be collected and&#xD;
      frozen at -250oC for laboratory analysis at the end of the trial. Patients will be submitted&#xD;
      to a protocol for assessing endothelial function (FMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients will be assigned to evolocumab (140 mg every two weeks) on top of the&#xD;
      standard of care therapy (SOC) or to the exclusive use of the SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At thirty days (Visit 1), 4 weeks (Visit 2), 8 weeks (Visit 3), 12 weeks (Visit 4) and 16&#xD;
      weeks (Visit 5) post-randomization, patients will be seen at the outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      evaluation of overall clinical status, treatment adherence through count of tablets, adverse&#xD;
      events and use of concomitant medications. Evolocumab will be administered at study center&#xD;
      every 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Visits 3 and 5, FMD will be reassessed and new blood samples will be collected and&#xD;
      stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol of Endothelial Function Assessment: Brachial artery measurements will be performed&#xD;
      using a high-resolution ultrasound (Vivid q, GE Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA), obtained&#xD;
      by physicians with long experience in this exam. The procedure will take place after&#xD;
      over-night fasting and withdrawal of any vasoactive medications for the previous 24 hours.&#xD;
      After ten minutes of quiet resting in a room with controlled temperature (around 25°C), the&#xD;
      brachial artery will be located above the antecubital fossa, and a longitudinal image of 6 to&#xD;
      8 cm of the artery will be considered as the baseline scan. A size appropriate blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff will be placed around the forearm and inflated up to 50 mmHg above the systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure for five minutes and the cuff will be then deflated. The FMD scan will be obtained&#xD;
      for 5 minutes. An adjustable stereotaxic clamp will stabilize the probe. Percentage change in&#xD;
      diameter for FMD will be calculated in relation to the respective baseline scans. Video clips&#xD;
      will be recorded for 1 minute before cuff inflation and then restarted 1 minute before cuff&#xD;
      deflation until 5 minutes after deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory methods - At randomization, 8th and 16th week, blood samples will be obtained for&#xD;
      measuring: Glucose, C Reactive protein, HbA1c, triglycerides. At the same time points, blood&#xD;
      samples will also be obtained before and after the two FMD measurements (pre and&#xD;
      post-ischemia) and will be assessed for VCAM-1 and NO. NO and its metabolites, i.e. nitrite&#xD;
      and nitrate (NOx), will be measured by an NO chemiluminescence analyzer (model NOA, Sievers&#xD;
      Instruments, Boulder, CO). Isoprostane will be measured by ELISA at randomization, 8th and&#xD;
      16th week of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoproteins fractions isolation by gradient ultracentrifugation - Lipid profile will be&#xD;
      assessed at admission, at the 8th week and at the 16th week by gradient ultracentrifugation.&#xD;
      VLDL, LDL (1 to 5 subfractions) and HDL (2b to 3a subfractions) will be isolated through&#xD;
      density gradient ultracentrifugation using a SW41Ti rotor. Isolated lipoproteins content in&#xD;
      cholesterol will be measured using commercially available enzymatic kits total cholesterol&#xD;
      (TC) (CHOD-PAP, Roche Diagnostics® reagents, Mannheim, Germany)], in the microplate reader&#xD;
      Power Wave XS (BioTek®, Winooski, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Statistical Analysis - Investigators are not aware of any studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of evolocumab or other anti-PCSK9 antibody on FMD. However, two trials&#xD;
      with similar characteristics to this design were performed testing the effects of&#xD;
      atorvastatin 80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 40 mg/day on conventional FMD. A difference of 3%&#xD;
      after treatment was noticed in both trials, with a mean pre-treatment value of 5.5% and a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 3.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering an alpha value of 0.05 and beta of 90%, this study would require 49 patients per&#xD;
      arm. Accounting for dropout and exclusion of patients during the pre-randomization phase and&#xD;
      the trial, investigators propose 12% of drop-off, equivalent to 110 patients, 55 in each arm.&#xD;
      Investigators used G-Power to calculate sample size. Covariance analysis (ANCOVA) will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the effect of treatments on the mean change in FMD at the 16th week, the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. The assumptions of ANCOVA models (linearity, distribution normality and&#xD;
      equal variance) will be verified using histograms, normal probability plots and residual&#xD;
      scatter plots. Age, gender and baseline FMD values will be included as covariables in all&#xD;
      ANCOVA models. The adjustment for the baseline values is intended to adjust for the possible&#xD;
      regression to the mean bias. Non-normal continuous variables will be transformed by logarithm&#xD;
      to correct dispersion. If after transformation they persist not normal, these variables will&#xD;
      be analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance in the secondary endpoints will only be considered if the primary&#xD;
      outcome is statistically significant. All of the exploratory endpoints will be reported with&#xD;
      95% CIs. In order to assure the quality of measurements, inter- and intra-patient variability&#xD;
      of FMD will be obtained in a set of patients from the screening phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization - Stratified randomization will be used in this study. Individuals will be&#xD;
      allocated in one of the four groups generated by the following parameters that could&#xD;
      interfere on endothelial function: gender and age (40 -55 or 56 - 70 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events will be collected from time of signature of informed consent, throughout the&#xD;
      treatment period until the last visit. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded from&#xD;
      the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of serious adverse events - All SAEs have to be reported in the CRF, whether or not&#xD;
      considered causally related to the investigational product or to the study procedure(s).&#xD;
      According to local sanitary (ANVISA) and ethics (CEP/CONEP) regulations, SAEs must be&#xD;
      reported to the regulatory authority and AMGEN at the same time.&#xD;
