  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of a wearable patch&#xD;
      TENS system (Appendix 2) in driving weight loss and appetite suppression when coupled with an&#xD;
      integrated weight loss reduction strategy. The study is designed to demonstrate that TENS&#xD;
      stimulation sufficient to drive weight loss and appetite suppression is safe and tolerable&#xD;
      when compared to standard of care, and that adverse events/adverse device effects are similar&#xD;
      to other TENS device use cases.&#xD;

      Randomized, adaptive parallel arm study. Subjects will be initially screened during a&#xD;
      screening period (+/- 7 days). During this screening period, subjects will sign an Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF), have their weight/height and blood pressure measured as part of a&#xD;
      physical exam, take a pregnancy test (females of child bearing potential), get blood drawn&#xD;
      for analysis (blood lipids, HbA1c), and complete the PHQ-9 and pre-study survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the screening period, eligible subjects will be enrolled/randomized in the&#xD;
      study and be randomized to either a treatment or control group. After enrolling, both control&#xD;
      and treatment subjects will be instructed to follow a healthy diet and reduce calories as&#xD;
      desired for the duration of the study and will receive training on the use of the electronic&#xD;
      scale and completion of paper diaries. For the treatment group, subjects will be instructed&#xD;
      on use of the Elira wearable patch system. Photographs will be taken at the enrollment visit.&#xD;
      Following this, subjects will enter the Therapy Period for ~24-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12 week visit, subjects will be assessed for weight loss, blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      lipids, HbA1c, patient preference questionnaire and their participation will continue through&#xD;
      months 4-6 for the Safety phase of the Therapy Period. The Therapy Period will be considered&#xD;
      complete (pending laboratory results, adverse events or serious adverse events). Patient&#xD;
      (treatment) photographs will also be taken at the 12 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study utilizes an adaptive approach where cohorts of enrolled/randomized subjects (in&#xD;
      groups of ~25 per arm) are assessed for dose response and progression to achievement of&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints. Frequent interim endpoint assessment utilizing Markov-chain&#xD;
      Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods coupled with Longitudinal analyses will be utilized to determine&#xD;
      sample sizes for future cohorts (assessed primarily via Normal dynamic linear modeling&#xD;
      [NDLM]). Long term safety of the device will be shown through 6 months of usage.&#xD;
