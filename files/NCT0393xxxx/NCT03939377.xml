  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The culture of the palliative is anchored more and more in France. In 2009, nearly 9 out of&#xD;
      10 French people (89%) believe that palliative care can reduce the suffering of people at the&#xD;
      end of their lives. Despite the rise of palliative care in France, their access is not&#xD;
      homogeneous between regions. In 2010, it is estimated that 2 French out of 3 likely to&#xD;
      receive palliative care could not access it. Palliative care remains essential at the end of&#xD;
      the patient's life, as well as for the family and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French government has put in place three national palliative care development programs:&#xD;
      2002-2005, 2008-2012, 2015-2018. The last program has unlocked a budget of 190 million euros&#xD;
      for their development. It has been estimated from Social Security reimbursements, that the&#xD;
      costs per patient over their last years of life are 26,000 euros, for a total of 13.5 million&#xD;
      euros.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important aspects of palliative care is the comfort of the patients as well&#xD;
      as their feelings in the care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to best meet the expectations of cancer patients, some offer early palliative care&#xD;
      that is effective in improving both the quality of life of the patient and its life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathy is a manual alternative medicine whose goal is to restore the lack of mobility of&#xD;
      tissues. It can be used as a complementary treatment when a specific support is put in place.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of osteopathy in the reduction of&#xD;
      pain in adult patients in palliative care.&#xD;
