  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce the risk of cancer relapse by giving a donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to boost the immune system early after a stem cell transplant so&#xD;
      that leukemia cells that escaped chemotherapy can be detected and killed. This DLI will&#xD;
      contain mostly lymphocytes that have graft versus tumor effect with low risk of graft versus&#xD;
      host disease. Because the process of giving a DLI in the first four weeks after a transplant&#xD;
      has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this study in&#xD;
      investigational (experimental).&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate if donor lymphocytes depleted of TCR-αβ&#xD;
      T cells and B cells can be infused on Day 28 following allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      without inducing Grade III-IV graft versus host disease, Grade II GVHD requiring systemic&#xD;
      treatment and or new onset, severe neutropenia requiring growth factor support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also seeks to characterize the lymphocyte subsets obtained following depletion of&#xD;
      TCR-αβ T cells and B cells from non-mobilized, leukapheresis products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will attempt to describe occurrence of disease relapse and to&#xD;
      describe the occurrence of post-transplant re- activation and/or infections with viruses such&#xD;
      as CMV, and EBV.&#xD;

    <description>This study will treat 10 participants with the donor NK/TCR-γδ T cell product. Of those 10 participants, 5 would have 10/10 HLA matched sibling donors (MSD) while 5 would have partially matched, related (haplo) donors.&#xD;
27 days post transplant, the participant's donor will undergo a second, non-mobilized leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
Donor PBMCs will be processed next day (Day T+28) to obtain the NK cell/TCRγδ T cell product for same day infusion if the participant remains aGVHD free and clinically stable.&#xD;
Participants will continue routine post-transplant and GVHD monitoring, as well as disease assessment at 56 days, 100 days, 6 months and 1 year following transplant.&#xD;
Blood samples will be obtained on T=0, T+7, 14, 21 and 28 days and then weekly until T + 56 days, then on T+100 days, + 6 months and + 12 months. If immune-mediated adverse events occur (GVHD, CRS etc) additional blood samples will be obtained at onset and resolution.</description>
