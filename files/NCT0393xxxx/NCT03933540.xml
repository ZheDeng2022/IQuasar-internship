      Aim: Determine the association between activity (steps taken) and PROMIS Pediatric measures&#xD;
      in order to explore the use of pedometry data to augment PROs in research and clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the associations between activity trackers and scores on&#xD;
      PROMIS pediatric measures in adolescents with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma,&#xD;
      aged 8 through 17 years. The investigators hypothesize that daily step data will be highly&#xD;
      correlated with and responsive when measured against PROMIS Pediatric measures of Physical&#xD;
      Activity and Physical Function-Mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Asthma (not well controlled) cohort will receive Garmin Vivofit3 activity monitors in&#xD;
      clinic/and or home and wear them continuously for 4 weeks while completing PROMIS measures,&#xD;
      the ecological survey, and an additional asthma control survey online (from home) via the&#xD;
      PRO-Core data collection system at the end of each of those 4 weeks. They will return the&#xD;
      Vivofit3 in a follow up clinic/and or home visit at the end of the 4 week period. In&#xD;
      addition, children/adolescents will complete a spirometry test at baseline and follow up&#xD;
      clinic/home visits. Written and verbal instructions for Vivofit3 use will be provided.&#xD;
      Trained CRAs will communicate frequently with participants, including when the monitor is&#xD;
      received by the participant and when the monitors need to be returned. Monitor data will be&#xD;
      uploaded to the device user account in the Garmin Connect Mobile App by the CRA upon return&#xD;
      of the monitor. Data from device user accounts will be imported into a UNC PRO-Core study&#xD;
      database. Asthma participants will receive $20 at each of the two clinic/and or home visits&#xD;
      and $10 per completed survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures and Analyses: Cross-sectional analyses of daily step and PROMIS Pediatric measures&#xD;
      will be used to test convergent validity of conceptually linked measures. Results from&#xD;
      regression models for longitudinal data analyses of PRO measures will be benchmarked against&#xD;
      regression results from step data, to ascertain responsiveness. The investigators will use&#xD;
      descriptive statistics to understand patterns by condition; the investigators will analyze&#xD;
      data in aggregate and test whether disease group (covariate) is associated with outcomes.&#xD;
      Analyses will control for demographics, mental health, and ecologic factors such as sports&#xD;
      participation and season/weather.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Safety issues: This is a minimal risk study. Participants may be at risk for skin&#xD;
      irritation due to continual monitor wear. Additionally, there is always a risk of breach of&#xD;
      confidentiality associated with all research.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the associations between activity trackers and scores on&#xD;
      PROMIS pediatric measures in adolescents with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma,&#xD;
      aged 8 through 17 years. The investigators hypothesize that daily step data will be highly&#xD;
      correlated with and responsive when measured against PROMIS Pediatric measures of Physical&#xD;
      Activity and Physical Function-Mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained in this study could have direct clinical benefits, such as it will allow&#xD;
      us to determine the association between steps taken (pedometer data) and PROMIS Pediatric&#xD;
      measures in order to explore the use of pedometry data to augment PROs in future research and&#xD;
      clinical care or to serve as a proxy measure for patients who are not able to self-report due&#xD;
      to limitations in language, literacy, cognition or health status. Based on prior work with&#xD;
      other PRO measures 18-20, the investigators expect that increased daily and weekly step&#xD;
      numbers will reflect better overall health status. Pedometry may prove to be a useful proxy&#xD;
      for health status in future research studies when adolescents are too ill to self-report&#xD;
      using PROMIS or other traditional PROs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures provide the opportunity to more fully gauge response&#xD;
      to disease and therapy, providing actionable health information to take treatment to a more&#xD;
      personalized level. For PRO measures to be widely adopted for use in either clinical trials 1&#xD;
      or by health care providers, there must be substantial evidence for the reliability and&#xD;
      validity of the PRO measure in the specific population. One of the most essential aspects of&#xD;
      the appropriateness of a PRO measure is documentation of the responsiveness of the PRO&#xD;
      measure, which indicates the ability of the PRO measure to detect change over time when it is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROMISÂ® measures represent a robust set of questionnaires for capturing the patient's&#xD;
      experience and have undergone extensive psychometric evaluation. However, PRO measures are&#xD;
      subjective and depend on a variety of patient level variables, including the patient's&#xD;
      cognition, literacy, language, or health status. Additionally, some situations exist in which&#xD;
      children or their parents may not be able to self-report symptoms using PROs due to language&#xD;
      barriers, literacy level, or disease activity (too fatigued, etc.). Objectively reported&#xD;
      steps, collected via pedometer wear, may be a way to augment the data that the investigators&#xD;
      get from PRO measures and to bypass some patient level variables that can affect PRO data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometers have been shown to be suitable for assessing step activity in children age 6 years&#xD;
      and up. A 7-day monitoring period using pedometers provided an accurate estimate of normal&#xD;
      physical activity in children and adolescents. Prior research in children has shown&#xD;
      correlations between physical activity and psychosocial indicators,4 physical health,5 and&#xD;
      cognitive function6; however, there is a deficiency of knowledge related to physical activity&#xD;
      in children with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, rheumatic disease, and asthma,&#xD;
      association with daily steps, and impacts on health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of several small pilot studies of physical activity monitoring in adult patients&#xD;
      with cancer found physical activity, particularly the number of daily &quot;steps&quot;, varied&#xD;
      considerably across phases of disease and treatment type, including healthy controls,&#xD;
      surgical resection with curative intent, and palliative chemotherapy and palliative&#xD;
      radiation.7 Low fitness and decreased exercise capacity have been demonstrated in children&#xD;
      with cancer,8 JIA9, 10 and SLE.11 Children with moderate to severe asthma have been shown to&#xD;
      get less physical activity than their healthy peers.14, 15 More specifically, children with&#xD;
      asthma tend to participate in less moderate to high intensity activity16 and to take fewer&#xD;
      daily steps16, though there appears to be little difference in sedentary time for children&#xD;
      with asthma and healthy controls.15, 16 However, uncertainties remain regarding the&#xD;
      relationships between daily activity levels, disease activity, and relevant domains including&#xD;
      physical function, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm, observational study of 100 patients with partly controlled or&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the association&#xD;
      between activity (steps taken) and PROMIS Pediatric measures in order to explore the use of&#xD;
      pedometry data to augment PROs in research and clinical care. The investigators anticipate 12&#xD;
      months of participant accruals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in two clinic/and or home visits and complete electronic surveys&#xD;
      from home at three time points. During the clinic/home visits on Day 0 and Day 28 (+/- 2&#xD;
      days), participants will complete the GINA checklist, a medication review, a spirometry test,&#xD;
      have BMI obtained, and complete the Child Asthma Control Test (if 11 years old or younger) or&#xD;
      the Asthma Control Test (if 12 years or older). On Day 0, parents will also complete a&#xD;
      demographics form and the child participant will recieve their Vivofit3 monitor. The Vivofit3&#xD;
      will be worn 24 hours a day for 4 weeks. At Day 28, CRA's will sync the data from the&#xD;
      Vivofit3 monitor to the participants study specific user account in the Garmin Connect Mobile&#xD;
      app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between Days 0 and 28 participants will complete three sets of electronic surveys.&#xD;
      Participants will complete their first set of surveys after 7 full days of VivoFit3 wear&#xD;
      (study Day 7), and every 7 days after that (Study days 14, 21, and 28) by clicking on a link&#xD;
      in the survey email that will take them to the PRO-Core data collection system. They may&#xD;
      complete these surveys from home or anywhere they would like where they have internet access.&#xD;
      The Day 28 survey will be completed in clinic/and or home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample (N=100) comprises 50 children between the ages of 8 and 12 and 50 children&#xD;
      between the ages of 13 and 17 who have uncontrolled or partly-controlled asthma. The&#xD;
      University of North Carolina (UNC) will accrue 30 children in each age group and the Boston&#xD;
      site will accrue 20 participants in each age group. Duke is the data coordinating center for&#xD;
      this study and will not be recruiting patients.&#xD;
