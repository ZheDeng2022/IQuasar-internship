  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human herpesvirus(HHV)-8-negative, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a rare&#xD;
      hematologic illness. Current therapeutic options are limited and provide benefit for only a&#xD;
      subset of patients. Blockade of IL-6 signaling with siltuximab or tocilizumab abrogates&#xD;
      symptoms and improves lymphadenopathy in a portion of patients. However, 66% of patients in&#xD;
      the siltuximab Phase II clinical trial did not meet response criteria, and recent studies&#xD;
      found that IL-6 is not significantly elevated in many iMCD patients. Recent research has&#xD;
      suggested a key role for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in iMCD pathogenesis and off-label administration of sirolimus, an&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitor, has shown clinical activity. Based on these experiences, we plan to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of sirolimus as a therapy for iMCD patients who are either unable to tolerate&#xD;
      anti-IL-6 blockade therapy (siltuximab or tocilizumab), or who fail, relapse, or are&#xD;
      refractory to such treatment. This study is a Phase II open label study of daily&#xD;
      administration of sirolimus in up to 24 evaluable male or female adults. Participants with&#xD;
      iMCD who have failed previous therapy will take daily oral sirolimus for 12 months.&#xD;
      Information that is collected as per standard of care will be used to review efficacy, in&#xD;
      addition to samples collected specifically for research.&#xD;

    <description>The CHAP scale consists of C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, albumin, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, each with a subscale range of 0-4. Each criterion in the CHAP scoring system provides a graded measure for a patient's disease activity. The sum of the four scores provides an objective scale for measuring a patient's disease activity and monitoring how it changes over time (scale range 0-16). A higher score indicates greater disease activity.</description>
