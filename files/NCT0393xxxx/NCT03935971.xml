      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of dupilumab on allergic contact&#xD;
      dermatitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 20 patients with allergic contact dermatitis who have not&#xD;
      improved with allergen avoidance up to 6 months after patch testing, but where allergic&#xD;
      contact dermatitis is still suspected. Subjects will receive 10 weeks of dupilumab, and both&#xD;
      clinical data and tissue samples will be assessed.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's global assessment is a physician-reported global assessment of disease activity (range 0-4) with 0 being clear and 4 being severe</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The body surface area is a physician-reported measure of the amount of disease involvement. The patient's palm size approximates 1% of body surface area involvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The eczema-area-and-severity-index score is a composite score of disease severity and extent of disease distribution. It was initially developed for evaluation of eczema. Disease severity (range 0-3; 0 being no disease and 3 being severe disease) is a measure of redness, thickness/induration, scratching, and lichenification. Each characterization is measured separately for body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) to calculate a regional score. The total score is a sum of the four body regions (range 0-72).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) itch</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating scale for itch is a patient-reported measure of itch (range 0-10) with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst imaginable itch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index is a 10-question, patient-reported instrument to assess impact of skin diseases on patient quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SLEEPY-Q (Sleep Questionnaire) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 6, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Sleepy-Q is a patient-derived, patient-reported sleep questionnaire for patients with chronic inflammatory dermatoses that consists of 28 individual questions. It assesses four dimensions of sleep in patients with inflammatory skin conditions: sleep disturbance (overall score 0-40, 0 being &quot;no sleep disturbance&quot; and 40 being &quot;severe sleep disturbance&quot;), causes of sleep disturbance related to dermatitis (binary, yes/no), causes of sleep disturbance unrelated to dermatitis (binary, yes/no), and impairment related to sleep disturbance (two subscales including Life Impairment Score = overall 0-40, being 0 &quot;no life impairment&quot; and 40 &quot;severe life impairment&quot; and Dermatitis Impairment Score = overall 0-30, being 0 &quot;no impairment&quot; and 30 &quot;severe impairment.&quot; The total impairment related to sleep disturbance is scored overall 0-70 after summing of the two subscales).</description>

             patch testing within 6 months of the baseline visit that can be duplicated at the&#xD;
             initiation of the study (placement at Week 0 and patch test reaction read at Week 0&#xD;
             +72-120 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
