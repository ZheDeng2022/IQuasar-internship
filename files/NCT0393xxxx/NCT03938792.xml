  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with PF-06741086 is anticipated to demonstrate a clinically relevant advantage&#xD;
      and/or a major contribution to patient care in comparison to current methods of treatment for&#xD;
      hemophilia A or B because it works differently than factor replacement products and will work&#xD;
      in the presence of inhibitors. The potential for once weekly (QW) subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      administration provides for treatment options in the absence of reliable vascular access,&#xD;
      increased convenience and may enable better compliance. Combined, these qualities should&#xD;
      result in a reduction of bleeding episodes.&#xD;
