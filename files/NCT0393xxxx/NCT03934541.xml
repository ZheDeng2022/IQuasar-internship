      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 gp41 MPER-656 liposome&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to four groups. Participants in Group 1 (Treatment 1)&#xD;
      will receive 500 mcg of MPER-656 liposome vaccine at Months 0, 2, and 6. Participants in&#xD;
      Group 1 (Control 1) will receive placebo at Months 0, 2, and 6. Participants in Group 2&#xD;
      (Treatment 2) will receive 2000 mcg of MPER-656 liposome vaccine at Months 0, 2, and 6.&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 (Control 2) will receive placebo at Months 0, 2, and 6. Study staff&#xD;
      will review safety data from Group 1 before deciding whether to enroll Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits through Month 12. Visits may include physical&#xD;
      examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and&#xD;
      questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Month 18 for follow-up health&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of May 2020, vaccinations were discontinued for all participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during&#xD;
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.&#xD;
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined in this protocol as consistently less&#xD;
                  than 140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or&#xD;
                  without medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which&#xD;
                  must be less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm&#xD;
                  Hg diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to&#xD;
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension&#xD;
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than&#xD;
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or&#xD;
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.&#xD;

             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of&#xD;
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the&#xD;
             period of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if&#xD;
