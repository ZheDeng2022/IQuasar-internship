  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the effects of tDCS applied on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (dlPFC) vs sham on the neuromuscular system. Two types of athletes will benefit from&#xD;
      stimulation: jumper and cyclists. Short and long term effects are assesed by&#xD;
      electromyographic records, experimental tasks and self-rated scales.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation is a technique of noninvasive brain stimulation which&#xD;
      delivers a electrical current to the scalp to modulate the neuronal activity. Depending on&#xD;
      the polarity of stimulation, tDCS induces a neural hyperexcitability (with anode) or&#xD;
      hypoexcitability (with cathode) of the target area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its neuromodulatory action, ease of use and low safety, tDCS can be used as a&#xD;
      potential treatment but also as an investigative tool in neurophysiology. Thus, studies have&#xD;
      shown a beneficial effect of tDCS on cognitive and motor functions. Nevertheless, studies&#xD;
      conducted on motor performance and the reduction of neuromuscular fatigue show disparate&#xD;
      results. It is impossible to conclude whether tDCS allows for improved performance and is a&#xD;
      means of doping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a prospective, sham-controlled, crossover, double-blind design, this study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of tDCS on neuromuscular fatigue resistance during explosive (jumping)&#xD;
      and endurance (cycling) exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: jumping group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: cycling group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part A, participants visit the laboratory on 3 occasions. Each visit is organized in&#xD;
      the same way and is at least 48 hours apart from the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are divided into two groups according to their level of experience (amateurs vs.&#xD;
      high level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the session of tDCS, participants carry out a psychometric assessment (MCQ, BIS10) and&#xD;
      experimental tasks (BART, EEFRT, STROOP test and Go NoGo task). Then, they performed three&#xD;
      types of jumps (long jump, squat jump and countermovement jump). Finally, participants&#xD;
      benefit from neuromuscular tests (EMG recording of plantar flexor muscle activity,&#xD;
      percutaneous stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be submitted to three sessions of tDCS (2 actives and one sham), one by visit,&#xD;
      in the order of randomization. Current intensity will be of 2 mA (or 0 mA), through 25 cm²&#xD;
      surface electrodes, during 20 minutes. The positioning of the stimulation electrodes will be&#xD;
      carried out in compliance with EEG 10/20 standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sequence order determined by randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anode: F3 / Cathode: AF8/ Stimulation intensity: 2 mA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anode: F3/ Cathode: AF8/ Stimulation intensity: 0 mA&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anode: FC2/ Cathode: Left shoulder/ Stimulation intensity: 2 mA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the stimulation, participants perform motor and cognitive task again and&#xD;
      the results are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During part B, subjects participate in two training sessions of five days each. The training&#xD;
      sessions are one month apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are divided into three groups according to their level of experience (amateurs&#xD;
      vs. high level vs. sedentary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day, the subjects perform two twenty-minute time trials during which they receive a&#xD;
      session of tDCS. (one week with the active tDCS, one week with the sham). So, subjects will&#xD;
      be submitted to 10 tDCS stimulation sessions (active or sham) for five consecutive days (2&#xD;
      sessions of 20 minutes/day). Current intensity will be of 2 mA, through 25 cm² surface&#xD;
      electrodes, placed over the dlPFC and the supraorbital region (anode position over F3 and&#xD;
      cathode over AF8, according to the EEG 10-20 international system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At J1 and J5 of each session (before and after session training), subjects carry out a&#xD;
      psychometric assessment (MCQ, BIS10) and experimental tasks (BART, EEFRT, STROOP test and Go&#xD;
      NoGo task) and benefit from neuromusculars tests (EMG recording of plantar flexor muscle&#xD;
      activity, percutaneous stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve). Baseline measures will be&#xD;
      compared to those obtained immediately after the end of sessions (5 days: short-term&#xD;
      effects), and to 12 and 30 days later (long-term effects). Active and sham stimulation&#xD;
      sessions outcomes will as well be compared.&#xD;

    <description>Compared scores from the French version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-10). The French version of the BIS-10 is a self-rated 34 item questionnaire, composed by three subscales: motor-impulsivity, cognitive-impulsivity and non-planning-impulsivity. Each item is scored on a 0 to 4 points scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of impulsivity.</description>

    <measure>MCQ scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Compared scores from the French version of the Monetary Choice Questionnaire. The MCQ is a self-rated 27 item questionnaire which assessed the discounting. Delay discounting is the decline in the present value of a reward with delay to its receipt.&#xD;
Example item: &quot; Would you prefer 25€ today or 75€ in 15 days? &quot;&#xD;
For each item, subjects must choose between a low immediate reward and a higher delayed reward.&#xD;
Waiting times vary from 7 days to 186 days, and rewards are divides into 3 magnitudes: low (25-35€), medium (50-60€), high (75-85€).&#xD;
This will allow assessing:&#xD;
the influence of the the magnitude of the difference between the two rewards proposed,&#xD;
the impact of the time on the reward's subjective value (speed at which the reward is devalued over time), reflected in the k index.&#xD;
This index is calculated separately for each magnitude, and an average index is calculated for each subject.&#xD;
The more the k index is high, the more the subject is considered impulsive.</description>

Each symptom is rated 0 to 3. The total score thus vary from 0 to 27.</description>
