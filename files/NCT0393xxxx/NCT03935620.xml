  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for significant language and communication&#xD;
      impairments. Enhancing the service delivery of early intervention for children with DS is a&#xD;
      key research and policy issue given the prevalence and detrimental effects of persistent&#xD;
      language impairments. Using a telemedicine approach allows clinicians to provide&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment to families from a wide geographic area in Oregon who may not&#xD;
      otherwise have access to a language intervention specialized for children with DS. Our&#xD;
      innovative project involves the creation of a new treatment optimized for children with DS,&#xD;
      as it will be the first study that translates an existing evidence-based language&#xD;
      intervention-Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT) into a telemedicine model. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to examine whether a telemedicine approach is effective for training parents to implement&#xD;
      EMT language support strategies and whether changes in parent behavior are associated with&#xD;
      child communication and language growth. The investigators will pilot the telemedicine&#xD;
      initiative to provide early intervention services to ten children with DS (aged 18- 48&#xD;
      months) and their families who live in rural and /or under-served areas of Oregon. The&#xD;
      investigators will use single-case research design methodology to pilot this intervention&#xD;
      research. The investigators will use secure video-teleconferencing technology to provide EMT.&#xD;
      Clinicians will provide EMT to parents through interactive coaching, teaching them how to&#xD;
      foster their children's social communication and language skills. Outcomes will focus on&#xD;
      parents' use of language support strategies and children's social communication and language&#xD;
      skills. Delivering early intervention to children with DS and providing parent-training at a&#xD;
      distance using a telemedicine approach has the potential to transform the delivery of early&#xD;
      language interventions for children with DS. Results of this study will directly inform the&#xD;
      development and refinement of language interventions for young children with DS.&#xD;

      1. Aim 1: To examine the effect of using a telemedicine service delivery model to teach&#xD;
           parents of children with DS to use EMT language support strategies. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that parents will learn to use EMT language support strategies from the&#xD;
           personalized instruction provided during 36 intervention sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 2: To examine the effect of delivering EMT using a telemedicine service delivery&#xD;
           model to improve the spoken language and social communication skills of children with&#xD;
           DS. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in child communication and language&#xD;
           skills will result from increasing parents' use of EMT language support strategies&#xD;
           during everyday parent-child interactions such as play with toys, singing songs, book&#xD;
           reading, and mealtimes.&#xD;

    <description>Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT) an evidence-based, naturalistic language intervention that has been optimized to address the specific language and communication deficits associated with DS. EMT is a parent-implemented intervention that involves home-visits during which clinicians teach parents to support their child learning language during typical parent-child interactions at home (play with toys, music, book reading, and snack time). Clinicians follow an evidence-based instructional framework called &quot;Teach-Model-Coach-Review&quot; to teach parents language support strategies.</description>
