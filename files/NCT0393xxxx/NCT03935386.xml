    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of using standard compression therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      chronic venous leg ulcers vs. the standard compression therapy with the additional use of the&#xD;
      application of a human allograft (Theraskin)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the propensity for venous leg ulcers to become refractory, long standing wounds,&#xD;
      incorporating active biologic grafts into the standard compression therapy, may prove to&#xD;
      accelerate wound healing. The two treatments to be compared in this study are both commonly&#xD;
      used for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Compression therapy has long been the standard&#xD;
      for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Standard Compression therapy consists of wound&#xD;
      debridement, application of non adherent dressings and a three or four layer compression&#xD;
      dressing. (PROFORE Multi-Layer Compression Bandage System) TheraSkin is a split thickness&#xD;
      skin graft harvested within 24 hours postmortem, from an organ donor who has cleared the&#xD;
      standard safety screenings. It is classified by the FDA as a donated tissue. Once harvested,&#xD;
      the graft is sanitized according to FDA specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is&#xD;
      delivered to the clinic for application to the foot ulcer. It is also a widely used treatment&#xD;
      for diabetic foot ulcers. TREATMENT RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY Chronic wounds of the lower&#xD;
      extremities affect a substantial proportion of the population. Venous leg ulcers (VLUs)&#xD;
      account for up to 90% of lower extremity wounds. The standard of care for treatment of VLU's&#xD;
      in wound centers in the United States is Standard Compression therapy as described above,&#xD;
      which may be combined with biologic graft materials applied to the wound bed. This study may&#xD;
      assist physicians who treat VLU's by comparing efficacy and costs of two common treatments&#xD;
      for VLU's in a prospective randomized clinical trial. The investigation will be a&#xD;
      head-to-head study comparing widely used human skin allograft (Theraskin) along with Standard&#xD;
      Compression Therapy vs Standard Compression Therapy alone. There is no randomized,&#xD;
      prospective data comparing these two options in the treatment of VLU. Compression is superior&#xD;
      to no compression and increases VLU healing rates. It is currently the mainstay of treatment&#xD;
      for venous ulcers of the lower extremities. It is important to consider the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of these wounds. A history of deep vein thrombosis is regarded as a&#xD;
      predisposing factor to venous insufficiency, and hence venous ulceration. Venous&#xD;
      insufficiency is associated with increased hydrostatic pressure in the veins of the leg&#xD;
      (Moffatt 207). External compression attempts to reverse this and aids venous return&#xD;
