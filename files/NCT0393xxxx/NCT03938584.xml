    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to perform a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of&#xD;
      vitamin C versus placebo on wound healing in mandibular fracture patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective, randomized clinical trial of de novo mandibular fracture patients requiring&#xD;
      intraoral surgical repair with plating, the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effects of supplemental vitamin C to placebo on soft tissue wound healing,&#xD;
           measured by a) biomarkers of soft tissue repair (Procollagen I and III, Matrix&#xD;
           Metallo-Proteinases 1,2,3 &amp; 9, C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, Interleukins 6 &amp; 8,&#xD;
           TBARS and TEAC) and b) clinical outcomes (wound dehiscence and Wound Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis1: Supplemental vitamin C will improve soft tissue healing post-mandibular&#xD;
           fracture, measured by improved procollagen I, other biomarker levels and clinical&#xD;
           outcomes, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale. The clinical literature describes impaired soft tissue wound healing in&#xD;
           mandibular fracture patients, including wound infection, wound dehiscence, and plate&#xD;
           exposure. Vitamin C is a necessary co-factor for the production of types I and III&#xD;
           collagen, as well as procollagen, the precursor to collagen, via the hydroxylation of&#xD;
           proline and lysine. In the setting of vitamin C deficiency, collagen production is&#xD;
           abnormal leading to defective vessel and connective tissue formation with degradation of&#xD;
           unstable collagen molecules.90-91,34, 63, 108,109&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will collect a robust set of clinical outcomes including clinician&#xD;
           evaluation and Wound Healing Score to measure soft tissue healing. Biomarkers of soft&#xD;
           tissue wound healing will be used to measure biochemical healing pathways as well. As a&#xD;
           precursor to collagen, procollagen I and III are widely used biomarkers of collagen&#xD;
           production in wound healing research. The investigators will assess these levels at&#xD;
           baseline and at 3 to 5weeks post-operatively to evaluate the effect of vitamin C on&#xD;
           collagen production. In addition, the antioxidant effects of vitamin C are critical&#xD;
           during the ordered phases of wound healing, from the inflammatory phase (including the&#xD;
           initial hemostatic cascade) to the proliferative phase. Antioxidant depletion during&#xD;
           these phases results in imbalanced proteolytic enzyme cascades (including matrix&#xD;
           metalloproteinases or MMPs) with resulting tissue destruction as well as an&#xD;
           over-exuberant inflammatory milieu. Further, the antioxidant deficit resulting from&#xD;
           vitamin C deficiency results in diminished monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis and&#xD;
           diminished bacteriocidal oxidative burst capabilities. Thus, the investigators will&#xD;
           additionally measure the effects of vitamin C supplementation on proteolytic enzyme&#xD;
           pathways (MMPs) and systemic markers of infection and inflammation (neutrophil count,&#xD;
           c-reactive protein level, interleukins (IL) 1 and 6). Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
           use indicators of oxidative stress at baseline and 6 weeks to measure the effects of&#xD;
           vitamin C supplementation on antioxidant capacity (TBARS and TEAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effects of supplemental vitamin C to placebo on bone repair, measured by a)&#xD;
           biomarkers of bone repair (alkaline phosphatase, TRACP 5b, osteocalcin, RANKL,&#xD;
           osteoprotegerin, and carboxy terminal collagen crosslinks) and b) clinical outcomes&#xD;
           (radiologic imaging and pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: Supplemental vitamin C will improve bone healing post-mandibular fracture,&#xD;
           measured by improved biomarkers of bone healing and more robust radiological bone&#xD;
           imaging, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale. A body of literature, from animal studies to randomized clinical trials,&#xD;
           supports the notion that vitamin C is necessary for bone health and healing. Multiple&#xD;
           animal studies demonstrate that vitamin C promotes bone formation / mineralization,&#xD;
           strengthens developing callous, and supports bone maintenance. Further, a number of&#xD;
           studies show that supplemental vitamin C prevents fracture in menopausal women and may&#xD;
           be protective against arthritis.10,11,12,69 Several well done randomized controlled&#xD;
           clinical trials have shown that supplemental vitamin C diminishes regional pain syndrome&#xD;
           after distal radius fractures and less robust data suggests this for foot and ankle&#xD;
           fractures. Well-done randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to develop Vitamin&#xD;
           C guidelines in traumatic facial fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will collect a comprehensive set of biochemical, clinical, and&#xD;
           radiological outcome measures to evaluate bony healing after mandibular fracture. The&#xD;
           biomarker evaluation will include assessment of osteoblast and osteoclast number&#xD;
           (alkaline phosphatase and TRACP 5b respectively), osteoblast activity (osteocalcin),&#xD;
           osteoclast differentiation (receptor activator for nuclear factor, B ligand or RANKL and&#xD;
           osteoprotegerin or decoy receptor for RANKL) and osteoclast activity (carboxy terminal&#xD;
           collagen crosslinks). The investigators will measure clinical outcomes about 1 and 3 to&#xD;
           5 weeks postoperatively. Finally, each subject will undergo a non-contrast CT of the&#xD;
           mandible 3to 5 weeks post-operatively for radiological evaluation of bone healing. The&#xD;
           CT scan may or may not be standard of care.30,36,135&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effects of supplemental vitamin C on soft tissue and bone healing by&#xD;
           smoking status in patients with traumatic mandibular fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Current smokers will have a higher prevalence of vitamin C deficiency than&#xD;
      nonsmokers at baseline, and vitamin C supplementation will improve soft tissue and bone&#xD;
      healing more in smokers than nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale. Despite clinical evidence for smoking-related impairment in wound healing, much is&#xD;
      unknown about the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this effect.21. It is postulated&#xD;
      that after injury, smoking impedes the inflammatory phase of wound healing by diminishing&#xD;
      cellular chemotactic responsiveness, migratory function, and oxidative bacterial killing, and&#xD;
      by creating an imbalance in protease-protease inhibitor relationships. The proliferative&#xD;
      phase of wound healing is also potentially impaired by smoking, with diminished fibroblast&#xD;
      proliferation and migration resulting in decreased collagen production.124-30 Increases in&#xD;
      oxidative stress and hypoxia further diminish healing in smokers.62,74,76,102 Vitamin C is&#xD;
      postulated to be an important contributor to the diminished wound healing evidenced in&#xD;
      smokers. Both population and experimental studies have shown smokers are more likely to be&#xD;
      deficient in Vitamin C, with 25% of female smokers and 30% of male smokers having severe&#xD;
      deficiency. This deficiency is likely secondary to a systemic depletion by the many reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species in tobacco smoke as well as a diet lacking antioxidants. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the effects of vitamin C on wound healing in current versus non smokers with&#xD;
      detailed assessment of tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project assembles a multidisciplinary team with expertise in wound healing,&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgery, medical effects of tobacco use, fracture repair, biomechanics of bone,&#xD;
      and conduct of clinical trials. The proposed work will define specific effects of&#xD;
      supplemental Vitamin C on soft tissue and bone healing, with additional attention to smoking&#xD;
      status in patients with mandibular fractures. For the many patients who are at high risk for&#xD;
      vitamin C deficiency and poor wound healing, this investigation will provide critical&#xD;
      knowledge of the role of oxidative stress and anti-oxidants in the mechanisms of impaired&#xD;
      healing. These data will provide pilot data to support randomized controlled trials of&#xD;
      interventions to improve post-operative wound healing in patients suffering from mandibular&#xD;
      and other traumatic fractures. Establishing the safety and efficacy of supplemental Vitamin C&#xD;
      in the peri-operative setting will improve wound healing outcomes for thousands of patients&#xD;
      undergoing traumatic fracture surgery and could be a transformative step in treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for any smoker undergoing surgery.&#xD;
