  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate an alternative clinical genetics cancer care delivery model, using non-genetic&#xD;
      providers to introduce and order genetic testing. 250 prostate and 250 pancreatic patients&#xD;
      will be recruiting. They will undergo genetic testing and complete study questionnaires.&#xD;
      Results from this pilot study will be used to inform the strategies used by the Clinical Risk&#xD;
      Evaluation Program (CREP) Genetic Counelors (CGS) and GI/GU physicians to deliver genetic&#xD;
      testing and return genetic risk information to patients with prostate or pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
