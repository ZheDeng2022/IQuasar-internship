  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard surgical treatment for glaucoma is trabeculectomy. The PRESERFLO™ (formerly&#xD;
      InnFocus) Microshunt (IMS) is a new, minimally invasive drainage device which has been&#xD;
      suggested to result in similar IOP lowering, but with faster visual recovery and less&#xD;
      complications and postoperative interventions. The objective of this study is to aid in&#xD;
      deciding on the use of the IMS in glaucoma surgery by assessing its efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) compared to the&#xD;
      standard trabeculectomy (TE).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures have been&#xD;
      introduced to the market. MIGS procedures or devices, often small stents or tubes that can be&#xD;
      placed into the eye, are potentially safer than standard trabeculectomy (TE). The surgery is&#xD;
      faster and easier to perform. Patient recovery is faster with fewer postoperative visits,&#xD;
      suggesting less impact on vision and quality of life. However, MIGS devices are more&#xD;
      expensive compared to standard surgery and it is unclear if the higher costs can be&#xD;
      compensated with their better safety profile and faster patient recovery (reduced&#xD;
      productivity losses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish guidelines for the use of MIGS, the Netherlands Glaucoma Group has recognized&#xD;
      the need for a formal investigation of their cost-effectiveness as compared to TE, prior to&#xD;
      their implementation on a large scale for regular care. Therefore, a societal&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis of MIGS procedures will be undertaken to further elucidate their&#xD;
      position in the glaucoma treatment algorithm in the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to aid in deciding on the use of the IMS in glaucoma surgery&#xD;
      by assessing its efficacy and cost-effectiveness in patients with primary open angle glaucoma&#xD;
      compared to trabeculectomy.&#xD;

             in-flammation in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Corneal thickness &lt;450um or &gt;620microns.&#xD;

         15. Conditions associated with elevated episcleral venous pressure such as active thyroid&#xD;
             orbitopathy.&#xD;

         16. Among patients in whom both eyes are eligible only the first eye is undergoing&#xD;
             surgical treatment is enrolled in the study.&#xD;
