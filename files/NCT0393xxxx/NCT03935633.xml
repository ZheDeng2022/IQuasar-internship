&#xD;
           Subjects started fasting for solid from 21:00 on the day before the study and for liquid&#xD;
           within 1 h before and after the administration. Subjects in each dose group received a&#xD;
           single administration on the first day of the study on an empty stomach. Blood samples&#xD;
           were collected at different time points before and within 48 hours after the&#xD;
           administration (before the administration on day 3). No administration was conducted on&#xD;
           day 2. continuous administration was conducted from day 3 to day 8, twice a day, once in&#xD;
           the morning on an empty stomach, once in 12 hours (±15min). The valley concentration&#xD;
           blood samples were collected in the morning on day 6, 7 and 8. In the morning of day 9,&#xD;
           a single administration was conducted on an empty stomach. Blood samples were taken at&#xD;
           the different time points before and within 48 hours after the administration on day 9.&#xD;
           Each dose was taken with 240 mL warm water.Except for the water taken together with the&#xD;
           tablets, it should be ensured that the water was banned for 1 hour before and after the&#xD;
           valley concentration blood sample collection from day 6 to day 8 and 1 hour before and&#xD;
           after the administration in the morning on day 1 and day 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pharmacokinetic assessment of CN128 administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           PK parameters of CN128 include AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/ F, MRT, λz,&#xD;
           Css-av, Css-min, Css-max, Accumulation rate, Fluctuation index, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety and tolerability assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation was based on the incidence rate of adverse events (AE) after the&#xD;
           administration, study termination information, vital signs (including body temperature,&#xD;
           pulse, breathing, sitting blood pressure) and physical examination (including height,&#xD;
           weight, general condition, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat,&#xD;
           chest, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, limbs and nervous system examinations, and laboratory&#xD;
           tests (blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, serum&#xD;
           iron, thyroid gland and parathyroid gland function), ECG to evaluate the status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pharmacokinetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phoenix WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, version 7.0) was used to estimate and&#xD;
      analyze the parameters of PK in non-atrioventricular model according to dosage. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in real time to fully reflect the characteristics&#xD;
      of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in human body. The PK parameters&#xD;
      of each participant were calculated according to the following methods. PK parameters&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRT, λz, Css_av, Css_min, Css_max, Accumulation&#xD;
      rate and Fluctuation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were summarized on untransformed datas of drug concentration in plasma&#xD;
      at each time point: AUC0 t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRTλz, Css_av, Css_min,&#xD;
      Css_max, R and DF. Descriptive statistics was used in the analysis of Number (N), arithmetic&#xD;
      mean, geometric mean, standard deviation (SD), CV, minimum, median and maximum. Average and&#xD;
      individual time-concentration curves were drawn according to the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Safety analysis All AE, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), drug-related TEAE, grade&#xD;
      3 or above TEAE, serious adverse events (SAE), drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to death, TEAE&#xD;
      leading to termination of trial, drug-relation TEAE leading to termination of trial and&#xD;
      drug-related TEAE leading to discontinuation of use of test drug were summarized for case&#xD;
      number, subject number and incidence rate. P value for the incidence of these AEs with&#xD;
      different classifications was calculated by Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEAE, SAE, drug-related TEAE, drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to the termination of the trial,&#xD;
      and TEAE leading to the discontinuation of drug use were summarized and described according&#xD;
      to the system organ classification (SOC), preferred terminology (PT) and study group. The&#xD;
      severity of TEAE and drug-related TEAE was also summarized according to SOC, PT and study&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measured value of parameters and changes from baseline of vital signs, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      physical examination, clinical laboratory examination, etc. were summarized according to the&#xD;
      planned time point and the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine dose-limited toxicity of multiple dose in human (DLT); Determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerable dose of multiple dose in human (MTD).&#xD;
