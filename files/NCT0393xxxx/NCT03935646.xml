  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the acute effects of stimulant medication on executive&#xD;
      functioning. The rationale for the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of stimulants&#xD;
      for college students with ADHD and help prevent stimulant misuse among college students&#xD;
      without ADHD. The working hypothesis is that stimulants, compared to baseline and placebo&#xD;
      conditions, will improve executive functioning for college students with ADHD but not for&#xD;
      college students without ADHD. Improvements on executive functioning measures (e.g., CPT-IP,&#xD;
      Spatial Span) will be examined through 2 (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) x 3 (Baseline, Placebo,&#xD;
      Stimulant) repeated measures ANOVAs. Follow-up analyses will include paired comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes are to confirm these hypotheses and demonstrate the need for further study&#xD;
      of stimulants. If confirmed, the results will provide pilot data for a larger NIH grant&#xD;
      proposal aimed at further examining the acute effects of stimulants (i.e., improved cognitive&#xD;
      functioning with stimulants) and comparing them to the acute effects of physical exercise&#xD;
      (i.e., improved cognitive functioning immediately after exercise). The investigators expect&#xD;
      this outcome to have an important positive impact because it can help support stimulant&#xD;
      medication as an effective treatment for college students with ADHD (DuPaul et al., 2012).&#xD;
      Additionally, demonstration that stimulants do not improve executive functioning for college&#xD;
      students without ADHD can be used to help prevent and discourage stimulant misuse and&#xD;
      diversion on college campuses (Hartung et al., 2013).&#xD;

      Participants. The investigators will enroll 40 University of Wyoming (UW) and Laramie County&#xD;
      Community College (LCCC) students including 20 with ADHD and 20 without ADHD (20 men, 20&#xD;
      women). Power analyses (G*Power 3.1; Faul et al., 2007) indicated a sample of at least this&#xD;
      size is needed to provide 80% power to detect medium effects. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      through several means including targeted email announcements, flyers, and SONA pre-screener&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full exclusion criteria can be found in the &quot;Eligibility&quot; section below. Most notably,&#xD;
      participants must stratify as being low risk for stimulant medication use. A health history&#xD;
      screening questionnaire and additional health items will be used to screen participants and&#xD;
      responses will be reviewed and approved by a medical consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All prospective participants will attend a baseline appointment to confirm eligibility&#xD;
      including: (a) being at low risk for stimulant use contraindications and (b) meeting&#xD;
      diagnostic threshold for ADHD. After confirming eligibility, participants will also complete&#xD;
      baseline measures during the baseline appointment. After enrolling in the study, participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled for two experimental appointments. The two experimental appointments will&#xD;
      include: (a) Placebo pill and (b) Stimulant (Adderall IR 10mg). The ordering of experimental&#xD;
      appointments will be counterbalanced. Experimental appointments will be scheduled in the&#xD;
      mornings and on the same day of the week and same time of day. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      abstain from caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drugs for 12 hours prior to their&#xD;
      appointments. Participants will be administered either placebo or stimulant. After a&#xD;
      90-minute wait, participants will complete executive functioning measures. Physiological&#xD;
      measures (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure) will be monitored at specific times throughout&#xD;
      the appointment and a medical consultant will be available on call for any emergencies.&#xD;
      Participants will also be sent a modified mood (i.e., Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale&#xD;
      or DASS) and sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or PSQI) questionnaire the morning&#xD;
      following all experimental appointments. The only difference between the two appointments is&#xD;
      the administration of either placebo or stimulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to analyses, all variables will be screened. Violations of statistical assumptions will&#xD;
      be addressed through data transformations or nonparametric statistics. Improvements on&#xD;
      executive functioning measures (e.g., CPT-IP, Spatial Span) will be examined through 2 (ADHD&#xD;
      vs. non-ADHD) x 3 (Baseline, Placebo, Stimulant) repeated measures ANOVAs. When interactions&#xD;
      are significant, paired samples t-tests will be used to evaluate group differences. When&#xD;
      interaction effects fail to reach statistical significance, independent samples t-tests will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate group differences. The magnitude of omnibus effects for repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVAs will be calculated using partial eta-squared (Î·p2). Within-group effects (Cohen's d)&#xD;
      and corresponding confidence intervals for within-group effect sizes will be standardized&#xD;
      using the variability of baseline scores (Howell, 2011). Between-group effects will be&#xD;
      calculated using Hedges g (Hedges, 1982).&#xD;
