    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men. Today serum prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) level and digital rectal examination (DRE) are routinely used for screening of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In the case of higher PSA levels and/or abnormal DRE, 10-12 core standard transrectal&#xD;
      prostate biopsy (STRUS-B) is preferred method.Most of the pathological T1 stage tumours are&#xD;
      diagnosed by this method. But as the prostate volume increases, cancer detection rate of&#xD;
      STRUS-B decreases.In the last decade multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (mpMR) has gained importance in the diagnosis of prostate cancer beside the staging. Now it&#xD;
      is possible to biopsies from lesions which are suspicious for cancer in mpMR. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that mpMR guided prostate biopsies either transrectally or perineally have better&#xD;
      cancer detection rates comparing STRUS-B, especially in patients with history of negative&#xD;
      previous biopsy. But its use in biopsy naive settings is not recommended.In this study it is&#xD;
      aimed to compare cancer detection rate of MR guided MR-US fusion transrectal prostate biopsy&#xD;
      with STRUS-B.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A histopathological evaluation of STRUS-B materials based on suspicious DRE findings and high&#xD;
      or increasing PSA levels is the gold standard in prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the fact&#xD;
      that approximately one-third of malignant prostate lesions is isoechoic and cannot be&#xD;
      detected using conventional grayscale transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) decreases the&#xD;
      sensitivity rates of STRUS-B. These restrictions on the use of TRUS have encouraged&#xD;
      urologists to use new methods to diagnose prostate cancer. One of these methods is the biopsy&#xD;
      of lesions defined using mpMR, which has been widely used for the past 10 years. An MR&#xD;
      targeted biopsy can be performed cognitively under MR guidance or using ultrasound devices&#xD;
      with fusion software that can combine MR images with sonographic images. mpMR targeted&#xD;
      biopsies are recommended in the current clinical practice for re-biopsies of patients who had&#xD;
      previous negative biopsy but clinically suspected of cancer, follow-up biopsies of active&#xD;
      surveillance, and biopsies of patients who are suspected to have recurrence after local&#xD;
      minimally invasive treatment, such as radiotherapy and high-intensity focused&#xD;
      ultrasonography. Recent studies showed that the cancer detection rate of mpMRIguided prostate&#xD;
      biopsy is between 33.7% and 79.5%, which is higher than that of standard 12-core transrectal&#xD;
      biopsy. However, the number of studies evaluating the use of MR targeted prostate biopsy in&#xD;
      biopsy naive patients is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is aimed to compare cancer detection rates of STRUS-B and MR guided MR-US&#xD;
      fusion transrectal prostate biopsy in the biopsy naive patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients will be randomized to STRUS-B arm and another 100 to fusion arm. In the standard&#xD;
      arm patients who have high PSA levels and/or suspicious DRE will be undertaken STRUS-B. In&#xD;
      the study arm all patients will undergo a multiparametric prostate MR without endorectal&#xD;
      coils. MRI will be performed by Siemens Magnetom(Trade mark) 1.5 T (Siemens Medical&#xD;
      Solutions, Pennsylvania, USA) MRI system. The images wi,ll be reviewed by an experienced&#xD;
      uro-radiologist who has no detailed clinical information about the patients. Suspected areas&#xD;
      in T2, T1 contrast, and diffusion-weighted images of multiparametric MRI were reported&#xD;
      according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version-2 (PIRADS v2). In cases of&#xD;
      multiple lesions with different PIRADS scores, the lesion with the highest PIRADS score will&#xD;
      be accepted as dominant lesion. Biopsy procedures will be performed under local anesthesia or&#xD;
      sedoanalgesia. However, sedoanalgesia will be preferred if the patient could not tolerate&#xD;
      pain during the penetration of US probe due to low pain threshold or anal canal stricture due&#xD;
      to previous rectal surgeries. The procedure will be performed in outpatient clinic&#xD;
      conditions. Transrectal ultrasonography will be performed by using an ultrasonography system&#xD;
      with rigid fusion software (LOGIQ E9; General Electric, Massachusetts, USA) when patients lie&#xD;
      on the left decubitus position. Rectal lidocaine gel will be applied 5 min before rectal US&#xD;
      probe is introduced. A sonographic examination of the prostate tissue will be performed to&#xD;
      check the presence of prominent lesions. Total prostate volumes will be measured.&#xD;
      Multiparametric prostate MRI images will be uploaded to the US system on the day of biopsy.&#xD;
      After segmentation (matching) of MRI images with sonographic images, the lesions reported in&#xD;
      mpMR will be marked. The periprostatic block will be then performed with 2% prilocaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (20 mg/mL) injected into the neurovascular bundle on both sides of the&#xD;
      prostate, with 5 mL to the right and 5 mL to the left. Following the block, two to five core&#xD;
      biopsies from the MRI-targeted lesions with PIRADS ≥3 will be obtained. All procedures in&#xD;
      fusion biopsy will be performed by two urologists experienced and trained in transrectal&#xD;
      prostate ultrasonography and biopsy. After the F-TRUS biopsy completed, a standard 12-core&#xD;
      TRUS biopsy will performed on fusion group. STRUS_B arm only standard 12 core transrectal&#xD;
      prostate biopsy will be performed. A histopathological evaluation of biopsy specimens will be&#xD;
      performed by a uro-pathologist with &gt;10 years of experience. The percentage of cancer within&#xD;
      the core, primary, and secondary Gleason score and grade according to the 2014 International&#xD;
      Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade will be specified in the final pathology report.&#xD;
      Patients reported with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm in three or more cores&#xD;
      or atypical small acinar proliferation will be redirected to rebiopsy, but they will be&#xD;
      included to the benign group in the evaluation of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the secondary outcomes, pain level during MR fusion biopsy and STRUS biopsy evaluated by&#xD;
      visual analogue scale score, cancer detection rates of different core numbers taken form MR&#xD;
      targeted lesion, role of the peripheric blood parameters (such as, neutrophil to lymphocyte&#xD;
      ratio and systemic immune inflammatuary index) in predicting prostate cancer in PRIADS 3,4&#xD;
      and 5lesions, and comparison of the tumor laterality and ISUP grade in MR US fuison biopsy&#xD;
      and radical prostatectomy specimens will be evaluated.&#xD;
