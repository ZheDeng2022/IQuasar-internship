  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single arm, open label study is to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab combined with radiation administered to the upper part of the vagina (vaginal&#xD;
      cuff brachytherapy) followed by three cycles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with endometrial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the patient begins the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer is commonly treated with surgery. The patient must have already had&#xD;
      surgery including hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) prior to being considered eligible for&#xD;
      this study. The surgery may also include removal of the ovaries, and removal of pelvic and&#xD;
      para-aortic lymph nodes. Following the surgery, the doctor will identify if the patient has&#xD;
      factors related to the cancer which places the patient at a greater risk for the cancer&#xD;
      returning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to participating in this study there are exams, tests or procedures to find out if the&#xD;
      patient can be treated in the study. Most are part of regular cancer care. Tumor tissue will&#xD;
      need to be collected for study tests to see if the patient is eligible for to take part on&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT If the patient is eligible, pembrolizumab will be given 7 days before radiation&#xD;
      therapy. After radiation therapy, three cycles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will be up to two years.&#xD;

             post-operative pre-treatment CT/MRI is required and must not demonstrate evidence&#xD;
             suggestive of metastatic disease (adnexa, nodes, intraperitoneal disease).&#xD;
             Post-operative, pre-treatment CT/MRI must be performed if a BSO and/or lymphnode&#xD;
             sampling was not performed.&#xD;
