      This is a 24-week, open-label, multiple dose safety, tolerability and efficacy study. There&#xD;
      is a 12-week run-in phase when all subjects receive Insulin Lispro and Insulin Degludec for&#xD;
      12 weeks. After completing the run-in period, subjects then are randomized to a treatment&#xD;
      group of either HDV- Insulin lispro + Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 40%) or&#xD;
      HDV-Insulin lispro+ Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 10%) for 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
