  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is one of the most common cutaneous cancers worldwide. Activating mutations in RAS&#xD;
      oncogenes are found in a third of all human cancers and NRAS mutations are found in 15%-20%&#xD;
      of melanomas. Acquisition of a functional mutation in NRAS results in activation of the Ras /&#xD;
      Raf / MEK / ERK signaling pathway leading to unconstrained cell growth and cell&#xD;
      transformation. NRAS mutation status was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor&#xD;
      in stage IV melanoma. No drug was approved to treat melanoma patients with NRAS mutation or&#xD;
      amplification until now. FCN-159, an oral and potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, has more than 10 folds&#xD;
      higher selectivity against activated MEK1 and MEK2 compared with trametinib, and has&#xD;
      demonstrated significant antitumor growth inhibition in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX)&#xD;
      models with NRAS mutation.This is the first in human study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a phase Ia/Ib, open label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study that will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of FCN-159 in&#xD;
      up to 37 patients with NRAS-aberrant including both NRAS amplification and mutation (Ia) and&#xD;
      NRAS-mutation only (Ib) in local advanced or metastatic melanoma. In this study, the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase utilizes 3+3, accelerated titration design with starting dose of 0.2 mg, QD,&#xD;
      orally, and the dose will be escalated up to Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD) or until the&#xD;
      Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified. The dose level will be considered to expand up&#xD;
      to 6 patients if the objective response is observed, intends to collect more clinical data to&#xD;
      support the RP2D determination. Once the MTD or RP2D dose is identified, an expansion cohort&#xD;
      will be followed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of FCN-159 in patients with&#xD;
      NRAS-mutation melanoma.&#xD;
