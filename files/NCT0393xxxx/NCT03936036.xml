  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing&#xD;
        linagliptin to the 2nd generation sulfonylurea (SU) antidiabetic class as a proxy for&#xD;
        placebo. SUs are not known to have an impact on the outcome of interest. In addition, SUs&#xD;
        were the most frequent background treatment in CARMELINA (after metformin), and DPP4i and&#xD;
        SUs are preferentially prescribed to similarly older patients in real world (Patorno et&#xD;
        al., 2019). The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline&#xD;
        period of 180 days before initiation of linagliptin or a comparator drug (cohort entry&#xD;
        date). Follow-up for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the&#xD;
        trial, patients are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during study follow-up.&#xD;
