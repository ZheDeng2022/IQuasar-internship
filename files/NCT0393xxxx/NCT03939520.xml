  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung&#xD;
      disease. It has been considered rare, with an incidence estimated to 11.5 cases per 100 000&#xD;
      individuals per year. Increasing rates of hospital admissions and deaths due to IPF suggest&#xD;
      an increasing burden of disease. The median survival time from diagnosis is 2-4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently two disease-modifying therapies, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved&#xD;
      worldwide. Both drugs reduce the disease progression as measured by progressive decline in&#xD;
      forced vital capacity (FVC), with a reduction of overall mortality showed by meta-analysis of&#xD;
      phase III pirfenidone trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, progression of disease continues to occur despite the currently available drug&#xD;
      therapy. Many patients die from progressive, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, or less&#xD;
      frequently from acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. In these patients, no data are&#xD;
      available to guide management between continuation of the prescribed antifibrotic drug, to&#xD;
      switch to the other available antifibrotic drug, or to combine the available drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nintedanib and pirfenidone is not recommended outside clinical trials.&#xD;
      However, although both antifibrotic drugs were developed and approved as monotherapy, two&#xD;
      recent trials have suggested the feasibility and safety of combining them over a 12-24 weeks&#xD;
      period. These results encourage further studies of combination treatment with pirfenidone and&#xD;
      nintedanib in patients with IPF. Such study is timely, as there is a risk that clinicians&#xD;
      facing the continued worsening of disease in patients receiving one of the available drugs&#xD;
      may prescribe both drugs combined outside clinical trials, potentially exposing patients to a&#xD;
      currently unknown risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of the combination pirfenidone and&#xD;
      nintedanib as compared to a &quot;switch monotherapy&quot;: i.e. switching from the current to the&#xD;
      other of the two existing drugs prescribed as monotherapy, in patients who present chronic&#xD;
      worsening IPF despite receiving either pirfenidone or nintedanib and as to a &quot;control group&quot;:&#xD;
      i.e.treatment still be on as before randomization (pirfenidone or nintedanib).&#xD;
