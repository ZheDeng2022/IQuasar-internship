    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that IV iron sucrose infusions given to iron deficient&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients prior to debulking surgery can improve pre-operative iron stores and&#xD;
      decrease transfusion of packed red blood cells in the peri-operative period. 21 participants&#xD;
      at least 18 years of age with epithelial ovarian cancer of any stage requiring neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and surgery will be enrolled. Participants will be on study for a period of up&#xD;
      to 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and anemia are common in cancer patients. Data from the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin (UW) suggest that more than 50% of ovarian cancer patients undergo blood&#xD;
      transfusion during their cancer treatments. Transfusion rates are particularly high in&#xD;
      patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), despite multiple opportunities to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat anemia prior to surgery. Blood transfusions have been associated with&#xD;
      worse survival in ovarian cancer patients. Seventy-seven percent of ovarian cancer patients&#xD;
      who receive NACT at the UW are anemic prior to surgery, and the same percentage receive a&#xD;
      perioperative blood transfusion, defined as a blood transfusion within 72 hours of surgery.&#xD;
      Iron deficiency without anemia is also common in cancer patients, though little has been&#xD;
      published regarding how frequently it occurs in ovarian cancer patients. Functional iron&#xD;
      deficiency, a lack of iron incorporation into erythroid precursors despite adequate iron&#xD;
      stores, is also common in cancer patients. Study investigators hypothesize that IV iron&#xD;
      sucrose infusions given to iron deficient ovarian cancer patients prior to debulking surgery&#xD;
      can improve pre-operative iron stores and decrease transfusion of packed red blood cells in&#xD;
      the peri-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have a new epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis, with planned&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. The study cohort will consist of&#xD;
      participants with iron deficiency without anemia (defined below) prior to starting&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Iron deficient participants with anemia are already offered iron sucrose&#xD;
      infusions as part of their standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will include participants with planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy and debulking&#xD;
      surgery with a normal Hgb within 30 days of study enrollment. Iron studies including&#xD;
      ferritin, transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), reticulocyte count and serum iron,&#xD;
      will be performed on these participants for research purposes only. Consent will be obtained&#xD;
      prior to drawing research-related iron studies. The majority of participants will have Hgb&#xD;
      levels available in their records from the last 30 days, either from the UW, or from a&#xD;
      referring institution. If this is not the case, pre-chemotherapy lab studies will be obtained&#xD;
      the day of their visit, which would routinely include a Hgb level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sign a consent to receive four IV iron sucrose transfusions, prior to their&#xD;
      debulking surgery, and be followed for prospective data collection. Consent will be signed&#xD;
      for the infusion and for prospective data collection related to future laboratory studies and&#xD;
      rates of transfusion of blood products. Participants with a normal Hgb and normal iron&#xD;
      studies will participate in the prospective data collection portion of this study only.&#xD;
      Prospective data collection will continue until subjects have completed first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled until 21 evaluable participants have been enrolled. Evaluable&#xD;
      participants will have true or functional iron deficiency without anemia and have received at&#xD;
      least one IV iron sucrose infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron studies will be repeated 21 days (+/- 7 days) after last infusion in participants who&#xD;
      receive IV iron sucrose. Participants with persistent iron deficiency will be referred to&#xD;
      hematology.&#xD;
