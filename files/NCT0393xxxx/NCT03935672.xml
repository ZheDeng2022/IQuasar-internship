  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PEARL study will recruit approximately 50 patients with human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) who are about to undergo primary&#xD;
      treatment with concurrent chemo-radiation from South Wales (Velindre Cancer Centre and&#xD;
      Singleton Hospital, Swansea) and Bristol. The main aim is to see whether it is feasible to&#xD;
      preform a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan after 2 weeks of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and re-plan the radiotherapy based on this PET-CT scan, to re-distribute the&#xD;
      dose of radiotherapy being delivered, so that a smaller area of normal tissues in the mouth&#xD;
      and throat are treated to a high dose of radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PEARL is a prospective, interventional, non-randomised, phase II feasibility study for&#xD;
      patients with good prognosis Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous&#xD;
      cell cancer (OPSCC) who are suitable for treatment with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) caused by Human Papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) infection (HPV-positive OPSCC) is increasing in the United Kingdom. It tends to affect&#xD;
      younger patients and has a better outcome than most other head and neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large proportion of patients diagnosed with HPV-positive OPSCC will undergo non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment. This usually involves 6 to 7 weeks of chemo-radiotherapy, with chemotherapy being&#xD;
      given weekly or during the first and fourth week of the radiotherapy course (CCRT). Many&#xD;
      patients with HPV-positive OPSCC are cured of their disease but often have to live for&#xD;
      several decades with the side effects of their treatment. Side effects from radiotherapy are&#xD;
      usually caused because normal tissues surrounding the cancer receive radiation whilst the&#xD;
      cancer itself is being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans are able to look at the&#xD;
      metabolic (or biological) activity of cells and are currently recommended in the UK for&#xD;
      response assessment after a patient has completed radiotherapy for a head and neck cancer&#xD;
      but, as far as we know, have not yet been used routinely to adapt radiotherapy according to&#xD;
      the individual patient's response during radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEARL will explore the feasibility of individually adapting the radiotherapy plan for each&#xD;
      patient after 2 weeks of radical CCRT, based on biological changes in tumour activity seen on&#xD;
      an interim FDG-PET-CT scan, carried out early on during a course of treatment. The aim is to&#xD;
      reduce the dose of radiotherapy received by surrounding normal tissues to ultimately reduce&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will establish the progression free survival rate (PFS) in patients who receive&#xD;
      biologically adapted radiotherapy. Furthermore, it will also explore whether changes seen on&#xD;
      PET-CT scan during treatment correlate with outcome and with changes in potential blood-based&#xD;
      biomarkers of response. Toxicity rates will be assessed, particularly the effect of treatment&#xD;
      on swallowing function.&#xD;

Baseline planning FDG PET CT scan&#xD;
Patients will start their 6 weeks of CCRT within two to three weeks following the planning scans. Cisplatin chemotherapy will be administered. 33 daily fractions of radiotherapy will be delivered over 6 weeks.&#xD;
A second FDG-PET-CT scan (iPET) and repeat plasma and saliva tests will be carried out after 2 weeks of CCRT (on RT days 9 - 12) and the iPET assessed for residual FDG-avid disease. The biological GTV will be re-outlined based on the residual avid region of the tumour on the second PET-CT (bGTV_iP)&#xD;
At the end of treatment, plasma and saliva tests will be carried out at 4 weeks post treatment and again at the 3 month post-treatment PET-CT&#xD;
Swallowing and QoL assessments will be repeated 4 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after treatment and will be repeated at 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment. The plasma and saliva samples will be repeated at 12 and 24 months</description>

    <description>Patients will have three scans during the trial.&#xD;
The 1st scan (prePET) is a baseline diagnostic scan. The patient is in a thermoplastic shell and PET CT will be used by to define a bGTV_P. bGTV_P will then be used as an adjunct to help us delineate the GTV_P.&#xD;
The 2nd scan (iPET) takes place following 2 weeks (10 fractions) of chemo-radiotherapy. The patient is in a thermoplastic shell and the PET CT will be used to delineate the remaining avid disease (bGTV_iP).&#xD;
The 3rd scan takes place 3 months following the last dose of radiotherapy. It will be used to ascertain whether any avid disease remains and may inform the need for further treatment.</description>

    <description>The biological GTVs (bGTV_P and bGTV_iP) will be automatically delineated by ATLAAS and verified manually by a nuclear medicine physician and a clinical oncologist. It will consist of the high FDG uptake volume based on visual assessment whilst using suitable windowing levels. Any differences in contouring will be settled either by the two doctors reaching a consensus or by a third doctor if differences between the first two cannot be resolved.</description>
