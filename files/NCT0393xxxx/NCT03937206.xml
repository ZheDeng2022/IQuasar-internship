  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood lipid profile plays a role in health and disease states and is affected by many&#xD;
      genetic and lifestyle factors. On the more extreme side, hyperlipidemia (a condition&#xD;
      characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesteremia, or both) is a risk factor for&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD) 1. CHD is the most common form of cardiovascular disease (CVD);&#xD;
      it is characterized by arterial obstructions or blockages, and is a leading cause of heart&#xD;
      attacks and strokes 2. Specifically, blood lipids including triglycerides (TG), total&#xD;
      cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and the ratio of TC: high&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, are key modifiable risk factors for CHD.&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemia is thought to be caused or promoted by sedentary lifestyle, obesity, or&#xD;
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetes 2. Therefore, lifestyle factors, like the modification of&#xD;
      dietary lipids to maintain a healthy blood lipid profile are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids in terms of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and the nervous system in general, as well as emerging research on DHA supplementation in&#xD;
      acute brain and spinal cord injury. Demand for dietary omega-3's, either through increased&#xD;
      fish consumption or through DHA supplementation, is expected to increase, particularly as the&#xD;
      baby boomer population adds to the ranks of senior citizens concerned about and/or&#xD;
      susceptible to health issues such as dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. Availability of EPA&#xD;
      and DHA in circulation is an important parameter in understanding biologic properties of&#xD;
      fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ascending&#xD;
      doses of NutriterraTM, as measured by plasma levels of total EPA, DHA, DPA and ALA under fed&#xD;
      conditions. In addition, after a two-week (minimum) washout period, subjects will take&#xD;
      product for 16 weeks to evaluate effects on cardiovascular markers as a measure of efficacy.&#xD;
