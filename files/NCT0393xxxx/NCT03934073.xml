  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability in France: more than half of&#xD;
      stroke survivors have a disabling motor deficit, affecting mainly the upper limb. A lack of&#xD;
      hand control makes everyday tasks more difficult and reduces the quality of life. The&#xD;
      investigators lack approaches to specifically rehabilitate the hand after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new tool has been developed to measure manual dexterity (the Finger Force&#xD;
      Manipulandum or FFM). This tool, which records the forces applied by the fingers on pistons,&#xD;
      allows to measure more finely the key components of manual dexterity during visuomotor tasks.&#xD;
      The tool measures the ability to control and release the force applied by the fingers, to&#xD;
      perform sequences, to track and maintain a frequency of tapping (temporality of movement)&#xD;
      with the fingers, and to use the fingers independently one another.&#xD;

      The DexTrain proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the benefit of a training using a tool,&#xD;
      an improved version of the FFM, named DexTrain, for the rehabilitation and specific training&#xD;
      of the fingers in subjects suffering from stroke. In this study the investigators will&#xD;
      compare the effect of conventional therapy with that of the DexTrain method, particularly on&#xD;
      the function of the hand and its spontaneous use at home (ecological condition). To better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms involved, the investigators will also study brain plasticity using&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (SMT) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
