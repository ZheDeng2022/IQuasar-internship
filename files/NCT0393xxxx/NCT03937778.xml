      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much is known about how people perceive light touch, temperature, and pain. But less is known&#xD;
      about how deep pressure is perceived. Deep pressure is an important part of many touch&#xD;
      therapies, like massage therapy. Researchers want to learn more to help people with chronic&#xD;
      pain and other disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out which sensory nerve fibers are involved in feeling the sensation of deep&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 50 enrolled in study number 16-AT-0077&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under study number 16-AT-0077&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 visit that lasts about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a brief medical interview. They will have a urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have ischemic nerve block on 1 arm. A blood pressure cuff will be inflated&#xD;
      until the arm is numb for up to an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests to see how they perceive different sensations. They will rate&#xD;
      gentle brushing on the hands and forearms. They will rate gentle pressure squeezing from a&#xD;
      hand massager on the hands and forearms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive other sensations such as vibration, cool, warm, pinprick without&#xD;
      piercing the skin, finger movement, and pressure. They will be asked to rate or respond to&#xD;
      the sensations. They will be asked to rate any pain or discomfort from the nerve block on an&#xD;
      ongoing basis.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory basis of non-painful deep pressure sensation is not known. We recently found that&#xD;
      innocuous pressure sensation is eliminated in rare sensory neuronopathy patients with a&#xD;
      specific loss of A-beta fibers, strongly suggesting that A-beta fibers underlie the ability&#xD;
      to sense deep pressure. In addition, we and others have shown that deep pressure touch&#xD;
      (observed in hugs and massage) frequently conveys a sense of pleasantness. The current study&#xD;
      aims to examine the role of A-beta fibers in the perception of deep pressure touch including&#xD;
      both its intensity and the pleasant affect it often elicits. This study constitutes the&#xD;
      second study of the K99 phase of a K99/R00 grant application awarded to Dr. Laura Case by&#xD;
      National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 healthy participants will be enrolled in the study with a goal of 12 completers.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited based on previous screening and participation in our studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will undergo an ischemic-compression block. Sensory stimuli will be&#xD;
      administered at frequent intervals to capture the loss of sensation related to A fibers as&#xD;
      the block progresses. Before and after A-beta-associated sensations have been lost, the&#xD;
      perception of deep pressure will be tested. Participants will rate the intensity and&#xD;
      pleasantness of the pressure. Ratings of pain and discomfort will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome; Rating of intensity of deep pressure on the blocked arm&#xD;
      before versus after loss of A-beta sensation, compared to ratings on the unblocked arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: 1) Rating of pleasantness of deep pressure on the blocked arm after loss&#xD;
      of A-beta sensation, compared to ratings on the unblocked arm; 2) Ratings of intensity and&#xD;
      pleasantness of gentle brushing on the blocked arm after loss of A-beta sensation, compared&#xD;
      to ratings on the unblocked arm.&#xD;
