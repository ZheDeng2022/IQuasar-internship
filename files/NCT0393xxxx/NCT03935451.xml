  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a relatively common disease that effects all age groups&#xD;
      and carries significant morbidity and mortality. The initial treatment typically involves&#xD;
      both short and long term medication, however when this is not enough to adequately control&#xD;
      the disease, surgery is often required. The high morbidity and mortality rates are in part&#xD;
      due to the increased rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&#xD;
      or pulmonary embolism (PE) which have been shown to develop more frequently in IBD patients&#xD;
      compared to the general population. Undergoing abdominal surgery has also been shown to&#xD;
      independently increase rates of DVT and PE and since the majority of patients with IBD will&#xD;
      undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime, the relative increased risk of developing a&#xD;
      VTE is very high. The majority of DVT and PE events in the postoperative IBD population will&#xD;
      occur after discharge from hospital and therefore carries significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      risk in a unmonitored setting. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits and safety of&#xD;
      twice daily dosing of oral extended VTE prophylaxis agents in orthopedic and cancer&#xD;
      postoperative patients following discharge from hospital. There have been no randomized&#xD;
      studies which have evaluated the use of extended postoperative VTE prophylaxis in IBD&#xD;
      patients. The purpose of this randomized placebo controlled pilot trial will be to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of postoperative VTE prophylaxis in IBD patients following abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. If this pilot trial demonstrates efficacy in reducing postoperative DVT and PE&#xD;
      rates, safety and feasibility, clinicians will be armed with the knowledge to pursue a larger&#xD;
      multicenter randomized trial with the intent of reducing overall morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      this high risk population.&#xD;
