  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is defined as any nausea, retching, or vomiting&#xD;
      occurring during the first 24-48 h after surgery in patients. PONV is one of the most common&#xD;
      causes of patient dissatisfaction after anesthesia, with reported incidences of 30% in all&#xD;
      post-surgical patients and up to 80% in high-risk patients. In addition, PONV is regularly&#xD;
      rated in preoperative surveys, as the anesthesia outcome the patient would most like to&#xD;
      avoid. While suture dehiscence, aspiration of gastric contents, esophageal rupture, and other&#xD;
      serious complications associated with PONV are rare, nausea and vomiting is still an&#xD;
      unpleasant and all-too-common postoperative morbidity that can delay patient discharge from&#xD;
      the post-anesthesia care unit and increase unanticipated hospital admissions in outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many well-established risk factors for PONV which are classified in two classes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Patient related risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Female gender is consistently the strongest risk factor for PONV, female patient are&#xD;
           three times more likely than men to suffer from PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For adult patient, age is a statistically, though not clinically, relevant risk factor,&#xD;
           with the incidence of PONV decreasing as patients age. For pediatric patients, however,&#xD;
           age increases the risk of post-operative vomiting (POV), such that children older than 3&#xD;
           years have been shown to have an increased risk of POV compared with children younger&#xD;
           than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obesity is a strong risk factor for PONV: patients with body mass index (BMI) more than&#xD;
           30 have the double risk of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-smoking status roughly doubles the patient's risk of PONV. The specific mechanism&#xD;
           underlying smoking's protective effect is unknown ,but one of the most commonly believed&#xD;
           theories is that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke induce cytochrome&#xD;
           P450 enzyme which increase the metabolism of emetogenic volatile anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of gastrointestinal disease as gastritis, gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer&#xD;
           increases the risk for PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. History of motion sickness, Meniere's disease or previous PONV indicates a general&#xD;
           susceptibility to PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Anesthesia related risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of volatile anesthetics is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of&#xD;
           PONV, with risk increasing in a dose dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative and postoperative opioid use increases the risk of PONV in a dose&#xD;
           dependent manner by the mechanism of reducing muscle tone and peristaltic activity,&#xD;
           thereby delaying gastric emptying, inducing distention, and triggering the vomiting&#xD;
           reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The duration of anesthesia can help predict the patient's risk of PONV, since the&#xD;
           duration of anesthesia describes the patient's exposure to emetogenic stimuli like&#xD;
           volatile anesthetics and intraoperative opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-emetic drugs used to treat PONV:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first line is classified into three classes: serotonin antagonists (e.g.&#xD;
           ondansetron), corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), and dopamine antagonists (e.g.&#xD;
           droperidol) have similar efficacy against PONV, with a relative risk reduction of about&#xD;
           25%. Moreover, they act independently and when used in combination, have&#xD;
           additiveeffects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dexamethasone : it can be effective in preventing PONV in adults and children. Compared&#xD;
           with other operative medications, dexamethasone has equal or even better efficacy in&#xD;
           reducing the incidence of PONV and has the advantages of low cost and longer&#xD;
           effectiveness as well. The mechanism of the antiemetic action of dexamethasone is still&#xD;
           not clearly known. Glucocorticoids receptors are found in nucleus of the solitary tract,&#xD;
           the raphe nucleus and the area postrema and all are associated with regulating nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting. Dexamethasone may affect PONV by modulating neurotransmission or receptor&#xD;
           density in these nuclei. Clinically, dexamethasone as a preventive drug against PONV has&#xD;
           not caused fatal outcome; therefore, it is generally considered to be an effective and&#xD;
           safe anti-emetic. Nevertheless, its use in this regard may lead to adverse effects,&#xD;
           principally postoperative hyperglycemia and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second line is Cyclizine: a histamine H1 antagonist given by mouth or parenterally&#xD;
           for control of postoperative and drug-induced nausea and vomiting and in motion&#xD;
           sickness. additionally, it has been used in management of vertigo in diseases affecting&#xD;
           the vestibular apparatus. Although the mechanism by which cyclizine exerts its&#xD;
           antiemetic and antivertigo effects has not been fully elucidated, its central&#xD;
           anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. It also possesses anticholinergic,&#xD;
           antihistaminic, central nervous system depressant and local anesthetic effects.&#xD;
           cyclizine is metabolized to its N-demethylated derivative , norcyclizine , which has&#xD;
           little antihistaminic activity compared to cyclizine.&#xD;
