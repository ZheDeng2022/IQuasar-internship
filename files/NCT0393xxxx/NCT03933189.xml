    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of physical therapy (PT) for individuals who are survivors&#xD;
      of trauma (SOT) and have chronic pain. While much has been studied about the psychological&#xD;
      effects and treatment of trauma, little is known about the PT management of chronic pain and&#xD;
      loss of function SOT experience. With over 24 million people in the U.S. suffering from&#xD;
      chronic pain there are potentially high numbers of individuals living with resultant&#xD;
      disability associated with that pain. Physical therapists are well versed in treating pain&#xD;
      and restoring function. However, choice of PT can vary based on therapist years of experience&#xD;
      and type or lack of PT specialization. Physical therapy has traditionally focused on a&#xD;
      bio-medical (BIOM) approach. Some believe that the BIOM approach is ineffective in reducing&#xD;
      chronic pain and functional loss, and that PT requires a biopsychosocial (BPS) approach,&#xD;
      targeting central nervous system changes that occur with chronic pain. Pain education (PE)&#xD;
      and Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) are PT interventions thought to address these brain changes,&#xD;
      and are used by physical therapists to treat patients with phantom limb pain and Complex&#xD;
      Regional Pain Syndrome. Most of the studies examining the effects of GMI and PE have&#xD;
      methodological issues. Exercise is another common PT treatment and is beneficial in promoting&#xD;
      improved function and decreasing disability for many conditions. Although PTs in clinical&#xD;
      practice can offer all of these modalities, there is little high quality evidence to support&#xD;
      the choice among them. This study will compare two varieties of PT: BIOM-based versus&#xD;
      BPS-based care. Individuals with chronic pain who are referred to PT by their primary care&#xD;
      provider or self-referred will be screened for trauma history by the PI. SOT who are seen at&#xD;
      a community psychology center who experience chronic pain and disability will be referred to&#xD;
      PT. Upon referral, SOT who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate. SOT&#xD;
      who consent to the study will be randomized to either the BIOM-based or the BPS-based group.&#xD;
      All participants will undergo baseline assessment. Participants will complete 6 one-hour PT&#xD;
      sessions once a week following their randomly assigned plan. All baseline measures will be&#xD;
      repeated by the blinded assessor after the 6th visit; scores will be assessed to determine if&#xD;
      there is a difference in the change in functional outcomes between the BIOM- and BPS-based&#xD;
      groups after completion of the 6 PT sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two usual PT programs to determine if one is more&#xD;
      effective than the other in reducing disability and pain in individuals who are survivors of&#xD;
      physical and or emotional trauma. Numerous studies have assessed the mental health issues of&#xD;
      SOT and the psychological interventions used to address these issues, but there has been&#xD;
      little research on interventions that address the somatic pain and disability complaints in&#xD;
      SOT in spite of the fact that 78-83% of survivors report chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is large variability in physical therapy management of painful conditions, representing&#xD;
      an opportunity to improve patient care and outcomes. Choice of physical therapy intervention&#xD;
      can vary based on the individual therapist's years of experience or type of PT practice&#xD;
      specialization, or lack of specialization. The biomedical model (BIOM) of physical therapy&#xD;
      (PT) management addresses pain problems by targeting treatment towards the physiologic&#xD;
      structures or tissues in the region where the patient is reporting the pain sensations. This&#xD;
      model follows the premise that pain is due to tissue damage and localized inflammation due to&#xD;
      faulty biomechanics and movement patterns, injury, disease or disuse. The Academy of&#xD;
      Orthopedic Physical Therapists Low Back Pain Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend manual&#xD;
      therapy, targeted spine strengthening, endurance and flexibility exercises to treat patients&#xD;
      with acute, sub-acute, and chronic back pain, and follows this BIOM approach. Additionally,&#xD;
      there are a variety of exercise methods and manual therapies touted by practitioners leading&#xD;
      to heterogeneous interventions given for similar patient conditions. A 2014 study compared&#xD;
      the outcomes of two different types of targeted spine interventions for the treatment of low&#xD;
      back pain, and found the results to be equivocal, with approximately half the subjects in&#xD;
      each treatment group demonstrating significant improvement. A biopsychosocial (BPS) PT&#xD;
      approach of pain neuroscience education, Graded Motor Imagery and general conditioning&#xD;
      exercises encompassing the health and skill related components of fitness has also been found&#xD;
      to reduce pain and improve function in patients with chronic low back pain, in patients with&#xD;
      complex regional pain syndrome and in patients with phantom limb pain. These conditions&#xD;
      involve central brain changes due to the experience of chronic pain; pain neuroscience&#xD;
      education and Graded Motor Imagery are purported to address these central changes. These&#xD;
      studies, however, had methodologic issues, such as lack of a control group or small sample&#xD;
      sizes. Exercise helps address the fear avoidance component of chronic low back pain, and&#xD;
      helps to improve strength, endurance and tolerance for daily functional activities.&#xD;
      Furthermore, pain education was found to decrease pain and improve function in SOT in a small&#xD;
      pilot study. Patient education is a major component of any PT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few small studies that have examined the effects of a BPS approach with promising&#xD;
      results for specific chronic pain conditions, and there are studies that support the BIOM&#xD;
      approach in treating musculoskeletal pain conditions but BPS- and BIOM-based treatments have&#xD;
      not previously been compared in a large randomized controlled trial, nor described in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic pain in STT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have sought to determine PT methods that are most beneficial in reducing chronic&#xD;
      pain and disability, but studies to date have been inconclusive. The investigators objective&#xD;
      is to compare the BIOM and BSP methods of PT to identify best treatment for individuals who&#xD;
      have experienced physical and/or emotional trauma and have resultant disabling chronic pain&#xD;
      due to this trauma. Findings from this work could help physical therapists provide targeted,&#xD;
      effective treatment to help ameliorate the effects of chronic pain and disability in this&#xD;
      population. With 78-83% of SOT living with chronic pain, the study findings will help&#xD;
      therapists choose appropriate interventions to achieve optimal patient outcomes.&#xD;
