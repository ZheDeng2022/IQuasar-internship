    <description>Dose escalation trial evaluating OKI-179 given orally on a daily basis. Patients will take OKI-179 orally (PO) on Days 1 - 4, 8 - 11 and 15 - 18 in 21-day cycles (± 3 days), under fasted conditions. The design is a modified 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose and allows for additional cohorts enrolling subjects with an alternative dosing schedule such as OKI-179 orally (PO) daily on Days 1 - 5, 8 - 12 and 15 - 19 per 21-day cycles or Days 1 - 21 per 21-day cycles to determine the maximum tolerated dose for continuous daily dosing.</description>

             (mean of the triplicate ECG measurements), with the exception for patients with an&#xD;
             atrioventricular pacemaker or other conditions (e.g., right bundle branch block) that&#xD;
             render the QT measurement invalid.&#xD;
