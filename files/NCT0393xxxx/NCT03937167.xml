  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has reached pandemic proportions in recent years, affecting not only the physical&#xD;
      health, but also the mental health, of obese people. According to Spain's National Health&#xD;
      Survey 2011-12, the prevalence of obesity in the adult population of Spain was 17%, having&#xD;
      increased by 2.5% since 2006. Therefore, a constant and worrying increase in the prevalence&#xD;
      of obesity is being observed, which is having a great impact, both individually, in terms of&#xD;
      health and quality of life, and socially, inter alia, by raising health expenditure due to&#xD;
      increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the desirability of a comprehensive approach that includes psychological&#xD;
      intervention in attending obese patients (Rev Cochrane, 2006), has been given greater&#xD;
      prominence. Paying attention to the emotional and psychopathological aspects related to&#xD;
      obesity has proven to be an action that could have positive impact on obesity intervention&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to measure, through a clinical trial, the efficacy of a&#xD;
      psychotherapy group program for obesity patients who are attended by the consulting&#xD;
      endocrinologist at the Infanta Leonor Hospital (Madrid). The impact of body mass index,&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing, psychopathology and quality of life of two experimental study groups&#xD;
      will be compared, one a control group of patients that follows the standard treatment, the&#xD;
      other an experimental group that follows not only the standard treatment, but also the&#xD;
      psychotherapy group intervention program.&#xD;
