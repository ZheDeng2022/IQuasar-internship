  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT of the brain, is&#xD;
      able to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumor progression in cases where MRI is&#xD;
      inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-fluciclovine is an FDA approved radioactive diagnostic agent and is injected into the&#xD;
      participant and then taken up by cancer cells, which can then be visualized with a PET/CT&#xD;
      scan. 18F-fluciclovine is FDA approved for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer, but is&#xD;
      still investigational for the purposes of this study.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the accuracy of 18F-fluciclovine PET in&#xD;
      distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor progression. Accuracy will be assessed via&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, as well as by calculating sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are to assess which factors may influence accuracy of&#xD;
      18Ffluciclovine PET in distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor progression and to&#xD;
      compare the accuracy of each of the qualitative and quantitative metrics.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received prior intracranial SRS at least once for brain metastases.&#xD;
             Prior WBRT is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have had a clinical tumor protocol MRI of the brain including a DSC-MR&#xD;
             perfusion sequence, which is equivocal for radiation necrosis versus tumor progression&#xD;
             within 30 days of treatment scan. &quot;Equivocal&quot; will be defined as being inconclusive&#xD;
             for radiation necrosis versus tumor progression as determined by the study&#xD;
             neuroradiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physician assessed life expectancy of ≥ 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of&#xD;
             registration is required.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have experienced a prior anaphylaxis reaction to 18Ffluciclovine are not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Females pregnant at the expected time of 18F-fluciclovine administration are not&#xD;
             eligible due to potential harm to the fetus from exposure to radiation. Women who&#xD;
             could be pregnant require a negative pregnancy test to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are breast feeding at the expected time of 18F-fluciclovine administration&#xD;
             are not eligible due to potential harm to the infant from exposure to radiation.&#xD;

          -  Subjects contraindicated for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with study requirements are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illness or psychiatric impairments, which in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             will prevent completion of protocol therapy and/or preclude informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastases from primary lymphoma, germ cell tumor, or small cell carcinoma.&#xD;
