  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of scoring models used in delirium prediction in patients&#xD;
      applying to intensive care unit. The diagnosis of delirium is based on the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The aim of this study is determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of three prediction models (Delirium prediction model for ICU patients version 1&#xD;
      [Predeliric version-1], Delirium prediction model for ICU patients version 2 [Predeliric&#xD;
      version-2] and Early prediction model for delirium in ICU patients [E-Predeliric]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are entered delirium during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Delirium; has been reported that it is associated with significant side effects such as&#xD;
      prolonged stay in hospital and intensive care unit, increased morbidity and mortality and&#xD;
      high costs. For evaluating delirium in intensive care units; There are several assessment&#xD;
      tools such as the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist(ICDSC) etc. The ICDSC checklist&#xD;
      is an eight-item screening tool that is based on DSM criteria and applied with data that can&#xD;
      be collected through medical records. Its validity has been confirmed by several studies.&#xD;
      Assessment tools such as ICDSC; can diagnose after patient is entered the delirium and&#xD;
      therefore cannot provide early treatment and preventive measures. Prevention of delirium is&#xD;
      more important than the correct treatment of delirium. For preventing delirium; early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Pre-deliric (DELIRIUM PREDICTION MODEL FOR INTENSIVE&#xD;
      CARE PATIENTS) and E-pre-deliric (EARLY PREDICTION MODEL FOR DELIRIUM IN ICU PATIENTS)&#xD;
      prediction models; are developed and approved for delirium estimation in intensive care unit&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the patient in the first 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit are&#xD;
      collected and the delirium prediction score is found by the pre-deliric model. In the&#xD;
      e-pre-deliric model, delirium prediction score is determined by inputting the data of the&#xD;
      patient in admission to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study; the definition of delirium was done by ICDSC scoring. Patients with an ICDSC&#xD;
      score of 4 and over were diagnosed with delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study; To determine the sensitivity and specificity of E-pre-deliric and&#xD;
      Pre-deliric scores by comparing the effectiveness of ICDSC, E-pre-deliric, Pre-deliric&#xD;
      version-1 and Pre-deliric version-2 assessment tools in the prediction of delirium.&#xD;
