  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical study. It developed&#xD;
      an innovative Tai Chi Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (TCCRP) for patients with chronic&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (CCS) and evaluated the efficacy, acceptability and safety of TCCRP on&#xD;
      patients with CCS in order to explore the possible mechanism of its feasibility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial of 100&#xD;
      participants with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) that compares Tai Chi cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (TCCRP) with conventional exercise rehabilitation programs (CERP),&#xD;
      with an allocation ratio of 1:1. A total of 6 months study period, including 1 month&#xD;
      in-hospital rehabilitation, 2 months home-based rehabilitation and 3 months follow-up. The&#xD;
      main outcome indicators were measured at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures will be measured at baseline and at 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Chinese Perceived Stress Scale is a self-rated questionnaire, which assesses perceived stress. Chinese Perceived Stress Scale is consisted of 14 items, which are divided into two dimensions: sense of tension and loss of control. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stress，lower scores indicate lower levels of stress. Chinese Perceived Stress Scale will be evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Locomotor skills</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline，3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Locomotor skills includes handgrip strength, balance and flexibility. Handgrip strength, which is used to determine the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles, will be measured using the handgrip strength dynamometer produced by CAMRY (product type EH101). The best result from repeated tests of each hand will be recorded. The balance test mainly includes standing on one foot with eyes closed, standing on one foot with eyes open, standing in situ with closed eyes and so on. Flexibility will be measured by seated forward flexion test. Locomotor skills will be evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 3-month intervention.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) is a 7-item self-report measure. The GAD-7 asks how often participants have been bothered by anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale indicating symptom frequency, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating GAD. According to the original authors, the total score can then be interpreted as indicating no/minimal anxiety (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), or severe (15-21), with a reasonable cut-off value for identifying cases of GAD at 10 points. GAD-7 will be evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 3-month intervention.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is designed for use with adults in assessing and monitoring depression severity based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.;DSM-IV); The PHQ-9 asks clients to check off the number of days they have been bothered by each of the PHQ-9 symptoms over the&quot;last two weeks.&quot; The nine items, based on DSM criteria for diagnosis of depression, are used to generate scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot;. The higher the score, the more serious the depression. PHQ-9 will be evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 3-month intervention.</description>
