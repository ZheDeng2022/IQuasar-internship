  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will characterize baseline antibiotic prescribing practices throughout the&#xD;
      Intermountain Healthcare Urgent Care (IH UC) system and implement a bundle of stewardship&#xD;
      interventions throughout the IH UC system with the intention of both scalability across a&#xD;
      large number of sites and sustainability. The urgent care (UC) antibiotic stewardship&#xD;
      intervention was designed to meet the unique challenges of UC providers and patients and will&#xD;
      directly incorporate all Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leadership Commitment. Improving the use of antibiotics is a priority for IH leaders. IH&#xD;
      leaders created two new system-wide leadership roles to direct antibiotic stewardship efforts&#xD;
      across IH's continuum of care: Dr. Eddie Stenehjem is the system's Antimicrobial Stewardship&#xD;
      Medical Director and Dr. Whitney Buckel is IH's Antimicrobial Stewardship Pharmacy Manager.&#xD;
      Drs. Stenehjem and Buckel direct and lead all inpatient and outpatient stewardship efforts&#xD;
      across the system. The creation of a system-wide antimicrobial stewardship leadership&#xD;
      structure demonstrates the IH commitment to deploy best practices in antibiotic stewardship&#xD;
      across the healthcare system. IH has designated a new system-wide outpatient stewardship&#xD;
      leadership position that serves as a direct liaison between UC leadership (Medical Directors&#xD;
      and Associate Medical Directors), participating UC facilities, and antibiotic stewardship&#xD;
      leadership. The outpatient stewardship leader will participate in education efforts around&#xD;
      appropriate antibiotic use and will work closely with prescribers that have been identified&#xD;
      to have high rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and/or high rates of sinusitis/AOM&#xD;
      diagnoses. Additionally, the Medical Director for UC has designated antibiotic prescribing as&#xD;
      one of only two quality metrics that will be assessed longitudinally for UC clinicians across&#xD;
      the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action for Policy and Practice. Our bundle of stewardship interventions is based on prior&#xD;
      evidence of effectiveness and the unique features of UC sites. Additionally, our bundle&#xD;
      allows for adaptability based on knowledge gained from the qualitative components of the&#xD;
      proposal described previously and the experiences gained throughout implementation. An&#xD;
      essential component to our bundle will be the implementation of tools that are designed to&#xD;
      improve the quality and efficiency of care provided in UC settings. The action elements of&#xD;
      our intervention will include the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Commitment Posters: All UC clinics will display commitment posters demonstrating support&#xD;
           from corporate, infectious diseases, and urgent care leaders and signed by providers.&#xD;
           These posters will be in the clinic waiting room attesting to the providers' commitment&#xD;
           to judicious antibiotic prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EHR Tools: With the input of our frontline clinicians and assistance of our internal EHR&#xD;
           developers, the study team has created electronic clinical decision support tools within&#xD;
           our EHR to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute bacterial sinusitis and acute otitis&#xD;
           media (AOM). This tool will improve efficiency of clinical documentation, improve&#xD;
           diagnostic accuracy by embedding the required diagnostic elements of upper respiratory&#xD;
           infections, provide quick access to patient education material, and facilitate the&#xD;
           ordering of a guideline concordant antibiotic prescription. This tool also incorporates&#xD;
           delayed antibiotic prescriptions, which is our new default prescribing method for AOM&#xD;
           and sinusitis. The delayed antibiotic prescription order was specifically developed for&#xD;
           this intervention to assist in tracking delayed prescribing. These tools will be&#xD;
           tailored with help from our frontline caregivers and piloted at a small sampling of UC&#xD;
           clinics prior to widespread implementation. The tools are expected to be of special&#xD;
           interest for UC clinicians because they target the most common diagnoses associated with&#xD;
           antibiotic prescribing, have the potential to enhance efficiency with documentation, and&#xD;
           facilitate appropriate antibiotic selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prescription Justification: Azithromycin is 2nd most common antibiotic prescribed in the&#xD;
           IH outpatient network. However, azithromycin prescriptions are rarely appropriate in UC.&#xD;
           Besides a few relatively uncommon ID conditions (e.g., mycobacterial infections),&#xD;
           azithromycin is only recommended for community acquired pneumonia, gonorrhea and&#xD;
           chlamydia, and Streptococcal pharyngitis with a penicillin allergy. However, in the IH&#xD;
           outpatient population, it is the most common antibiotic used for acute bronchitis and&#xD;
           cough, 5th most common for sinusitis, and 2nd most common antibiotic given for&#xD;
           unspecified acute pharyngitis. Given the very high rates of azithromycin misuse,&#xD;
           providers will now be required to justify their ordering of azithromycin with&#xD;
           documentation. When azithromycin is ordered, the provider will be required to fill out&#xD;
           an &quot;azithromycin justification form&quot; prior to having the order signed. The justification&#xD;
           form will populate the medical record and display the indication for the antibiotic that&#xD;
           was selected by the provider. This method of &quot;accountable justification&quot; is an effective&#xD;
           method to reduce antibiotic overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracking and Reporting. Using IH data analysts to access the Enterprise Data Warehouse,&#xD;
      system level, facility level, and provider level reports have been developed to detail&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing practices. During the first 4 months of the baseline period, feedback&#xD;
      from urgent care clinicians and leaders was generated on the design of the reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual provider reports will focus on the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of antibiotics prescribed for respiratory encounter visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent of sinusitis, pharyngitis, and AOM (respiratory, tier 2) encounters that&#xD;
           received an order for appropriate first-line antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent of sinusitis and AOM visits receiving a delayed antibiotic prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent of Tier 3 respiratory encounters in which an antibiotic was prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis rate of sinusitis (adults) and AOM (children)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the above reported elements will include the providers' data along with comparison&#xD;
      data for the individual facility and the UC type (i.e., InstaCare or KidsCare). These data&#xD;
      will be available via an antibiotic stewardship dashboard that individual clinicians may&#xD;
      access anytime. The dashboard will be fully transparent (all providers data will be displayed&#xD;
      without blinding of names/locations) and include other antibiotic prescribing data (e.g. most&#xD;
      common antibiotics used, duration of therapy, etc.) The study team and the outpatient&#xD;
      stewardship lead will be available to review data with individual providers as needed.&#xD;
      Throughout the study period the study team will receive feedback about the design and&#xD;
      usability of the monthly reports and dashboard and modifications can occur accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily huddles are a method to help teams focus on quality and safety. Huddle boards are&#xD;
      standardized visual tool a tool to help teams collaborate on and visualize the tasks and&#xD;
      operations of a group or clinic. All IH UC facilities now have dynamic huddle boards. IH&#xD;
      huddle boards highlight data and metrics surrounding our 5 Intermountain fundamentals of care&#xD;
      - stewardship, safety, quality, patient experience, and access. Prior to the start of each&#xD;
      clinic day, each clinic team reviews their huddle board and discusses any potential&#xD;
      foreseeable challenges. With our antibiotic stewardship intervention, weekly antibiotic&#xD;
      prescribing metrics will be posted to the quality section of each clinic's huddle board.&#xD;
      Antibiotic prescribing metrics may be presented monthly if insufficient volume is identified.&#xD;
      The clinical manager will be responsible for posting facility and provider metrics (obtained&#xD;
      from the online dashboard). An antibiotic stewardship leader (study leader, UC leader, or the&#xD;
      outpatient stewardship leader) will be present for the huddle board review intermittently to&#xD;
      review antibiotic prescribing metrics, answer questions from providers, discuss improvement&#xD;
      strategies, and promote judicious prescribing. The study team will develop a cadence in which&#xD;
      a stewardship leader will be present for each clinic's huddle board review with more contact&#xD;
      early in the intervention. Lastly, senior IH leaders will maintain oversight of this&#xD;
      initiative and receive quarterly executive-level formative reporting on program results using&#xD;
      the same structured data reports. Dr. Stenehjem and the UC leadership will be responsible for&#xD;
      the quarterly updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education and Expertise. Our UC focused stewardship intervention will incorporate several key&#xD;
      educational components for both providers and patients. For our UC providers, the study team&#xD;
      will conduct a presentation at each of the monthly regional meetings that outlines&#xD;
      appropriate antibiotic use and provides an overview of the UC stewardship initiative,&#xD;
      expectations, and interventions. Second, all UC providers will have their antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship metrics reviewed with them during their annual review by either the UC Medical&#xD;
      Director or Associate Medical Director. This will allow for focused education by UC leaders&#xD;
      directly to individual clinicians. Third, a quarterly newsletter and/or blog post will be&#xD;
      written and disseminated to all UC clinicians on topics relevant to appropriate antibiotic&#xD;
      prescribing. Fourth, clinic computer screen savers will be developed and implemented in all&#xD;
      UC sites highlighting key stewardship interventions. Lastly, clinical managers will be&#xD;
      provided with education to disseminate to their nursing staff and medical assistants to&#xD;
      ensure antibiotic stewardship messages are consistent throughout the clinic visit. UC&#xD;
      clinicians will continue to have the ongoing clinical support from the existing ID telehealth&#xD;
      program. The ID telehealth program operates an ID hotline that is available 24 hours a day, 7&#xD;
      day a week, allowing outpatient clinicians the ability to discuss complex cases with&#xD;
      physicians that have ID expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our patients will also be a target for an educational initiative. Currently, IH is involved&#xD;
      in a large opioid reduction campaign that has already reduced over 1 million tablets for&#xD;
      acute pain. This campaign consists of publicly facing messages raising awareness of opioid&#xD;
      use and instructing patients to talk with their provider about alternative pain control&#xD;
      options. The study team will initiate a similar antibiotic stewardship campaign running in&#xD;
      parallel with, and at times, in conjunction with the opioid messaging. Antibiotic stewardship&#xD;
      messaging will be posted at the entrance of and within Urgent Care sites. Similar messaging&#xD;
      will be run in parallel on IH social media sites and patient facing webpages. The study team&#xD;
      has also developed educational materials that can be given to patients during a provider&#xD;
      visit explaining in clear language why an antibiotic was not given and how a delayed&#xD;
      antibiotic prescription should be managed. The study team has also developed a checklist of&#xD;
      common over-the-counter symptomatic therapies for congestion, fever, and pain that will&#xD;
      assist the provider in instructing the patient on symptomatic therapies and assist the&#xD;
      patient on finding the appropriate medications at retail stores.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Intervention period is one year</time_frame>
    <description>As data availability allows, a secondary outcome of patient satisfaction will be measured at the patient encounter level in terms of a validated, patient satisfaction score. Patient satisfaction will be assessed using the &quot;rate your provider&quot; question. This question asks patients to rate their provider on a scale of 1 - 10 (1 being the worst, 10 being the best). Patient satisfaction scores will be explored in patients that receive antibiotics for tier 2 and 3 respiratory conditions and those that do not receive antibiotics for tier 2 and 3 respiratory conditions.</description>
