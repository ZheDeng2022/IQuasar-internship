      This study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra&#xD;
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the QPlus Cartridge in patients taking anitplatelet medication that&#xD;
      are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses&#xD;
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QPlus Cartridge was&#xD;
      developed to monitor hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. The&#xD;
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,&#xD;
      which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding six parameters that depict the&#xD;
      functional status of a patient's coagulation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-site, prospective, observational study will evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      Quantra System as compared to standard coagulation tests and comparable measures determined&#xD;
      using TEG in patients taking antiplatelet medication that are scheduled to undergo cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
