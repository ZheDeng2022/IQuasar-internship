  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A confirmatory dual-clinic, non-randomized study of the Inliant device to aid in dental&#xD;
      implant placement in humans. The hypothesis is that using the Inliant Surgical Navigation&#xD;
      System (&quot;Inliant&quot;) will provide a high degree of accuracy in multiple dimensions relative to&#xD;
      the ideal implant position as determined in the planning stage, and will not result in any&#xD;
      adverse outcomes related to use of the device. Five clinicians (Investigators) of various&#xD;
      clinical backgrounds and experience will use the Inliant device, a licensed, medical device&#xD;
      in Canada, to place a dental implant in a total of twenty (20) subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term success of dental implant therapy is largely dependent on proper implant&#xD;
      positioning in bone, and the facilitation of a well-functioning prosthesis. Surgical&#xD;
      complications from implant placement in an incorrect location can include damage to adjacent&#xD;
      teeth, sinus perforations, hemorrhage, buccal plate dehiscence, and nerve damage. In implant&#xD;
      therapy, dynamic surgical guidance is a new technology used to facilitate accurate and&#xD;
      efficient implant placement, and to aid in communication between the restorative dentist and&#xD;
      surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Inliant device is a dynamic surgical navigation system that is based on passive optical&#xD;
      tracking technology. Passive optical tracking is accomplished by having the patient wear a&#xD;
      reference body that is identified by an optical tracking system. This information allows the&#xD;
      clinician to visualize the surgical drill projected onto a screen, showing its position in 3&#xD;
      dimensions on a CBCT scan of the patient. Dynamic surgical guidance has additional advantages&#xD;
      over traditional methods in that it allows for intra-operative changes in implant planning,&#xD;
      and allows the clinician to visualize the position of the surgical drill during the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to analyze the accuracy of the Inliant device as a method&#xD;
      of placing dental implants in an actual clinical setting and to confirm its safety.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 22 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In good general health as evidenced by medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To provide attachment of the stent for each implant, there must be at least two&#xD;
             adjacent zero mobility teeth anywhere in the same arch on which the surgery is to be&#xD;
             performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A medical condition, psychological condition or dental condition that would exclude a&#xD;
             patient from having dental implant surgery. Example: inability to tolerate local&#xD;
             anesthesia or other dental disease conditions that would preclude dental implant&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of disallowed concomitant medications (only if a contraindication to dental&#xD;
             implant surgery. Examples include long term bisphosphonates, high dose blood thinners,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain a suitable pre-operative CBCT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In surgery, if there are clinical conditions that unexpectedly do not allow for the&#xD;
             placement of an implant, e.g. lack of primary stability during immediate placement.&#xD;
