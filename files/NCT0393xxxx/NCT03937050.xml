  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate a package of three interconnected educational/behavioural&#xD;
      interventions aimed at: a) improving knowledge and skills of GDM guidelines and skills of&#xD;
      health providers; b) raising awareness of importance of GDM screening among pregnant women&#xD;
      and their families; and c) improving confidence and skills in self-management among those&#xD;
      diagnosed with GDM. The interventions will be delivered through the medium of film as they&#xD;
      are low-cost and scalable, and are particularly suitable for people who are not very&#xD;
      literate, making them ideal for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be carried out in Uganda (Entebbe) and India (Bengaluru). A careful&#xD;
      contextual analysis will precede the development of a culturally-tailored film-based&#xD;
      intervention for each setting, which will be iteratively refined using qualitative research&#xD;
      methods till it is fit for purpose. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated&#xD;
      in independent cluster randomised trials, involving ~10,000 pregnant women across 30&#xD;
      maternity units at each site. The films will be made available in the intervention arm&#xD;
      facilities: for viewing by doctors and nurses at their meetings, for continual screening in&#xD;
      waiting areas of antenatal clinics, and during group education sessions (and personal mobile&#xD;
      use) for GDM patients. Where video/projection facilities are unavailable, small low-cost&#xD;
      projectors will be made available. Control arms will follow usual care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal research question is whether a low-cost educational/behavioural intervention&#xD;
      delivered through a package of culturally-tailored films can provide scalable improvements in&#xD;
      timely detection and management of GDM. This will be evaluated through assessing three&#xD;
      endpoints: a) detection of GDM at 32 weeks of; b) glycaemic control (fasting glucose) in&#xD;
      women with GDM at ~34 weeks of pregnancy; and c) adverse perinatal outcomes associated with&#xD;
      GDM. Interviews will be conducted with women and health providers to help understand how and&#xD;
      why the intervention may be (or may not be) successful. The ultimate aim of the project is to&#xD;
      contribute to scientific evidence underpinning the use of films in cost-effectively scaling&#xD;
      up behavioural interventions in low literacy settings.&#xD;

    <description>A package of three interconnected educational/behavioural film-based interventions will developed for delivery at the cluster (clinic) level. The aim of the three components will be as follows: a) improving knowledge of GDM guidelines and skills among health providers involved in GDM management, b) raising awareness of GDM and the importance of screening among pregnant women and their family members, and c) improving confidence and skills in self-management of GDM among women diagnosed.</description>

    <description>Three film-based components:&#xD;
Professional development of doctors and nurses to improve screening and management of GDM. Modules will cover knowledge and relevant clinical guidelines, skills for glucose monitoring and managing medication, specialist obstetric and neonatal care, and lifestyle counselling. These films will be screened 6-monthly at routine professional development meetings.&#xD;
Awareness-raising among pregnant women and family members regarding GDM and the importance of healthy lifestyles during pregnancy. The films will be culturally tailored and will be screened in waiting areas of antenatal clinics.&#xD;
Structured diabetes self-management education programme for women with GDM to empower them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage GDM successfully. The programme will incorporate behavioural counselling and educational reinforcement. Films will be screened at weekly group sessions and optimised for viewing on mobile devices.</description>
