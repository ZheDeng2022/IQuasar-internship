      Participants will be randomized to exercise intervention and control groups, for 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      participants will be examined for following test Mini mental state examination, Trail making&#xD;
      test A and B, MOCA. The intervention will consist of twice weekly, 55- 60 minute exercise&#xD;
      session for experimental group The participants of control group will receive 20 minutes&#xD;
      treadmill walk thrice weekly. Participants will walk at constant pace with zero inclination&#xD;
      such that a subjective rate of perceived of 5 to 7 points on the ten-point Borg scale will be&#xD;
      reached. Assessment of both groups will be done on first session and on last session.&#xD;

      Elderly, old person and senior citizen are all the terms generally used for geriatric&#xD;
      population. According to WHO, most developed countries have accepted the chronological age of&#xD;
      65 years as definition of elderly or older population which cannot be applied to developing&#xD;
      third world countries as the life expectancy is between 60 to 70 years. The United Nation&#xD;
      agreed cutoff is 60+ years to refer to old age. Adding to difficulty of defining actual birth&#xD;
      dates is often unknown in some areas because many people do not have official birth records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging is characterized by gradual irreversible changes in structure and function of an&#xD;
      individual that occur as a result of the passage of time. It is additionally subject to the&#xD;
      developments by which general public understands maturity. It is associated with declines in&#xD;
      different systems of body, resulting in an impaired capacity to perform daily activities&#xD;
      placing a large economic burden on society. Life of the elderly is characterized by a high&#xD;
      risk of multimorbidity accompanied by a high prevalence of cognitive impairment short of&#xD;
      dementia. A decline in cognitive abilities, such as perception, reasoning, and memory, is&#xD;
      part of the normal cognitive aging process. It is a process that is genetically defined and&#xD;
      environmentally modulated. In fact, advancing age is the major risk factor for a number of&#xD;
      chronic diseases in humans. A decrease in cognitive performance in older adults is&#xD;
      predominant in most individuals. During next 40 years, it is anticipated that there will be&#xD;
      an epidemic of dementia worldwide, with a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of prevalent&#xD;
      cases owing to longer life expectancies and demographic changes. Attention is turning toward&#xD;
      identification of preclinical disease and development of treatments to prevent or delay the&#xD;
      onset of dementia. Cognitive impairment is a health problem that almost concerns to every&#xD;
      second elderly person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is of evidence from epidemiological studies, experimental trials, and basic&#xD;
      neurosciences that suggesting that cognitive decline related to aging can be cut off by&#xD;
      different intellectual activities which makes you less prone to cognitive problems faced at&#xD;
      later ages. There is always a debate whether cognitive mental activities are more better or&#xD;
      physical activity is better solution for these age related cognitive decline .Some studies&#xD;
      showed that cognitive training is effective when cognitive skills are practiced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive decline due to aging leads to functional limitation and disability which leaves the&#xD;
      society with a huge economic burden. That is why, intervention and plan should be designed to&#xD;
      lessen this economic burden furthermore maintain and control epidemics like dementia and&#xD;
      other cognitive disorders. Physical activity has shown tremendous results in improving&#xD;
      cognition function in healthy older adults and as well as in older adults affected with&#xD;
      cognitive diseases and disorders. Evidence from epidemiological studies shows that physical&#xD;
      activity of high levels and for longer follow-ups showed better results in decreasing the&#xD;
      likelihood of developing cognitive impairments as compared to people with low levels of&#xD;
      physical activity .Therefore, it is hypothesized that physical activity plays an important&#xD;
      role in alleviating cognitive decline in older adults. Physical movement has been appeared to&#xD;
      have an intense up regulating impact on neurogenesis and to result in increased concentration&#xD;
      of brain derived neurotropic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite of the beneficial effects observed in cognitive outcomes with aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training in Previous studies aerobic exercise was associated with progress in neurocognitive&#xD;
      functions in older adults whether cognitive impairment is present or not . A study conducted&#xD;
      in 2012 reported significant improvements in memory domain and few other studies showed&#xD;
      significant improvements in executive function after following aerobic training protocol. But&#xD;
      there was lack of consistent evidence to show the beneficial effects of aerobic training on&#xD;
      cognition in elderly population. Many other researchers focused on resistive training&#xD;
      exercises for improving cognitive and memory functions.With advancement of time and&#xD;
      technology newer exercise techniques and modalities have been developed to maximize&#xD;
      functional capacities of older adults. In these days of development multi-component exercises&#xD;
      is a new combination of training exercise in which aerobic, resistance training is combined&#xD;
      with balance ,coordination, flexibility to decrease disability in older&#xD;
      adults.Multi-component is the most effective approach in addressing functional capacity in&#xD;
      frail older adults and limiting disability.Functional benefits of this exercise are well&#xD;
      established ,however evidence is less consistent regarding cognitive gains associated with&#xD;
      multi-component exercise training. A study reported that aerobic and resistance training&#xD;
      combined has better gains in working memory as compared to aerobic training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of literature review studies were conducted to determine the effects of&#xD;
      different types of physical activity on cognition of elderly people and in prevention of&#xD;
      decreasing cognitive levels in elderly people. The impact of exercises including aerobic&#xD;
      training, resistive training, aerobic training versus stretching, resistive training versus&#xD;
      stretching, resistive training with no intervention were previously examined however, results&#xD;
      were less clear and consistent.&#xD;
