      (TUV) on Tc 99m Planar Imaging&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Manocept Platform prospective, open-label, multicenter, single and repeat-dose&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of TUV assessments in HCs and&#xD;
      subjects with active RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is stratified into 3 arms. The first 2 arms, comprised of [1] disease-free HCs and&#xD;
      [2] clinically diagnosed RA subjects on stable treatment. The third arm is designed to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of TUV global in clinically diagnosed subjects with active RA..&#xD;

             Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Classification Criteria&#xD;
             (score of ≥ 6/10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) of ≥ 3.2 (includes the&#xD;
             Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR] test and Visual Analog Scale [VAS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects receiving traditional DMARDs must have been on therapy for ≥ 90 days and at a&#xD;
             stable dose for ≥ 30 days prior to the first imaging visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the subject is receiving bDMARD or janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy, they have&#xD;
             been at a stable dose &gt; 180 days prior to the first imaging visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;

             for &gt; 28 days prior to first imaging visit (Day 0). The corticosteroid dose must be ≤&#xD;
             10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent steroid dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ARM 3 (only): The subject is receiving anti-rheumatic treatment and is a candidate for&#xD;
             initiation of, or change to, a new anti-TNFα bDMARD treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. The subject has hepatic insufficiency as demonstrated by ALT (alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             [SGPT]) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase [SGOT]) greater than 3 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has any severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions and/or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions and/or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration that would deem the subject inappropriate for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has a known allergy to or has had an adverse reaction to dextran exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to the Tc 99m&#xD;
             tilmanocept administration (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has received intra-articular corticosteroid injections ≤ 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the first imaging visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
