    <measure>Part 1 Single Day (SD) Dose: Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Weeks post final dose</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs are adverse events (AEs) which will occur up to 24 Weeks that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Has an active systemic or GI acute or chronic infection as determined by appropriate&#xD;
             clinical screening and laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, has a positive serum pregnancy test at screening, a positive urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test at admission, or is lactating prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active cigarette smoker or has quit cigarette smoking within the previous 6 months&#xD;
