      Overall Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of investigating bilateral&#xD;
      continuous erector spinae blocks (BESB) for postoperative pain management in a small cohort&#xD;
      of children undergoing surgical sternotomy prior to planning an appropriately powered,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators' primary hypothesis is that utilizing bilateral erector spinae&#xD;
      blocks for post-sternotomy pain is a feasible intervention for consideration in a larger&#xD;
      trial by demonstrating a 75% or greater successful intervention completion rate without any&#xD;
      major adverse outcomes.&#xD;

      Regional anesthesia-and pediatric regional anesthesia in particular-is a rapidly evolving&#xD;
      subfield of anesthesia practice driven with considerable urgency by the growing recognition&#xD;
      that even appropriate perioperative narcotic administration can have significant derogatory&#xD;
      long-term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthetics can provide targeted, continuous analgesia to select dermatomes with&#xD;
      minimal additional patient risk and as such have become routine components of opioid-sparing&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative pain management plans for surgical patients at BCH. In&#xD;
      addition to the postulated benefit of reducing overall opioid exposure and potentially&#xD;
      reducing the risk for long term physiologic and behavioral dependence upon opioids, regional&#xD;
      anesthetics may allow for earlier extubation after selected surgeries, shorter ICU, PACU and&#xD;
      inpatient admissions, earlier mobilization, fewer gastrointestinal complications, and&#xD;
      improved patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a robust literature supporting the safety and efficacy of regional anesthesia for&#xD;
      postoperative pain control across a broad range or surgery types, patient demographics and&#xD;
      underlying comorbidities, there are certain classes of surgeries that have (to date) not&#xD;
      benefitted from the advantages that regional anesthetics may provide, most notably spine&#xD;
      surgery and cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns have been expressed with regard to regional anesthetics for cardiac surgeries in&#xD;
      particular (this being the primary surgical type associated with sternotomies in a pediatric&#xD;
      populations), given that most patients are pharmacologically anticoagulated to some extent&#xD;
      during their procedures and are thus at increased risk for bleeding. This is further&#xD;
      complicated in the pediatric cardiac surgical population as many of these children are&#xD;
      intubated for an extended period of time and therefore may not have particularly reliable&#xD;
      neurological exams in the setting of neuraxial regional anesthetics-potentially resulting in&#xD;
      unrecognized acquired neurological defecits. While there is emerging evidence of improved&#xD;
      outcomes with neuraxial regional anesthetics in adult cardiac surgery patients, this has not&#xD;
      trickled down to the pediatric population, likely for some of these reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators at BCH are fortunate to have one of the largest concentrated pediatric&#xD;
      cardiac surgical populations in the US along with an active, and well organized regional&#xD;
      anesthesia service. Because of this, the investigators are in a unique position to more&#xD;
      thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and safety of regional anesthetics in children&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery. Furthermore it is thought to be critical that institutions such as&#xD;
      BCH take a leading role in documenting the effects of regional anesthesia on the most&#xD;
      important outcome measures when considering perioperative medicine. These include: overall&#xD;
      pain management, surgical healing, functional recovery, long term pain symptoms, and&#xD;
      emotional/behavioral outcomes after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the erector spinae block (ESB) has become popular for providing analgesia after a&#xD;
      number of anterior chest and abdominal procedures. This is a simple interfascial plane block&#xD;
      that can reliably provide unilateral chest and/or abdominal wall analgesia. It has been&#xD;
      described in numerous case reports and one case series as an effective block for management&#xD;
      of unilateral thoracotomies, unilateral rib fractures, unilateral abdominal incisions and&#xD;
      most notably, when used bilaterally, for management of post-sternotomy pain. New case reports&#xD;
      and series involving the ESB are being published almost weekly at this point with a growing&#xD;
      literature specific to cardiac surgical applications. Indeed a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      investigate the analgesic efficacy of bilateral erector spinae plane (BESP) blocks compared&#xD;
      with conventional treatment for pain after cardiac surgery in adult patients was published&#xD;
      recently (2018) with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an interfascial plane block in a compressible anatomical space, the ESB is thought to be&#xD;
      safe in anticoagulated (or recently anticoagulated) patients. It is fast becoming a preferred&#xD;
      anesthetic option for these pharmacologically or otherwise coagulopathic patients as opposed&#xD;
      to neuraxial (e.g. epidural) and paraneuraxial blocks (i.e. paravertebral) nerve blocks,&#xD;
      which are largely contraindicated in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ESB's potentially favorable risk profile versus the other blocks that would&#xD;
      subserve the same dermatomes (i.e. it is technically less challenging, more distant from&#xD;
      critical structures, and thought to be safe in anticoagulated patients) it could provide both&#xD;
      a safer and easier to perform regional anesthesia option for many patients. In particular, it&#xD;
      offers a new option for a subset of anticoagulated patients for whom other regional&#xD;
      techniques (epidural, paravertebral) are contraindicated. This is particularly true for the&#xD;
      populations of pediatric cardiac surgical patients at BCH if used bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, given the current information available related to the ESB, the regional anesthesia&#xD;
      service at BCH has begun employing it when possible in circumstances when a neuraxial or&#xD;
      paravertebral block(s) would commonly be used but is/are relatively or absolutely&#xD;
      contraindicated. Patients undergoing thoracotomies while anticoagulated for cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass, aortic clamping, etc. have been successfully managed with unilateral continuous ESBs.&#xD;
      In addition, thoracotomies in patients with acquired (e.g. dilutional) and other pathologic&#xD;
      coagulopathies have been managed with ESBs. As such, the ESB has been adopted for routine use&#xD;
      in specific patient populations at BCH and has even occasionally been utilized in lieu of the&#xD;
      more longstanding routine PVBs or epidural blocks for patients without contraindication for&#xD;
      such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective review of BCH outcomes data for 67 ESBs done for a variety of surgeries and&#xD;
      populations has not revealed any significant differences between PVBs and ESBs in terms of&#xD;
      adverse events, postoperative opiate use, median pain scores, or other standard outcomes&#xD;
      measures. As this data is observational in nature, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions&#xD;
      as to the efficacy of the two blocks. However, since there are distinct known and described&#xD;
      advantages associated with regional anesthetics for postoperative pain management, it would&#xD;
      be prudent to evaluate these blocks in a controlled, randomized, trial. Prior to such a&#xD;
      trial, a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of such a trial is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of investigating bilateral&#xD;
      continuous erector spinae blocks (BESB) for patients undergoing surgical sternotomy by means&#xD;
      of a pilot study. For this study, 'feasibility' will be defined primarily as a successful&#xD;
      intervention completion rate of 75% or greater of all subjects with no major adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Secondary measures of feasibility will include aggregate 'data integrity' as&#xD;
      defined by successful collection of 75% or greater of all possible data points for&#xD;
      successfully completed subjects as well as 'efficient intervention duration' as evaluated by&#xD;
      intervention completion time being less than 40 minutes.&#xD;

Patients will have access to rescue opiates as needed by means of the standard PCA/NCA demand protocols utilized at BCH.&#xD;
Ropivacaine: Erector spinae blocks: T4/5 transverse process is identified with the ultrasound transducer in a parasagittal orientation; the needle tip is advanced until it contacts the transverse process, just below the erector spinae muscle complex; the erector spinae muscle is visualized to be elevated up off of the transverse process with normal saline injection. Following a bolus injection of 2ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine, a catheter is threaded into the space occupied by the local anesthetic bolus. Repeated on contralateral side.</description>
