    <textblock>
      A partially blinded randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of Triple ACTs artemether-lumefantrine + amodiaquine (AL+AQ) and&#xD;
      artesunate- mefloquine+piperaquine (AS-MQ+PPQ) with the ACTs artemether-lumefantrine +&#xD;
      placebo (AL+PBO) and artesunate- mefloquine + placebo (AS-MQ+PBO) (with single-low dose&#xD;
      primaquine in some sites) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria to&#xD;
      assess and compare their efficacy, safety, tolerability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to up to four arms: artemether-lumefantrine + amodiaquine,&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine + placebo, artesunate-mefloquine + piperaquine and&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine + placebo. As a contingency measure in case of significant differences&#xD;
      in the efficacy or safety of one of the combinations being tested and/or study drug expiry or&#xD;
      unavailability, subjects may be randomised to 2 arms with a matching ACT-TACT pair, i.e.,&#xD;
      with artemether-lumefantrine + placebo or artemether-lumefantrine + amodiaquine OR&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine + placebo or artesunate-mefloquine + piperaquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some sites may randomize between 2 arms only with matching ACT-TACT pairs, i.e.,&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine + placebo or artemether-lumefantrine + amodiaquine OR&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine + placebo or artesunate-mefloquine + piperaquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arms, the ACT will be co-packed with a matched (appearance) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lower transmission settings (Annual Parasite Incidence &lt;50 per 1000 population per year)&#xD;
      the treatment will include a single 0.25 mg/kg gametocytocidal dose of primaquine as&#xD;
      recommended by the WHO for children ≥10 kg. All drug administrations will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated in an in-patient unit for 3 days and followed up weekly up to D63.&#xD;
      Microscopy to detect and quantify malaria parasitaemia will be performed daily (more&#xD;
      frequently in patients with parasite density of &gt;5000/µL at inclusion) during&#xD;
      hospitalization, at all weekly and unscheduled visits. A physical examination and&#xD;
      measurements of vital signs along with a symptom questionnaire for tolerability will be&#xD;
      performed and recorded through a standardized method at baseline, daily during admission and&#xD;
      weekly during follow up through D42 and at all unscheduled visits. Physical exam, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements and assessments of symptoms will be performed on D49, D56, and D63 only for&#xD;
      patients who are parasitaemic or those who report fever or other symptoms.&#xD;
      Electrocardiographs will be performed during admission (H0, H4, H52, or H64) and day 42 of&#xD;
      follow up to assess and compare the effect of ACTs and TACTs antimalarials on QT or&#xD;
      QTc-intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DeTACT-ASIA Trial is funded by UK Aid from the UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth and&#xD;
      Development Office (FCDO). The FCDO project number is 300341-114.&#xD;
