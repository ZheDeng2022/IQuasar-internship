  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is a new entity in the world of respiratory ailments. The&#xD;
      respiratory tract of these patients are continuously exposed to oxidants (due to cigarette&#xD;
      smoking) causing oxidative stress. Antioxidant enzymes such as, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#xD;
      and catalase (CAT) neutralize these oxidants or free radicals and transform them into safer.&#xD;
      Vitamin D is a natural antioxidant which has few evidence of increasing antioxidant enzyme&#xD;
      level in COPD and asthma, but not in ACO patients. To evaluate the effects of vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation on antioxidant enzymes level in vitamin D3 deficient patients with stable&#xD;
      ACO. The randomized controlled trial was conducted in Department of Physiology Bangabandhu&#xD;
      Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Shahbag, Dhaka from March 2018 to February 2019. For&#xD;
      this study, a total number of 40 vitamin D3 deficient (serum 25 hydroxycholecalceferol &lt;30&#xD;
      ng/ml) male, stable (diagnosed patient, who was not experienced any acute exacerbation,&#xD;
      hospitalization, urgent care visits or changes in routine medication within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
      study) patients with ACO of age ≥40 years was selected from the Out Patient Department (OPD)&#xD;
      of the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH) and randomly grouped as A&#xD;
      (control) and B (study). Then serum Superoxide dismutase and Catalase level of all the&#xD;
      patients was assessed. Along with the standard pharmacological treatment of ACO (according to&#xD;
      GOLD criteria), oral vitamin D3 (80,000 IU per week) will be supplied to the patients of the&#xD;
      'Study group' and placebo for 'Control group' for consecutive 26 weeks. At 26th week of&#xD;
      follow up, all the study variables were examined. With this, all patients of both the groups&#xD;
      were advised to continue ad lib (according to their own choice) diet. The results was&#xD;
      expressed as mean±SD and the data was statistically analyzed by SPSS Version 16, using&#xD;
      Independent sample 't' test (between two groups) and paired student's 't' test (between&#xD;
      paired groups before and after intervention). In the interpretation of results, &lt;0.05 level&#xD;
      of probability (p) was accepted as significant.&#xD;
