  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with oral tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) will be critical to ending the HIV epidemic. However,&#xD;
      maintaining daily adherence to PrEP can be difficult and the accuracy of self-reported&#xD;
      adherence is often limited by social desirability bias. Pharmacologic adherence monitoring&#xD;
      (measuring drug levels in a biomatrix) has been critical to the interpretation of the PrEP&#xD;
      trials, but testing usually requires expensive equipment and skilled personnel. We have&#xD;
      recently developed a point-of-care (POC) immunoassay to measure tenofovir in urine, allowing&#xD;
      real-time adherence monitoring for the first time. We now want to test the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary impact of monitoring adherence in real-time using this novel POC&#xD;
      assay with adherence feedback provided to the patient with supportive messaging (versus&#xD;
      standard of care adherence counseling).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot randomized trial to test the acceptability to participants, feasibility&#xD;
      for providers, and impact on long-term metric of adherence among participants (assessed via&#xD;
      tenofovir hair levels) of implementing a POC urine tenofovir test to provide real-time&#xD;
      adherence feedback and enhanced adherence counseling among women on PrEP in Thika, Kenya.&#xD;
      Eligible women (n=100) will be HIV-negative, ≥18 years old, and on PrEP. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to the intervention of providing real-time feedback via the urine assay versus&#xD;
      standard-of-care adherence counseling. Acceptability will be assessed by a quantitative&#xD;
      survey of participants at the end of the study, as well as by qualitative data collected via&#xD;
      in-depth interviews (n=20) and focus group discussions (n=4 groups of 5-10 women each).&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by the proportion of women retained in the study, the mean&#xD;
      number of missed visits, the proportion of planned urine assessments completed and messages&#xD;
      delivered, while in-depth interviews with providers will explore the ease of administering&#xD;
      the urine test. Tenofovir levels in hair serve as the long-term metric of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcome: The investigators will assess the feasibility of the intervention by&#xD;
      interviewing health care providers, who will be administering this test at the clinical point&#xD;
      of care in the future. The investigators will examine provider perceptions of the assay using&#xD;
      in-depth interviews. These key informant interviews will be performed at the end of this&#xD;
      study with the healthcare providers (up to 8) who delivered the counseling messages to&#xD;
      intervention arm participants after performing the POC urine TFV test. The semi-structured&#xD;
      interview guide will draw from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)&#xD;
      model.200 This model incorporates factors that influence technology acceptance (in this case,&#xD;
      of the POC immunoassay): perceived usefulness (performance expectancy), complexity to use&#xD;
      (effort expectancy), stigma/social harm (social influence), and benefits (facilitating PrEP&#xD;
      adherence among patients). These interviews will also elicit barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      delivering the TFV assay-informed counseling messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability outcome: The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods assessment of the&#xD;
      intervention arm participants' experiences with real-time monitoring and feedback at the end&#xD;
      of the study. A quantitative survey and a qualitative interview guide for in-depth interviews&#xD;
      of participants will draw from the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB)&#xD;
      model.205-212 Quantitative data collection will occur via standardized&#xD;
      interviewer-administered questionnaires. Items to be assessed include the following: 1)&#xD;
      Feelings about receiving their PrEP adherence results in real time; 2) Likelihood of&#xD;
      participating in other studies using a similar design; 3) Likelihood of wanting to receive&#xD;
      results of urine testing outside of a study while they are on PrEP; 4) Concern about the&#xD;
      privacy and security of the data regarding their urine results; 5) Grading of the potential&#xD;
      impact of knowing their urine TFV results on subsequent medication adherence; 6) Advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages of being told about their adherence in real time; 7) Likelihood of taking&#xD;
      PrEP just before later study visits because they knew the urine test was being conducted; 8)&#xD;
      Preferences regarding a yes/no assay versus an assay that provides information on &quot;high&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;low&quot; adherence. A 5-point Likert item format will be used to assess graded&#xD;
      items (such as the likelihood of wanting continued urine testing in the context of PrEP;&#xD;
      feelings about the urine testing, ranging from negative to positive; concerns about privacy,&#xD;
      ranging from low to high; the potential impact of real-time feedback on subsequent adherence,&#xD;
      ranging from low to high). Other items (advantages and disadvantages of being told about&#xD;
      adherence results) will provide pre-specified options with one &quot;other&quot; option for open-ended&#xD;
      text fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence outcome: A linear mixed effects linear regression model will estimate the effect of&#xD;
      the intervention versus standard-of-care on logarithmically transformed levels of tenofovir&#xD;
      in hair.&#xD;
