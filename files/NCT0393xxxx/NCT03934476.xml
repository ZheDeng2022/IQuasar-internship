  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the long-term effects of the ketogenic diet and&#xD;
      exercise (including interactions) on health markers, exercise performance and wellbeing&#xD;
      outcomes in sedentary overweight individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intentional nutritional ketosis induced by the low carbohydrate diet is an intensively&#xD;
      discussed topic of many scientific as well as non-scientific discussions throughout the areas&#xD;
      of healthy living, the sports sciences and often used now for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      chronic diseases. It has been demonstrated that long-term low-carbohydrate diet is more&#xD;
      effective for weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor reduction than a&#xD;
      low-fat diet. In light of conflicting theories of best practice surrounding a polarized topic&#xD;
      that impacts human health and daily work performance, the primary aim of this research&#xD;
      project is to examine how low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets affect health markers, exercise&#xD;
      performance and wellbeing outcomes in sedentary overweight individuals. Each study subject&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of the four arms of the study and will undergo a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention, with the exception of the study subjects in the control group, who will undergo&#xD;
      no intervention for the period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project outcomes are of immense importance for the investigator's global human health,&#xD;
      focus on a unique holistic perspective and have the potential to contribute towards&#xD;
      much-needed adjustments in public health recommendations.&#xD;
