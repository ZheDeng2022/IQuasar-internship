  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish a new and more accurate method to visualize the&#xD;
      peritoneal changes caused by endometriosis using Indocyanine Green mediated fluorescence&#xD;
      imaging. The hypothesis is that Indocyanine Green, a fluorescent dye that has wide&#xD;
      applications throughout medicine in identifying vascularity of tissues and&#xD;
      neo-vascularization, could facilitate the localization and excision of endometriotic lesions&#xD;
      exploiting the hypervascularization due to the chronic inflammation. The already published&#xD;
      Pilot Study GRE-ENDO (Cosentino F, Near-Infrared Imaging with Indocyanine Green for Detection&#xD;
      of Endometriosis Lesions (Gre-Endo Trial): A Pilot Study.), encouraged the effort of a larger&#xD;
      prospective trial. Based on the mini-max two-stage design by Simon [Simon R. Optimal two&#xD;
      stage design for phase II clinical trials], the investigators tested the null hypothesis that&#xD;
      the true rate of pathologically assessed endometriosis would improve from 87% to the&#xD;
      clinically relevant alternative of 100.0%, as assessed by NIR-ICG laparoscopy.&#xD;

      Patients were recruited within the clinical routine after indication for laparoscopy under&#xD;
      consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated according to the study design by Simon (Simon R. Optimal two&#xD;
      stage design for phase II clinical trials), using an α-error of 0.01 (two-sided) and a&#xD;
      β-error of 0.90. Considering a patient dropout of approximately 10%, the study was planned to&#xD;
      enrol at least 47 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first abdominal and pelvi's inspection was made using direct laparoscope visualization&#xD;
      under white light conditions. All areas suspected of peritoneal endometriosis was classified&#xD;
      as white, black and red lesions and recorded together with their anatomic location in the&#xD;
      surgical record for the purposes of subsequent extirpation. After the first visual inspection&#xD;
      the patient was administered with 0.05 - 0.25 mg /(kg BW) Indocyanine Green intravenously.&#xD;
      The Indocyanine Green imaging mode of the Olympus Indocyanine Green Imaging System was&#xD;
      activated and suspected areas in Indocyanine Green imaging mode were recorded with them&#xD;
      corresponding appearance in white light mode. If suspected areas were visible either in white&#xD;
      light or Indocyanine Green imaging mode, specific sample has been taken from these areas. In&#xD;
      addition, control biopsy specimens from inconspicuous peritoneum has been taken.&#xD;
