          <description>All enrolled participants who had geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, signed informed consent for this trial, and met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, for evaluating the usage of microperimetry and Swept Source - Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) in assessing the natural changes of retinal sensitivity and anatomy in the retina. Each participant was planned to be observed for an observation period of 48 weeks after screening visit. During the observation period, 4 visits were planned to be taken at Week 0, 12, 24, and 48 of the observation period.</description>
