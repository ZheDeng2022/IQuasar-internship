  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that the majority of all mental health (MH) treatment for children is&#xD;
      delivered in schools. Unfortunately, however, school mental health (SMH) providers rarely use&#xD;
      evidence-based approaches and are often poorly integrated into the school context. Given the&#xD;
      high (&gt;20%) and increasing rates of MH disorders among children and youth, MH clinicians&#xD;
      working in schools need effective and efficient ways to address student emotional and&#xD;
      behavioral problems. The Brief Intervention Strategy for School Clinicians (BRISC) is a&#xD;
      four-session, flexible, and research-informed &quot;Tier 2&quot; intervention tailored to high school&#xD;
      students and designed to fit the school context. Findings from initial research funded by an&#xD;
      IES Development and Innovation grant, including a small (n=66) comparison study, indicate&#xD;
      positive, small to large sized effects (ES = .30- 1.33) in favor of BRISC for MH impairment,&#xD;
      emotional symptoms, therapeutic alliance, coping skills, and client satisfaction. Moreover,&#xD;
      even though the majority of students who were referred to BRISC were in the clinical range&#xD;
      for functional impairment due to MH problems, over 50% were able to step down to lower levels&#xD;
      of intervention after four sessions of BRISC, demonstrating promise for efficiency and reach.&#xD;
      Given potential for public health impact, the purpose of the current study is to further&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of BRISC by assessing its impact on mental health and academic outcomes&#xD;
      - as well as feasibility, acceptability, and efficiency - in a larger, multi-site trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fostering emotional and behavioral well-being is critical to school success, and research&#xD;
      shows that over 70% of all mental health treatment for children is delivered in schools.&#xD;
      Thus, school mental health (SMH) services are a fundamental component of our nation's&#xD;
      strategy to ensure academic and life success of our children and youth. Unfortunately, SMH&#xD;
      providers rarely use evidence-based approaches and are often poorly integrated into the&#xD;
      school context. SMH providers carry large caseloads, experience time constraints, and serve&#xD;
      youth with a broad array of needs. For SMH to live up to its potential, individuals who&#xD;
      provide SMH treatment must be equipped with effective and efficient ways to address student&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of&#xD;
      the Brief Intervention Strategy for School Clinicians (BRISC). BRISC is a fully developed,&#xD;
      manualized intervention strategy for use by professionals working individually with high&#xD;
      school students experiencing mental health symptoms or other emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      stressors that negatively affect their ability to succeed academically. With funding from an&#xD;
      IES Development and Innovation grant (R305A120128), BRISC was developed as a brief,&#xD;
      evidence-based, and flexible &quot;Tier 2&quot; intervention designed to fit the high school context.&#xD;
      Findings from a small (N=66) comparison study indicate positive, small to large sized effects&#xD;
      (ES = .30 - 1.33) in favor of BRISC over SMH services as usual (SAU) for a range of short and&#xD;
      longer-term outcomes (see Section A9). The study also found high clinician fidelity to BRISC,&#xD;
      increased clinician use of evidence-based strategies, high ratings of feasibility, and very&#xD;
      low ratings of research burden. Moreover, even though the majority of students who were&#xD;
      referred to BRISC were in the clinical range for functional impairment due to MH problems,&#xD;
      over 50% were able to step down to lower levels of intervention after four sessions of BRISC,&#xD;
      demonstrating promise for efficiency and reach. The current study aims to further examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of BRISC, the mediators and moderators that may further influence its development,&#xD;
      and to illuminate how and under what conditions BRISC is effective. A cluster randomized&#xD;
      design has been used to assign 52 schools in Washington, Minnesota, and Maryland to BRISC or&#xD;
      SAU (520 students total; 260 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This efficacy project has six research aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effects of BRISC on hypothesized short-term service outcomes such as&#xD;
           clinician use of evidence-based strategies and standardized assessment data, therapeutic&#xD;
           alliance, student service satisfaction, retention in services, and service referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effects of BRISC on hypothesized short-term student outcomes, such as&#xD;
           problem-solving, coping skills, school engagement, school attendance, and homework&#xD;
           completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the effects of BRISC on longer-term outcomes such as MH symptoms,&#xD;
           emotional/behavioral functioning, peer/family relations, discipline problems at school,&#xD;
           and academic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the impact of BRISC on treatment efficiency, in terms of trajectory of&#xD;
           student change in outcomes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To confirm that BRISC is perceived as an appropriate, feasible, and acceptable&#xD;
           intervention for use by SMH clinicians working in a diverse array of high schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine hypothesized moderators and mediators of outcomes, including service factors&#xD;
           (e.g., fidelity, service dosage/duration, clinician orientation, receipt of other&#xD;
           services), student factors (e.g., age, gender, problem type and severity), and proximal&#xD;
           outcomes (e.g., problem-solving skills, coping strategies, school engagement).&#xD;
