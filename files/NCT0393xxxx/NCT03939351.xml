  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the changes in morphology and Retinal&#xD;
      vascularization after revascularization of the internal carotid artery. Indeed, the stenosis&#xD;
      of the internal carotid artery can lead to ophthalmological charts. The underlying hypothesis&#xD;
      is that revascularization of the internal carotid artery would improve ipsilateral and&#xD;
      retinal homolateral perfusion in the short term. The OCT-angiography technique accurately&#xD;
      studies the retinal vasculature and also assesses the risk of retinal and choroidal embolism,&#xD;
      which is recognized as increased in cases of symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stenosis of the internal carotid artery is a frequent and potentially serious pathology&#xD;
      (TIA, ischemic stroke, death), which can also be manifested by ophthalmological charts,&#xD;
      foremost among which are transient monocular blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common etiology of this stenosis remains the atheromatous pathology, whose&#xD;
      treatment, depending on the symptomatic or non-symptomatic nature of the stenosis, includes,&#xD;
      among other things, a revascularization procedure that may be surgical (endarterectomy,&#xD;
      reference treatment) or guided by radiology (angioplasty and carotid stent placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the anatomical point of view, the internal carotid artery notably has for branching the&#xD;
      ophthalmological artery, which itself will give birth:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the central artery of the retina: role in the vascularization of the inner layers of&#xD;
           the retina&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  posterior ciliary arteries: role in the choroidal vasculature and outer layers of the&#xD;
           retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little knowledge at the present time relates changes in retinal and choroidal&#xD;
      vascularization after a revascularization procedure on the internal carotid artery&#xD;
      OCT-angiography is a non-invasive imaging technique that is now part of investigative&#xD;
      examinations in retinal imaging. This technique makes it possible to study the macular and&#xD;
      choroidal retinal vascularization with precision without injection of contrast medium and&#xD;
      thus allows to deepen the knowledge in medical fields where the exploration was until now&#xD;
      limited because of the invasiveness of the examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this project is that revascularization of the internal carotid artery would&#xD;
      improve retinal and choroidal ipsilateral perfusion in the short term (1 month&#xD;
      postoperatively), as assessed by OCT-angiography. OCT-angiography could also be used to&#xD;
      assess retinal and choroidal embolism risk, usually recognized as increased in cases of&#xD;
      symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.&#xD;
