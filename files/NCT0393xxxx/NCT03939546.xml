  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FOUNDATION study will evaluate the tolerability of feeding preterm infants a B. infantis&#xD;
      probiotic (EVC001) as the primary endpoint. This particular strain of Bifidobacterium has&#xD;
      been shown to uniquely utilize oligosaccharides found in human breast milk, possibly&#xD;
      providing a nutritional benefit for the infant consuming breast milk when B. infantis is&#xD;
      colonized in the gut.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, prospective, cohort study of an infant probiotic (Food&#xD;
      for Special Dietary Use) conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Each subject&#xD;
      enrolled will be in the study from the time of consent (within 10 days of birth) to hospital&#xD;
      discharge. A prospective control cohort of 15 infants will initially be enrolled. Fifteen&#xD;
      (15) infants will then be enrolled into the B. infantis cohort. Infants in the B. infantis&#xD;
      cohort will receive a daily feeding of B. infantis EVC001 in MCT oil until hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
