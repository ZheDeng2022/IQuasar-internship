  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preemptive analgesia is widely used during surgical procedures to reduce post-operative pain.&#xD;
      Pudendal nerve blockade has been established and provides highly effective and safe&#xD;
      anaesthesia to the vulva, lower vagina, and perineum. Various local anaesthetics used in&#xD;
      gynaecological practice, including lidocaine, bupivacaine and mepivacaine. Using Bupivacaine&#xD;
      in the Pudendal block has shown controversial results. The use of Ropivacaine as preemptive&#xD;
      analgesia in different nerve blocks, including nerve block on the face, thorax, abdominal and&#xD;
      perineal region, and had shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine and ropivacaine both are commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks. ropivacaine&#xD;
      has been shown in two randomized control trials to improved postoperative analgesia and&#xD;
      quicker recovery, compared to placebo [28,29]. Previous studies showed the promising effect&#xD;
      on different nerve blocks including nerve block on the face, thorax, abdominal and perineal&#xD;
      region. However, there are no studies done to investigate the effect of ropivacaine or in&#xD;
      comparing their analgesic duration in the setting of a pudendal nerve block for&#xD;
      gynaecological surgeries. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comparison of the duration&#xD;
      of postoperative analgesia achieved by two agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to conduct a randomized comparison of the duration of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia achieved by pudendal nerve blockade using ropivacaine compared to&#xD;
      bupivacaine, in women undergoing posterior vaginal repair. The primary outcome is pain scores&#xD;
      and postoperative analgesic consumption, and secondary outcomes include post-operative&#xD;
      recovery, ambulation and measure length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators assume that using the Preemptive pudendal nerve block will reduce the&#xD;
      postoperative pain and decrease the postoperative analgesic demand in patients who undergo&#xD;
      posterior vaginal repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy of preemptive pudendal nerve blockade on postoperative pain,&#xD;
      after the posterior vaginal repair, below the level of ischial spine, excluding uterine&#xD;
      suspension procedures that are higher than the coverage of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While bearing with the postoperative analgesia consumption (Morphine) over 24 hours as&#xD;
      Primary Outcome of interest, presuming Ropivacaine is equivalent to Bupivacaine, the&#xD;
      estimated sample size at 95% confidence interval for each arm with 80% power to detect&#xD;
      non-inferiority using two-tailed t-test is 30 respectively. Therefore, the total patient&#xD;
      required is 60. However, while baring with the 20% patient dropout rate, the estimated sample&#xD;
      size for each arm is 36, a total of 72 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited randomly from urogynecology clinic after fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria, who will undergo posterior vaginal wall repair. Research assistants&#xD;
      in the pre-operative anaesthetic clinic will approach patients scheduled for surgery for&#xD;
      participation. Patients providing informed consent (Appendix 1) will be allocated to one of&#xD;
      two groups using a computer-generated random number table, and blinding of group allocation&#xD;
      will be maintained with sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. All other personnel&#xD;
      - patients, anesthesiologists or caring for the patient in the operating theatre, surgeons,&#xD;
      research assistants performing outcome measures, and statisticians - will remain blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be explained about the risks, benefits and complications and file will be&#xD;
      labelled as A or B for that particular patient by computer generated software. The patient&#xD;
      can have surgery under spinal or general anaesthesia. Block will be done in the operating&#xD;
      room, by the surgeon, just prior to starting the procedure, through the transvaginal&#xD;
      approach. One group of patients will receive analgesia, bupivacaine 0.25% to be prepared by&#xD;
      the pharmacologist, while the other group will receive ropivacaine 0.2 % in the syringe&#xD;
      prepared for the pudendal block. A pharmacist will label syringe as A and B. The enrollment&#xD;
      in the study is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologist role prepare and label two syringes: bupivacaine 0.25% syringe, and&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.5% syringe. Operating Room nurse will keep two syringes labelled A and B.&#xD;
      Before operation nurse will give the surgeon labelled syringe. Postoperatively research nurse&#xD;
      will assess the postoperative pain intensity by visual analogue pain scale, as well as&#xD;
      analgesic requirements, at 1, 3, 5, 7, 18, 24, and 36 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pudendal nerve block technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive prophylaxis antibiotics [Cefoxitin 2 g intravenously or similar]&#xD;
      within one hour before surgery. All surgeries performed transvaginally under general or&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia. Three attending physicians will supervise all surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a pudendal nerve block injection on each side as previously described&#xD;
      5-10 minutes before the beginning of surgery. A tubular director that allows 1.0-1.5 cm of a&#xD;
      15-cm-long, 22-gauge needle to protrude beyond its tip will be used to guide the needle into&#xD;
      the pudendal trunk at lesser sciatic foramen about 1 cm inferior-medial to attachment of the&#xD;
      sacrospinous ligament to the ischial spine. The end of the director will be placed against&#xD;
      the vaginal epithelium just beneath the tip of the ischial spine. The needle pushed beyond&#xD;
      the tip of the director, and 5 ml of the anaesthetic solution will be injected. The needle&#xD;
      advanced 1 cm posterior and lateral, and another 5 mL of the anaesthetic solution will be&#xD;
      injected into this region. Aspiration will be attempted before every injection to guard&#xD;
      against intravascular infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators will use a validated visual analogue pain scale at 1, 3, 5, 7, 18, 24 and 36&#xD;
      hours after surgery to assess postoperative pain intensity. This pain scale provides a&#xD;
      validated and minimally intrusive measure of pain intensity, consisting of a 10-cm vertical&#xD;
      line with the two endpoints labelled &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst possible pain.&quot; The patient is&#xD;
      required to mark the 10-cm line at a point that corresponds to the present level of pain&#xD;
      intensity. The distance in centimetres from the low end of the visual analogue scale and the&#xD;
      patient's mark are used as a numerical index of pain intensity. To ensure that the questions&#xD;
      will be asked in the same way each time, the nursing staff will be trained and instructed to&#xD;
      phrase the questions in a standardized fashion, using the specific wording, as follows: &quot;How&#xD;
      bad is participant's pain? and mark participant's pain intensity on the pain scale from 0 to&#xD;
      10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicate the worst possible pain. Analgesic requirements&#xD;
      will consistently be recorded at 1, 3, 7, 18, and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given the following, unless allergic, Paracetamol 1 gm orally every 4&#xD;
      hours, and non-steroidal analgesia in the form of ibuprofen 400 mg orally 8 hourly, to&#xD;
      diclofenac 50 mg rectally, 8 hourly, and Tramadol, up to 100 mg orally 8 hourly as required,&#xD;
      and analgesia requirement will tabulate in the chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected on a customized case report form that includes all&#xD;
      relevant demographic and intra-operative data as well as each outcome sought. Patients will&#xD;
      be provided with a home diary to complete that will capture all outcomes sought that are not&#xD;
      obtained in the hospital. Demographic data will be summarized and expressed using appropriate&#xD;
      measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous data, and frequency for&#xD;
      categorical data. The primary outcome, time to the first sensation of pain at the surgical&#xD;
      site, will be summarized as mean [SD] or median [IQR] after testing the data for normality&#xD;
      with the Kolmogorov Smirnoff test. This will also determine whether groups will be compared&#xD;
      with the t-test [for normally distributed data] or Kaplan Meier Survival Curves [for skewed&#xD;
      data]. Secondary outcomes that are time-based will also be assessed in the above manner [time&#xD;
      to first analgesic request, duration of motor block]. Continuous secondary outcomes [opioid&#xD;
      consumption, VRS, room air SpO2] will be assessed with repeated measures ANOVA or the Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U-test for non-parametric data. Categorical outcomes will be compared with the&#xD;
      Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approval from the King Fahad Medical City institutional review board [IRB] is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Budget will be based on estimation according to cost and protocol, and IRF will be&#xD;
      obtained&#xD;
