      Echocardiography is a common and essential tool in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Using ultrasound, this technique allows for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function,&#xD;
      including systolic function, diastolic function, heart chamber quantification, and diagnosis&#xD;
      and quantification of valvular abnormalities. Usage of echocardiography has increased each&#xD;
      year; over 7 million echocardiograms were performed in 2011 in the Medicare Population alone.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and allowing for&#xD;
      widespread usage of echocardiography could result in earlier diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and potential reduction in healthcare disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of an echocardiogram first requires image acquisition which is then followed by&#xD;
      image analysis and interpretation. Image acquisition is traditionally performed by cardiac&#xD;
      sonographers (technicians) or physicians. Image review and interpretation is performed by&#xD;
      specialist physicians, typically cardiologists or radiologists. Each step in the process&#xD;
      historically requires a high level of training and specialized equipment which limits its use&#xD;
      in under-resourced areas. However, given the high level of skill required to operate this&#xD;
      equipment there remains a need for additional technologies to aid in the acquisition and&#xD;
      interpretation of imaging. As ultrasound technology has improved, however, costs and size of&#xD;
      equipment have decreased and use of bedside ultrasound to guide clinical decision making has&#xD;
      become increasingly common. This bedside ultrasound is focused on specific questions, such as&#xD;
      diagnosis of a pleural or pericardial effusion, and can be readily taught to non-experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the potential tools to overcome these limitations is artificial intelligence (AI). AI&#xD;
      is the use of computer programs to mimic the cognitive function of the human mind in order to&#xD;
      learn and solve problems. Echocardiology is a particularly ripe field that may benefit from&#xD;
      the use of artificial intelligence. Due to anatomical differences and dynamic clinical&#xD;
      situations, the process of image acquisition and analysis can vary widely between patients.&#xD;
      Although simple computer algorithms fail to integrate these differences, artificial&#xD;
      intelligence may allow for machine-assisted image acquisition and analysis. In the last&#xD;
      several years, there have been numerous studies of computer-assisted analysis of&#xD;
      echocardiography. The use of this technology may speed the acquisition of echocardiographic&#xD;
      images, reduce the amount of training needed to acquire and analyze images, improve&#xD;
      diagnostic quality, and reduce interobserver variability in the analysis of echocardiographic&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By integrating artificial intelligence-assisted image acquisition and analysis with&#xD;
      ultrasound technology, it may be possible for minimally trained operators in underserved&#xD;
      areas to use echocardiography to accurately diagnose cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be supervised by the Echocardiography Laboratory and the Internal Medicine&#xD;
      Residency Program in the Department of Medicine at the NewYork Presbyterian Columbia&#xD;
      University Medical Center. The study will take place on the medical resident inpatient&#xD;
      cardiology ward services which are primarily housed in the Milstein Hospital 5 Garden South&#xD;
      ward. The primary subjects of the study are the medical residents in the Department of&#xD;
      Medicine who are rotating through the inpatient cardiology ward services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, the medical residents will undergo a training session introducing them to&#xD;
      the basic concepts of echocardiography and the usage of either the Bay Labs echocardiology AI&#xD;
      ultrasound system or a standard echocardiography system (a native Terason echocardiography&#xD;
      machine). In this protocol, the echocardiographic images they obtain using these tools will&#xD;
      be called a &quot;study echocardiogram.&quot; This is in contrast to a &quot;formal echocardiogram&quot; that is&#xD;
      performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiology fellows, or cardiology attendings and analyzed&#xD;
      by cardiology attendings who specialize in echocardiography. The medical residents will use&#xD;
      either the Bay Labs system or the native Terason system to perform echocardiograms on&#xD;
      patients admitted to the cardiology ward teams who either have undergone or are planned to&#xD;
      undergo a formal echocardiogram within 1 day of the study echocardiogram. The explicit goals&#xD;
      of this project are (1) to determine if it is possible for the medical residents as novice&#xD;
      users to acquire and interpret echocardiographic images and (2) whether the use of the Bay&#xD;
      Labs system aids in education over the standard system. The Bay Labs echocardiogram that is&#xD;
      performed as part of this study is not FDA approved to aid in clinical decision making, and&#xD;
      as such the results of the study echocardiograms will not be used to change clinical&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a total of 4 cardiology resident teams on the inpatient cardiology wards, and the&#xD;
      teams are designated using a letter system: A, B, C, and D. Each of these teams is comprised&#xD;
      of a first-year medical resident and a third-year medical resident. The A and C teams form&#xD;
      one team dyad and the B and D teams form a second team dyad. The teams are covered at night&#xD;
      by a separate team of medical residents. Each dyad is primarily supervised by a pair of&#xD;
      cardiology attendings who oversee the care of the general cardiac patients. In addition to&#xD;
      the service cardiology attendings, the teams may manage patients under the care of heart&#xD;
      failure cardiologists or other private cardiologists. Each team can carry a total of 10&#xD;
      patients. The admitting structure of the teams allows for 7 new patients to be admitted to&#xD;
      the cardiology ward services per 24 hour period. During the day, 3 patients can be admitted&#xD;
      to the long-call team and 1 patient to the short-call team. At night, 3 patients can be&#xD;
      admitted to the overnight (long-call) team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the initiation of the study, a schedule will be created where each 4 week cardiology&#xD;
      inpatient ward rotation block will be assigned to use Bay Labs technology or the native&#xD;
      Terason system. At the start of their cardiology inpatient ward rotation, the medical&#xD;
      residents will be approached to consent to take place in the study. The medical residents who&#xD;
      consent to the study will undergo a pre-test asking them about their comfort with the&#xD;
      performance of and interpretation of echocardiography. They will then undergo a training&#xD;
      session introducing them to the basics of echocardiography, the study protocol, and the&#xD;
      operation of either the Bay Labs echocardiography system or the native Terason&#xD;
      echocardiography system. After receiving this training, they will be able to start performing&#xD;
      echocardiograms in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each morning, each medical resident will able to designate between 1-3 patients on their&#xD;
      service to undergo an echocardiogram. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the&#xD;
      protocol. The patients will be approached by the an investigator or research assistant to&#xD;
      consent them for the study. Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram performed by the&#xD;
      medical residents and images will be stored for later analysis. After each echocardiogram,&#xD;
      the medical residents will fill out a short form documenting the echocardiogram. Questions on&#xD;
      this form will include demographics, clinical features, technical aspects about the test&#xD;
      (such as whether specific views could be obtained), and ask basic questions about operator&#xD;
      estimated cardiac function that was observed during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the rotation, the participating residents will take a post-test on their&#xD;
      comfort with the performance of and interpretation of echocardiography. They will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to provide feedback on the study. The medical residents will be offered&#xD;
      feedback on their echocardiograms during and after the study period to aid in learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the study period, the data will be analyzed. Results from the pre-test and&#xD;
      post-test will be analyzed to determine if the medical residents had improvement in their&#xD;
      knowledge of echocardiography during the rotation. The echocardiograms will be analyzed and&#xD;
      compared with the formal echocardiograms by the study investigators and attending&#xD;
      echocardiographers to determine if the designated image views could be obtained, the time&#xD;
      needed to obtain the images, and the quality of the images in comparison to the formal&#xD;
      echocardiogram. The left ventricular systolic function visually observed by the medical&#xD;
      residents during the study echocardiogram, the autoEF calculated by the Bay Labs software in&#xD;
      those patients in those groups, and the left ventricular ejection fraction from the formal&#xD;
      echocardiogram will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is of no more than minimal risk to the patients enrolled. The test itself (a&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiogram) is noninvasive and has no radiation exposure. In addition, the&#xD;
      medical teams will be prohibited from making clinical decisions based on the Bay Labs&#xD;
      echocardiogram which will instead be based on the formal echocardiogram. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the data will be permanently de-identified.&#xD;
