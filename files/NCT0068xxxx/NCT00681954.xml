      The purpose of the study is to determine whether transfusion is associated with mild&#xD;
      pulmonary changes.&#xD;

      Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of blood product related&#xD;
      death. The precise mechanisms of TRALI are uncertain. We hypothesize that TRALI is a full&#xD;
      spectrum of lung injury. One theory holds that the infusion of cytokines associated with the&#xD;
      transfusion of stored blood combined with the trauma and stress of surgery produce lung&#xD;
      injury. We propose to examine lung function following transfusion, and that stored blood (and&#xD;
      by implication, cytokines) injures the lung. TRALI is a rare condition and we do not expect&#xD;
      any of the patients that we observe will develop TRALI. We are merely observing their&#xD;
      pulmonary function closely to see if there are any mild changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into three groups based on whether or not they have pre-donated&#xD;
      blood for the surgery. Once divided into these groups they are randomized to one of three&#xD;
      groups with patients in the first group randomized to receive their stored (either autologous&#xD;
      or allogeneic) &quot;unwashed&quot; blood first in the operating room using the standard cell salvage&#xD;
      system. The second group will receive their stored (either autologous or allogeneic) &quot;washed&quot;&#xD;
      blood first and the third group will receive blood from the cell salvage system first. Those&#xD;
      who get the stored blood first will get the cell salvage blood as their second transfusion&#xD;
      and those that get the cell salvage blood first will get stored &quot;unwashed&quot; blood as the&#xD;
      second transfusion in the operating room. We will closely monitor pulmonary function and&#xD;
      oxygenation, and try to observe whether there is early evidence of lung changes. If there is&#xD;
      evidence of lung changes, then the blood is tested for cytokines and antibodies.&#xD;

        The study population is all adult spine surgery patients aged 16 to 75 who are scheduled&#xD;
        for orthopedic spine surgery at UCSF who are expected to lose at least 1000 cc of blood&#xD;
        during their surgery and who will receive both stored blood and cell-salvaged blood during&#xD;
        their surgery.&#xD;
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients who are undergoing substantial posterior spinal reconstruction are chosen as the&#xD;
        study population because (1) the need for transfusion is highly predictable; (2) all have&#xD;
        endotracheal tubes to allow for controlled ventilation and control of inspired gases; (3)&#xD;
        the availability of stored non-leukoreduced autologous packed red blood cells (prbcs) will&#xD;
        enable comparison of effects of autologous blood containing elevated concentrations of&#xD;
        pro-inflammatory cytokines and lyso-phosphatidyl choline with that of autologous red cells&#xD;
        without elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (salvaged cells); (4) all&#xD;
        have arterial catheters allowing for frequent sampling of arterial blood for blood gas&#xD;
        determinations; (5) all have central venous catheters to guide fluid therapy and ensure the&#xD;
        absence of fluid overload, thus eliminating an important confounder in assessing&#xD;
        alterations of lung function after transfusion. For those not having autologous blood, it&#xD;
        will be possible to compare the effects of blood containing elevated concentrations of&#xD;
        pro-inflammatory cytokines and lyso-phosphatidyl choline normally associated with blood&#xD;
        storage with that of autologous red cells without elevated concentrations of&#xD;
        pro-inflammatory cytokines (salvaged cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients, male or female, any race or ethnicity, age 16-75 years, undergoing elective&#xD;
        posterior spine surgery at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with expected&#xD;
        sufficient blood loss to require intra-operative cell salvage and blood transfusion, who&#xD;
        have donated blood for themselves preoperatively. -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are excluded who are under 16 or over 75 year of age. Also excluded are those that&#xD;
        have pulmonary disease, abnormal pulmonary function or gas exchange by history or physical&#xD;
        examination, and pre-operative measurement of oxyhemoglobin saturation (percutaneous); any&#xD;
        operative procedure within one week of study; active infection; cardiac failure.&#xD;
