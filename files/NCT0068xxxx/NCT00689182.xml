      Hypothesis: The reduction of total body iron by phlebotomy will be safe and feasible in the&#xD;
      post-HSCT setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload is common after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is associated with&#xD;
      chronic liver disease, with increased rates of infection and decreased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible, consenting patients will have once monthly phlebotomy procedures (500ml) for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY: At each visit, patients will have a comprehensive assessment prior to starting and&#xD;
      after completing the phlebotomy. This assessment will include determination of pain at&#xD;
      phlebotomy site, local infection and an assessment of symptoms of anemia including&#xD;
      presyncope, fatigue and dyspnea. The patient's pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and&#xD;
      temperature will also be determined before and following the phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY: Iron stores will be measured serially in each patient. Measurements will be&#xD;
      performed prior to the start of phlebotomy, and at 6 months and 12 months following the start&#xD;
      of the series of 12 phlebotomies. These evaluations will be undertaken regardless of the&#xD;
      number of phlebotomies which the patient actually undergoes. Iron stores will be estimated by&#xD;
      measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. Total body iron will be estimated&#xD;
      from hepatic and cardiac iron concentration as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      Gandon et al. (12) described a non-invasive technique using MRI to measure hepatic iron&#xD;
      stores. Iron is a paramagnetic substance which causes local magnetic field inhomogeneities&#xD;
      leading to dephasing and signal loss in MRI. Gradient echo sequences are most susceptible to&#xD;
      their effects because they do not use a 180° refocusing pulse, unlike conventional spin-echo&#xD;
      sequences. Gandon et al. used multiple gradient echo sequences, compared the signal in liver&#xD;
      to adjacent muscle and used this ratio to correlate with hepatic iron levels measured on&#xD;
      tissue biopsy samples using spectrophotometric analysis. Multiple sequences were used because&#xD;
      the nomogram comparing the L/M signal ratio is linear over only a small concentration of&#xD;
      tissue iron.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a treatment&#xD;
      for a variety of malignant and non-malignant conditions. With improvements in conditioning&#xD;
      regimens and post-transplant care, more HSCT recipients are becoming long-term survivors and&#xD;
      therefore increasing attention is being directed to studying the long-term consequences of&#xD;
      successful HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload is surprisingly common after HSCT. The pathophysiology of iron overload or&#xD;
      siderosis is related to transfusional iron, inhibition of normal erythropoiesis and released&#xD;
      iron stores from hepatocytes, tumour cells and bone marrow. It is associated with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease in this patient population, as well as with increased rates of infection.&#xD;
      Studies suggest that iron overload may also affect survival in this population, as has been&#xD;
      shown in other populations who are susceptible to iron overload such as those with&#xD;
      thalassemia and hereditary hemochromatosis (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      McKay et al. described 76 survivors of allogeneic and autologous HSCT who were at least 1&#xD;
      year post-transplant (3). Sixty-seven (88%) had a ferritin level above the normal range.&#xD;
      Thirty-one (41%) had abnormal liver enzymes and 30/31 also had elevated ferritin. At the time&#xD;
      of publication, 10 of the patients had begun a venesection program; all showed a reduction in&#xD;
      ferritin levels and nine patients had a reduction in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Strasser&#xD;
      et al. showed an increase of hepatic iron concentration in 10 consecutive patients who died&#xD;
      post-HSCT (4). In a retrospective study to determine the characteristics of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease post-HSCT, iron overload was felt to contribute to chronic liver dysfunction in 52.4%&#xD;
      of patients post-HSCT who had liver disease (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload has also been associated with an increased frequency of infection in HSCT&#xD;
      recipients. A single-centre retrospective study of autopsies conducted post-HSCT revealed an&#xD;
      association between high liver iron concentration and invasive Aspergillus infection (6). In&#xD;
      a consecutive series of 263 allogeneic HSCT patients, 5 cases of mucormycosis all occurred in&#xD;
      patients with severe iron overload (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload prior to transplantation may also have a negative effect on survival. In a&#xD;
      prospective study of 25 consecutive patients, Altes et al. showed that a very high ferritin&#xD;
      level and a high transferrin saturation prior to conditioning was associated with a decreased&#xD;
      overall survival and a high transferrin saturation was associated with an increase in&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic phlebotomy is well-established for treatment of iron overload associated with&#xD;
      hereditary hemochromatosis (9) and beta thalassemia after HSCT (10). Phlebotomy has also been&#xD;
      studied in survivors of acute leukemia with iron overload. Franchini et al. showed that&#xD;
      phlebotomy was feasible and well-tolerated in this population and resulted in normalization&#xD;
      of ferritin and transferrin saturation (11). This study demonstrated feasibility of&#xD;
      phlebotomy but the effect of iron reduction on end-organ function was not addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, iron overload is common following HSCT and has been associated with a number of&#xD;
      adverse biochemical and clinical outcomes. In other clinical settings such as hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis and transfusional iron overload states such as thalassemia, the reduction of&#xD;
      iron stores by phlebotomy or chelation has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce both&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. We therefore postulate that the reduction of iron overload after&#xD;
      HSCT will similarly be associated with lower morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. demonstrate the safety and feasibility of phlebotomy to reduce total body iron in HSCT&#xD;
           recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. demonstrate reduction in total body iron by reduced ferritin and transferrin saturation&#xD;
           and reduction in hepatic and cardiac iron&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. demonstrate improvements in end-organ function by improved hepatic, cardiac and&#xD;
           endocrine function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective, single arm phase II trial designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of decreasing total body iron in HSCT recipients by phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Patients who are eligible to participate and who give informed consent&#xD;
      will undergo a regimen of phlebotomy in the following manner. Starting after 60 days&#xD;
      post-transplant, the patients will undergo a phlebotomy of 500 mL of whole blood monthly for&#xD;
      a total of 12 treatments. There will be a determination of the complete blood count prior to&#xD;
      each phlebotomy and if the hemoglobin level is less than 100 g/L, the phlebotomy will not be&#xD;
      performed. Patients will not routinely receive crystalloid volume replacement following the&#xD;
      phlebotomy. However, if a patient experiences syncope or pre-syncope, subsequent phlebotomies&#xD;
      will be followed by the infusion of 500 mL of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety and Feasibility The safety and feasibility of regular phlebotomy will be&#xD;
      determined by assessing the proportion of patients who can complete the 12 planned&#xD;
      phlebotomies. Delays in phlebotomy and reasons for stopping the phlebotomy program will be&#xD;
      documented. At each visit, patients will have a comprehensive assessment prior to starting&#xD;
      and after completing the phlebotomy. This assessment will include determination of pain at&#xD;
      phlebotomy site, local infection and an assessment of symptoms of anemia including&#xD;
      presyncope, fatigue and dyspnea. The patient's pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and&#xD;
      temperature will also be determined before and following the phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events In this study, only those adverse&#xD;
      events felt to be related to study procedures will be recorded. Phlebotomy adverse events&#xD;
      include: Pain at phlebotomy site, infection at phlebotomy site, evidence of phlebitis,&#xD;
      fatigue, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea, bacteremia, cellulitis at the phlebotomy site. A fall&#xD;
      in systolic blood pressure of greater than 20 mmHg post-phlebotomy will also be considered an&#xD;
      adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only serious adverse events related to study procedures will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be carefully assessed before and after the phlebotomy procedure. Adverse events&#xD;
      and serious adverse events related to study procedures will be assessed throughout the study&#xD;
      and up to 30 days following the last phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy Determination of iron concentration Iron stores will be measured&#xD;
      serially in each patient. Measurements will be performed prior to the start of phlebotomy,&#xD;
      and at 6 months and 12 months following the start of the series of 12 phlebotomies. These&#xD;
      evaluations will be undertaken regardless of the number of phlebotomies which the patient&#xD;
      actually undergoes. Iron stores will be estimated by measuring serum ferritin and transferrin&#xD;
      saturation levels. Total body iron will be estimated from hepatic and cardiac iron&#xD;
      concentration as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gandon et al. (12) described a&#xD;
      non-invasive technique using MRI to measure hepatic iron stores. Iron is a paramagnetic&#xD;
      substance which causes local magnetic field inhomogeneities leading to dephasing and signal&#xD;
      loss in MRI. Gradient echo sequences are most susceptible to their effects because they do&#xD;
      not use a 180° refocusing pulse, unlike conventional spin-echo sequences. Gandon et al. used&#xD;
      multiple gradient echo sequences, compared the signal in liver to adjacent muscle and used&#xD;
      this ratio to correlate with hepatic iron levels measured on tissue biopsy samples using&#xD;
      spectrophotometric analysis. Multiple sequences were used because the nomogram comparing the&#xD;
      L/M signal ratio is linear over only a small concentration of tissue iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the MRI technique was subsequently verified by Alustiza et al. (13). They&#xD;
      measured hepatic iron concentration in 112 patients with iron levels that varied from normal&#xD;
      (n=68) to abnormal in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (n=21) and transfusional&#xD;
      hemosiderosis (n=23). The correlation coefficient between iron measured by MRI compared to&#xD;
      tissue biopsy in this series was 0.957. This positive correlation verifies the Gandon&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will also be collected at baseline to screen for the most common mutations of&#xD;
      the HFE gene (C282Y mutation and H63D mutation) as hereditary hemochromatosis is common in&#xD;
      the general population and may contribute to iron overload in HSCT recipients. The patient&#xD;
      and family physician will be informed about the results of hemochromatosis testing and&#xD;
      standard practice will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of end organ function The effect of iron overload will be studied in three&#xD;
      principal areas: liver, heart and endocrine organs. All measurements will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at 6 and 12 months following the start of the series of 12 phlebotomies. Hepatic&#xD;
      function will be determined by measurement of liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and liver function testing including total&#xD;
      bilirubin, albumin and INR. Cardiac function will be determined by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      and serum brain natriuretic peptide and troponin. Endocrine function will be determined by&#xD;
      measurement of serum LH, FSH, TSH, free T4, testosterone (males) and fasting glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After completion of the trial, patients will continue to be followed by their&#xD;
      hematologist. If the phlebotomy is safe and feasible, their physician may choose to continue&#xD;
      with phlebotomy but this would not be standard practice and there is not evidence to support&#xD;
      the intervention at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The analysis of the results of this study will be descriptive. A screening log will&#xD;
      be kept and the number of patients screened for this study will be recorded. Patients who are&#xD;
      eligible to participate and who give informed consent will be described according to the&#xD;
      following parameters: age, gender, underlying indication for transplant, type of transplant,&#xD;
      number of red cell transfusions received prior to transplant, number of red cell transfusions&#xD;
      from the start of conditioning until study enrollment and ECOG performance status at time of&#xD;
      study entry. The feasibility of the intervention will be recorded by describing the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who complete the planned series of 12 phlebotomies. In order to&#xD;
      consider the patients who are unable to complete all 12 phlebotomies, the total number of&#xD;
      actual phlebotomies conducted in the trial will also be recorded and expressed as a&#xD;
      proportion of the total number of planned phlebotomies. The number of phlebotomies per&#xD;
      patient per time period will also be reported. The efficacy of the intervention will be&#xD;
      recorded by describing the changes in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, liver&#xD;
      enzymes and liver function, endocrine parameters and liver and cardiac iron stores as&#xD;
      determined by liver MRI. Cardiac function will also be determined at study entry and 6 and 12&#xD;
      months following the start of the series of 12 planned phlebotomies. The safety of the&#xD;
      intervention will be recorded by evaluating the number of patients who had adverse and/or&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
