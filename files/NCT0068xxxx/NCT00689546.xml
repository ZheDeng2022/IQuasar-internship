      It has been observed that several of patients having prolonged or complicated course of acute&#xD;
      viral hepatitis have underlying diabetes. It is possible that with impaired hepatocyte&#xD;
      regenerating capacity, these patients run a more prolonged and complicated course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that acute hepatitis infection has a prolonged and complicated course among&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral hepatitis is usually a self limited condition characterizes by typical course of&#xD;
      prodrome followed by an icteric phase. In some cases the course may be protracted or&#xD;
      complicated by the development of cholestatic phase or acute liver failure . The development&#xD;
      of complicated course depends on a number of factors such as the type of virus and a variety&#xD;
      of host factors including age of infection, immune status of the host and condition of the&#xD;
      underlying liver before the onset of hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease or cirrhosis have increased risk of&#xD;
      development of decompensation and liver related death when they develop superinfection with&#xD;
      some hepatotropic viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vento etal demonstrated in their classical study that superinfection with hepatitis A on&#xD;
      chronic liver disease is associated with high risk of decompensation and death. In India,&#xD;
      since most of the adult population including those with chronic liver disease has been shown&#xD;
      to have protective antibodies against HAV, this infection is rarely a problem in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has demonstrated to be the most common cause of acute hepatitis,&#xD;
      acute liver failure and subacute liver in India. There is now enough data to suggest that HEV&#xD;
      superinfection is also the commonest cause of acute decompensation of chronic liver disease&#xD;
      in Indian subcontinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these patients do not have any signs and symptoms of preexisting liver disease and it&#xD;
      is the liver failure secondary to HEV superinfection which bring to light the underlying&#xD;
      chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World over, as well as in developing countries nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is&#xD;
      fast emerging as an important causes of chronic liver disease. Obesity and diabetes are two&#xD;
      most important risk factors for NAFLD.It has been estimated that there would be about 366&#xD;
      million diabetes in the world by 2030.Of these 79.4 million will be in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes has been proposed as a risk factor for both chronic liver disease and HCC.The&#xD;
      spectrum of liver involvement ranges from fatty liver, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis to&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Even among patients with NASH, presence of diabetes is annotated with advanced&#xD;
      stage of fibrosis . There is some suggestion that diabetic patients who develop acute viral&#xD;
      hepatitis may have a prolonged course. Liver regeneration capacity has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be impaired among animal and human with fatty liver after partial resection. It is therefore&#xD;
      possible that diabetic by of having NAFLD may have poor regenerating capacity leading to&#xD;
      prolonged course of hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been an observation in our unit that most of the patients who present with acute on&#xD;
      chronic liver failure or subacute hepatic failure have diabetes. Whether it is simply a&#xD;
      co-existence of two commonly occurring diseases (diabetes with a prevalence of 10% in Indian&#xD;
      population and hepatitis E which is endemic(1) in our country) or the presence of acute&#xD;
      hepatitis E in a diabetic patients some how produces a worse outcome as compared to hepatitis&#xD;
      E in a non-diabetic patients. There fore it is important to find out the natural course of&#xD;
      the two commonly occurring diseases when they occur together or separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that acute hepatitis infection has a prolonged and complicated course among&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;
