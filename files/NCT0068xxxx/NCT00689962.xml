  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      I hypothesize that absorbable screw fixation of the foot's Lisfranc ligaments does not yield&#xD;
      significant differences in postoperative foot stability, ligament function, and symptoms when&#xD;
      compared to steel screw fixation. In addition, absorbable screw fixation of the Lisfranc&#xD;
      ligaments offers the advantage that a second surgical procedure to remove the screw is not&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lisfranc ligaments are a group of ligaments that connect the bones of the middle portion&#xD;
      of the foot to each other. The Lisfranc ligaments allow for a normal and stable range of&#xD;
      motion and shape to the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the Lisfranc ligaments are disrupted, the stability it had given to the middle of the&#xD;
      foot is lost. Attempted activity at the foot will result in pain and abnormal motion. If&#xD;
      injury to the Lisfranc ligaments is left untreated, the eventual end result is foot arthritis&#xD;
      and deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard orthopaedic treatment of Lisfranc ligament injuries is surgery. The&#xD;
      Lisfranc ligaments are fixed by compressing the space between the middle bones of the foot&#xD;
      with steel screws. These screws allow for ligament healing. As the ligaments heal, the&#xD;
      patient should not resume activity with the fixed foot too soon as the screw may break. A&#xD;
      second surgical procedure is often recommended to remove the screw 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
      This allows for a complete return of normal foot range of motion, but at the cost of a second&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of materials that can be absorbed by the human body to fix the Lisfranc ligaments has&#xD;
      only been studied in 1 paper. One such material is the Smart Screw (Bionx, Blue Bell,&#xD;
      Pennsylvania) which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) and made of&#xD;
      polylevolactic acid (PLA). Absorbable screws could be ideal for the treatment of Lisfranc&#xD;
      ligament injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing the long-term results of fixing the Lisfranc ligaments with either a steel or&#xD;
      absorbable screw is important as there are no studies on the subject to date. There is only 1&#xD;
      published study regarding absorbable screws to fix the Lisfranc ligaments. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the outcome of steel and absorbable screw fixation of the Lisfranc&#xD;
      ligaments in foot injuries in one surgeon's (J.A.) practice at Thomas Jefferson University&#xD;
      Hospital, Riddle Memorial Hospital, and Nazareth Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in a prospective manner. This study does not focus on&#xD;
      experimental procedures or components, but rather involves the accepted management of a&#xD;
      select population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in a randomized, prospective manner involving 2 groups of&#xD;
      patients (steel vs. bioabsorbable screw populations) from 3 different hospitals. Power&#xD;
      analysis has been conducted to ensure an adequate patient population size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to patients will be minimal. The standard risks of fixing the Lisfranc ligaments&#xD;
      include bleeding, infection, nerve injury, recurrent foot instability, and the dangers of&#xD;
      administering anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups Chosen patients for this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
      Group A will consist of patients that receive the steel screw. Group B will contain the&#xD;
      patients that receive the absorbable screw. Postoperative activity restrictions and&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be kept the same between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine protocols for care of foot fracture patients will be utilized regarding infection,&#xD;
      wound care, pain control, and weightbearing restrictions. The involved foot will be placed in&#xD;
      a non-weight-bearing splint that patients are requested to avoid handling until it is removed&#xD;
      by the PI upon the first postoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have their injury fixed using steel screws, need a second surgery in 6 months&#xD;
      for removal of the screw. This is the standard textbook treatment and is not a revision&#xD;
      surgery. Patients who will receive absorbable screw, wont need this surgery. This will be&#xD;
      discussed with the patient at the time of the approach for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome evaluation The PI will monitor and follow the patients during and after surgery. Data&#xD;
      collection will include the details of the surgery, intraoperative and postoperative course&#xD;
      including complications if applicable, and number of revision surgeries performed should they&#xD;
      occur. These patients received postoperative follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years. Both groups of patients are prohibited from bearing&#xD;
      weight on the affected foot for six weeks. Patients will be instructed to gradually increase&#xD;
      weight-bearing starting at six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative satisfaction and function which will be scored according to the American&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Midfoot scale which is highly accepted for its&#xD;
      validity, reliability, and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked about their satisfaction with the surgical results using both the&#xD;
      10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) and a four-point scale (poor, mild, good, and excellent).&#xD;
      Observed complications including need for further revision surgeries would be documented. All&#xD;
      of this information would have been gathered during the patients' follow-up visits in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics after surgery. For those patients that receive a steel screw, they will&#xD;
      receive a second outpatient surgical procedure after the 6-month postoperative follow-up to&#xD;
      remove that screw using current standard orthopaedic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative foot X-rays of these patients during their follow up in the outpatient setting&#xD;
      will also be examined to view proper alignment and compression of the middle portion of the&#xD;
      foot together which indicates healing of the Lisfranc ligaments. Radiographs are used to&#xD;
      evaluate the screw for breakage. In the case of the absorbable screw, radiographs are also&#xD;
      done to assess absorption.&#xD;
