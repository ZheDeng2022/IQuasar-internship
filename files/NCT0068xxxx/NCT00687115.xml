      This study will investigate how to better predict why some individuals gain or lose weight&#xD;
      more easily than others. It will examine whether the increase in the amount of energy a body&#xD;
      burns in 24 hours with overeating or the decrease over 24 hours with fasting can help&#xD;
      determine how easily someone gains or loses weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people between 18 and 60 years of age who have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5&#xD;
      kg/m(2) and 24 kg/m(2) (for overfeeding study) or a BMI greater than 27 kg/m(2) with a body&#xD;
      weight less than 350 pounds (weight loss study) may be eligible for this study. The study&#xD;
      requires a 10-week admission to the NIH Clinical Center (2-week baseline, 6-week&#xD;
      overfeeding/weight loss, 2-week post-weight change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during the hospital admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination and laboratory studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to assess eating behavior, food preferences, body composition, and&#xD;
           activity level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition assessment (height, weight, waist circumference, and fat mass and&#xD;
           muscle content through DXA and MRI scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meal test to measure the response of certain hormones to food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity monitors to determine activity level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic chamber study to measure calories burned over 24 hours and monitor body&#xD;
           temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Free-living energy use study to measure calories burned under normal home conditions&#xD;
           over 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat and muscle biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intervention: Measurements of food intake and energy loss over a 6-week&#xD;
           overfeeding (1.5 times the subject s normal food intake) or weight loss (one-half the&#xD;
           subject s normal food intake) program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup procedures after the inpatient stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measurements at 6 months (overfeeding study participants) and monthly&#xD;
           for the first year, at 3-month intervals for the second year, and then yearly for 3 more&#xD;
           years (weight loss study participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yearly visits (2-night inpatient stay) for all participants for repeat meal test, DXA,&#xD;
           oral glucose tolerance test, behavioral questionnaires and, in women who can become&#xD;
           pregnant, pregnancy test&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For obese individuals, losing weight and keeping it off are extremely difficult, whereas some&#xD;
      other individuals are thin and report trouble gaining weight. In most weight loss and&#xD;
      overfeeding studies there is a large variation in the amount of weight lost or gained, and it&#xD;
      is not clear whether an individual s response to an intervention can be predicted.&#xD;
      Measurement of the amount of energy an individual uses over 24 hours (24 hour energy&#xD;
      expenditure or 24-EE) and the response of 24-EE to overfeeding and fasting may help predict&#xD;
      which individuals will have the greatest changes in weight with changes in energy balance. In&#xD;
      previous work, 24-EE responses to overfeeding and fasting were related such that individuals&#xD;
      with the greatest increase in 24-EE upon overfeeding tended to have the smallest decrease in&#xD;
      24-EE upon fasting ( spendthrift phenotype) and those individuals with less increase in 24-EE&#xD;
      during overfeeding had a greater decrease in 24-EE with fasting ( thrifty phenotype). Those&#xD;
      with the spendthrift phenotype who had a greater increase in 24-EE in response to overfeeding&#xD;
      gained less weight over time. Furthermore, studies have shown that diets with very low&#xD;
      protein content may magnify the variability in response to overfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if a phenotype defined by 24-EE responses to&#xD;
      overfeeding and underfeeding is related to weight loss or gain in 4 different under- and&#xD;
      overfeeding settings: an inpatient weight loss group for obese individuals who will be&#xD;
      administered one of two diets based on a 50% reduction of their daily energy needs for six&#xD;
      weeks (standard reduction diet or calorie reduced diet that is still high in protein; 6 week&#xD;
      weight reduction, 10 week stay, n=20/standard reduction diet group and n=10/relative high&#xD;
      protein diet), and two overfeeding groups for lean, weight gain resistant individuals: a&#xD;
      low-protein overfeeding group at 150% of daily energy needs for 6 weeks overfeeding (6%&#xD;
      protein, 64% carbohydrate, 30% fat; 10 week stay, n=10), and a normal protein overfeeding&#xD;
      group at 150% of daily energy needs for 6 weeks overfeeding (20% protein, 50% carbohydrate,&#xD;
      30% fat; 10 week stay, n=10). We will also examine additional metabolic and behavioral&#xD;
      measurements to determine how they relate to weight change and changes in 24-EE. These&#xD;
      include sympathetic nervous system activity, behavior, adipose and muscle tissue energy&#xD;
      content, and abdominal adipocyte size. The study will evaluate the relationship between the&#xD;
      percent increase in 24-EE in response to overfeeding/underfeeding and the amount of weight&#xD;
      change over time in each subject. These findings may provide important information for&#xD;
      predicting and adapting specific individualized interventions for obesity.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m(2) for the weight loss protocol but body weight&#xD;
             less than 350 pounds to accommodate the DXA scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI less than or equal to 24 kg/m(2) (and BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m(2)&#xD;
             for the overfeeding protocols. A history of low BMI and difficulty gaining weight.&#xD;
