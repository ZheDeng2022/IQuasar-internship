  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to treatment regimes among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is well documented&#xD;
      in the literature. Unfortunately, few interventions have been successful at improving&#xD;
      adherence rates in this patient population. Within the pediatric population, specifically&#xD;
      adolescents, attitude toward treatment directly effects adherence to treatment. Changing&#xD;
      attitude includes making conscious decisions regarding adherence or non-adherence and should&#xD;
      include an understanding of what outcomes will likely result from nonadherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if attitudes can be enhanced and adherence to treatment regimen&#xD;
      improved in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) adolescent patients by using a simulation game &quot;My Life with&#xD;
      CF&quot; . The target population is CF patients ages 12-21 years. Attitudes will be assessed&#xD;
      utilizing four attitude scales in CF adolescents pre and post experiencing the simulation&#xD;
      game. In the simulation game, patients make life decisions, including CF therapy decisions,&#xD;
      using a fictional character diagnosed with CF. The game has been designed to help players&#xD;
      understand the long-term effects of health care choices. Data from this pilot study will&#xD;
      assess changes in attitudes and reported changes in adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients will be enrolled in the study. These volunteer individuals will complete the&#xD;
      Attitude Assessment Scale and Diet and Treatment form, play the game and provide demographic&#xD;
      data. They will complete the Attitude Assessment Scales again following the game and&#xD;
      debriefing. These individuals will complete the Attitude Assessment Scale and Diet and&#xD;
      Treatment form a third time, one month after playing the game. Historical review indicates&#xD;
      that enrollment for the study can be completed within 10 months after IRB approval is&#xD;
      secured. This allows all aspects of the study to be complete within the one year time frame&#xD;
      established by the funding agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for this study will be identified using study inclusion / exclusion criteria&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: 1) patients with a diagnosis of CF, 2) age 12 - 20 years, 3) capable&#xD;
      of reading and conversing in English, 4) capable and willing to provide assent for study&#xD;
      participation, and 5) presence of a parent/guardian capable of providing informed consent.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are: 1) absence of a parent/guardian or unwillingness to provide&#xD;
      permission, 2) potential participant declines to provide assent 3) the presence of a&#xD;
      healthcare condition that does not meet infection control standards (i.e. patients with&#xD;
      burkodalia cepacia) for participation in the small group setting necessary to play the game.&#xD;
      Patients with MRSA will not be excluded from the study. Patients with MRSA can play the game&#xD;
      alone, with a CMH staff member, study personnel, or sibling. All infection control measures&#xD;
      will be followed according to hospital policy. Members of the study team have identified&#xD;
      patients, based on inclusion criteria, who will qualify for the study. A letter will be&#xD;
      mailed to these patients with a description of the game, study purpose, and time requirement.&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call will be made by a member of the study team to arrange a time when the&#xD;
      patient can play the game. Any questions related to study participation will be answered.&#xD;
      Consent/assent will be obtained prior to filling out the paper work at the start of the game&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient is identified for study inclusion, a study investigator will explain the study&#xD;
      to the parent/legal guardian and the child. If both these individuals express a willingness&#xD;
      to participate, a copy of the informed consent/assent form will be given to them. After both&#xD;
      the parent/guardian and child have read and signed the consent/assent form, a copy will be&#xD;
      given to each of them and placed in the medical record. The original informed consent/assent&#xD;
      form will be kept by the PI with all study materials. The study uses a convenience sampling&#xD;
      methodology so no unique study number will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Treatment Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no treatment groups for this study. Participants will complete an Attitude&#xD;
      Assessment Scale and Diet and Treatment form prior to playing the game and complete the&#xD;
      Attitude Assessment Scales immediately after the game and debriefing. The Attitude Assessment&#xD;
      Scales and Diet and Treatment form will also be filled out again one month after playing the&#xD;
      game. In addition, these individuals will provide self-disclosed demographic data, which will&#xD;
      be used only to describe the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Drugs/Devices/Experimental Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental intervention includes playing the game &quot;My Life with CF.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete an assessment regarding diet and treatment adherence, and&#xD;
      attitudes toward behaviors associated with 1) belief that luck rather than effort determines&#xD;
      what happens to a person in life, 2) belief in personal invulnerability, and 3) making life&#xD;
      decisions without including long-term consequences. After the baseline measure has been&#xD;
      obtained, participants will play the &quot;My Life with CF&quot; game. The attitude assessment scales&#xD;
      will be repeated after the game and debriefing. The attitude assessment scales and Diet and&#xD;
      Treatment form will be repeated one month following the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Observations and Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the &quot;Attitude Assessment Scales provided in Appendix&#xD;
      B. Attitude Scales 1,2 and 3 are the attitude scales validated for the &quot;My Life&quot; game.&#xD;
      Attitude scale 4 was created specifically for the &quot;My Life with CF&quot; game and has not been&#xD;
      validated. Each attitude scale has 20 questions and is based on a likert-type scale with 1&#xD;
      strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree. The first three attitude scales focus on the three&#xD;
      attitudes which have been shown to influence decision making during adolescence. Attitude&#xD;
      scale number one assesses personal invulnerability, attitude scale number two assesses&#xD;
      present versus future considerations, and attitude scale number three measures luck versus&#xD;
      effort. Attitude scale number 4 has an equal number of questions from the above three&#xD;
      categories which are specific to CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur through the utilization of a &quot;My Life with CF&quot; Case Report Form&#xD;
      provided in Appendix C. All study participants' personal health information will be kept&#xD;
      confidential in compliance with Federal Law and institutional guidelines. All research case&#xD;
      report forms will be kept in Kathy Christenson's office within a secured cabinet and&#xD;
      destroyed in accordance with policy and procedures in place regarding research data.&#xD;
