  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Milataxel is a new taxane that may have several advantages over the currently available&#xD;
      taxanes. The current study is designed to determine the response rate of oral Milataxel in&#xD;
      patients with malignant Mesothelioma. The study specifically targets patients who have&#xD;
      recurring or progressive disease following previous chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open label, single agent phase II study. Patients with&#xD;
      malignant mesothelioma that has recurred or progressed following chemotherapy, and who&#xD;
      qualify for this study, will receive milataxel 60 mg/m2 orally on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle. If&#xD;
      no toxicities of greater than Grade 1 severity occur, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 for the&#xD;
      second and subsequent cycles. Patients will receive drug for a total of six cycles. Milataxel&#xD;
      administration in excess of six cycles will be permitted at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator if patients have stable or responding disease.&#xD;
