      RATIONALE: Learning about the effect of exemestane on bone mineral density in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women at increased risk of breast cancer may help plan treatment, decrease the risk of broken&#xD;
      bones, and help patients live more comfortably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is measuring bone mineral density in postmenopausal women at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing breast cancer who are receiving exemestane on clinical trial&#xD;
      CAN-NCIC-MAP3.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by dual x-ray&#xD;
           absorptometry (DEXA) scans of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip 2 years after&#xD;
           randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the percentage change in BMD as measured by DEXA scans of the spine (L1-L4),&#xD;
           and total hip 5 years after randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop BMD of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip&#xD;
           below the absolute threshold value for osteoporosis (T score ≤ -2.5 SD below the mean&#xD;
           peak bone mass in young women) in the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the pattern of changes in BMD parameters and bone biomarkers (i.e., PINP and&#xD;
           NTx) over time and the impact of covariants using exploratory longitudinal analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop clinical skeletal fractures in the&#xD;
           treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual x-ray absorptometry&#xD;
      (DEXA). Blood specimens are collected at baseline and at 1 year, and 5 years and stored in a&#xD;
      central laboratory for future assays of the bone biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject withdraws from the core MAP.3 study before 5 years, a bone density measurement&#xD;
      and serum for bone biomarkers is obtained unless performed within the past 3 months. Patients&#xD;
      may continue to be followed on the MAP.3 core study for fractures (and other MAP.3 study&#xD;
      endpoints) for a minimum of 5 years after randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Increased bone turnover may be a risk factor for fracture [Lønning 2005]. However, it is uncertain whether markers of bone resorption and markers of bone formation are both associated with fracture risk [Looker 2000]. Therefore, we will measure bone formation and bone resorption markers at baseline, year 1 and year 5. Blood specimens will be shipped to and stored in a central laboratory for future assays of bone biomarkers. For markers of bone formation, the N-terminal Propeptide of Type I Collagen (PINP) will be measured. For bone resorption markers, serum levels of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) will be measured. Note: Subjects must fast 12-14 hours prior to blood draw.</description>

    <description>BMD of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip will be done within 12 months prior to randomization to the MAP.3 core protocol. BMD by DEXA of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip will be repeated at year 2 and year 5 of the MAP.3 core study on the same Lunar or Hologic scanner.</description>

        Eligible women consenting to be randomized to the core MAP.3 trial will be approached for&#xD;
        participation in this companion study. They must have an acceptable quality BMD scan by&#xD;
        DEXA taken within 12 months prior to randomization to MAP.3. A BMD T-score &gt; -2.0 SD (i.e.&#xD;
        2.0 standard deviations below the average peak BMD of a young adult woman) has been&#xD;
        established as the study population cut-off because postmenopausal women who have BMD&#xD;
        T-scores as low as or lower than - 2.0 SD are currently recommended to consider&#xD;
        pharmacological therapies for their bones&#xD;
