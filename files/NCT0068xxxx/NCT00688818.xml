  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centred study will be conducted at three centres. The design will be a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group one. This investigation will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      add-on Quetiapine XR (extended release) treatment for patients who meet diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for depressive disorders and one or more comorbid anxiety disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective is to examine the beneficial effect of quetiapine augmentation of&#xD;
      first-line antidepressants in refractory depression with co-morbid anxiety, compared to&#xD;
      placebo. It is hypothesized that significant improvement on depression and anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      will be seen as evidenced by reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and&#xD;
      Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores after the 12 week treatment period for those who&#xD;
      received Quetiapine XR augmentation compared to those who received placebo.2.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1) To establish the tolerability and safety of Quetiapine XR versus&#xD;
      Placebo in patients with co-morbid depressive and anxiety disorders;2) To assess and compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of Quetiapine XR versus Placebo improving quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      co-morbid depressive and anxiety disorders.; 3) To assess and compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR versus Placebo on clinical measures symptoms associated to co-morbid depressive&#xD;
      and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
