      Hypothesis: Early detection, and treatment, of BK virus infection after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation will prevent BK virus associated kidney transplant injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BK virus associated nephropathy (BKVN) is estimated to cause a progressive kidney transplant&#xD;
      injury in 1-10% of renal transplant recipients. Diagnostic and monitoring strategies for BKVN&#xD;
      is still being developed. Detectable virus in the blood by polymerase change reaction-test&#xD;
      (PCR) is predictive of BKVN. Additionally, PCR provides a objective estimate of the degree of&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If early detection and treatment of BK virus infection is effective in preventing subsequent&#xD;
      kidney transplant injury has not been studied. However, renal injury and dysfunction develops&#xD;
      late in the natural course of BKVN and it seems likely that screening in combination with&#xD;
      early treatment would be beneficial for long-term transplant survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no established treatment for BK virus infection. Nevertheless, in kidney&#xD;
      transplanted patients diagnosed with BK virus infection, immunosuppression is reduced to&#xD;
      allow the patients own immune system to handle the virus. However, reduction of&#xD;
      immunosuppression has not been associated with rejection. This indicate that these patients&#xD;
      were over-immunosuppressed, predisposing them to BKVN. Therefore, to compare the degree of&#xD;
      immunosuppression in BKVN patients (over-immunosuppressed) to other patients (not&#xD;
      over-immunosuppressed) could yield interesting information. One possibility would be to&#xD;
      quantify these patients specific cellular immune response to BK virus but also to other&#xD;
      viruses (T cell reactivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide (Arava) is an immunosuppressive drug, approved for the treatment of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, and has been used in more than 300,000 patients worldwide. Furthermore,&#xD;
      leflunomide has been used safely in humans after clinical kidney and liver transplantation&#xD;
      for more than 300 days. In addition to leflunomide's value in preventing rejection, it has&#xD;
      been shown to exert inhibitory effects on different viruses. Recently published pilot studies&#xD;
      suggest that leflunomide treatment of patients with BKVN significantly reduces the amount of&#xD;
      BK virus in blood and prevents recurrence of kidney transplant injury. At Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital, leflunomide has been used for treatment of BKVN and, in some of the&#xD;
      patients, renal function has stabilized and BK virus load has decreased significantly.&#xD;
