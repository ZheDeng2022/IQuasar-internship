  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two different zinc formulations&#xD;
      (dispersible Zinc tablets versus Zinc suspension) for the treatment of acute diarrhea in&#xD;
      hospital based settings. Additionally we intend to compare the effectiveness of treatments of&#xD;
      different groups on the basis of usage of Zinc in the treatment of diarrhoea, and to monitor&#xD;
      additional treatment components such as ORS, antibiotic usage rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open randomized trial in children designed to measure the impact and efficacy&#xD;
      of daily zinc administration. There will be two groups in the study, one group will receive&#xD;
      Zinc in the form tablets, other will receive in the form of suspension, both of these groups&#xD;
      will also receive recommended treatment of diarrhea as per WHO protocol and these groups will&#xD;
      be enrolled from the patients admitting in the Paediatric Unit of Civil Hospital, Hyderabad&#xD;
      and NICH, Karachi with the complain of acute diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention study will be undertaken in hospital based settings. A total recruitment of&#xD;
      300(150 each in each group) has been targetted during the study duration. The duration of&#xD;
      this study shall be 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief history will be taken regarding the current illness and will be noted down in the&#xD;
      specific forms. After the history the patient will be completely examined by the duty&#xD;
      doctors, examination will emphasize of the vitals, status of dehydration and anthropometry.&#xD;
      Patient will then be randomized in one of the groups and the procedure of using Zinc tablets&#xD;
      or suspension will be explained to the mother or caretaker.The patient will be advised&#xD;
      treatment according to the general condition and state of the dehydration and general health.&#xD;
      All treatments will be noted down in the specific forms to have a record of what have been&#xD;
      given to the patient and to keep the record of fluid intake. Stool samples for the detailed&#xD;
      report and culture and sensitivity will be collected &amp; sent to have the information regarding&#xD;
      the status of stool and any isolated organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be followed &amp; examined thoroughly every 8 hourly till the time of&#xD;
           discharge by a trained RMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each follow up, details of illness characteristics, including the number and&#xD;
           character of stools and vomiting, will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information regarding the associated symptoms including fever, abdominal pain distension&#xD;
           and dysentery will be obtained. Hydration status, vitals and weight will also be&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RMO will record about the proper dosages of zinc and confirm that weather or not patient&#xD;
           is taking his medications during every follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RMO will also document the recovery of diarrhea in terms of reduction in frequency and&#xD;
           duration of diarrhoea and all the information will be noted in the assigned follow up&#xD;
           forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any adverse effect of the associated with the Zinc will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance will be measured by reported intake and by measuring the remaining volume of&#xD;
           syrup in the returned bottles and number of tablets used in the blisters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of discharge a discharge summary form is also filled by RMO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients who will be discharged will be followed at home for a total of two weeks of&#xD;
           illness.&#xD;
