  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase I portion of study is designed to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      BSI-201 with two clinically relevant dosing regimens of temozolomide (TMZ). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives in the phase I trial include determining the PK of BSI-201 in malignant glioma&#xD;
      patients and correlating BSI-201 PK with degree of PARP-1 inhibition. A safety run-in will&#xD;
      confirm the safety of BSI-201 added to standard TMZ and radiation therapy and the phase II&#xD;
      portion of the study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of the MTD dose of BSI-201&#xD;
      with daily TMZ and radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM and assess overall survival as the primary outcome measure. Information on each&#xD;
      phase of the study will be listed when each phase opens for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess&#xD;
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been&#xD;
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,&#xD;
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of&#xD;
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell&#xD;
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.&#xD;
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (i.e. the patient must be able&#xD;
             to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have the following hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. Absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dl, total&#xD;
             bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 mg/dl, transaminases &lt; 4 times above the upper limits of the&#xD;
             institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The anti-proliferative activity of this&#xD;
             experimental drug as well as the standard drug (temozolomide) may be harmful to the&#xD;
             developing fetus or nursing infant&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a Mini Mental Status Exam score of &gt; 15&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have tumor tissue form completed and signed by a pathologist. See&#xD;
             section 9.6 for details&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I Criteria (Phase I Patients ONLY)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically proven supratentorial malignant glioma (anaplastic&#xD;
             astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or glioblastoma multiforme)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have received at least 80% of planned temozolomide and radiation therapy&#xD;
             with no grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity attributed to the temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received planned treatment with radiation therapy and concomitant&#xD;
             temozolomide at least 28 days but no more than 49 days prior to starting treatment on&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have Gadolinium MRI or contrast CT scan within 28 days of starting&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize&#xD;
             the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with&#xD;
             reasonable safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding. The anti-proliferative activity of this&#xD;
             experimental drug and temozolomide may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing&#xD;
             infant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients receiving concurrent therapy for their tumor (i.e. chemotherapeutics or&#xD;
             investigational agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a concurrent or prior malignancy are ineligible unless they are patients&#xD;
             with curatively treated carcinoma-in-situ or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
             Patients who have been free of disease (any prior malignancy) for greater than five&#xD;
             years are eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients cannot be receiving cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAEDs; e.g.,&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbazepine) and must not have&#xD;
             taken them for at least 10 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I Ineligibility Criteria (Phase I Patients ONLY)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had repeat craniotomy for tumor therapy after receiving RT and TMZ&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who received other chemotherapeutics or investigational agents in addition to&#xD;
             their radiation therapy and concomitant temozolomide treatment. Patients who have&#xD;
             received Gliadel wafers are eligible for this study&#xD;
