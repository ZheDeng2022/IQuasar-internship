      The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between gastric residence time of&#xD;
      the SmartPill Capsule and the time required for partial emptying of a standard radiolabeled&#xD;
      meal as measured by gastric emptying scintigraphy for subjects 65 years of age and older.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric emptying scintigraphy is considered the gold standard for evaluating gastric emptying&#xD;
      and is widely available. Accurate characterization of gastric emptying may guide medical and&#xD;
      surgical treatment choices. In addition, these techniques may allow for monitoring of&#xD;
      therapeutic results for follow-up patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for&#xD;
      characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that&#xD;
      houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing&#xD;
      signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The&#xD;
      capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature&#xD;
      data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is&#xD;
      downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation. This trial is for subjects 65&#xD;
      years of age and older.&#xD;
