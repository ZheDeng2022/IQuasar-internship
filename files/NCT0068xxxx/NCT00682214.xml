    <textblock>
      Hypovitaminosis D is common in Asian Indians despite plenty of sunshine and relates to their&#xD;
      skin pigmentation and poor sunshine exposure. Serum 25(OH)D levels are &lt;20 ng /ml in up to&#xD;
      90% of them and therefore, based on the modern cut off, majority of apparently healthy normal&#xD;
      Asian Indians would be classified as vitamin D deficient. Though, several investigators have&#xD;
      highlighted the paradox of hypovitaminosis D in sunny Indian environment, there are only&#xD;
      limited studies which have assessed its functional significance. To date, the significance of&#xD;
      low serum 25(OH)D in them have been analyzed in terms of its inverse relationship with serum&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone levels and variable association with reduced bone mineral content at hip&#xD;
      and spine on DXA. Recently we have shown impairment in the absorption of intestinal calcium&#xD;
      in 25(OH)D and its reversal after eight weeks of cholecalciferol supplementation. Present&#xD;
      study is being taken to further understand the functional significance of 25(OH)D in terms of&#xD;
      its effect on Skeletal muscle strength including its energy metabolism, bone mineral&#xD;
      homeostasis and Th1/Th2 cytokines expression in Asian Indians with chronic biochemical&#xD;
      hypovitaminosis D&#xD;

      Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that plays an important role in calcium metabolism and&#xD;
      bone health. In recent years, biomarkers like PTH, calcium absorption have been used to&#xD;
      define relevant biological indices of vitamin D nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of 25(OH)D in Asian Indians Several studies from India have shown wide prevalence&#xD;
      of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in India, Goswami et al studied serum 25 (OH)D levels and its&#xD;
      functional significance in apparently healthy subjects residing in Delhi. In this study three&#xD;
      groups of subjects (soldiers, depigmented person and physicians and nurses) were studied in&#xD;
      winter. Other three groups namely pregnant women, newborns and physicians and nurses were&#xD;
      studied in summer. All the groups except one with maximum sunlight exposure (soldiers) had&#xD;
      subnormal concentration of serum 25(OH) D levels. Vitamin D deficient groups tended to have&#xD;
      an imbalance in bone mineral homeostasis when exposed to winter and low dietary calcium and&#xD;
      high dietary phytate, with significantly low serum calcium and elevated PTH.On the basis of&#xD;
      the studies related to the intestinal calcium absorption, inverse relation with serum iPTH&#xD;
      concentration and protection from fracture risk, a recent consensus has suggested that an&#xD;
      ideal health based normal cutoff of circulating serum 25(OH) D would at least be 32 ng/mL.&#xD;
      Interestingly, using the above consensus, recent studies conducted at AIIMS, by Goswami et al&#xD;
      , have shown that 94.3% of the apparently healthy northern Indian subjects residing in Delhi&#xD;
      were vitamin D deficient (AJCN 2006, BJN 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Significance of 25(OH)D deficiency Though there have several studies highlighting&#xD;
      widespread prevalence of 25(OH)D in Asian Indians, there is paucity of data on its functional&#xD;
      significance. Relevant studies assessing functional significance of VDD in Asian Indians are&#xD;
      summarized below (Am J Clin Nutr 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Effects on Serum PTH levels Goswami et al while reporting low serum 25(OH) D&#xD;
      concentrations in healthy subjects in Delhi, showed a higher serum PTH levels &amp; significant&#xD;
      inverse relation between serum 25(OH) D and PTH levels ( r = -0.6303, p &lt; 0.001) in all the&#xD;
      three groups (soldiers, physicians &amp; nurses, depigmented persons) studied in winter (Am J&#xD;
      Clin Nutr 2006) B) Effects on BMD Recently,we have analyzed relationship between BMD and&#xD;
      serum 25(OH) D in 105 apparently healthy Asian Indian. The cohort of 105 subjects was split&#xD;
      into 2 groups at a serum 25(OH) D cutoff of 9.0 ng/mL. The mean serum iPTH was significantly&#xD;
      higher in the group 1 (&lt;9.0 ng/ml)than in the group 2 subjects (53.1±31.3 and 39.3±17.5&#xD;
      pg/mL, respectively; P=0.012).The mean BMD values of the total hip, including femoral neck,&#xD;
      trochanter, and intertrochanter, were significantly (P = 0.001) lower in group 1 than in&#xD;
      group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Effects on intestinal calcium absorption Effect of VDD on intestinal calcium absorption in&#xD;
      Asian Indians with chronic hypovitaminosis D and its change after cholecalciferol&#xD;
      supplementation was studied recently at our Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Study&#xD;
      subjects were 29 apparently healthy volunteers [17 M, 12 F, mean (SD) age = 28.4 ± 6.4 year]&#xD;
      with low serum 25(OH)D levels [mean (SD) = 7.6 ± 4.8 ng/ml]. Intestinal calcium absorption&#xD;
      was assessed by 'calcium load test' (PAK test) (10) using 1 gm of oral elemental calcium load&#xD;
      before and after (n = 26) supplementation with oral cholecalciferol (60,000 IU/week for eight&#xD;
      weeks). This study showed that the vitamin D Deficiency is physiologically relevant in terms&#xD;
      of intestinal calcium absorption in Asian Indians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Effects on physical performance and related skeletal muscle strength Zamboni et al showed&#xD;
      a significant association between serum 25(OH)D levels and muscle strength and physical&#xD;
      performance as noticed in 6 - minute walk test in elderly women. However to date there has&#xD;
      been no study which has systematically assessed role of cholecalciferol supplementation in&#xD;
      improving muscle strength a randomized placebo controlled trial in apparently healthy who&#xD;
      have chronic hypovitaminosis D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study would include 40 apparently healthy volunteers (medical and paramedical&#xD;
      staff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete evaluation of daily dietary intake including calcium and phytic acid will be done by&#xD;
      semiquantitative of frequency questionnaire and 24 - h recall method using published data of&#xD;
      nutritive value of Indian food. Subjects will be enquired about their average duration of sun&#xD;
      exposure between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and average body surface area exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation (Before vitamin D supplementation) Serum total calcium, inorganic&#xD;
      phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact PTH and 25(OH) D assays. At baseline, assessment of&#xD;
      bone density at hip, spine and forearm would also be performed by DEXA&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline isokinetic gastrosoleus strength testing will be done using a computerized&#xD;
      dynamometer (Biodex Medical System) in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      under the guidance of Professor U Singh, Head, Department of Department of Physical Medicine&#xD;
      &amp; Rehabilitation, AIIMS.. Subjects will perform three maximal planter flexion repetitions&#xD;
      with right lower limb at 180 degree/sec. The peak strength will be recorded in Newton.&#xD;
      Handgrip strength will be measured in right hand by hand dynamometer. The average of two&#xD;
      measurement of grip strength will be used for analysis (in kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory muscle strength testing will be done using a digital instrument (Micromedical&#xD;
      respiratory pressure meter) and measuring the maximal inspiratory pressure &amp; maximal&#xD;
      expiratory pressure in the Department of Medicine under the guidance of Dr Randeep Guleria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical performance will be tested by performing 6 - minute walk test using standard&#xD;
      protocol and results will be interpreted in terms of 6 minute walk distance in meters and&#xD;
      degree of shortness of breath using modified Borg dyspnea scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      31P MRI spectroscopy would be performed in all the of subjects for muscle energy parameters,&#xD;
      in the department of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance under the guidance of Professor NR Jagnathan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mRNA expression Th1 and Th2 cytokines would be assessed in the PBMC drawn from 5 ml of&#xD;
      the peripheral blood using the real time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the 40 subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio (Active: placebo) into treatment group&#xD;
      and placebo group in 2:1 ratio in a double blind manner. Random code would be generated by a&#xD;
      investigator, who will not be involved in distribution of medicines and assessment of the&#xD;
      muscle strength Active drug would be calcium (two tablets of calcium carbonate each&#xD;
      containing 500 mg of elemental calcium/day, and 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol/week obtained&#xD;
      from the commercial source. The inactive drug would be lactose containing identical placebo&#xD;
      obtained from the same source. All study subjects will be provided with packets containing&#xD;
      four sachets of cholecalciferol (each containing 60000 IU vitamin D3; Cadila Pharmaceutical,&#xD;
      India) /placebo; and sixty tablets of calcium carbonate (500mg elemental calcium &amp; 250 IU&#xD;
      vitamin D3; Elder Pharmaceutical, India)/placebo. First dose will be supervised. Subjects&#xD;
      will be counseled for daily intake of two tablets of calcium carbonate and weekly intake of a&#xD;
      cholecalciferol sachet and follow up at completion of 4 weeks. Similar packets will be given&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of follow up. Drug compliance will be assessed by counting the empty sachets.&#xD;
      After eight week subjects will be provided daily two tablets of calcium carbonate containing&#xD;
      500 mg elemental calcium each and 250IU of Vitamin D3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year Repeat evaluation at 8 weeks and six months and&#xD;
      one year would include serum intact PTH &amp; 25(OH) D levels estimation, skeletal muscle&#xD;
      strength testing, respiratory muscle strength testing and 6 minute walk test 31P MRS and&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of Proposed Interventions Cholecalciferol dose of 60000 IU/week × 8 weeks is&#xD;
      considered safe to be used in healthy subjects, as shown in our recent study. Also in another&#xD;
      study done at Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, AIIMS as a DM dissertation work by&#xD;
      Dr. Ajay Gupta, the same dosage of vitamin D was supplemented to a cohort of 29 apparently&#xD;
      healthy individuals. None of the study subject developed hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.&#xD;
      Study by A Malabanan et al (Lancet 1998) also showed that 50000 IU replacement of vitamin for&#xD;
      8 weeks effectively normalize 25(OH)D levels, and corrects secondary hyperparathyroidism with&#xD;
      no adverse effects.&#xD;
