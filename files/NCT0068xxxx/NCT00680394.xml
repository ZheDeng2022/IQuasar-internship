    <textblock>
      A double blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial to compare the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      acceptability of two medical abortion regimens up to 63 days' LMP. The first regimen will&#xD;
      include a 200 mg oral dose of mifepristone followed by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol. The second&#xD;
      regimen will include two 800 mcg doses of buccal misoprostol. We hypthesize that both methods&#xD;
      work well, but that the mifepristone regimen will have an efficacy rate of approximately 95%,&#xD;
      and misoprostol alone will be closer to 90%. We will consider a greater than 5% difference to&#xD;
      be clinically meaningful.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-surgical abortion methods have the potential to improve the quality and safety of women's&#xD;
      reproductive health in the developing world. However, until recently, widespread availability&#xD;
      and utilization of medical abortion with mifepristone in low resource countries has been&#xD;
      restricted by the limited availability of mifepristone and perceived high cost of the drug,&#xD;
      while the low and varied rates of efficacy of the misoprostol alone regimens have hindered&#xD;
      its widespread adoption. In recent years, a handful of new mifepristone and misoprostol&#xD;
      products have come to the market, easing the availability and reducing the cost of both&#xD;
      drugs, and therefore making their introduction in new settings more feasible. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      mifepristone is much more expensive than misoprostol (approximately $4 - 6 a tablet versus&#xD;
      $0.35 a tablet) and often a large part of the cost of the medical abortion cost. In this&#xD;
      respect, this study provides an important opportunity to better understand the real&#xD;
      difference in efficacy of the two regimens in addition to the costs and benefits of these two&#xD;
      non-surgical abortion regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will contribute greatly to the literature on medical abortion. First, it will be&#xD;
      the first randomized trial to compare two buccal regimens (and the second ever to compare&#xD;
      mifepristone+misoprostol with misoprostol alone. Second, if proven efficacious, it promises&#xD;
      to offer alternative regimens for use in women with gestations up to 63 days' LMP. Third, it&#xD;
      may create evidence in support of shortening the time to abortion completion, by offering all&#xD;
      women in the mifepristone arm the chance to complete their abortions 24 hours after&#xD;
      mifepristone, instead of the standard 48 hours later. Lastly, it provides a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to systematically and in a non-biased manner, compare the side effects and&#xD;
      acceptability of these two regimens, thereby creating more information to help providers and&#xD;
      policy makers debate the relative costs and benefits of these two medical abortion regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 700 women will be recruited. We assume that the efficacy of mifepristone plus&#xD;
      buccal misoprostol is approximately 95%. The efficacy of misoprostol alone for medical&#xD;
      abortion, via the vaginal route, is 88%. The efficacy of misoprostol alone via the buccal&#xD;
      route is not known, nor is the efficacy via the buccal route with repeat dosing after a 24&#xD;
      hour interval. We expect that the efficacy with buccal misoprostol should be similar to that&#xD;
      with vaginal misoprostol based on both pharmokinetic and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that the efficacy of mifepristone plus buccal misoprostol in our research settings&#xD;
      will be 95%. A difference in efficacy of buccal misoprostol alone of at least 5% (90%) is&#xD;
      clinically meaningful to providers and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using alpha = 0.05 with a one-sided test and power = 0.80, the number needed to demonstrate&#xD;
      this difference is 664 (334 in each arm). Assuming 5% will drop out or not complete the&#xD;
      protocol, we plan to enroll a total of 700 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is efficacy; safety, acceptability and side effects will be assessed as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;
