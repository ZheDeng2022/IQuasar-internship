  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commercially-available internal nasal stents placed inside the nostril should produce&#xD;
      decreased nasal obstruction detectable subjectively (volunteers will fill out a survey) and&#xD;
      objectively (degree of obstruction will be measured with a rhinomanometer which measure&#xD;
      resistant of airflow while breathing through nose).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal rhinomanometry provides a measure of the airflow through the nose during inspiration&#xD;
      and expiration. The effect of static obstructions, such as septal deviation, as well as&#xD;
      dynamic obstructions, such as lateral nasal wall collapse, can be measured by the&#xD;
      rhinomanometer. The effect of commercially available nasal stents on nasal airflow will be&#xD;
      measured. In subjects chosen from the general population, some of whom may not complain of&#xD;
      nasal obstruction, the airflow will be measured before and after the placement of removable&#xD;
      nasal silastic stents. In addition, these subjects will complete a one question scale in the&#xD;
      Likert model to rate the degree of their subjective nasal obstruction; they will complete&#xD;
      this both before and after placement of the stents. The results of the scale before and after&#xD;
      application of the stents will be correlated with the objective measurements of airflow by&#xD;
      rhinomanometry taken before and after stent insertion.Several studies have measured the&#xD;
      effect of external nasal splints (such as Breathe-Rite strips) on nasal airflow and nasal&#xD;
      airway size (as measured by acoustic rhinometry), but few have studied internal nasal stents.&#xD;
      No studies have correlated rhinomanometric evaluation of effect on nasal obstruction by nasal&#xD;
      stents with the validated NOSE survey (Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation). In patients&#xD;
      with a chief complaint of nasal obstruction and who are noted to have anterior nasal&#xD;
      obstruction, nasal stents may provide a satisfactory improvement in nasal airflow without&#xD;
      surgical or medicinal intervention. For patients who are determined to be candidates for&#xD;
      surgical intervention, the surgical procedure is tailored to their specific anatomic&#xD;
      deformities, as determined by the staff facial plastic surgeon. While the patient's complaint&#xD;
      of nasal obstruction as well as the surgeon's assessment of the nasal anatomy are important&#xD;
      components in the determination of the need for surgical intervention, no studies have&#xD;
      utilized the validated NOSE instrument of subjective complaint of nasal obstruction combined&#xD;
      with objective measurements of dynamic airflow. Rhinomanometric measurements can be used to&#xD;
      further validate the NOSE instrument both preoperatively and postoperatively.&#xD;
