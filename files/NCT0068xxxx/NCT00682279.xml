    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of oral topotecan administered in combination with&#xD;
      lapatinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This Phase I study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan administered in combination with&#xD;
      lapatinib. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will investigate&#xD;
      the impact of lapatinib on the bioavailability of oral topotecan (bioavailability phase) and&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will consist of dose finding to determine the maximum-tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) regimen of the combination (dose escalation phase). In Part 2 of the study, the dose of&#xD;
      oral topotecan will be escalated while lapatinib will be given initially as fixed doses. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to determine the MTD regimen of oral topotecan administered&#xD;
      for five-consecutive days every 21 days in combination with daily lapatinib in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential (i.e. women with functioning ovaries and no documented&#xD;

             weeks prior to the first does of investigational product and for 28 days after the&#xD;
             final dose of investigational product. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used&#xD;
             consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the&#xD;
             physician, are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the&#xD;
             sole sexual partner for that female.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that&#xD;
             do not permit compliance with the protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients&#xD;
