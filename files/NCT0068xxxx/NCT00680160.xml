      The purpose of the study is to determine the absorption, systemic pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      accumulation in the nail of AN2690 during a 28 day period of daily application of a 7.5%&#xD;
      solution of AN2690 to all 10 toenails of up to 25 otherwise healthy adult patients with&#xD;
      onychomycosis.&#xD;

      For this study, the case definition of onychomycosis included moderate to severe distal&#xD;
      subungual onychomycosis including subjects with evidence of subungual dermatophytoma or&#xD;
      yellow spikes, lateral and proximal onychomycosis and severely dystrophic nail plates.&#xD;
      Subjects with only superficial white onychomycosis were excluded. Confirmation of the&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis of at least one great toenail included a positive KOH wet&#xD;
      mount.&#xD;
