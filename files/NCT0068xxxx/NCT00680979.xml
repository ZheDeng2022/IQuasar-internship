  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can help reduce excessive&#xD;
      weight gain in adolescent girls. It will compare the effectiveness of IPT with a teen health&#xD;
      education program in preventing weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent girls between 12 and 17 years of age who are at risk for becoming overweight&#xD;
      adults, by virtue of being above average weight and experiencing episodes of loss of control&#xD;
      over eating, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened in two visits with the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview and questionnaires about the child s general health, social and psychological&#xD;
           functioning and eating patterns and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA scan to measure body fat, muscle and bone mineral content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory test meal. The child fills out a rating scale about her level of hunger and&#xD;
           is then given a food buffet from which she is instructed to eat as much as she wants.&#xD;
           Immediately after eating, the child again completes the hunger rating forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview about the child s mood and psychological functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assigned at random to either the IPT or teen health education program. All&#xD;
      participants have a 1- to 1 1/2-hour individual session with a therapist, followed by 12&#xD;
      weekly group sessions of 1 1/2 hours each in their assigned program. They are assessed at the&#xD;
      end of the program with questionnaires and body measurements. They return to the clinic after&#xD;
      6 months for body measurements, blood test, DXA scan, questionnaires, interview and a test&#xD;
      meal, and again at 1 year for body measurements, questionnaires and a DXA scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The most prevalent disordered eating pattern described in overweight youth is loss of control&#xD;
      (LOC) eating, during which individuals experience an inability to control the amount of food&#xD;
      they are consuming. LOC eating appears to be associated cross-sectionally with greater&#xD;
      adiposity in children and adolescents, and appears to predispose youth to gain weight or body&#xD;
      fat above that expected due to normal growth, thus likely contributing to obesity in&#xD;
      susceptible individuals. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), a form of psychotherapy that has&#xD;
      been adapted for the treatment of eating disorders, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      binge eating episodes and inducing modest weight loss (or at least weight stabilization)&#xD;
      among adults diagnosed with binge eating disorder. We adapted group IPT for the targeted&#xD;
      prevention of excessive weight gain (IPT-WG) among adolescent girls. Our pilot data support&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week group IPT-WG trial among adolescent girls at&#xD;
      high risk for obesity who report LOC eating, and preliminary findings suggest that IPT-WG has&#xD;
      the potential to prevent excessive weight gain. We now propose an adequately powered clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of IPT-WG compared to a standard-of-care health education for&#xD;
      stabilizing weight and body fat gain trajectories in 117 adolescent girls at high risk for&#xD;
      adult obesity who report LOC eating. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12-week&#xD;
      group IPT-WG or health education group; anthropometric variables will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately after, and for up to 1 year following the initiation of treatment. We&#xD;
      will assess the efficacy of IPT-WG in improving social functioning and reducing negative&#xD;
      mood, disturbed eating patterns, and emotional distress. We also aim to determine the impact&#xD;
      of IPT-WG on objective measures of LOC eating during a test meal and on appetitive hormones.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 12 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI between 75th and 97th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal laboratory testing, including negative urine glucose and&#xD;
             normal electrolytes, hepatic, and thyroid function, or they will be referred for&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as&#xD;
        needed):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic&#xD;
             (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological problems or&#xD;
             pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous medication).&#xD;
             Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an obesity-related medical complication that would require a more&#xD;
             aggressive weight loss intervention approach. Such comorbidities include&#xD;
             hyperlipidemia (LDL-cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL), hypertension (defined by&#xD;
             age-, sex-, and height- specific standards fasting hyperglycemia (fasting glucose&#xD;
             greater than 100 mg/dL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (ALT above NIH Clinical&#xD;
             Center laboratory norms with consistent radiologic findings and absence of another&#xD;
             cause such as infectious hepatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of prescription medications. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted,&#xD;
             provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting&#xD;
             study. Individuals taking medications for most conditions will be excluded, but&#xD;
             medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis. In particular, participants currently prescribed SSRIs,&#xD;
             neuroleptics, tricyclics, stimulants, or any medication known to affect body weight or&#xD;
             eating will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current involvement in psychotherapy or a structured weight loss program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight loss during the past 2 months for any reason exceeding 3 per cent of body&#xD;
             weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or recently pregnant girls (within 1 year of delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an eating disorder or a current eating disorder (other than binge eating&#xD;
             disorder) as determined by medical history or if uncovered during the study s&#xD;
             structured clinical interviews. Subjects found to have an eating disorder other than&#xD;
             binge eating disorder at baseline will be referred to mental health specialists for&#xD;
             further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or breast feeding. A negative pregnancy test before starting the&#xD;
             study will be required. Because pregnancy is a state in which weight gain is expected&#xD;
             and appropriate, pregnant individuals would not be suitable for this study. Sexually&#xD;
             active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These methods include&#xD;
             total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives ( the pill ), an intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections&#xD;
             (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom&#xD;
             is recommended. Should a participant in the IPT-WG group become pregnant during the 12&#xD;
             weeks of therapy, she will be excluded from the group sessions. The girl s IPT-WG&#xD;
             therapists will closely assist her in obtaining an appropriate referral to a community&#xD;
             mental healthcare provider. The IPT-WG leaders will request a release of information&#xD;
             so that they may communicate with the community therapist in order to facilitate a&#xD;
             smooth transition for the girl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have DSM-IV-TR major depressive disorder, psychoses, current substance&#xD;
             or alcohol abuse, conduct disorder, or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder&#xD;
             completion of the study. Individuals whose parents or guardians have current substance&#xD;
             abuse or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators, would impede adherence with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to participate in a group due to psychiatric or cognitive functioning.&#xD;
             School placement (e.g. grade level) will be used as an estimate of cognitive&#xD;
             functioning. The decision to include or exclude subjects for this reason is left&#xD;
             entirely to the discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition in the adolescent or her parents or guardians that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigators, would impede compliance or possibly hinder completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
