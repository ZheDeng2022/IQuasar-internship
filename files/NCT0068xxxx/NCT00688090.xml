  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-component active immunotherapy, MKC1106-MT, consists of 1 plasmid dose and 2&#xD;
      peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens&#xD;
      (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1,4, 15 and 18&#xD;
      of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the&#xD;
      treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into superficial inguinal&#xD;
      lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
