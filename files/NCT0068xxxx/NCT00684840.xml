  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the extent to which stress and other factors, including money, the&#xD;
      amount of drug available and the amount of work effort, affect drug choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess whether exposure to yohimbine, a drug stressor, increases opioid&#xD;
      craving- and -seeking behavior. We will determine whether these behavioral outcomes are&#xD;
      associated with biobehavioral stress markers: increased saliva cortisol levels,&#xD;
      cardiovascular response (heart rate and blood pressure), and negative mood state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical, environmental, and pharmacological stressors have been repeatedly shown to increase&#xD;
      self-administration of various abused substances in both preclinical and human studies. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the proposed work is to assess the effects of yohimbine, a pharmacological&#xD;
      agent, used to create an objectively-measured stress response, upon opioid-seeking behavior&#xD;
      and craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first be an outpatient and must come to the Jefferson Avenue Research&#xD;
      Program daily to receive buprenorphine doses. This phase will last at least 10 days or&#xD;
      longer. Three times per week during the first two weeks (i.e., on 6 different days),&#xD;
      participants will be asked to provide urine samples and to complete questionnaires that ask&#xD;
      about opiate withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, participants will live on an inpatient research unit for at least 11 consecutive nights&#xD;
      and possibly up to 15 consecutive nights. During this stay they will participate in a total&#xD;
      of eight experimental sessions. Participants will take part in multiple trials in which they&#xD;
      have the opportunity to choose drug, hydromorphone (HYD), or money. HYD is a drug that is&#xD;
      currently used as a cough suppressant and to relieve pain. During the first two test&#xD;
      sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. Before&#xD;
      each of the final 6 test sessions begin, participants will be given a capsule containing&#xD;
      either different doses of the drug yohimbine or a placebo (blank). Yohimbine is a drug that&#xD;
      has been shown to produce a &quot;stress&quot;-like response in humans. Then participants will have 12&#xD;
      opportunities to choose either drug or money by using a computer to earn choices. Respiration&#xD;
      rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice&#xD;
      trials. Self-report questionnaires will be completed at different times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants have completed the experimental procedures, they will again come to the&#xD;
      Jefferson Ave. Research Program daily to receive buprenorphine doses. The dose of&#xD;
      buprenorphine will be gradually decreased so that they will eventually be free from&#xD;
      medication. This will take three weeks. We will administer questionnaires and collect urine&#xD;
      samples three times each week to assess using illicit drugs.&#xD;
