  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential&#xD;
      immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. However, four&#xD;
      primary factors limit the generation of effective immune mediated anticancer activity in&#xD;
      therapeutic application:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identifying and/or targeting cancer associated immunogen(s) in an individual patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. insufficient or inhibited level of antigen presenting cell priming and/or presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. suboptimal T cell activation and proliferation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. cancer-induced inhibition of the anticancer immune response in both afferent and&#xD;
           efferent limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to overcome these limitations, we have designed a novel autologous vaccine to&#xD;
      address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the&#xD;
      immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance.&#xD;
      We have completed clinical investigations using two different gene vaccine approaches to&#xD;
      induce enhancement of tumor antigen recognition which have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
      Specifically, both the use of a GMCSF gene transduced vaccine and a TGFβ2 antisense gene&#xD;
      vaccine, in separate trials, have demonstrated similar beneficial effects without any&#xD;
      evidence of significant toxicity in advanced cancer patients. The GMCSF transgene directly&#xD;
      stimulates increased expression of tumor antigen(s) and enhances dendritic cell migration to&#xD;
      the vaccination site. TGFβ2 blockade following intracellular TGFβ2 antisense gene expression&#xD;
      reduces production of immune inhibiting activity at the vaccine site. These agents have never&#xD;
      been used in combination but the rationale of integrating enhancement of an anticancer immune&#xD;
      response concurrently with a reduction in cancer-induced immune suppression is conceptually&#xD;
      sound. We will harvest autologous cancer cells from patients with advanced refractory cancer.&#xD;
      We have constructed a TGFβ2 antisense / GMCSF expression vector plasmid and have successfully&#xD;
      demonstrated preclinical activity of the vector function following transfection by&#xD;
      electroporation and irradiation of autologous cancer tissue.&#xD;
