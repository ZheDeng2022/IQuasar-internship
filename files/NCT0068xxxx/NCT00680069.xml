  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating&#xD;
      individuals who have previously received an avian influenza vaccine derived from one type of&#xD;
      H5N1 virus with a vaccine derived from a different type of avian influenza virus. A second&#xD;
      reason for this study is to compare responses in people who have received two different but&#xD;
      similar types of H5N1 vaccine to the responses in subjects who receive 2 doses of only the&#xD;
      H5N1 vaccine used in this study. The information obtained may provide important information&#xD;
      into the usefulness of a pre-pandemic vaccination. Participants will include 600 healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers, ages 19 and older, in the United States. Study procedures include: physical&#xD;
      exams, vaccination with either a low dose (15 micrograms) or high dose (90 micrograms) of&#xD;
      vaccine, blood samples, and maintaining a memory aid to record oral temperatures and side&#xD;
      effects. Study participation will be approximately 7 months.&#xD;

      The goals of this study are to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      a single dose of monovalent subvirion influenza vaccine produced from a clade 2 A/H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine administered by intramuscular injection to healthy adults and the elderly who have&#xD;
      previously received at least 2 doses of clade 1 A/H5N1 vaccine. In addition, this study will&#xD;
      compare these results to individuals who are receiving 2 doses of the clade 2 A/H5N1 vaccine&#xD;
      for the first time. The primary objective of the study is to compare the immune response&#xD;
      following a single low-dose (15 mcg) to a single high-dose (90 mcg) of influenza vaccine&#xD;
      derived from the clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 in individuals who have previously&#xD;
      received at least 2 doses of an influenza vaccine derived from the clade 1 virus&#xD;
      A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A/VN/1203/04). The secondary objectives will: compare the immune&#xD;
      response following a single low-dose (15 mcg) or single high-dose (90 mcg) of influenza&#xD;
      vaccine derived from the clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 in individuals who have&#xD;
      previously received at least 2 doses of an influenza vaccine derived from the clade 1 virus&#xD;
      A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A/VN/1203/04) to a group that has not received any previous A/H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine but who will receive 2 doses of an influenza vaccine derived from the clade 2 virus&#xD;
      A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05; evaluate the factors associated with immunologic response to a single&#xD;
      dose of a vaccine derived from a clade 2 virus among individuals who have previously received&#xD;
      at least 2 doses of vaccine derived from a clade 1 virus; evaluate the safety of a single&#xD;
      dose of subvirion inactivated vaccine derived from the clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05&#xD;
      in individuals who have previously received at least 2 doses of an influenza vaccine derived&#xD;
      from the clade 1 virus A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A/VN/1203/04); explore immunologic responses&#xD;
      following vaccination with a clade 2 vaccine from A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 to influenza strains&#xD;
      other than A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05, including A/VN/1203/04; evaluate the immune responses of&#xD;
      previously unvaccinated individuals after 1 or 2 doses of clade 2 virus&#xD;
      A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 vaccine; and evaluate the duration of antibody responses following 1&#xD;
      or 2 doses of vaccine derived from the clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05. This study will&#xD;
      recruit 600 healthy volunteers aged 19 years or older, in the United States, who have&#xD;
      previously participated in a linked DMID-sponsored study. This study is linked to DMID&#xD;
      protocols 04-063, 05-0090, 04-076, 05-0015, 05-0127, 05-0141, 06-0089, 04-062, 06-0052, and&#xD;
      08-0030. The study will be conducted at up to 7 vaccine centers. Subjects who previously&#xD;
      received at least 2 doses of the clade 1 vaccine derived from the A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004&#xD;
      virus will be randomized to receive a single dose of either 15 mcg or 90 mcg of a clade 2&#xD;
      vaccine derived from the A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 virus in a 1:1 ratio. H5 na√Øve subjects who&#xD;
      previously received at least 2 doses of a placebo will be randomized to receive 2 doses of&#xD;
      either the 15 mcg or 90 mcg of a clade 2 vaccine derived from the A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05&#xD;
      virus in a 1:1 ratio. Volunteers will be observed in the clinic for 15 minutes after&#xD;
      inoculation, and will maintain a memory aid to record oral temperature and systemic and local&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) for 8 days following each vaccination. Volunteers will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone 1 to 3 days after each vaccination to assess for the occurrence of AEs, and they&#xD;
      will return to the clinic 8-10 days after each vaccination for AE and concomitant medication&#xD;
      assessment, a targeted physical examination (if indicated), and review of the memory aid. T&#xD;
