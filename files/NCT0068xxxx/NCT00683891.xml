  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZUR Pharma has received several reports from practicing psychiatrists prescribing FazaClo&#xD;
      showing that FazaClo patients start losing body weight instead of keep gaining it, after&#xD;
      being switched from other clozapine products or other atypical antipsychotics treatments.&#xD;
      Another important clinical observation reported by doctors is a considerable reduction in&#xD;
      hypersalivation when FazaClo administration is compared to other antipsychotic treatments.&#xD;
      Based on the findings described above, and on the real need for effective and safer&#xD;
      treatments for schizophrenia, AZUR Pharma has decided to design and conduct an observational&#xD;
      study in a large number of patients taking FazaClo to prove the received clinical reports&#xD;
      from physicians. Better understanding and evaluation of these beneficial findings are&#xD;
      necessary to provide physicians information for improved treatment decision.&#xD;
