  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis is often associated with severe functional deficits resulting in a range&#xD;
      of progressive impairments. Approximately 80% of patients have bladder symptoms at the time&#xD;
      of diagnosis and up to 97% will have bladder symptoms during the course of the disease. To&#xD;
      date, the vast majority of treatment has been centered on the use of medications to control&#xD;
      &quot;bladder spasms&quot; and the use of catheters to help patients empty the bladder. There have been&#xD;
      very few studies looking at medications like Alfuzosin that may help in controlling bladder&#xD;
      symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis. Alfuzosin has been shown to significantly improve voiding&#xD;
      symptoms and bladder emptying in patients with prostatic enlargement. There have been no&#xD;
      controlled studies yet to determine whether this treatment helps patients with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis. The purpose of this study is to determine if Alfuzosin improves bladder symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of Alfuzosin in the&#xD;
      treatment of bladder dysfunction in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Twenty (20) participants aged 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis and lower urinary tract symptoms will be treated with Alfuzosin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a single institution, non-randomized, non-blinded pilot study of the use of&#xD;
      Alfuzosin in the treatment of bladder dysfunction in MS patients. After the initial screening&#xD;
      visit patients will be given 10 mg of Alfuzosin to be taken daily once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INSTRUMENTS The primary end points of this study are a reduction in the ICIQ&#xD;
      questionnaires and improvement in uroflow, post-void residual (PVR) and voiding diaries. All&#xD;
      patients will have a detailed history and physical examination at the beginning of the study&#xD;
      and at 12 weeks follow-up. Women will have a pregnancy test at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be given the ICIQ questionnaires, uroflow and PVR at the screening visit&#xD;
      and at week 6 and 12. In addition, these patients will be asked to maintain a three day&#xD;
      voiding diary prior to week 2 and week 12. Assessments for safety (blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate) will be collected at baseline and at the last visit. Blood tests will be performed to&#xD;
      check for liver, kidney and prostate problems at the baseline visit. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded at all visits and when spontaneously reported by the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY The study will be 12 weeks in duration.&#xD;
