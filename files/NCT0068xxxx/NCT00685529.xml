      The purpose of this study is to compare the blood levels of arformoterol tartrate inhalation&#xD;
      solution to racemic formoterol in male and female subjects with mild to moderate Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, multiple dose, 3-way crossover, multicenter, inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient study to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of arformoterol tartrate&#xD;
      inhalation solution and Foradil® in male and female subjects with mild to moderate COPD. Up&#xD;
      to 36 subjects (with a minimum 40% of each gender) were to be randomized to ensure that at&#xD;
      minimum 24 subjects completed the study. The study included 3 dose periods and 3 washout&#xD;
      periods. Subjects received 3 different treatments in random order for 13 consecutive days and&#xD;
      a single dose on the morning of the 14th day. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of the&#xD;
      6 possible treatment sequences. During each dose period, subjects received medication via&#xD;
      nebulization or DPI twice daily for 13 consecutive days and a single dose on the morning of&#xD;
      the 14th day. There was be a 10 day washout period between each treatment. Subject&#xD;
      participation was be approximately 13 weeks and included a screening visit and 7 study&#xD;
      visits. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was&#xD;
      acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed&#xD;
      to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.&#xD;
