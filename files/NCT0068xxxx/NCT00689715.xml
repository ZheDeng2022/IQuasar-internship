  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic lesions of the pancreas are defined as round, fluid-filled structures within the&#xD;
      pancreas detected by radiologic imaging. With widespread use of cross-sectional imaging&#xD;
      modalities for various indications, such lesions are now detected in nearly 20% of abdominal&#xD;
      imagings, with the majority discovered incidentally. These lesions encompass a wide spectrum&#xD;
      of histopathologic entities and biologic behavior, ranging from benign to malignant.&#xD;
      Substantial morphologic overlap restricts the accuracy in diagnosing specific type of cystic&#xD;
      lesion in spite of recent advances in diagnostic modalities. It is a challenging issue to&#xD;
      differentiate each cystic lesion and make a management plan since cystic lesions that are&#xD;
      relatively common and asymptomatic may possess malignant potential. Although inflammatory&#xD;
      pseudocysts were thought to account for 80-90% of cystic lesions of the pancreas, with cystic&#xD;
      tumors accounting for the remaining,10 the latter may occur much more frequently than&#xD;
      traditionally estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, surgical resection is generally recommended for malignant and potentially malignant&#xD;
      lesions. However, surgical resection of the pancreas still carries substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      sometimes mortality, especially for the cystic lesion located in the head portion. Therefore,&#xD;
      management should be individualized by risk-benefit analysis for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a pilot study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage for cystic tumors of the pancreas&#xD;
      reported that complete resolution was achieved in only one-third of patients even though&#xD;
      epithelial lining ablation was demonstrated in all resected specimens. Therefore, more&#xD;
      effective treatment modalities or ablation agents are required to improve treatment&#xD;
      responses. Intratumoral or intraperitoneal injection of chemotherapeutic agent has been used&#xD;
      for endobronchial lesions of lung cancer, brain tumors and advanced ovarian cancer.13-16&#xD;
      EUS-guided injection of antitumor material has been reported in advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Although local injection of chemotherapeutic agents into pancreatic cystic tumors has not yet&#xD;
      been reported, it is reasonable to suggest that such an approach may have an additive effect&#xD;
      on ablation of the epithelial lining of cystic tumor when combined with ethanol lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, inhibits cell processes that are dependent&#xD;
      on microtubule turnover. Due to its highly hydrophobic nature,19 paclitaxel is expected to&#xD;
      exert its effect longer when instilled within a closed cavity such as a cyst. The hydrophobic&#xD;
      and viscous nature of paclitaxel may reduce the possibility of it leaking through a puncture&#xD;
      site and causing complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluated safety, feasibility and response following EUS-guided ethanol&#xD;
      lavage with paclitaxel injection (EUS-EP) for treating cystic tumors of the pancreas.&#xD;

    <description>A curvilinear-array echoendoscope and a 22 gauge needle were then used for cyst fluid aspiration, ethanol lavage and paclitaxel injection. The maximum possible volume of cyst fluid was aspirated, and the needle tip was carefully maintained inside the cyst to avoid parenchymal injury. Ethanol was injected into the collapsed cyst until the original shape was restored, and a lavage was then performed for 3-5 minutes. Pure ethanol (99%) was used for all patients except the first 2 in whom 88% ethanol was used. After reaspiration of the injected ethanol, the cyst cavity was injected with a solution containing 3 mg/mL paclitaxel and the needle then carefully retracted. The high viscosity of paclitaxel necessitated dilution in 0.9% normal saline for administration via a 22G needle. The volume of the paclitaxel solution administered was the same as the volume of the cyst fluid aspirated.</description>
