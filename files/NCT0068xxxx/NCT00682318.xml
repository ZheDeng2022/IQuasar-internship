  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) recently&#xD;
      encouraged &quot;increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish or capsule form&#xD;
      (1 g/day) for risk reduction&quot; and stated that &quot;for treatment of elevated triglycerides,&#xD;
      higher doses are usually necessary for risk reduction&quot; (Smith SC et al. Circulation&#xD;
      2006;113:2363-72). These recommendations are based on conflicting evidence about the efficacy&#xD;
      of the omega-3 treatment with data derived from single randomized trials or non-randomized&#xD;
      studies (Smith SC et al. Circulation 2006;113:2363-72). Much effort has been undertaken to&#xD;
      elucidate the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the development of cardiovascular disease, but&#xD;
      even recent meta-analyses deliver no clear picture; they either favor (Mozaffarian D Jama&#xD;
      2006;296:1885-99) or reject (Hooper L Bmj 2006;332:752-60) the hypothesis of cardioprotective&#xD;
      effects of omega-3 FAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the clinical study is to study the effects of fish oil on blood and urinary&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and cell stress. By using different permutations of high-dose&#xD;
      supplementation of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids versus different alimentary omega-3 fish&#xD;
      doses and grain alcohol versus different kinds of red wine, this trial will study how omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids, ethanol and red wine constituents modulate biomarkers of inflammation and cell&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 21 - 60,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in good health as based on medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             vital signs, and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All Subjects have to adhere to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be non-smoking volunteers (both male and non-pregnant females) due to a&#xD;
             significant influence of smoking and overweight on the outcome measures of lipid&#xD;
             peroxidation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be of normal weight with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 25. The correlation between&#xD;
             the BMI number and body fatness is fairly strong; however it varies by sex, race, and&#xD;
             age. These variations include the following examples: At the same BMI, women tend to&#xD;
             have more body fat than men; at the same BMI, older people, on average, tend to have&#xD;
             more body fat than younger adults; highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because&#xD;
             of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness; source at&#xD;
             http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_BMI/index.html. Therefore,&#xD;
             subjects with a BMI &gt; 25 can be enrolled at the discretion of the PI in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must be using a medically acceptable method&#xD;
             of contraception (oral contraception, depo-provera injection, IUD, condom with&#xD;
             spermicide, diaphragm, cervical cap, progestin implant, abstinence, tubal ligation,&#xD;
             oophorectomy, TAH) throughout the entire study period. All female subjects must&#xD;
             consent to a urine pregnancy test at screening and just prior to the start of each&#xD;
             treatment phase of the study (first study visit, every ethanol administration visit,&#xD;
             at first visit of fish oil administration), and during the third week of fish oil&#xD;
             administration. All pregnancy tests must be negative at all time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must be surgically sterile and/or agree to use condoms throughout the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons who consume vitamin supplements are required to undergo a &quot;washout period&quot; of&#xD;
             ≥ five weeks without supplement prior to study enrollment (in analogy to Block G, et&#xD;
             al. Am J Epidemiol 2002; 156: 274)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine ethanol assessment indicating abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who have received an experimental drug, used an experimental medical device&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to screening, or who gave a blood donation of ≥ one pint within 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any coagulation, bleeding or blood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with nutritional inefficiencies in Fe, Zn, Cu, Mg (according to 61)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sensitive or allergic to fish, fish oil or fish-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any evidence of cancer or history of significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
             (including stroke or TIA), renal, hepatic, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic,&#xD;
             hematopoietic or neurological disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a systolic blood pressure above 160 or a diastolic blood pressure above&#xD;
             95,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any evidence of GI disorders that could interfere with fat absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an intention to lose weight during their participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any abnormal laboratory value or physical finding that according to the&#xD;
             investigator may interfere with interpretation of the study results, be indicative of&#xD;
             an underlying disease state, or compromise the safety of a potential subject. Subjects&#xD;
             who have had a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin &gt; 6% indicating chronic alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete abstinence from alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of more than three alcoholic drinks per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of cancer, including skin cancer&#xD;
