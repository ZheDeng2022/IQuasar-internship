  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the side effects and tolerability of the drug lithium in patients&#xD;
      with spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCA1) an inherited disorder caused by loss of nerve cells&#xD;
      in parts of the brain. Symptoms include ataxia (difficulty walking) and loss of muscle&#xD;
      coordination and strength. Recent studies suggest that lithium may be helpful in treating&#xD;
      some SCA1 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 65 years of age with SCA1 who have only difficulty walking or who have&#xD;
      difficulty walking as well as tremor, hand incoordination or speech problems, may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participation requires three hospital admissions at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      and one outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 1 (2-6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of SCA1 symptoms (balance, walking, dexterity, tremor, memory, mood and&#xD;
           concentration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of liquid intake and output (urine) and weight changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lithium treatment Start treatment and remain in hospital until the blood level of the&#xD;
           drug is stabilized; continue treatment at home after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 2 (2-4 days, 4 weeks after hospital discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat of some or all of the procedures done at the first admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue lithium in hospital and at home after discharge, with local physician checking&#xD;
           laboratory values as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 3 (2-4 days, 8 weeks after Admission 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat of some or all of the procedures done at other admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stop lithium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Visit (4 weeks after Admission 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of SCA1 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of tolerability and safety of lithium in SCA1 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 molecularly diagnosed SCA1 patients divided in two groups. One group would be&#xD;
      composed of 5 patients with gait difficulty only and 5 patients with gait difficulty and&#xD;
      tremor, hand incoordination or speech difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for initiation and titration of Lithium&#xD;
      until high therapeutic levels currently accepted for the treatment of Bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorder are achieved (1.0-1.2 mmol/L) or a maximum tolerated dose. During their admissions,&#xD;
      they will have neurological evaluations, ataxia and tremor evaluations, timed-up-and-go&#xD;
      testing, quality of life assessment, questionnaires evaluating sleep, balance confidence and&#xD;
      depression, memory testing, alertness assessment and quantitative balance/sway evaluations.&#xD;
      Parameters and side effect profiles will be assessed at baseline, 1 month (plus or minus 5&#xD;
      days) and 3 months (plus or minus 5 days) after achievement of therapeutic levels. They will&#xD;
      also have an exit evaluation one month (plus or minus 5 days) after discontinuation of&#xD;
      Lithium also at the NIH. For their baseline evaluation and titration, patients will be&#xD;
      admitted to the NIH for 4 weeks plus or minus 2 weeks. Evaluation at 1 month (plus or minus 5&#xD;
      days) and 3 months (plus or minus 5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Side effect profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Timed-up-and-go test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ICARS score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SARA score&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Modified Falls Efficacy Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quantitative Sway/Balance assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tremor Rating Scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part A Tremor location/severity rating&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part B Handwriting and drawings&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part C Functional disabilities resulting from tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Questionnaires related to sleep, depression (Beck Depression Inventory) (BDI), alertness&#xD;
           (Computerized Continuous Performing Tasks) and memory (Mini Mental State Examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Dexterity evaluation At-Home Testing Program device&#xD;
