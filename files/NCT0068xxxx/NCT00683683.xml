      Background: One of the 2010 Impact Goals of the Emergency Cardiac Care (ECC) Committee of the&#xD;
      American Heart Association is to double survival from cardiac arrest. Currently,&#xD;
      approximately 60% of adults and 50% of paediatric patients that regain spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation following cardiac arrest die before leaving the hospital. A key piece of the&#xD;
      &quot;chain of survival&quot; is this fifth link; the care of patients post-arrest. Although there are&#xD;
      several modalities recommended for post arrest care, therapeutic hypothermia is the only&#xD;
      in-hospital therapy that has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials to improve&#xD;
      patient outcome after cardiac arrest. Despite the strong evidence for its efficacy and the&#xD;
      apparent simplicity of this intervention, recent surveys show that hypothermia is delivered&#xD;
      inconsistently, incompletely, and with undue delay in hospitals receiving resuscitated&#xD;
      patients; only 26% of physicians and 26% of hospitals regularly institute a hypothermia&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To design and apply a knowledge translation program for the 2005 AHA&#xD;
      guideline on hypothermia post cardiac arrest and enable effective implementation of&#xD;
      hypothermia in 100% of eligible OHCA patients. The integration of two robust data collection&#xD;
      systems, which include both pre-hospital and in-hospital indicators, will give complete&#xD;
      process of care and clinical outcome information for all cardiac arrest patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: the proportion of eligible out of hospital cardiac arrest patients cooled&#xD;
      to 32-34°C within 6 hours of ED arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This project will be implemented through an established research collaborative&#xD;
      of 43 hospitals in southern Ontario currently participating in the Toronto site of the&#xD;
      Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. A stepped wedge study design will be employed, whereby the&#xD;
      intervention will be rolled-out sequentially to the participating hospitals over a number of&#xD;
      time periods as sites reach pre-defined benchmarks. The multifaceted KT strategy will include&#xD;
      1) local multidisciplinary champions in ED, ICU, and Cardiology 2) A simple protocol for&#xD;
      application of hypothermia, tailored to local needs and policy; 3) Identification of&#xD;
      perceived and actual barriers to knowledge use; 4) Development of an implementation tool kit&#xD;
      and 5) Providing timely feedback on benchmarks for hypothermia and outcomes&#xD;

      Substantial resources are spent in providing emergency medical services to victims of&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The science of pre-hospital medicine has advanced&#xD;
      considerably over the past decade. Specifically, EMS services and medical directors have&#xD;
      developed carefully designed protocols, intensive training, and very substantial resources,&#xD;
      in attempting to improve the immediate outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. It is anticipated that approximately 200-400 patients per year in the Greater Toronto&#xD;
      Area are successfully resuscitated by Emergency Medical Services personnel and be admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with intact circulatory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many of these patients will then die following hospital admission, from one of&#xD;
      a variety of complications of the initial cardiac arrest. The &quot;in-hospital attrition rate&quot; is&#xD;
      approximately 50%, and is the result of short and longer-term organ damage suffered during&#xD;
      the circulatory arrest, as well as in-hospital complications including pulmonary,&#xD;
      neurological, septic, and multi-organ dysfunction related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although guidelines for specific aspects of intensive care therapy of critically ill patients&#xD;
      have been developed (for example, ventilation guidelines, sepsis prevention and therapy&#xD;
      guidelines, treatment of metabolic disorders, etc), practical guidelines, which are&#xD;
      specifically aimed at the investigation and treatment of patients resuscitated from&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, do not currently exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies (in press) suggest that a program of comprehensive and consistent&#xD;
      adherence to a specific set of standard procedures in intensive care units can lead to a&#xD;
      substantial improvement in the survival of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. One&#xD;
      recent example is a study from Oslo Norway, which showed substantial improvements in survival&#xD;
      to discharge following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after a set of informal guidelines were&#xD;
      adopted by participating intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple reasons for the lack of clearly articulated guidelines and protocols for&#xD;
      the investigation and treatment of patients resuscitated following cardiac arrest however the&#xD;
      two most obvious are lack of understanding of the current recommended best practices and&#xD;
      practical impediments to their efficient implementation in all units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC), an NIH funded multi-centre effort, seeks to&#xD;
      randomize over 10,000 patients in selected North American sites to study specific&#xD;
      interventions designed to improve long term survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. As part of this consortium, intensive care units in the ROC hospitals are being&#xD;
      invited to join a new best practice initiative entitled &quot;Strategies for Post Arrest Care in&#xD;
      the ICU&quot; (SPARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with more than 50 hospitals across Ontario, the objectives of the SPARC Project are&#xD;
      planned as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a network of intensive care units, with medical and nursing leaders who&#xD;
           will participate in a collaborative program designed to standardize, monitor, and&#xD;
           improve the care of patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a series of standardized protocols and processes for the care of patients&#xD;
           following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with particular emphasis on the delivery of&#xD;
           post cardiac arrest mild hypothermia. These protocols will be based on best evidence to&#xD;
           date and will focus on the simplifying the processes required implement the recommended&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct pragmatic clinical trials of the integrated post cardiac arrest protocol&#xD;
           versus historical controls, and study related patient outcomes such as survival to&#xD;
           hospital discharge. We will also look to provide a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
           in-hospital complications, the incidence of presumed myocardial ischemic events causing&#xD;
           cardiac arrest, and to assess the causes of in-hospital and post discharge morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality for the one year following discharge, as a function of the presumed underlying&#xD;
           cause of cardiac arrest and the in-hospital course.&#xD;
