      The goal of the current study is to determine the role of dairy in similarly preventing&#xD;
      weight and fat re-gain in obese adults who have successfully completed a weight loss diet&#xD;
      program.240 obese subjects will undergo a meal-replacement-based weight loss plan designed to&#xD;
      produce a 10 kg weight loss in 8-12 weeks. Upon achieving the weight loss goal, subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either a low-dairy or high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance diet&#xD;
      for two years. Macronutrient distribution will be maintained constant and set at&#xD;
      approximately the U.S. average. Primary outcomes include changes in body weight, body fat and&#xD;
      anatomical distribution of fat (via dual x-ray absorptiometry) and resting metabolic rate and&#xD;
      substrate oxidation (via respiratory calorimetry); Secondary outcomes include blood pressure,&#xD;
      circulating glucose, insulin, lipids and calcitrophic hormones. on prevention of weight&#xD;
      regain in humans has not yet been assessed in clinical trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dietary calcium plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism, as we have found&#xD;
      high calcium diets to attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion and weight gain during periods of&#xD;
      over-consumption of an energy-dense diet and to increase lipolysis and preserve thermogenesis&#xD;
      during caloric restriction, thereby markedly accelerating weight loss. Our studies of the&#xD;
      agouti gene demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating adipocyte lipid&#xD;
      metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca2+ resulting in&#xD;
      stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and suppression of lipolysis,&#xD;
      resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the increased&#xD;
      calcitriol produced in response to low calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca2+ influx and,&#xD;
      consequently, promotes adiposity, while higher calcium diets inhibit lipogenesis, promote&#xD;
      lipolysis, lipid oxidation and thermogenesis and inhibit diet-induced obesity in mice.&#xD;
      Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in attenuating weight and&#xD;
      fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy products versus&#xD;
      supplemental calcium is likely due to additional bioactive compounds in dairy which act&#xD;
      synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are confirmed by both&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical data which demonstrates that increasing dietary calcium results&#xD;
      in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in the absence of caloric&#xD;
      restriction and markedly accelerates the weight and body fat loss secondary to caloric&#xD;
      restriction, while dairy products exert markedly greater (nearly two-fold compared to calcium&#xD;
      supplements) effects. These data indicate an important role for dairy products in both the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of obesity. However, weight maintenance following successful weight&#xD;
      loss (i.e. prevention of regain) is at least as important as strategies to initially achieve&#xD;
      weight loss, as most individuals who successfully lose weight are not successful in&#xD;
      maintaining this weight loss. We have recently demonstrated that ad libitum re-feeding of&#xD;
      dairy-rich following weight loss in mice on an energy restricted mice prevented the&#xD;
      suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis and fat oxidation that otherwise accompanies such&#xD;
      re-feeding and markedly upregulated skeletal muscle fat oxidation. Consequently, although&#xD;
      animals re-fed low calcium diets rapidly regained all of the weight and fat that had been&#xD;
      lost, animals fed high calcium diets exhibited a shift in energy partitioning and a 50-85%&#xD;
      reduction in weight and fat gain; moreover, dairy exerted markedly greater effects than&#xD;
      supplemental calcium on weight and fat regain. However, the effect of dairy on prevention of&#xD;
      weight regain in humans has not yet been assessed in clinical trials. Accordingly, the goal&#xD;
      of the current study is to determine the role of dairy in similarly preventing weight and fat&#xD;
      re-gain in obese adults who have successfully completed a weight loss diet program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      340 obese subjects will undergo a meal-replacement-based weight loss plan designed to produce&#xD;
      a 10 kg weight loss in 8-12 weeks. Upon achieving the weight loss goal, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either a low-dairy or high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance diet for&#xD;
      two years. Macronutrient distribution will be maintained constant and set at approximately&#xD;
      the U.S. average. Primary outcomes include changes in body weight, body fat and anatomical&#xD;
      distribution of fat (via dual x-ray absorptiometry) and resting metabolic rate and substrate&#xD;
      oxidation (via respiratory calorimetry); Secondary outcomes include blood pressure,&#xD;
      circulating glucose, insulin, lipids and calcitrophic hormones.&#xD;
