    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the drug ranibizumab (Lucentis) can help prevent vision loss&#xD;
      in people with macular telangiectasia, a condition in which new blood vessels grow in the&#xD;
      retina at the back of the eye and can leak. Such changes in blood vessels are seen in other&#xD;
      diseases associated with changes in a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF). Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF drug that is effective in treating another eye disease,&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration, with similar changes in eye blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with macular telangiectasia in both eyes with no new blood&#xD;
      vessel growth in either eye may be eligible for this study. They must have vision better than&#xD;
      20/400 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ranibizumab injections in the study eye at least four times over 12 weeks. Depending on&#xD;
           the response to treatment and the side effects, additional injections may be given every&#xD;
           4 weeks for up to 1 year. The eye is numbed before the injection and the eye area is&#xD;
           cleaned with an antiseptic. Antibiotic drops are used for 3 days following the injection&#xD;
           to prevent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations before starting treatment, at the time of each injection, and 8 weeks after&#xD;
           the last treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye examination with dilation, microperimetry and photography: The eye examination&#xD;
                measures visual acuity, eye pressure and eye movements. For the microperimetry&#xD;
                test, subjects sit in front of a computer screen and press a button when they see a&#xD;
                light on the screen. Measurements and photographs of the retina are also taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography to examine the blood vessels in the&#xD;
                eye: A dye called fluorescein or indocyanine green is injected into a vein in the&#xD;
                arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A camera&#xD;
                takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy test: Women who are able to become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                before each ranibizumab injection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retinal telangiectasis is a group of rare, idiopathic retinal vascular anomalies affecting&#xD;
      the retinal capillaries in which irregular capillary dilation and incompetence occur in the&#xD;
      macula. This is the group 2 in the Gass classification of idiopathic juxtafoveal&#xD;
      telangiectasia in which fluorescein angiography showed leakage with capillary dilation. These&#xD;
      patients typically are diagnosed in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Both sexes may be&#xD;
      affected. Minimal exudation, superficial retinal crystalline deposits, and right-angle&#xD;
      venules characterize this disorder. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. Because of&#xD;
      the leakage of the retinal vessels and also the finding of neovascularization, it is possible&#xD;
      that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be implicated in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of ranibizumab for the treatment&#xD;
      of eight participants with macular telangiectasia with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography, with vision better than 20/400, without neovascularization. The primary outcome&#xD;
      of this study will be the proportion of participants that lose 15 letters or more in ETDRS&#xD;
      BCVA at 12 months compared with baseline. The secondary outcomes measured at one year will&#xD;
      include the proportion of participants who lose 10 letters or more, the mean change in ETDRS&#xD;
      BCVA, the change in central retinal thickness, the extent of fluorescein leakage, the change&#xD;
      in fundus autofluorescence, change in size of neovascular membrane and the change in central&#xD;
      retinal sensitivity. This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of treating patients with macular telangiectasia in a larger, phase III study within&#xD;
      the organization of the MAC TEL Research Group, sponsored by the Lowy Foundation. Currently,&#xD;
      the research group is enrolling 200 patients affected with this condition for a natural&#xD;
      history study in 22 international clinical centers.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have macular telangiectasia in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have vision loss of better than 20/400 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to permit&#xD;
             good quality stereoscopic fundus photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             baseline, and be willing to undergo testing immediately prior to each injection and&#xD;

             drugs (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, anecortave acetate, Protein Kinase C&#xD;
             inhibitors, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
