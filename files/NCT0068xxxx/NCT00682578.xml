  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major public health problem in many provinces of Afghanistan the failure rate of&#xD;
      chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) treated Plasmodium falciparum(Pf) malaria has risen to&#xD;
      more than 60% overall and as high as 90% in Jalalabad. CQ remains fully effective against P&#xD;
      vivax, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) remains effective against P falciparum (10-15% of&#xD;
      cases fail to cure). The current malaria treatment protocol still continuing CQ for P.vivax&#xD;
      and adopted Artmisinine based combination therapy (ACT) for treating (Pf) malaria, as most&#xD;
      than 50% malaria has being diagnosed clinically, so due to this and other operational reasons&#xD;
      the protocol needs to be simplified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing 56 day PCR corrected cure rate of DHA-PPQ with the standard treatment regimen as&#xD;
      primary objective and comparing the safety, gametocytecidal effect and parasite clearance&#xD;
      time as secondary objectives, our study titled: Randomized, Open Label, controlled,&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical trial for comparison of Efficacy &amp; safety, will provide scientific&#xD;
      evidence to lead the simplification and improvement of the standard malaria treatment regimen&#xD;
      in Afghanistan; to adopt a policy of treating both vivax and falciparum malaria with the same&#xD;
      drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a significance level (α) = 0.05 and a power=80%, the calculated sample size is 274 per&#xD;
      study arm. Therefore about1100 patients (274 per study-arm: 548 patients with falciaprum&#xD;
      malaria and 548 patients with vivax malaria) will be recruited in Malaria reference Centers&#xD;
      (MRCs) of three malaria endemic provinces (Nangarhar in the east, Thakhar in the north-east&#xD;
      and Faryab in the north-west of country) after signing written inform consent form, according&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be treated as out patients by giving the&#xD;
      randomized drug dose under observation of study team and followed-up daily for 3 days (as&#xD;
      treatment course of either arm is once daily dose for three days) and after than weekly up to&#xD;
      day 56. and the study is planed to conducted in 3 provinces of Afghanistan for approximately&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed clinically as well necessary laboratory tests will be performed and&#xD;
      all the bio-medical findings will be recorded in special patient case record form, the&#xD;
      electronic form of which will be broth to Trop. Med of Mahidol University for final analysis.&#xD;
      The patients will be receiving the reasonable transportation cost for follow-up visits as&#xD;
      well as one bed-net at the end of enrollment.&#xD;
