  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who addicted to Heroin and other opiates suffer from a disease with approved genetic&#xD;
      basis. It causes to a behavioral response as searching and using those drugs even though they&#xD;
      know it causes severe damages as physiological, familiar and legal affairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The popular treatment's goal is to &quot;clean&quot; the people from any drug. In a medical and&#xD;
      pharmacological point of view there is no sense in this approach for all people. This point&#xD;
      of view believes that Buprenorphine (Subutex) is a correct pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research is that people using Buprenorphine have difficulties in&#xD;
      gaining weight, in sexual and cognitive function (according to subjects' reports)&#xD;
