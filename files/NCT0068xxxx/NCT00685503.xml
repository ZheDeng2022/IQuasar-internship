  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the drug ranibizumab (Lucentis) can help prevent vision loss&#xD;
      in people with macular telangiectasia, a condition in which new blood vessels grow in the&#xD;
      retina at the back of the eye and can leak. Such changes in blood vessels are seen in other&#xD;
      diseases associated with changes in a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF). Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF drug that is effective in treating another eye disease,&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration, with similar changes in eye blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with macular telangiectasia in both eyes and new blood&#xD;
      vessel growth in at least one eye may be eligible for this study. They must have vision&#xD;
      better than 20/400 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ranibizumab injections in the study eye at least four times over 12 weeks. Depending on&#xD;
           the response to treatment and the side effects, additional injections may be given every&#xD;
           4 weeks for up to 1 year. The eye is numbed before the injection and the eye area is&#xD;
           cleaned with an antiseptic. Antibiotic drops are used for 3 days following the injection&#xD;
           to prevent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations before starting treatment, at the time of each injection, and 8 weeks after&#xD;
           the last treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye examination with dilation, microperimetry and photography: The eye examination&#xD;
                measures visual acuity, eye pressure and eye movements. For the microperimetry&#xD;
                test, subjects sit in front of a computer screen and press a button when they see a&#xD;
                light on the screen. Measurements and photographs of the retina are also taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography to examine the blood vessels in the&#xD;
                eye: A dye called fluorescein or indocyanine green is injected into a vein in the&#xD;
                arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A camera&#xD;
                takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy test: Women who are able to become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                before each ranibizumab injection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retinal telangiectasis is a group of rare, idiopathic retinal vascular anomalies affecting&#xD;
      the retinal capillaries in which irregular capillary dilation and incompetence occur in the&#xD;
      macula. This is group 2 in the Gass classification of idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia&#xD;
      in which fluorescein angiography showed leakage with capillary dilation. These patients&#xD;
      typically are diagnosed in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Both sexes may be affected.&#xD;
      Minimal exudation, superficial retinal crystalline deposits, and right-angle venules&#xD;
      characterize this disorder. As the disease progresses, intraretinal pigment plaques and&#xD;
      intraretinal and eventually subretinal/choroidal neovascularization develop. The pathogenesis&#xD;
      of the disease is unknown. Because of the leakage of the retinal vessels and also the finding&#xD;
      of neovascularization, it is possible that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be&#xD;
      implicated in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of ranibizumab for the treatment&#xD;
      of eight participants with macular telangiectasia with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography, with vision better than 20/400, with neovascularization. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      this study will be the proportion of participants that lose 15 letters or more in ETDRS BCVA&#xD;
      at 12 months compared with baseline. The secondary outcomes measured at one year will include&#xD;
      the proportion of participants who lose 10 letters or more, the change in central retinal&#xD;
      thickness, the mean change in ETDRS BCVA, the extent of fluorescein leakage, the change in&#xD;
      fundus autofluorescence change in size of neovascular membrane, and the change in central&#xD;
      retinal sensitivity. This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of treating patients with macular telangiectasia in a larger, phase III study within&#xD;
      the organization of the MAC TEL Research Group, sponsored by the Lowy Foundation. Currently,&#xD;
      the research group is enrolling 200 patients affected with this condition for a natural&#xD;
      history study in 22 international clinical centers.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must understand and sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have macular telangiectasia in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have neovascularization in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have vision loss of better than 20/400 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to permit&#xD;
             good quality stereoscopic fundus photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             baseline, and be willing to undergo testing immediately prior to each injection and&#xD;
             monthly for at least 2 months following the last dose of ranibizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Safety and toxicity of ranibizumab have not yet been investigated in children.&#xD;
             Further, it is unlikely that younger participants will be able to comply with all&#xD;
             examinations and intravitreal injections. Therefore, participants below the age of 18&#xD;
             will be excluded from participation in the study. This ocular condition is not&#xD;
             commonly found in participants below the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History (within past five years) of a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident or evidence of severe cardiac disease (apparent in electrocardiogram&#xD;
             abnormalities, clinical history of unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure within six months prior to&#xD;
             baseline, atrial or ventricular tachyarrythmias requiring ongoing treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke within 12 months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History within the past 30 days of a chronic ocular or periocular infection (including&#xD;
             any history of ocular herpes zoster).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current acute ocular or periocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major surgical procedure within one month of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known serious allergies to fluorescein dye AND either indocyanine green dye iodine, or&#xD;
             shellfish. Indocyanine green dye is contraindicated in patients with iodine and&#xD;
             shellfish allergies.&#xD;
