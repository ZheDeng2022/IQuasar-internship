      MEK111054 is a first-time-in-human, open-label study to determine recommended dose and&#xD;
      regimen for the orally administered GSK1120212. The study consists of three parts. Part 1&#xD;
      will identify the maximum tolerated dose. Part 2 will explore the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of GSK1120212. Part 3 will determine a range of effective doses.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years old or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy or&#xD;
             lymphoma that is not responsive to standard therapies or for which there is no&#xD;
             approved or curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed. This&#xD;
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until&#xD;
             four weeks after the last dose of study medication. However, the Sponsor advises that&#xD;
             contraception be used for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose (based on the&#xD;
             lifecycle of sperm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four&#xD;
                  weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this&#xD;
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their&#xD;
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
                  of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until four weeks after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug&#xD;
                  interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CPP&lt;/= 4.0 mmol2/L2 (55 mg2/dL2)&#xD;

             mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CRC must be KRAS or BRAF mutation positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with melanoma, CRC, or non-small cell lung cancer must provide either the&#xD;
             results of a BRAF or KRAS mutation assay, archived tumor tissue, or a fresh biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
