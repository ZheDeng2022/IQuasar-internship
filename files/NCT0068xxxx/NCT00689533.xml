      Primary Objective: To evaluate the use of unilateral or bilateral VEPTR devices, with or&#xD;
      without expansion thoracoplasty, for preventing further progression of the Cobb angle,&#xD;
      allowing for spinal growth and improving pulmonary function in the treatment of children with&#xD;
      progressive scoliosis without rib abnormalities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Number of Patients Planned: A total of 250 patients requiring treatment with the VEPTR device&#xD;
      and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. All patients&#xD;
      enrolled in this study will receive the VEPTR device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up: Patients will be clinically followed post-surgery throughout the&#xD;
      course of the patient's treatment. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 1, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months post-surgery and every year thereafter until 5 years after the index procedure, then&#xD;
      every 2 years until the final planned procedure, or the completion or spinal growth&#xD;
      (typically about 2 years after menarche in girls, or the equivalent in boys), whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Other patient visits may occur as deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design and Methodology: This is a prospective, multi-center, clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the use of VEPTR devices for preventing further progression of the Cobb angle, a&#xD;
      measure of the curvature of the spine, determined from measurements made on radiographs,&#xD;
      allowing for spinal growth and improving pulmonary function in the treatment of children with&#xD;
      progressive scoliosis without rib abnormalities. Unilateral vs. Bilateral, and use of an&#xD;
      opening wedge thoracostomy, are at the discretion of the surgeon. The treatment would be used&#xD;
      regardless of the study, therefore it is routine care. The primary study hypothesis is that,&#xD;
      in regard to key clinical and radiographic outcomes, the success rate of the VEPTR device is&#xD;
      at least 90%. A secondary study hypothesis is that in regards to key pulmonary outcomes&#xD;
      (improvement in pulmonary function tests and increase in lung volume as measured by CT&#xD;
      scans), the success rate of the VEPTR device is at least 90% (see Primary Study Endpoints&#xD;
      below). Details of the patient outcomes and the study hypothesis are given below. With&#xD;
      correction for 10% attrition, 250 patients split between the participating institutions will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint will be based on the findings up to and&#xD;
      including the last scheduled patient follow-up visit. An individual patient's treatment will&#xD;
      be considered successful only if each of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's Cobb angle at the final surgery is less than or equal to the patient's&#xD;
           pre-operative Cobb angle and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's trunk height or spinal length at final surgery is greater than or equal to&#xD;
           the patient's immediate post-operative trunk height or spinal length&#xD;
