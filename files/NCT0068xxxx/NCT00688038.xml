  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how well magnetic resonance thermal&#xD;
      imaging (MRTI) can check the amount of tumor being destroyed using a therapy called laser&#xD;
      ablation (a procedure that uses lasers to create heat that is designed to destroy cancer&#xD;
      cells).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser ablation is designed to destroy tumor tissue with the use of fiber optics that are&#xD;
      placed directly into the tumor to deliver laser light energy into the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, tumor destruction will be checked using MRTI. MRTI is very similar to other&#xD;
      MRI techniques, but instead of providing imaging data, MRTI will provide temperature data for&#xD;
      cancerous areas in the body during the laser ablation process. If tumor temperature can be&#xD;
      measured more accurately, the laser ablation process may be safer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Ablation and the MRTI Scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on the day you have laser&#xD;
      ablation, you will have an intravenous (IV) line placed. You will receive sedation or general&#xD;
      anaesthesia (drugs to make you sleep) through a needle in your vein over 1-3 hours to lessen&#xD;
      any pain you may have during the procedure. This process will be explained to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the anaesthesia, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a limited MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your skin will be cleaned and covered with sterile towels and sheets to lower the chance&#xD;
           of an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The doctor will use MRI scans to place a special needle (applicator) into the tumor.&#xD;
           This applicator will be used to create heat at a high enough temperature that cells can&#xD;
           be destroyed. Small masses may be destroyed in 1 treatment, but larger masses may&#xD;
           require that the needle is placed several times. Each heating cycle takes less than 10&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During laser ablation, MRTI will be used to monitor the temperature within the ablation&#xD;
           zone. The MRTI process is very similar to regular MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your heart rate and blood pressure will be measured during the entire procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entire procedure may take about 1-3 hours, depending on the size and location of&#xD;
           your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure is completed, you will be kept in the hospital for 4-6 hours for&#xD;
      observation. You will be checked for recovery from the sedation that you received during the&#xD;
      procedure. Once you have recovered from the procedure, you will be allowed to leave the&#xD;
      hospital. If you have side effects from the procedure, the doctor may decide to keep you in&#xD;
      the hospital for a longer time period for observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the procedure, you will return to M. D. Anderson for follow-up&#xD;
      visits. About one (1) week after the laser ablation, you will have a physical exam and an&#xD;
      X-ray. About one (1) month after the laser ablation, you will have a physical exam and a&#xD;
      limited MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off-study after the 1-month follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The laser ablation procedure is an FDA-approved procedure.&#xD;
      The devices are commercially available and can be used outside research studies. The&#xD;
      investigational part of this study involves using MRTI to check the effect of ablation on the&#xD;
      tumor. Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
