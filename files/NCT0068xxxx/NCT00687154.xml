  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development or worsening of macular edema following full scatter photocoagulation is a&#xD;
      well recognized occurrence. However, there is limited literature in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and extent of macular edema following&#xD;
      scatter laser photocoagulation surgery using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in eyes&#xD;
      without macular edema prior to scatter laser photocoagulation and to explore whether the&#xD;
      incidence and extent of macular edema varies according to the number of sittings included in&#xD;
      the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study eyes will receive one of two types of scatter photocoagulation with results compared&#xD;
      through use of OCT and photography images, as well as visual acuity testing.&#xD;

      Study eyes will receive scatter photocoagulation given by one of the following two regimens.&#xD;
      To reduce selection bias, investigators will be required, prior to study initiation, to&#xD;
      indicate which treatment (1 PRP sitting or 4 PRP sittings) they will administer. Only the&#xD;
      selected treatment will be performed by a given investigator on study eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 sitting with a minimum of 1200 to a maximum of 1600 burns, with one burn width&#xD;
           separation of burns and scatter extending from the peripheral arcades to beyond the&#xD;
           equator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 sittings, each separated by four weeks (+4 days), with approximately 300 burns in each&#xD;
           of the first two sittings and investigator judgment for number of burns for the third&#xD;
           and fourth sittings as long as the total for the four sittings is between 1200 and 1600&#xD;
           burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of these regimens conform with usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to enroll 150 eyes. At least 40 eyes will be enrolled with prior focal laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation and at least 40 eyes without prior focal laser treatment. After enrollment&#xD;
      of 80 eyes (40 with prior treatment and 40 without prior treatment), an interim analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted so that focused enrollment strategies can be implemented if the analysis&#xD;
      suggests that more subjects in a subgroup should be entered. Approximately half of the eyes&#xD;
      will receive each scatter treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be done on the study eye at baseline and at each scheduled&#xD;
      visit (except 8 and 12 weeks at which exam data are not collected) unless otherwise&#xD;
      specified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E-ETDRS visual acuity in both eyes (refraction in the study eye at baseline, 17 weeks,&#xD;
           and 34 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photographs (7-fields at baseline and 3-fields at 34 weeks only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs to document the scatter photocoagulation (day of the first PRP sitting only)&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible, the following inclusion (1-4) and exclusion criteria&#xD;
        (5-8) must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Patients &lt;18 years old are not being included because there would be an insufficient&#xD;
             number of patients &lt;18 years old who would meet eligibility criteria for the study in&#xD;
             order to be able to generalize the results to patients &lt;18 years old or to provide&#xD;
             informative data as to the effects of treatment in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes&#xD;
             is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of&#xD;
                  diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least one eye meets the study eye criteria listed in section 2.2.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria: A patient is not eligible if any of the following exclusion&#xD;
             criteria (5-8) are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of pancreatic transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic&#xD;
             control).&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Patients in poor glycemic control who, within the last 4 months, initiated intensive&#xD;
             insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next 4&#xD;
             months should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not&#xD;
             covered by another clinical center during the next 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria (a-d) and none&#xD;
        of the exclusion criteria (e-k) listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient can have only one study eye. If both eyes are eligible, the investigator at&#xD;
        his/her discretion will select one to be the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of early proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy for&#xD;
             which investigator intends to perform full scatter photocoagulation in either one&#xD;
             sitting or four sittings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Central subfield thickness on OCT ≤ 299 microns. Note: Clinically significant macular&#xD;
             edema is not an exclusion provided the central subfield is ≤299 microns.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Visual acuity 73 letters or greater (20/32 or better).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient to administer&#xD;
             full scatter photocoagulation and obtain adequate fundus photographs and OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior scatter photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. High risk (severe proliferative) retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of an ocular condition (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might produce macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, significant vitreomacular interface&#xD;
             disease, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment for diabetic macular edema is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of any treatment for DME within prior 6 months, including focal/grid macular&#xD;
             photocoagulation and corticosteroids by any route.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, vitrectomy, scleral&#xD;
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the&#xD;
             next 8 months following enrollment.&#xD;
