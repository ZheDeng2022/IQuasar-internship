      A chart review will be performed to extrapolate information including sex, height, weight,&#xD;
      date/time admitted to HMC, injury data, comorbidities, fracture pattern, antibiotic usage,&#xD;
      surgical history, wound history, fracture healing, and length of time to return to work.&#xD;
      Dr.'s Goodspeed and Reid will conduct a radiographic review independently for each subject,&#xD;
      classifying all fractures according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification&#xD;
      guide. If a discrepancy in classification is found, then both will discuss together and come&#xD;
      to a consensus.&#xD;

      After patients are identified with the Orthopaedic Surgical Database, letters will be sent to&#xD;
      those patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria informing them of the study and that&#xD;
      they will be contacted by the research associate in 1-2 weeks. The research associate will&#xD;
      telephone the patient to discuss the study and answer any questions they may have. Dr.&#xD;
      Goodspeed will also be available to answer any questions. The research associate with obtain&#xD;
      verbal consent and proceed by asking questions from the Short Musculoskeletal Function&#xD;
      Assessment Injury and Arthritis Survey, and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. The&#xD;
      medical student will then perform a chart review to extrapolate information including sex,&#xD;
      height, weight, date/time admitted to HMC, injury data, comorbidities, fracture pattern,&#xD;
      antibiotic usage, surgical history, wound history, fracture healing, and length of time to&#xD;
      return to work. Dr.'s Goodspeed and Reid will conduct a radiographic review independently for&#xD;
      each subject, classifying all fractures according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association&#xD;
      classification guide. If a discrepancy in classification is found, then both will discuss&#xD;
      together and come to a consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes data will be measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment&#xD;
      Injury and Arthritis Survey and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. Radiographic&#xD;
      Classifications will be determined according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association's&#xD;
      classification guide.&#xD;
