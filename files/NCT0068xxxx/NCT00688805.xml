      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapse to drug abuse is thought to result, in many cases, from exposure to cues that&#xD;
           trigger drug-related memories or emotional associations for example, the association&#xD;
           between the sight of a crack pipe and a set of responses such as rapid heartbeat and&#xD;
           desire for cocaine. This type of memory is reconsolidated (actively re-stored) each time&#xD;
           it is reactivated; however, the reconsolidation process can be disrupted by the drug&#xD;
           propranolol, which weakens the link between that memory and an emotional response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propranolol is traditionally used to treat high blood pressure and other heart-related&#xD;
           conditions. Researchers are interested in studying whether propranolol disrupts&#xD;
           reconsolidation of drug-cued memories in individuals who are addicted to cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine whether propranolol can interfere with reconsolidation of cocaine-related&#xD;
      memories and reduce cravings and drug use in substance abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who are current cocaine users enrolled in a&#xD;
      methadone treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve four long sessions (visits 1, 4, 6, and 14) and 10 short&#xD;
           sessions. The short visits will be for monitoring of participants use of drugs and&#xD;
           alcohol; the longer visits will involve more tests and lab sessions. Participants will&#xD;
           be randomized to either the propranolol or placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The long sessions will involve the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An interview session to develop a personalized drug script/cue set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A two-hour intervention session with baseline measures, drug administration (propranolol&#xD;
           or placebo), and two script-guided imagery sets. This is the only administration of&#xD;
           propranolol during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two follow-up test sessions, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will make brief visits to our outpatient clinic for twice-weekly monitoring&#xD;
           of ongoing drug use via urine screens and self-report, starting 1 week before the&#xD;
           intervention session and ending 5 weeks later.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse to drug abuse or addiction is thought to result, in many cases, from exposure to cues&#xD;
      that elicit drug-related memories. The term memories is used here not in its everyday sense,&#xD;
      but in a sense that corresponds more closely to emotional associations for example, the&#xD;
      association between the sight of a crack pipe and a set of responses such as rapid heartbeat&#xD;
      and desire for cocaine. Studies in rodents and humans show that this type of memory is&#xD;
      reconsolidated (actively re-stored) each time it is reactivated, and that the reconsolidation&#xD;
      process can be disrupted by propranolol. Such disruption does not erase the autobiographical&#xD;
      memory of an event, but instead weakens the link between that memory and an emotional&#xD;
      response. Human studies are needed to determine whether propranolol disrupts reconsolidation&#xD;
      of drug-cued memories in addicted individuals; this would present a novel and exciting&#xD;
      therapeutic possibility for preventing craving and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine whether administration of propranolol interferes with reconsolidation of&#xD;
      cocaine-related memories and reduces cravings and drug use in substance abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 (60 evaluable) individuals maintained on methadone and using cocaine will be&#xD;
      recruited from local treatment programs. The target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%&#xD;
      minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: propranolol (40 mg, oral,&#xD;
      immediate-release formulation) or placebo. The study will include four laboratory sessions:&#xD;
      (1) An information-gathering session that includes an interview to obtain information for&#xD;
      development of a personalized drug script/cue set. (2) A two-hour intervention session in&#xD;
      which there will be baseline measures, drug administration (propranolol or placebo, double&#xD;
      blind), and, starting 60 min after drug administration, two script-guided imagery sets.&#xD;
      Cue-responsivity data will be collected, but the main purpose of the session is&#xD;
      interventional. This will be the only administration of propranolol during the study. (3, 4)&#xD;
      Two follow-up test sessions, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention session; participants&#xD;
      responses to re-exposure to the personalized drug script/cue set will be measured. In&#xD;
      addition to attending the four laboratory sessions, participants will make brief visits to&#xD;
      our outpatient clinic for twice-weekly monitoring of ongoing drug use via urine screens and&#xD;
      self-report, starting 1 week before the intervention session and ending 5 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include subjective ratings of drug craving, autonomic responses (heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response), and cocaine and heroin use (urine drug screens&#xD;
      and self-reported drug use).&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. - Minimum lifetime cocaine use of one year (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. - Minimum use of cocaine of once in the past 30 days (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. - Enrolled in methadone maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. - Allergy or hypersensitivity to propranolol or other beta blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. - History of: schizophrenia (or of any other DSM-IV psychotic disorder), anxiety&#xD;
             disorders (e.g., panic disorder), or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. - Current physical dependence on, or current abuse of, alcohol, benzodiazepines, or&#xD;
             other sedative-hypnotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. - Cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid responses&#xD;
             on questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. - Pregnant; breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. - Impaired hepatic function with AST or ALT greater than 5x the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. - Medical conditions that would contraindicate administration of propranolol (e.g.,&#xD;
             uncompensated congestive heart failure; pulmonary edema; asthma; COPD; history of&#xD;
             severe allergic reactions (seasonal, environmental, food, medications, etc.); Raynaud&#xD;

             sinus arrhythmia; thyroid dysfunction; diabetes mellitus; renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Per the American Thoracic Society (ATS), COPD Clinical assessment is based on medical&#xD;
             history and physical examination. Although a complete examination is indicated for all&#xD;
             patients, these two components are specifically important for patients with suspected&#xD;
             COPD. (ATS &amp; ERS, 2004) Accordingly, if medical history and physical exam suggest&#xD;
             possible COPD the participant will be forwarded for spirometry/pulmonary function&#xD;
             tests to aid in the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. - Bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 60 bpm) on three consecutive readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. - Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg; on three&#xD;
             consecutive readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. - Medications that could interact with propranolol either pharmacodynamically or&#xD;
             pharmacokinetically to produce adverse effects. Such medication would include CNS&#xD;
             depressants (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, other sedatives), antihypertensive&#xD;
             medications (including nitrates), antiarrhythmic medications, antiseizure medications&#xD;
             (dilantin), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, galantamine),&#xD;
             aminoquinolines (antimalarial), antipsychotic medications, beta agonists, insulin,&#xD;

             pseudophedrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine, noriepinephrine, amphetamines,&#xD;
             and some herbal supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. - Current use of beta blockers for any medical condition.&#xD;
