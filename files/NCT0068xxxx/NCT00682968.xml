      Hypertension affects nearly 50 million Americans [1] and is the most common chronic condition&#xD;
      among veterans. Unfortunately, many patients with established hypertension have poorly&#xD;
      controlled blood pressure (BP); control rates in the VA are at approximately 70% currently.&#xD;
      While clinician failure to aggressively manage hypertension through therapeutic&#xD;
      intensification (clinical inertia, or failure to intensify pharmacotherapy appropriately)&#xD;
      contributes to poor blood pressure control, even when doctors do intensify therapy, 43-78% of&#xD;
      patients fail to adhere to recommended therapies, indicating that adherence remains a central&#xD;
      problem in hypertension care. This suggests important opportunities for interventions to&#xD;
      improve risk factor control by working through clinicians, their teams, or their delivery&#xD;
      systems, as well as with patients, to address both patient adherence and clinical inertia.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension affects nearly 50 million Americans [1] and is the most common chronic condition&#xD;
      among veterans. Unfortunately, many patients with established hypertension have poorly&#xD;
      controlled blood pressure (BP); control rates in the VA are at approximately 70% currently.&#xD;
      While clinician failure to aggressively manage hypertension through therapeutic&#xD;
      intensification (clinical inertia, or failure to intensify pharmacotherapy appropriately)&#xD;
      contributes to poor blood pressure control, even when doctors do intensify therapy, 43-78% of&#xD;
      patients fail to adhere to recommended therapies, indicating that adherence remains a central&#xD;
      problem in hypertension care. This suggests important opportunities for interventions to&#xD;
      improve risk factor control by working through clinicians, their teams, or their delivery&#xD;
      systems, as well as with patients, to address both patient adherence and clinical inertia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the importance of understanding and intervening to improve adherence to&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications and to address clinical inertia, VA HSR&amp;D has funded numerous&#xD;
      studies in the last decade to address these issues, either through interventions or through&#xD;
      exploratory studies to better understand the problems. There has been little discussion among&#xD;
      investigators and clinical managers as to the comparative effectiveness of such approaches --&#xD;
      which practices are 'best' for use in VA, based on the evidence emerging from these studies.&#xD;
      Thus, we conducted an evidence synthesis project to accomplish these aims, in order to&#xD;
      summarize the literature and facilitate exchange among investigators and clinicians on the&#xD;
      implications of this growing body of VA research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We sought to catalog and extensively describe all VA funded studies conducted over the past&#xD;
      decade focusing on adherence to antihypertensive medications, therapeutic intensification, or&#xD;
      both. We also included non-VA funded studies focused on the care of veterans receiving health&#xD;
      care in VA. We aimed to describe gaps in current research and identify important areas for&#xD;
      future research, synthesize results from the studies, whether published or unpublished, in&#xD;
      the form of an evidence synthesis, and to build on these efforts to develop more formal&#xD;
      exchange and collaboration among VA researchers and clinicians working on addressing these&#xD;
      important issues.&#xD;
