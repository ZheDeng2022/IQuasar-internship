      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if lenalidomide can help to treat&#xD;
      uncontrolled pain caused by advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Determine efficacy of Lenalidomide for the treatment of refractory cancer pain, as&#xD;
      measured by the change on Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of Lenalidomide on fatigue, sleep, depressed mood, nausea and&#xD;
           appetite/anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine changes in serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha,&#xD;
           interferon(IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma, and C-reactive protein) before and after treatment&#xD;
           with Lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effect of Lenalidomide on T-cell subsets especially T-regulatory cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effect of Lenalidomide on the expression of costimulatory receptors, CD80, CD86, and&#xD;
           CD40, on myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety (type, frequency, severity, and relationship of adverse events to study&#xD;
           treatment)&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it&#xD;
      may decrease or prevent the growth of cancer cells. The drug is also designed to decrease the&#xD;
      level of certain proteins in the blood called cytokines, which may result in decreased pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take lenalidomide&#xD;
      capsules each morning, with or without food. Take lenalidomide capsules whole, with a 4-ounce&#xD;
      (1/2 cup) glass of water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you&#xD;
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do&#xD;
      NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take too much lenalidomide, call your study doctor or health care provider or poison&#xD;
      control center right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be allowed to take strong pain killers such as morphine as prescribed by your&#xD;
      study doctor for pain. If you need more than 3 doses of these pain killers in a 24-hour&#xD;
      period, you should call your study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will visit the clinic throughout the study. At each visit, you will be asked to return&#xD;
      any unused study drug and empty bottles to the clinic and you will be asked about any side&#xD;
      effects you may be experiencing. The last study visit will be on Day 43 or Day 57, depending&#xD;
      on the side effects you may experience. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and women who are able to have&#xD;
      children will have a blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 15:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children will have a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test. You will complete 5 questionnaires&#xD;
      about the pain, the pain symptoms, and any side effects you may be having. The questionnaires&#xD;
      will take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete. Women who are able to have children will have a&#xD;
      blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 22:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children will have a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 29:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete the same questionnaires as on Day 15. Women who are able to have children&#xD;
      will have a blood pregnancy test and will be counseled about pregnancy precautions and risks.&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children will have a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 36:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 43:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. You will complete the same&#xD;
      questionnaires as on Day 15. If this is your last visit, you will have an ECG. Women who are&#xD;
      able to have children will have a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 57 (if necessary):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete the same questionnaires as on Day 15. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine tests. You will complete the same questionnaires as on Day 15. If this is&#xD;
      your last visit, you will have an ECG. Women who are able to have children will have a blood&#xD;
      (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 71 (if necessary):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you stopped taking the drug on Day 57, a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take lenalidomide for up to 57 days. You will be taken off study if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or if intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are a female who is able to have children and you do take lenalidomide for all 57&#xD;
      days, you will be required to have a blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test 28 days after your&#xD;
      last dose of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine blood draws on Days 8, 22, and 36 may done at your home (by a study nurse), local&#xD;
      doctor's office, or at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who were on lenalidomide and then stopped taking it, will be checked every 3 to&#xD;
      5 weeks for a period of 1 year. During the follow-up visits, certain tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed. These include a symptom questionnaire, blood draw for routine tests, a&#xD;
      check of your side effects, and pregnancy testing for women who are still able to become&#xD;
      pregnant. These are the same tests that were done while you were on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Drug Diary and Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1 until the end of the study, you will complete a questionnaire once daily&#xD;
      about any symptoms and pain you may be experiencing. It will take about 5 minutes to complete&#xD;
      each time. You will also be provided with a drug diary to write down when and how often you&#xD;
      take pain medication. You should bring your completed diary to each study visit so it can be&#xD;
      reviewed by the research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Call Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be contacted by telephone at home to be asked questions about your symptoms and any&#xD;
      side effects you may have experienced. You will be called on Day 8 (plus or minus 3 days),&#xD;
      Day 22 (plus or minus 3 days) and Day 36 (plus or minus 3 days). The phone calls will last&#xD;
      about 10-15 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will come to the clinic 28 days after your last dose of lenalidomide for a follow-up&#xD;
      visit. You will be checked for side effects, and women who are able to have children must&#xD;
      have a negative blood (1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is approved by FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM). Lenalidomide is not FDA approved for pain relief. Its use in this&#xD;
      study is investigational. If you experience intolerable pain after you stop receiving the&#xD;
      study drug, you will be allowed to start receiving lenalidomide (off study). You will be&#xD;
      monitored for side effects for every 2-3 weeks while you are on this medication for a period&#xD;
      of 1 year. Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
