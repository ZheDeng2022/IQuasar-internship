        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Domain Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific 24 item questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness, and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and/or knee. It consists of 3 domains: pain, stiffness and physical function. WOMAC pain domain consists of 5 questions scored on 5 point Likert scale (0=minimum pain to 4=maximum pain) where higher score indicates higher pain. It assesses amount of pain experienced due to OA in the study joint in past 48 hours. Total possible pain domain score calculated by addition of scores of each 5 questions ranged from: 0 (minimum) - 20 (maximum), higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>

It consists of 3 domains: pain, stiffness and physical function. WOMAC physical function consists of 17 questions scored on 5 point Likert scale (0=minimum physical impairment to 4=maximum physical impairment), higher score indicates worse function. It assesses worse function (ability to move/perform activity) due to OA in study joint in past 48 hours. Total possible score calculated by addition of scores of each 17 questions ranged from: 0 (minimum) to 68 (maximum), higher scores indicate worse function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC Physical Function Domain Score at Week 1 and Week 2</title>
          <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific 24 item questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness, and physical function in participants with OA of the hip and/or knee. It consists of 3 domains: pain, stiffness and physical function. WOMAC physical function consists of 17 questions scored on 5 point Likert scale (0=minimum physical impairment to 4=maximum physical impairment), higher score indicates worse function. It assesses worse function (ability to move/perform activity) due to OA in study joint in past 48 hours. Total possible score calculated by addition of scores of each 17 questions ranged from: 0 (minimum) to 68 (maximum), higher scores indicate worse function.</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure for specified time points.</population>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship with the study treatment. SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: was fatal or life-threatening; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect; was medically significant; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Treatment-emergent AEs were events that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment emergent AEs included both SAEs and all non-SAEs.</description>

          <title>Number of Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related AEs by Severity</title>
          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship with the study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs were events that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to the study drug in a participant who received study drug. The severity grades (mild, moderate and severe) were defined as - Mild: did not interfere with participant's usual function, Moderate: Interfered to some extent with participant's usual function and Severe: Interfered significantly with participant's usual function.</description>
