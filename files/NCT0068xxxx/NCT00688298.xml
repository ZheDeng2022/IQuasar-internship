  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pre-pubic approach of the tension free vaginal sling placement is a new approach in the&#xD;
      treatment of SUI. The retropubic approach of the tension free vaginal sling is the standard&#xD;
      method of device delivery; in addition a suprapubic and a transobturator approach are&#xD;
      alternative methods of delivery. All of these delivery approach systems are intended to place&#xD;
      the mesh &quot;tension free&quot; in the mid-urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no studies that investigate the pre-pubic delivery approach in the United&#xD;
      States. However, the largest series of cases in Europe using the pre-pubic system was done by&#xD;
      Ulmsten (published in the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive&#xD;
      Biology) 107 (2003) 205-207, titled &quot; Pre-Pubic tension free vaginal tape application: an&#xD;
      alternative to classic tension free vaginal tape application in selected patients with SUI.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a pre-pubic&#xD;
      approach to the placement of a mid-urethral vaginal mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the mesh can be properly placed in the mid-urethra using a pre-pubic&#xD;
           approach;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the performance of the delivery device by measuring the ease of use, technical&#xD;
           complexity, and instrument difficulties&#xD;
