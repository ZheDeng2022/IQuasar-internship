  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to compare prospectively whether sBIS, sEMG, or CVI variability&#xD;
      (brain monitoring) can be used to predict unwanted intraoperative responses (high blood&#xD;
      pressure, fast heart rate, tearing, etc.) to stimulation (pain) and to determine whether&#xD;
      these intraoperative findings are related to patient-assessed postoperative pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that increases in these variability measures are associated with increased&#xD;
      probability of unwanted responses. If confirmed, these variability measures may help&#xD;
      anesthesia providers by highlighting periods of inadequate analgesia (pain relief).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia providers have been using processed EEG parameters (brain monitors) to assess the&#xD;
      depth of anesthesia for many years. The Bispectral Index (BISÂ®; Aspect Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Inc.), one such brain monitor, provides a direct measure of the hypnotic state of the patient&#xD;
      [1, 2]. These clinicians use the BIS value, a number ranging from 0 (very deep anesthesia) to&#xD;
      100 (awake state), to help optimize anesthetic dosing. Using BIS technology, anesthesia&#xD;
      providers may adjust anesthesia doses to provide adequate sedation while avoiding over&#xD;
      sedation, resulting in faster recovery [3] and a reduced incidence of awareness with recall&#xD;
      [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      While BIS technology helps anesthesia providers achieve desired levels of hypnosis, they&#xD;
      currently rely primarily on monitoring hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate), autonomic&#xD;
      (tearing, sweating), and somatic (moving) responses to noxious (painful) stimulation as a&#xD;
      means to detect potential patient arousals. Additional analgesics (narcotics, NSAIDS) are&#xD;
      often administered in order to suppress further response to noxious (painful) stimulation.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that noxious stimulation can also affect EEG signals, resulting in&#xD;
      increased variability in the BIS index, suggesting that information in EEG signals could&#xD;
      potentially help clinicians anticipate and detect patient response to noxious stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropcke et al. [5] showed that BIS values were higher with surgical stimulation than without&#xD;
      any stimulation. Other reports have shown that focal noxious stimuli in volunteers and&#xD;
      patients induce transient increases in BIS [6-9]. Many of these studies show that adding&#xD;
      analgesics suppresses the BIS response to noxious stimulation, and the level of suppression&#xD;
      achieved was related to the dose of the added drugs [6, 8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, it is expected that insufficient analgesia would likely result in&#xD;
      transient increases in BIS due to ongoing surgical stimulation, increasing the overall&#xD;
      variability of BIS. Recently reported findings confirm that overall variability of BIS&#xD;
      increased prior to and following intraoperative somatic events [10]. These reports also&#xD;
      identified similar increases in variability of the EMG, with the largest changes realized&#xD;
      from a Composite Variability Index (CVI) which combined the BIS variability (sBIS) and EMG&#xD;
      variability (sEMG) into a single value. Other studies have also shown an association between&#xD;
      these variability measures and postoperative pain scores [11, 12]. These studies showed that&#xD;
      sBIS, sEMG, and CVI computed over the entire surgical procedure were all higher in both&#xD;
      adults and children with worse postoperative pain scores. However, the reliability and&#xD;
      optimum method of displaying these variability scores has yet to be been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to compare whether sBIS, sEMG, or CVI can be used to predict&#xD;
      unwanted intraoperative somatic responses to stimulation, and to determine whether these&#xD;
      values are related to patient-assessed postoperative pain scores. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      increases in these variability measures are associated with increased probability of somatic&#xD;
      responses. If our hypothesis is confirmed, these variability measures may help clinicians by&#xD;
      highlighting periods of inadequate analgesia.&#xD;
