      This is a prospective, non-randomized multi-center multi-national study to evaluate the&#xD;
      chimerism measured by STR and SNP in patients with hypoplastic RC and normal karyotype&#xD;
      transplanted with a preparative regimen of reduced intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study hematopoietic chimerism in whole blood and different cell population (CD14,&#xD;
           CD15, CD 56, CD3, CD19) as well as in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells after SCT&#xD;
           with RIC in patients with RC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the results of chimerism obtained with standard STR PCR (sensitivity 1%) with&#xD;
           those obtained with SNP PCR (sensitivity 0.1- 0.01%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between mixed chimerism and hematological engraftment, OS&#xD;
           and EFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of mixed chimerism in plasmacytoid dendritic and regulatory T-cells&#xD;
           on the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD&#xD;

      Research Question 3.1.1 Chimerism and post transplant outcome During the past 3 decades, SCT&#xD;
      has become a well established treatment procedure for many malignant and hematopoietic&#xD;
      disorders in children and adults.1-8 After transplantation, it has been of central interest&#xD;
      whether the newly developed hematopoietic system is of recipient or donor origin. The&#xD;
      investigations of the genotypic origin of post transplant hematopoiesis are called chimerism&#xD;
      analysis. Originally, it was believed that complete donor hematopoiesis is essential to&#xD;
      maintain engraftment after allogeneic SCT in humans.9 In the last decades, however, it became&#xD;
      evident that donor and recipient hematopoiesis could coexist after allo-SCT in the recipient.&#xD;
      This state of coexistence of hematopoietic cells is called mixed chimerism which might end in&#xD;
      an &quot;autologous recovery&quot;. In patients with refractory cytopenia SCT after myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimen allowed prompt and sustained engraftment in virtually all patients. In&#xD;
      this disease relapse has become a very rare event. Consequently, transplant related mortality&#xD;
      and long term squeals have become major obstacles yet to be overcome to improve the&#xD;
      children's well being and the prognosis of the disease. In SCT with RIC, the reduction of&#xD;
      early and late toxicity may be counterbalanced by delayed engraftment, graft rejection, mixed&#xD;
      chimerism and GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection It is well known that less myeloablative conditioning regimens predispose for&#xD;
      a higher rate of mixed chimerism. Consequently, graft rejection or non engraftment is a major&#xD;
      cause of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitization to minor histocompatibility antigens by prior transfusions of blood products&#xD;
      can increase this risk. The rapid development of complete chimerism in NK-cells and T-cells&#xD;
      seems to play an important role to achieve sustained engraftment specifically in patients&#xD;
      transplanted with a dose reduced preparative regimen. Therefore, it is important to elucidate&#xD;
      the development of post transplant chimerism in different cell subpopulations. This will&#xD;
      allow following and documenting proper engraftment, and will detect early hints of ongoing&#xD;
      graft rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft versus host disease The occurrence of GVHD is influenced by many well known factors.&#xD;
      Although the use of nonmyeloablative SCT can reduce the severity of GVHD, GVHD remains a&#xD;
      major complication. In our pilot study using the reduced intensity preparative regimen in RC,&#xD;
      the probability for developing GVHD grade IIIV was 0.48. It is accepted that in comparison to&#xD;
      myeloablative SCT, in reduced intensity preparative regimens higher proportions of host&#xD;
      immune hematopoietic cells may persist. While donor-derived alloreactive lymphocytes are&#xD;
      being infused, these autologous cells might possibly serve as host antigen presentation for&#xD;
      continuous stimulation of donor T-cells. Consequently, it was speculated by the group Shapira&#xD;
      and Slavin10 that GVHD may be similarly amplified by reduced conditioning followed by&#xD;
      intentional administration of host cells. This hypothesis was tested in a preclinical animal&#xD;
      model. Increased incidence of GVHD, higher mortality and increased levels of chimerism were&#xD;
      observed in recipients reconstituted with additional host cells, particularly with&#xD;
      non-irradiated spleen cells. Graft-versus-Leukaemia (GVL) effect was not impaired by post&#xD;
      transplant cell administration. These results suggested that GVHD may be amplified by&#xD;
      recipient cell infusion using either irradiated or viable stimulatory host cells. This could&#xD;
      possibly explain the higher than anticipated incidence of GVHD and consequently the rapid&#xD;
      displacement of host cells with conversion to 100% donor type cells in reduced intensity SCT.&#xD;
      The present study will therefore investigate whether autologous antigen presenting cells&#xD;
      (Auto-APC) do survive the conditioning regimen and favour to occurrence of GVHD.&#xD;
