  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study we plan to evaluate the effects of the conversion from gastric banding&#xD;
      to gastric bypass on esophageal function using combined monitoring. The primary aim of the&#xD;
      current study is to evaluate esophageal function before and 3-months after the conversion&#xD;
      from gastric banding to gastric bypass. A second objective is to evaluate the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms, esophageal dysmotilities, endoscopic abnormalities and bolus retention found in&#xD;
      patients referred for conversion from gastric banding to gastric bypass. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that esophageal motility disorders associated with gastric banding are reversed by conversion&#xD;
      to gastric bypass.&#xD;

      2.2.3 Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      As model for this study we propose a longitudinal single-center study design with testing&#xD;
      before and after the surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be limited to patients considered for gastric banding to gastric&#xD;
      by-pass conversion. Patients will be recruited from the surgical out-patient clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-OP 3 months post-OP Symptom evaluation X X Endoscopy X X Upper GI series X X Combined&#xD;
      MII-EM X X&#xD;
&#xD;
      OP - conversion of gastric band to gastric bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent the volunteers will be screened for inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Participants fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo baseline&#xD;
      symptom evaluation, endoscopy, an upper GI series and esophageal function testing using&#xD;
      combined MII-EM as part of the pre-operative work-up. The same examinations (symptom&#xD;
      evaluation, endoscopy, upper GI series and esophageal function testing) will be repeated 3&#xD;
      months after successful conversion from gastric band to bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom evaluation Patients will be asked to complete a standardized esophageal symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire. This questionnaire evaluates the frequency and severity of heartburn, chest&#xD;
      pain, regurgitation and dysphagia which are then computed into a composite score (Eraflux&#xD;
      score ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy Standard sedated endoscopy will be performed by a trained gastroenterologist. The&#xD;
      endoscopy will be performed according to the standard clinical protocol. During endoscopy the&#xD;
      examiner will pay particular attention to the esophageal mucosa, the size of the gastric&#xD;
      pouch above the band (baseline examination), the size of the gastric pouch above the&#xD;
      gastro-jejunal anastomosis (post-operative examination), the presence of ulcerations at the&#xD;
      site of gastric banding/gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper GI Series Patients will undergo upper GI series using a modified timed-barium swallow&#xD;
      (achalasia) protocol. Patients will receive 100ml liquid barium and PA images focused on the&#xD;
      GE junction will be taken immediately after swallowing, 1 and 3 minutes later. These&#xD;
      sequences should allow determining the position of the band relative to the GE junction and&#xD;
      the size of the gastric pouch above the gastro-jejunal anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal function testing (EFT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of esophageal motility testing an EFT probe will be placed transnasally through&#xD;
      the esophagus into the stomach and the LES location and pressure will be determined by&#xD;
      stationary pull-through technique. The most distal circumferential pressure sensor will be&#xD;
      placed in the high-pressure zone (HPZ) of the LES. The other measuring sites (both pressure&#xD;
      and impedance) will be subsequently at 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm above the HPZ of the LES. Ten&#xD;
      swallows (5 cc each) of liquid (0.9% normal saline) and 10 swallows (5 cc each) of a standard&#xD;
      viscous material (EFT viscous, Sandhill Scientific, Inc) will be given with each swallow&#xD;
      20-30 seconds apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzed parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus transit time (BTT): time interval (sec) between bolus entry at the proximal&#xD;
           measuring segment and bolus exit at the distal segment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smooth muscle bolus transit time (SMBTT): time interval (sec) between bolus entry at the&#xD;
           second most distal measuring segment and bolus exit at the distal segment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraction amplitude at 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm above the HPZ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal esophageal amplitude (DEA): average amplitude of contraction at 5 and 10cm above&#xD;
           HPZ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset velocity of contractions: contraction velocity between 5 and 10 cm above the HPZ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LES mid-respiratory resting pressure measured during station pull-through&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average LES residual pressure during swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportions (i.e. percentage of patients with esophageal dysmotility, patients with&#xD;
      ulcerations at the banding/anastomosis site, etc.) will be compared using McNemar test.&#xD;
      Continuous parameters (i.e. symptom scores, esophageal manometry and bolus transit data)&#xD;
      recorded prior and 3-months after the conversion will be compared using paired T-tests. For&#xD;
      statistical significance alpha will be set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Assuming that esophageal dysmotilities are present in 50% of patients&#xD;
      prior to the conversion of banding to bypass and that conversion reduces this proportion by&#xD;
      50% we calculated that 40 complete datasets would be required for an 85% power to identify&#xD;
      this change. Allowing a drop-out rate of 20% we plan to enroll 50 patients in the present&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
