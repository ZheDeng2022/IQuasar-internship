  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to describe the performance of very low birth-weight preterm&#xD;
      toddlers regarding expressive language and cognitive development during sensorimotor and&#xD;
      beginning of pre-operational periods, as well as to compare the performance presented by&#xD;
      these children to that presented by their full-term peers, according to Genetic Epistemology&#xD;
      theoretical principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that very-low birth weight preterms would present a poorer&#xD;
      performance, concerning expressive language and cognition development,than their full-term&#xD;
      peers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight preterm infants are known to have risks of cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      problems, including learning difficulties, attention deficits and hyperactivity, as well as&#xD;
      neuromotor deficits. Moreover, they are reported to have a high risk of speech and language&#xD;
      impairments up to school age, even in cases where major neurological abnormalities are&#xD;
      excluded. Impairments have been reported both in receptive and expressive language and, more&#xD;
      specifically, in morphosyntax and naming.&#xD;
