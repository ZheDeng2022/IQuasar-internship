  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out about the safety of injecting the gene (DNA) for mouse&#xD;
      TYRP2 in patients with melanoma. DNA is a material that contains the information needed to&#xD;
      produce many substances in the body. TYRP2 is a substance found in melanoma cells that helps&#xD;
      to produce their black color. The DNA used in this study is the gene for mouse TYRP2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene is introduced into bacteria, which are grown in large quantities. The DNA vaccine is&#xD;
      then made from bacteria that is inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to see if we can immunize patients against TYRP2 by injecting mouse TYRP2 DNA.&#xD;
      We will also follow the patients closely to see if there are any side effects. Mouse TYRP2&#xD;
      DNA is very similar to human TYRP2 DNA. We believe, based on lab experiments, that injection&#xD;
      of mouse TYRP2 DNA could result in the production of immune substances (antibodies and T&#xD;
      cells) that recognize melanoma cells. Antibodies are substances produced by your immune&#xD;
      system to defend your body against bacteria and viruses. T cells are a type of white blood&#xD;
      cell that can also fight infections. The small differences between mouse and human TYRP2 may&#xD;
      allow your immune system to make the antibodies and T cells against melanoma. There is no&#xD;
      evidence yet that injection of TYRP2 DNA results in any clinical benefit in patients.&#xD;
