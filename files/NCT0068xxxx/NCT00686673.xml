      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will compare two arms: an experimental&#xD;
      intervention group that receives a decision aid consisting of an educational video and&#xD;
      targeted manual providing a protocol for the family members' disclosing terminal illness to&#xD;
      the patients and aimed at improving communication, satisfaction with decision making process,&#xD;
      and quality of life between patients and their family versus an attention control group that&#xD;
      receives a video and non-tailored manual on pain control.&#xD;

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed at decreasing the decisional conflict among family members who are ready&#xD;
      or not to disclose patients' terminal illness. The decision aid will lead to effective&#xD;
      communication between patients and family and the effective decision making process will lead&#xD;
      to the final outcome to improve the quality of life in patients and their family. This trial&#xD;
      is limited to situations where the family and their patients are cognitively capable of&#xD;
      participating in decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Measures. At baseline, before randomization, self-reported questionnaire is used to&#xD;
      collect data. To correct possible confounders in this study, family' background variables are&#xD;
      assessed on entry to the study, including sociodemographic and decisional conflicts,&#xD;
      decisional-role preference, stage of readiness, level of anxiety and depression, and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family decisional conflict is assessed using four subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale&#xD;
      which assessed how well informed participants feel about their choices and the associated&#xD;
      benefits and risks; the clarity of their values; the support they have in the decision-making&#xD;
      process; and their level of uncertainty. It consists of 16 items followed by a Likert&#xD;
      response of 1, strongly agree, to 5, strongly disagree. A mean score is obtained for each&#xD;
      participant. The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) is translated into Korean by two bilingual&#xD;
      individuals, using a forward-backward translation procedure, and completed pilot test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family preference for role in decision making is assessed using a scale modeled on an&#xD;
      instrument developed by Degner et al. We make family/patient dimension from modifying Degner&#xD;
      and Sloan's second Control Preference Scale set, family/physician dimension. The options of&#xD;
      modified set of five cards (family/patient dimension) range from the family making the&#xD;
      decision mainly, through a collaborative model where the family and patient jointly decided,&#xD;
      to a scenario where the patient made decision mainly. Family is asked to indicate whether&#xD;
      they preferred an independent role (i.e., &quot;that the family makes the final decision regarding&#xD;
      which treatment the patient will receive or after considering patient's opinion&quot;), shared&#xD;
      role (i.e., &quot;that the family and patient together select which treatment is best for the&#xD;
      patient&quot;), or a dependent role (i.e., &quot;that the patient alone makes all the decisions&#xD;
      regarding the patient's treatment or considers the family's opinion&quot;). Family participant&#xD;
      chose the decision-role statement that best described his/her preferred role in decision&#xD;
      making. The Control Preference Scale (CPS) is translated into Korean by two bilingual&#xD;
      individuals, using a forward-backward translation procedure, and completed pilot test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of family anxiety and depression is assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale which consists of 14 items, seven on anxiety and seven on depression, forming two&#xD;
      sub-scales. Each item has four descriptive response options to be scored on a 0 to 3 scale. A&#xD;
      value of 0 corresponds to not having the symptom, 3 corresponds to having the symptom to a&#xD;
      high level. Scores for each of the two sub-scales are constructed by simple summation of its&#xD;
      seven items. The developers have suggested that sub-scale scores of 0-7 represent non-cases,&#xD;
      8-10 represent doubtful cases, and 11-21 represent definite cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Baseline Patient's Generic QOL:. Because we expect the effect of intervention for family&#xD;
      to accompany change of patients' outcome, we measure patients' QOL and quality cancer care at&#xD;
      baseline to observe secondary outcome related with effect of the decision aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's QOL is assessed with QCQ-EOL. To correct possible confounders in this study,&#xD;
      patient' background variables are obtained on entry to the study including sociodemographic&#xD;
      and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome to be considered is the potential efficacy of this aid including family's&#xD;
      decisional conflicts, satisfaction with decision making, and decisional-role preference,&#xD;
      decisional regret, and physician and family acceptance of the decision aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family satisfaction with decision making is assessed using the effective decision-making&#xD;
      subscale of the decisional conflict instrument [O'Connor AM. Validation of a decisional&#xD;
      conflict scale. Med Decis Making. 1995 Jan-Mar;15(1):25-30]. The subscale was four items&#xD;
      regarding satisfaction with decision making (being informed, reflection of participant's own&#xD;
      values, likelihood to comply, and satisfied). Scores for family satisfaction are reversed so&#xD;
      that the higher scores reflect higher level of satisfaction (ie, a reversed Likert scale in&#xD;
      which 5 is the highest scored). A mean score is obtained for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician and participant's acceptance of the decision aid is addressed using two&#xD;
      questionnaires followed by a Likert response of 1, strongly agree, to 5, strongly disagree&#xD;
      (i.e., family assessment item, &quot;The decision support was useful to me in reaching a&#xD;
      decision&quot;, &quot;I would recommend that others facing the decision use the support&quot;, &quot;The decision&#xD;
      support interfered with my relationship with patient&quot;, Physician assessment item, &quot;I feel the&#xD;
      family has made an informed choice&quot;, &quot;The decision support was useful in helping this family&#xD;
      understand the risk and benefits of the disclosure on terminal illness&quot;, &quot;The decision&#xD;
      support did not interfere with my anticipated physician-patient relationship with my&#xD;
      patient&quot;)[Brundage et al2001]. Decision regret is measured by the Decision Regret Scale which&#xD;
      is useful tool for measuring regret after decisions at a particular point in time developed&#xD;
      by O'Connor et al. It consists of 5 items followed by a Likert response of 1, strongly agree,&#xD;
      to 5, strongly disagree. The definition of decision regret is remorse or distress over a&#xD;
      decision[O'Connor]. These items were whether regret was felt to be present, whether the&#xD;
      decision was the right one for him/her, whether he/she would make same decision again in the&#xD;
      same circumstances, whether the decision was a wise one, and whether the decision had&#xD;
      resulted in harm. The Decision Regret Scale is translated into Korean by two bilingual&#xD;
      individuals, using a forward-backward translation procedure, and completed pilot test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the levels of family anxiety and depression,and family's QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of family anxiety and depression is assessed with the Hospital Anxiety Depression&#xD;
      Scale. The actual disclosure following use of the material is assessed by following items&#xD;
      including chosen disclosure and if terminal illness disclosed &quot;who, and when disclose&#xD;
      patients' terminal condition&quot; and it is assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after sending the&#xD;
      material. Levels of family anxiety and depression, family decision regret, family preference&#xD;
      for role in decision making, and patient's QOL are assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      sending the video.&#xD;
