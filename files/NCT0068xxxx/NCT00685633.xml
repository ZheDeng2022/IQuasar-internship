      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such&#xD;
      as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Enzastaurin may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether giving bicalutamide together with enzastaurin is more effective than&#xD;
      bicalutamide alone in treating prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying bicalutamide to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared with giving bicalutamide together with enzastaurin in treating patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the two regimens on the proportion of patients with undetectable&#xD;
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL) at 44 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the proportion of patients with PSA decline &gt; 85% at 44 weeks on the&#xD;
           combination therapy arm compared to that of bicalutamide monotherapy arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the distribution of best PSA response in each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the time to PSA progression and the time to PSA nadir in each arm of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the duration of PSA response in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the PSA slope before, during, and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of enzastaurin hydrochloride in this patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether Gleason score or prior hormonal therapy has any effect on PSA&#xD;
           response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≤ 6&#xD;
      vs 7 vs 8-10) and prior hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weeks 1-12: Patients are observed without treatment. Patients with a&#xD;
                prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise of &gt; 50% above baseline or nadir (whichever is&#xD;
                lowest) and a rise of at least 5 ng/mL, confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks&#xD;
                later, may be started on bicalutamide before the end of week 12 at the discretion&#xD;
                of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weeks 13-44: Patients with a rise PSA ≥ 50% above baseline or nadir, and a PSA rise&#xD;
                of at least 5 ng/mL confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, are removed&#xD;
                from study. Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily. Patients achieving a PSA&#xD;
                decline ≥ 50% in the absence of toxicity may continue to receive bicalutamide up to&#xD;
                72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weeks 1-12: Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride twice daily. Patients&#xD;
                with a PSA rise of &gt; 50% above baseline or nadir, and a rise of at least 5 ng/mL,&#xD;
                confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, may be started on bicalutamide&#xD;
                before the end of week 12 at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weeks 13-44: Patients with a PSA rise of ≥ 50% above baseline or nadir, and a rise&#xD;
                of at least 5 ng/mL, confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, are removed&#xD;
                from study. Patients receive oral enzastaurin twice daily and oral bicalutamide&#xD;
                once daily. Patients achieving a PSA decline ≥ 50% in the absence of toxicity may&#xD;
                continue on this combination therapy up to 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 10 years.&#xD;
