    <textblock>
      A randomized, modified-blind active-controlled multicenter, two-way crossover study of&#xD;
      levalbuterol compared to racemic albuterol (using a spacer) in subjects 12 years of age and&#xD;
      older with asthma. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009,&#xD;
      Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's&#xD;
      name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive both treatments: (a) levalbuterol HFA MDI; 45 micrograms (16 cumulative doses); followed by (b) racemic albuterol HFA MDI; 90 micrograms (16 cumulative doses).&#xD;
The first treatment will be administered, followed by a 7 ±2 days washout period, after which the second of the two treatments will be administered. Cumulative dosing will occur according to the following schedule: 1 puff at 0 and 30 minutes, 2 puffs at 60 minutes, 4 puffs at 90 minutes and 8 puffs at 120 minutes. An AeroChamber Plus spacer will be utilized for each dose</description>
