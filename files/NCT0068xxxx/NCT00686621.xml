    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide posaconazole compassionate treatment to patients with&#xD;
      invasive fungal infections: 1) which are resistant to standard antifungal therapies; 2) for&#xD;
      which there are no effective therapies; 3) with a prior history of serious, severe, or&#xD;
      life-threatening toxicities while receiving standard antifungal therapies, or 4) with&#xD;
      pre-existing organ dysfunction which precludes the use of standard antifungal therapies.&#xD;

          -  Ability to take study medication orally by swallowing or via an enteral feeding tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is not considered eligible for any other clinical research program with&#xD;
             posaconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Safety Related Inclusion Criteria&#xD;

                  methods must continue for at least 30 days after discontinuation of treatment&#xD;
                  with posaconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be non pregnant by history or (preferably) by negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to the first dose of posaconazole for all females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not breast feeding or if lactating, willing to discontinue breast feeding during&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Invasive Fungal Infection Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each patient must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A documented invasive fungal infection who have failed a reasonable trial of&#xD;
                  other licensed antifungal agents, either due to progression or lack of&#xD;
                  improvement of the infection, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious, severe or life-threatening toxicities related to current or prior&#xD;
                  antifungal therapy, or&#xD;
&#xD;

                  therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with debilitating but not immediately life threatening fungal diseases, where&#xD;
             significant morbidity may result in disability and where prior antifungal therapy has&#xD;
             been unsuccessful (eg, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, recurrent oropharyngeal or&#xD;
             esophageal candidiasis with dehydration and malnutrition, or cutaneous&#xD;
             phaeohyphomycosis and mycetoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are in a situation or have any condition requiring the use of prohibited&#xD;
             drugs or unstable medical conditions where the risk of therapy would exceed any&#xD;
             potential benefit i.e., hematological disorder such as unstable cardiac disorder&#xD;
             (including acute myocardial infarction or unstable myocardial ischemia/angina within&#xD;
             30 days, ventricular arrhythmia within 30 days, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, or&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation/flutter with symptomatic bradycardia [sick sinus syndrome], or&#xD;
             unstable congestive heart failure) or impairment expected to be unstable or&#xD;
             progressive during the course of this study (e.g., recurrent or uncontrolled seizure&#xD;
             disorders, demyelinating syndromes, or progressive peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving vinca alkaloids or anthracyclines within 24 hours of study&#xD;
             enrollment or requiring therapy with vinca alkaloids or anthracyclines within the next&#xD;
             30 days for treatment of uncontrolled (pre-existing) malignancy or requiring ongoing&#xD;
             therapy with vinca alkaloids or anthracyclines, where the risk of toxicity from these&#xD;
             medicinal products is considered to be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition requiring the use of prohibited drugs (please consult current product&#xD;
             labeling).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic function tests: alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST) &gt;10 times upper limit of normal, or evidence of severe hepatic dysfunction based&#xD;
             on other clinical assessment.&#xD;
