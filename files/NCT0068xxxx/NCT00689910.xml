  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic disposition of raltegravir in pregnant HIV-1&#xD;
      infected women. These results will be compared to pharmacokinetic data obtained following&#xD;
      pregnancy as well as to studies previously carried out in nonpregnant women and male&#xD;
      patients. By determining the disposition characteristics for this specific patient&#xD;
      population, antiretroviral (ARV) dosing can be optimized during pregnancy. Appropriate dosing&#xD;
      is necessary to minimize adverse effects, slow progression of disease, and further reduce the&#xD;
      risk for vertical transmission. Data will also be obtained on genital tract penetration and&#xD;
      placenta transfer of raltegravir to the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects enrolled in this study will take an antiretroviral based regimen containing&#xD;
      raltegravir twice daily both during and after their pregnancy. The specific regimen will be&#xD;
      chosen by their own primary care provider based on their antiretroviral history and&#xD;
      resistance testing. They will undergo a series of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
      over 12 hours on two occasions; a) during their 3rd trimester and b) approximately 3 months&#xD;
      postpartum. Concentrations of raltegravir in the infant will be assessed by cord and infant&#xD;
      blood sample at delivery and a blood sample at approximately 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The pharmacokinetic exposure of raltegravir as measured by the 12 hour area under&#xD;
      the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-12h) during third trimester pregnancy is&#xD;
      similar to the AUC0-12h estimated three months post-partum.&#xD;

        Preliminary eligibility will be determined by the study investigators, research staff, and&#xD;
        the patient's primary pregnancy healthcare provider. During a dedicated visit to the&#xD;
        primary investigator's office, potential participants will undergo a screening examination&#xD;
        including review of physical exam and blood work obtained by their primary pregnancy&#xD;
        provider within two weeks of study enrollment. Those that qualify will then provide written&#xD;
        consent and be able to continue in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female, 16 years old or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, at least 14 weeks gestation in order to initiate raltegravir treatment if&#xD;
             decided by their pregnancy health care provider. The first pharmacokinetic study visit&#xD;
             occurs no sooner than 26 weeks gestation (3rd trimester)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal fetal heart motion by ultrasound, vital signs and brief physical exam as&#xD;
             conducted by their primary pregnancy health care provider within two weeks of study&#xD;
             entry (part of their standard prenatal care)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intolerance or resistance to at least two classes of antiretroviral agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a raltegravir-optimized background regimen based on referring&#xD;
             provider's selection and resistance testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English or Spanish speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to follow study protocol or drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are planning to breastfeed (this is not recommended for HIV-infected women&#xD;
             to reduce HIV transmission to the baby)&#xD;
