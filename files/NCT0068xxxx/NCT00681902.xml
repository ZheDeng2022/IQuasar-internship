      The purpose of this study is to explore to what degree, if any, Jet lidocaine will reduce or&#xD;
      alleviate pain, as compared to Jet normal saline, in children undergoing needle insertion in&#xD;
      the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED). If effective, Jet lidocaine would afford a novel&#xD;
      rapidly acting local anesthesic for children in the PED.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial involves double blind allocation of either (1) Jet&#xD;
      administration of buffered 1% lidocaine or (2) Jet normal saline (placebo) prior to needle&#xD;
      insertion in the PED. The product will be prepackaged on a weekly basis at an off site&#xD;
      pharmacy into the jet injector system and all devices will be labeled as &quot;study drug&quot; with an&#xD;
      assigned number. We estimate 30 patients being enrolled in each one-month period and the&#xD;
      pharmacy will allocate 10 devices of study medication and 10 devices of normal saline. Our&#xD;
      estimated sample size is 84 patients per group. The study duration will continue until the&#xD;
      sample size is achieved. An interim analysis of data will be performed after 25% or 21&#xD;
      patients are obtained in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 168 patients will be expected to participate in order to achieve our sample size.&#xD;
      The a priori sample size analysis uses a two tailed student's t-test with an alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      and a power of The study is open to children of any race or ethnicity. There will be no race&#xD;
      or ethnicity-based enrollment restrictions or selection factors for the population to be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department at Bellevue Hospital are first&#xD;
      triaged by the nursing staff. Triage includes documenting vital signs, a chief complaint, and&#xD;
      a brief clinical assessment. The physician (resident, fellow, or attending) evaluates the&#xD;
      patient and repeats a more extensive clinical assessment. Children with clinical evaluations&#xD;
      and treatment plans that identify a need for needle insertion will be prepared for the&#xD;
      procedure by a physician, nurse, and/or a Certified Child Life Specialist (CCLS). Preparation&#xD;
      involves education and support to the parent and/or child before and during the procedure.&#xD;
      The pre-procedure preparation is a part of the routine care for all children who present to&#xD;
      the PED and require a procedural intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments prior to the procedure.&#xD;
      The treatment group will receive 0.2 cc of 1% buffered lidocaine via Jet injection, while the&#xD;
      control group will receive 0.2 cc of normal saline via Jet injection. All patients who&#xD;
      fulfill enrollment criteria and with whom consent and assent (if appropriate) are obtained&#xD;
      will be assigned consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The provider's decision to insert a needle is determined as part of the patient's&#xD;
           standard care for the diagnosis or treatment of illness. A standard history and physical&#xD;
           examination will be performed by the ED physician/nurse and includes information&#xD;
           sufficient to determine patient eligibility. All children undergoing needle insertion&#xD;
           will be assessed for eligibility by a trained provider based on information routinely&#xD;
           documented (see above Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria). Children eligible to receive EMLA&#xD;
           cream will be excluded and will receive EMLA cream routinely. Other anesthetics or&#xD;
           analgesics will not be withheld from any patient enrolled in this study. The standard&#xD;
           pre-procedure preparation time will provide an appropriate time period to educate the&#xD;
           patient and parent about the study and obtain consent. This process will not delay the&#xD;
           patient's care. Standard non-pharmacologic emotional support and explanations will be&#xD;
           provided to the patient and/or parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For patients meeting inclusion criteria, informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
           parent or legal guardian. Patients who are 18 years of age will provide their own&#xD;
           consent. Informed assent will also be obtained in children less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
           Consent and assent will be obtained during the standard pre-procedural preparation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If informed consent/assent is obtained, the patient and parent will receive additional&#xD;
           education about the Jet device. This patient will undergo standard needle insertion by a&#xD;
           trained provider and concomitantly receive supportive care including, but not limited&#xD;
           to, age appropriate education, distraction, relaxation, and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A Color Analogue pain score (CAS) (see outcome measures section for CAS background and&#xD;
           description, and fig 2) will be obtained from the patient at the baseline, prior to the&#xD;
           start of the procedure. The Jet application will occur at the insertion site, prior to&#xD;
           the needle being inserted into the skin. A CAS pain score will be obtained from the&#xD;
           patient subsequent to administration of the device. The provider will wait thirty&#xD;
           seconds prior to insertion of the needle into the skin. A CAS pain score for needle&#xD;
           insertion will be collected after completion of the procedure. After one minute a post&#xD;
           procedure CAS score will be collected. The parent and/or support staff will be with the&#xD;
           child throughout the entire procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the procedure the provider will document patient demographics, diagnosis, and&#xD;
           Likert scales for cooperation and ease of insertion (see provider document). The&#xD;
           provider will ask the parent and child one question related to satisfaction after the&#xD;
           completion of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients will be withdrawn from the study if either the patient or caregiver requests&#xD;
           withdrawal at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After insertion of the needle appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions will&#xD;
           be continued leading to either hospital admission with the IV or discharge home with&#xD;
           removal of the IV upon discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The J-Tip Jet device (National Medical Products, CA) will be purchased as an empty device and&#xD;
      sent to Dr. Nayan Patel at Central Drugs Pharmacy, CA, for preparation. Central Drugs&#xD;
      Pharmacy will fill these devices and ship them to Bellevue hospital. The devices will be&#xD;
      filled and packaged, using aseptic techniques, with either 0.25 cc of normal saline or 0.25&#xD;
      cc of 1% buffered lidocaine. This device is FDA approved for administration of lidocaine in&#xD;
      children and is currently used in a number of other institutions at the time of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, the primary outcome, will be assessed using the Color Analogue pain Scale (CAS) (1-5)&#xD;
      (see appendix for CAS scale picture). This scale is anchored by descriptors &quot;no pain&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;most pain&quot; with gradation in color, area, and length (see attached CAS figure). The point on&#xD;
      the tool that is identified by the child with the plastic marker on the colored scale front&#xD;
      side is converted to a corresponding numerical scale from the back of the tool. This number&#xD;
      is the CAS score in centimeters. This scale has been well validated for use in children over&#xD;
      five years of age undergoing procedures in the PED with minimal or no training with this&#xD;
      tool. The following instructions are given prior to use of the scale: &quot;This is a pain scale.&#xD;
      The bottom, where it is small and white, means no pain, and the top, where it is wider and&#xD;
      red, means the most pain you can imagine (instructor points to anchor). You slide the marker&#xD;
      to the spot on the scale that shows how much pain you are having right now. (2)&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAS pain scale will be self-reported by the patient at the site of needle insertion at a&#xD;
      number of points in time. A 2.5 cm change in CAS is considered clinically significant (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-Jet&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Jet administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insertion of needle into the skin (60 seconds after Jet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-needle insertion (1 minutes after completion of insertion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be measured to assess satisfaction. All patients and parents will be&#xD;
      asked &quot;Based on your IV start today, would you like this numbing medicine in the future?&quot; (8)&#xD;
      The provider will report satisfaction related to cooperation and &quot;difficulty of finding a&#xD;
      vein&quot; using a 5-point likert scales. The patient's demographic data, location of placement,&#xD;
      diagnosis, and number of attempts will be included in the study documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection sheets will be filed in a locked collection cabinet, to be reviewed only&#xD;
      by the principal investigators after completion. Study number and age will be identified on&#xD;
      the data collection document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child's data collection sheets (See Data Collection Forms) will include their gender,&#xD;
      ethnicity, date of visit, age, pain scores, and survey data.&#xD;
