      RATIONALE: Coriolus versicolor mushroom extract may slow the growth of cancer cells and may&#xD;
      be an effective treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of coriolus versicolor&#xD;
      extract in treating women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer who have&#xD;
      finished radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral coriolus versicolor extract in women&#xD;
           with stage I-III, estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-negative or positive&#xD;
           (as of 1/26/2009), infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast who have recently&#xD;
           completed standard post-surgery radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of measuring changes in fatigue and quality of life of&#xD;
           patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gather preliminary data that compare baseline and post-treatment immunologic&#xD;
           measures, including differential blood counts (i.e., WBC), natural killer cell activity,&#xD;
           phagocytic index, regulatory cell assay, T/B/NK cell population subset assays,&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cell production of levels of interferon gamma, and tumor&#xD;
           necrosis factor-alpha in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral coriolus versicolor extract twice daily for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo quality of life and fatigue assessment at baseline, weekly during study, and&#xD;
      at the 3-week follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for immunological marker studies. Samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for T-regulatory cell, T-and B-lymphocyte, and NK cell activity in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC), phagocytic index in monocytes and granulocytes, and cytokine&#xD;
      secretion and upregulation by flow cytometry, cytotoxicity assays, cytolysis assays,&#xD;
      T-regulatory cell assay, or T/B/NK cell population subset assays. Changes in the production&#xD;
      of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in serum and in supernatants of PBMCs are&#xD;
      analyzed via standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 weeks.&#xD;
