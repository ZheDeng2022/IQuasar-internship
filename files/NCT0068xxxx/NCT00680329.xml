             or exfoliation glaucoma in at least one eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular pressure considered safe, in both eyes, assuring clinical stability of&#xD;
             vision and the optic nerve throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently treated with DuoTrav alone, dosed in the evening for at least for 30 days,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Intraocular pressure ≤ 30 mm Hg in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence causing the investigator to consider the patient to be non-adherent, at some&#xD;
             level, to their glaucoma medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
