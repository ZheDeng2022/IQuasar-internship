      This research study is a randomized trial to evaluate a training program that is designed to&#xD;
      improve the communication skills of clinicians. The training program focuses on care for&#xD;
      patients with serious illnesses and their family members, and assesses effectiveness using&#xD;
      patient and family outcomes. The long term goal of this research is to improve communication&#xD;
      skills of doctors and nurses, thereby improving patient and family outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three decades of research on end-of-life care in the United States indicates that people who&#xD;
      are dying often spend their final days with a significant burden of pain and other symptoms&#xD;
      and receive care they would not choose. Patient-clinician communication about end-of-life&#xD;
      care is an important focus for improving patient-centered end-of-life care for three reasons:&#xD;
      1) it is an integral component of clinician skill that affects all other aspects of&#xD;
      end-of-life care; 2) physicians and nurses in practice do not demonstrate adequate skills for&#xD;
      communicating about end-of-life care; and 3) current training in end-of-life communication is&#xD;
      inadequate. Studies have shown that clinicians can improve their communication skills with&#xD;
      experiential training, but no studies to date have shown that an intervention to improve&#xD;
      clinician communication skill improves patient outcomes. Furthermore, despite widespread&#xD;
      knowledge that end-of-life care is best delivered in an interdisciplinary context, most&#xD;
      studies do not incorporate interdisciplinary training that includes physicians and nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized trial of a communication skills workshop for internal medicine residents&#xD;
      and nurse practitioner (NP) students. A total of 373 residents and 128 NP students from two&#xD;
      large training programs (UW and MUSC) will be randomized to either the intervention or usual&#xD;
      education. The study's primary outcome measure will be the QOC scores on the &quot;communication&#xD;
      about end-of-life care&quot; domain. The QOC will be assessed by patients, family members, and&#xD;
      nurses before and after the intervention time period for all trainees. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are patient symptoms and patient-, family - and nurse-assessed QEOLC scores. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be collected for 5 patients and family members per trainee before the&#xD;
      intervention period and 5 patients and family members per trainee after the intervention&#xD;
      period. Process measures for both residents and NP students will include pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding communication&#xD;
      using standardized patient assessment as well as self-assessment and faculty assessment.&#xD;
