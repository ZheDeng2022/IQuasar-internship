    <textblock>
      This study is open to women with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer. Subjects will be asked to donate either a piece of their tumor or malignant effusion&#xD;
      in order to make the first part of the vaccine or lysate. If enough of the lystate had been&#xD;
      collected to make the first part of the vaccine, then subjects may enroll in the study as&#xD;
      long as they meet the rest of the entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After is determined that a subject is eligible to enroll into the study, you will have to&#xD;
      donate some blood in order to make the second part of the vaccine. After this, the blood and&#xD;
      vaccine are mixed together to make the vaccine called DCVax-L. You will be given two dose of&#xD;
      a drug called Avastin every other week (Avastin will be given through your vein) and a oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy called Cytoxan. One week after your last dose of oral Cytoxan, you will receive&#xD;
      3 vaccines given every other week for the next month. After the first two doses of vaccine,&#xD;
      you will also receive more Avastin. During the study you will be seeing your study team to&#xD;
      have physical exams, blood drawn in order to monitor your health and have blood drawn for&#xD;
      research. The study team will contact you for the next 5 years in order to determine how you&#xD;
      are doing.&#xD;

      Subjects with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma or recurrent primary peritoneal cancer,&#xD;
      for whom autologous tumor or malignant effusion has been harvested and is available for&#xD;
      lysate preparation, are eligible, provided all other eligibility criteria are fulfilled.&#xD;
      Harvested tumor or malignant effusion will be shipped to Cognate BioServices (Sunnyvale, CA)&#xD;
      for preparation of lysate. If sufficient amount of lysate for vaccine can be generated,&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo apheresis on day -35 to -29 to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMC). The apheresis product will be shipped to Cognate BioServices, where DC will be&#xD;
      prepared and pulsed with autologous lysate according to proprietary technology. Following&#xD;
      apheresis, subjects will receive two cycles of biological antiangiogenesis/immunomodulatory&#xD;
      therapy comprising intravenous bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg on day -28 and -14, which may be&#xD;
      followed by 7 days of oral metronomic cyclophosphamide at 50 mg daily (days -28 to -21, and&#xD;
      -14 to -7, respectively). Subjects will receive three doses of intradermal vaccination with&#xD;
      ~5-10 x 106 dendritic cells (DCVax-L) on days 0, 14 and 28. Subjects will also receive&#xD;
      intravenous bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg concurrently with intradermal DCVax-L on day 0 and 14,&#xD;
      which may be followed by oral cyclophosphamide at 50 mg for 7 days (days 0 to 7, and 14 to&#xD;
      21, respectively). The last DCVax-L (day 28) may be followed by oral cyclophosphamide at 50&#xD;
      mg daily x 7 days (days 28 to 35), but no bevacizumab will be given on day 28. Prevnar, an&#xD;
      FDA approved seven-valent vaccine against Pneumococcus pneumoniae, will be given&#xD;
      intramuscularly on day 0 as positive control of immune responsiveness. Two weeks following&#xD;
      third vaccine dose (day 42), patients will undergo immune assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted every 6 months for 5 years and then annually for survival. Subject&#xD;
      will have the option of enrolling in other combinatorial immunotherapy trials when these are&#xD;
      available, if they satisfy enrollment criteria. Subjects will have the option of continuing&#xD;
      vaccination every two months till exhaustion of DCVax-L or disease progression, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
