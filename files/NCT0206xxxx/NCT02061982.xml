  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will perform experiments in an at home-setting. The effect of caffeine in coffee&#xD;
      will be tested in subjects with computer tests on attention and alertness. Comparison of the&#xD;
      results with published results from controlled experiments will indicate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      home experiments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing interest in the general public in measuring health parameters at home,&#xD;
      instead of in a medical setting. Many tests for measuring health parameters are commonly&#xD;
      available in drug stores as well as online. When structured, this trend may also be used for&#xD;
      performing a randomized intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is aimed to evaluate the procedure of performing a non invasive&#xD;
      intervention study by subjects themselves performing the tests at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects have to consume a cup of coffee after an overnight fast. Coffee will be prepared&#xD;
      from instant coffee containing either regular coffee or decaff coffee. Each intervention will&#xD;
      be given twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects on alertness and attention will be established by three computerized tests provided&#xD;
      by Quantified Mind. The tests will be performed by the subjects at t=0 (baseline, prior to&#xD;
      coffee consumption) and t=1h, one hour after coffee consumption, in one go. Each test will be&#xD;
      performed during 5 minutes. During the training session the participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to get acquainted with the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the study concerns the effect of caffeine in the at home setting versus&#xD;
      published results, as well as reproducibility of the results.&#xD;
