  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies genetics in predicting risk of bisphosphonate-related&#xD;
      osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer receiving zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid&#xD;
      is an anti-resorptive drug used as part of cancer treatment. A serious side effect of these&#xD;
      drugs is death of the jawbone, commonly called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the&#xD;
      jaw (BRONJ). Genetic research may help doctors understand risk factors for BRONJ or who is&#xD;
      more likely to get BRONJ and why.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To develop a pharmacometric model to predict jawbone zoledronic acid (Zol) concentrations&#xD;
      in oncologic patients by conducting a prospective cohort study of Zol pharmacometrics in&#xD;
      BRONJ patients, measuring drug in plasma, urine, and jawbone tissue obtained during surgical&#xD;
      treatment for BRONJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To clinically assess and validate our predictive pharmacometric model, and develop a risk&#xD;
      model for BRONJ in oncologic patients receiving intravenous Zol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.&#xD;

    <measure>Identify potential risk factors for BRONJ</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The magnitude of associations between the study variables and BRONJ status will be estimated. For categorical variables, the univariate association with each variable and with BRONJ will be determined using Wald's test of association. For continuous variables, the association with each variable and BRONJ will be determined using Wald's test. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate the risk of BRONJ for development of the final risk model.</description>
