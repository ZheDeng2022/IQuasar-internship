      This is a randomised, phase II open-labelled two-arm study comparing R-GEM-P and LR-GEM in&#xD;
      second-line treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients will be randomised&#xD;
      1:1 between R-GEM-P and LR-GEM.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the complete response rate to LR-GEM (lenalidomide, rituximab, gemcitabine and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone) and R-GEM-P (rituximab, gemcitabine,cisplatin and methylprednisolone)&#xD;
      following 3 cycles of induction treatment as secondline therapy for patients with Diffuse&#xD;
      Large B-cell Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate in both arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall response rate following 3 cycles of induction treatment evaluated by IWG 2007&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of successful stem cell harvest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint by cell-of-origin&#xD;
           immunohistochemical subtype using the Choi method[2] (GCB vs non-GCB), morphological&#xD;
           subtype (centroblastic vs immunoblastic vs other), IPI (0-1 vs ³2),and previous response&#xD;
           to treatment (£12 vs &gt; 12 months), and eligibility for ASCT at randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LR-GEM: lenalidomide plus rituximab, gemcitabine and methylprednisolone every 28 days.&#xD;
      R-GEM-P: rituximab, gemcitabine, methylprednisolone and cisplatin every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be reviewed at baseline and prior to each scheduled dose of treatment for&#xD;
           toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological tumour assessment will be done with contrast-enhanced CT scan after the 1st&#xD;
           and 3rd cycles in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET/CT scan will be performed at baseline and upon completion of induction treatment&#xD;
           (3-4 weeks after last dose of chemotherapy). If PET/CT scan is performed with a&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced CT, then patients do not need a separate CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up after completion of induction treatment will be at 3 monthly intervals for the&#xD;
           first 12 months in Arm A and at monthly intervals for the first 12 months for patients&#xD;
           in Arm B. Thereafter follow up in both Arm A and B will be at 6 monthly intervals for 2&#xD;
           years, then annually up until 5 years in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan at 3 &amp; 12 months post induction treatment in both arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following disease progression patients will be followed for survival every 3 months&#xD;
           until death&#xD;
