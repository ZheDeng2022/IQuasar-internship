  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine whether the use of plantar pressure measurements in&#xD;
      the production of customized therapeutic footwear for patients with diabetes and a history of&#xD;
      foot ulceration results in lower production costs and more pressure relief, compared to the&#xD;
      standard production. A secondary objective is to explore if a difference in durability can be&#xD;
      observed in pressure reduction and development of (pre-) ulcerative lesions between the shoes&#xD;
      produced with and without plantar pressure measurements.&#xD;

      For each patient two pairs of shoes will be produced by two shoemakers, one using plantar&#xD;
      pressure measurements and one according current standard production procedures. The patient&#xD;
      will wear one of these two pairs of shoes during a period of 3 months.&#xD;
