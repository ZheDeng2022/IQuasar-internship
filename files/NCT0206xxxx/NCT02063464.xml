      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monocytes are a type of white blood cell found in human blood. They help the immune&#xD;
           system. Researchers have found that monocytes taken from the blood of healthy people can&#xD;
           kill tumor cells. Now they want to know if monocytes taken from the blood of people with&#xD;
           ovarian cancer can kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, native host anti-tumor cell mediated immune mechanisms may play a role in&#xD;
           clinical outcome of epithelial ovarian cancer; data indicate that the presence of&#xD;
           intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells was shown to prognosticate improved outcome in advanced&#xD;
           ovarian cancer. Furthermore, non-cellular components in the blood, such as exosomes, may&#xD;
           influence outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if monocytes taken from the blood of people with ovarian cancer can kill tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women 18 years and older with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and/or an MRI. For these scans, they will lie&#xD;
           in a machine that takes pictures of their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of blood (two tubes) will be collected by needle during one visit.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using both in vitro and in vivo assays we have shown that human monocytes primed with&#xD;
      Interferons alpha and gamma are tumoricidal and are capable of killing a number of tumor cell&#xD;
      lines and human tumors implanted into immunocompromised mice. We have shown that monocytes&#xD;
      isolated through elutriation at the NIH blood bank and monocytes isolated from anticoagulated&#xD;
      peripheral blood from healthy women from the NIH blood bank are equally capable of killing&#xD;
      tumor cells. No data have been collected as to whether monocytes from patients with Ovarian,&#xD;
      Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer have tumoricidal properties. In addition, native&#xD;
      host anti-tumor cell mediated immune mechanisms may play a role in clinical outcome of&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer; data indicate that the presence of intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells was&#xD;
      shown to prognosticate improved outcome in advanced ovarian cancer. Furthermore, noncellular&#xD;
      components in the blood, such as exosomes, may influence outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain blood samples from patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age with a prior diagnosis of ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer seen in the Women s Cancer Clinic of the NCI. Patients&#xD;
      must be able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect approximately 20 ml of peripheral blood at a single time point from patients&#xD;
      with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who are not currently on therapy&#xD;
      and are screening for trials, being seen in consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
