      While few students may consider a career in research at baseline, receiving information from&#xD;
      peers via online social networks represents a potential way of reaching underserved minority&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses a critical problem in the process to diversify the pipeline of clinical&#xD;
      researchers - how to cultivate baseline interest in research among high achieving youth&#xD;
      before they participate in pipeline programs. We will seek to challenge existing paradigms of&#xD;
      studying effectiveness of interventions to promote entry of minority youth into clinical&#xD;
      research careers through testing a novel social media campaign that aims to increase interest&#xD;
      in research careers among schoolmates of students in a pipeline program. We are testing the&#xD;
      use of of peer-created and inspired videos about career choice as a novel way to develop&#xD;
      messages that have potential to influence teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this research program be successful, it will yield valuable insights for researchers&#xD;
      and educators who are attempting to train minority students about the importance of involving&#xD;
      youth in creating materials to recruit and retain minorities into pipeline programs and&#xD;
      educational programs targeted towards clinical research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite several decades of effort that have produced meaningful insights into factors&#xD;
      affecting the entry of minority students into careers in health research, there is still a&#xD;
      great need to further promote entry of minority students into health research. Research we&#xD;
      have done building on broader research on how minority youth select careers has shown that&#xD;
      when minority students are interested in career in health research, a dedicated program with&#xD;
      realistic career experiences and multi-tiered mentors can increase knowledge, attitudes and&#xD;
      behaviors needed for a career in health research. However, we found that such programs are&#xD;
      much less effective if students do not enter them with a pre-existing interest in careers in&#xD;
      health research. Unfortunately, very little is known about how to increase the interest in&#xD;
      careers in health research. Research is badly needed on interventions that can &quot;prime the&#xD;
      pump&quot; for pipeline programs by increasing the number of minority students with interest in&#xD;
      careers in health research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies from adolescent health education suggest that messages that have the potential to&#xD;
      change people's attitudes and behaviors often originate from a trusted peer. A peer messenger&#xD;
      is often more easily able to relate to an individual and understand the unique pressures that&#xD;
      an individual may face in changing their behavior. This is especially true in teens, who are&#xD;
      more likely to value the opinion of and seek to emulate their peers compared to adults. While&#xD;
      peer pressure is often cast as a negative phenomenon among teens, the use of positive modes&#xD;
      of peer pressure to change behavior among teens is gaining in popularity. For example,&#xD;
      positive peer pressure has been used in many youth-to-youth messaging campaigns related to&#xD;
      difficult to change behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse or safe sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer online social networks may be a potential way to increase interest in careers in health&#xD;
      research among underrepresented minority students. The explosion of social media and&#xD;
      smartphones has facilitated the creation of social networks online, a well-documented way for&#xD;
      teenagers to interact with each other and to obtain information. According to the Pew&#xD;
      Internet Project, nearly three quarters of online teens and an equal number of young adults&#xD;
      use social network sites. Moreover, roughly 85% of teens who use social networks are active&#xD;
      participants in the site, and engage in activities such as posting comments on a friend's&#xD;
      profile page, or underneath a friend's picture. Nearly 40% of teens report sharing content&#xD;
      online that they created personally. The use of self-created videos has exploded with the&#xD;
      creation of popular media-sharing websites, such as YouTube and roughly one third of teens&#xD;
      report sharing videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, there is reason to believe that online social networking interventions that&#xD;
      aim to boost career interests would be more effective for underrepresented racial and ethnic&#xD;
      groups as well as teens from low income families than for whites. First, data suggests that&#xD;
      online social network use is higher among teens from low-income families (those earning less&#xD;
      than $30,000 annually) than in teens from wealthier households (80% vs. 70%). Moreover,&#xD;
      minority families are more likely to access the internet remotely through mobile devices such&#xD;
      as cell phones than whites. Together, this data highlights the enormous potential for online&#xD;
      social media interventions to influence career interest and engagement in minority youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising solution to increase interest in clinical research careers among high achieving&#xD;
      youth at a time when career decision making is easily influenced is through the spreading&#xD;
      video messages crafted by youth for youth through social media. Therefore, the specific aims&#xD;
      of this proposal are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To engage high achieving minority youth enrolled in an intensive pipeline&#xD;
      clinical research program in performing focus groups and surveys of their peers to&#xD;
      characterize what types of messages would be most likely to motivate their peers to consider&#xD;
      a career in clinical research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To engage high-achieving minority youth participating in a pipeline clinical&#xD;
      research program in a social media campaign in which they will create a short video to&#xD;
      promote interest in clinical research careers and spread it to their schoolmates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the reach of social media campaign led by students in a pipeline&#xD;
      clinical research program to spread a video they create to improve interest in clinical&#xD;
      research careers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To evaluate the effects of a student-led social media campaign on interest in&#xD;
      a clinical research career among the schoolmates of students in a pipeline clinical research&#xD;
      program&#xD;
