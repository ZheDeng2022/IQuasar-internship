      Octava has two versions, each with a different intend of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OctavaPink is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by authorized&#xD;
      clinical laboratories. The product is used for two following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intend of Use #1: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed&#xD;
           mammography and were determined negative for breast cancer. Being moderately sensitive&#xD;
           (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of mammography false negatives. In&#xD;
           addition, being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies additional evidence for&#xD;
           true mammography negative result which will reduce examinees anxiety of being&#xD;
           misdiagnosed as a result of high false negative mammography rate (10-30%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intend of Use #2: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed&#xD;
           biopsy after positive mammography and the biopsy result was negative. Being moderately&#xD;
           sensitive (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of biopsy false negatives.&#xD;
           In addition being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies an additional evidence&#xD;
           for true biopsy negative result which reduces examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OctavBlue is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by EventusDx&#xD;
      authorized laboratories. Intend of use of OctavBlue is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • OctavBlue is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed mammography and received&#xD;
      doubtful results. Being highly sensitive (&gt;95% sensitivity) the test can help to reveal 95%&#xD;
      of positive cases; and being moderately specific (&gt;55% specificity) - about half of negative&#xD;
      cases. The test is not intended to be used as a standalone diagnostic technique but to supply&#xD;
      additional information to a physician and help deciding about the further course of&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives - To improve the specifications of the OctavaPink test and the&#xD;
      OctavaBlue test. The current specifications being&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For the OctavaPink - 95% specificity and 50% sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For the OctavaBlue - 50% specificity and 95% sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be considered as successful in any of the below options -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaPink chip will maintain specificity of at&#xD;
           least 95% and increase the sensitivity to at least 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaBlue chip will maintain sensitivity of at&#xD;
           least 95% and increase the specificity to at least 85%.&#xD;
