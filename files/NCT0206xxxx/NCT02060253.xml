      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ganetespib when given with&#xD;
      paclitaxel, trastuzumab, pertuzumab in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body and&#xD;
      usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or has returned after a&#xD;
      period of improvement (metastatic). HER2+ describes cancer cells that have too much of a&#xD;
      protein called HER2 on their surface. In normal cells, HER2 helps to control cell growth.&#xD;
      When it is made in larger than normal amounts by cancer cells, the cells may grow more&#xD;
      quickly and be more likely to spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the proteins needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, bind&#xD;
      to HER2+ cancer cells and may kill them. Giving ganetespib with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and&#xD;
      pertuzumab may be a better treatment for patients with HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study has two parts. During the first part of this study, patients with HER2+&#xD;
      MBC receive trastuzumab in combination with ganetespib and paclitaxel to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this triplet regimen. There are dose escalations&#xD;
      for ganetespib. Paclitaxel and trastuzumab are administered at standard doses without&#xD;
      escalation. Part 1 is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second part of this study, pertuzumab at standard dose will be added to the&#xD;
      triplet regimen of ganetespib, paclitaxel and trastuzumab, using the MTD of ganetespib&#xD;
      determined in part one. The MTD of ganetespib and the safety of the four-drug regimen will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The MTD for ganetespib in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab is 150&#xD;
      mg/m2.&#xD;
