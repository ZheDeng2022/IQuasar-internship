  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of select drug therapies in patients with salivary gland cancer. The study&#xD;
      has two phases: a molecular profiling phase (phase 1) and a treatment phase (phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the Molecular profiling results in phase the participants will receive matched&#xD;
      treatment if a specific aberration is identified or will receive treatment with Selinexor if&#xD;
      unmatched and no druggable aberration is identified.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In molecular profiling phase of the study, participants will provide a sample of their tumor&#xD;
      tissue to test for changes in certain genes that show whether certain drug treatments will be&#xD;
      more useful than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have undergone molecular profiling, they will be offered a drug treatment&#xD;
      depending on the results. Certain drug treatments are designed to target certain gene&#xD;
      changes. If there is a matching drug treatment, participants will be offered that treatment&#xD;
      (either outside a clinical trial or within a clinical trial). If there are no gene changes or&#xD;
      there are changes to genes were there are no drug treatments available for those certain&#xD;
      changes, participants will be offered the study drug, Selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. Research shows that one way cancer cells can grow&#xD;
      uncontrollably is when certain proteins, called exporter proteins, are present in high levels&#xD;
      in the body. These proteins prevent certain other proteins important in protecting cells from&#xD;
      becoming cancerous and important in the controlling the growth of cells, from working. The&#xD;
      study drug Selinexor is new class of drug called Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE)&#xD;
      that blocks the exporter proteins from working which may allow the other proteins to work and&#xD;
      slow or stop tumors from growing.&#xD;
