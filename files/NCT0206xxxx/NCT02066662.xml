    <textblock>
      The following trial hypothesis will be proved: In patients with atrial fibrillation and/ or&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism standard anticoagulant treatment with coumadin/phenprocoumon is associated&#xD;
      with accelerated coronary or valvular calcification as assessed by cardiac computed&#xD;
      tomography compared to the new anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi center, prospective, controlled, open, randomized, interventional clinical trial&#xD;
      blinded concerning outcome measurements with a two- arm parallel group design will be&#xD;
      performed to investigate the association of rivaroxaban compared to coumadin/phenprocoumon&#xD;
      treatment for OAT in patients with atrial fibrillation and / or pulmonary embolism regarding&#xD;
      the development and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and aortic valve&#xD;
      calcification (AVC) as assessed by multi-slice spiral computed tomography scanning (MSCT)&#xD;
      within one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 190 patients (95 patients per treatment arm) with atrial fibrillation and/ or&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism with the indication for oral anticoagulation therapy will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening first cardiac CT scan will be performed in order to validate if calcium score&#xD;
      is &gt;50 which is an inclusion criteria. If the patient matches all other inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria the remaining imaging procedures (Echocardiography, Intima Media Thickness of&#xD;
      carotid artery (IMT) and Flow Mediated Vasodilatation (FMD), Electrocardiography (ECG) and&#xD;
      blood pressure are executed. Pregnancy strip test will be executed and also serum chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, coagulation and batch analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized to one of the two arms (Rivaroxaban or Marcumar) and will&#xD;
      undergo the same examinations and measurements as described above at 1 week, 1, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      month Follow- Up (FU). In case of a positive result in respect to the primary endpoint a FU&#xD;
      after 2 years will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be assessed after all active patients will have completed&#xD;
      12-months study visit (interim analysis)&#xD;
