  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study on the virological response of chronic&#xD;
      HBV infection to pegyinterferon-alfa-2a among patients who achieved HBeAg seroconversion on&#xD;
      nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the sustained response (HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA &lt;2000 IU/ml) to peginterferon at 24&#xD;
      weeks after the end of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B is the commonest cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Treatment with interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      HCC. NA is the commonest used medication in Hong Kong. However, most patients require&#xD;
      long-term treatment and premature drug cessation may lead to hepatitis relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the current regional guidelines, patients who have positive hepatitis B e antigen&#xD;
      (HBeAg) treated by NA can consider stopping treatment if HBeAg seroconversion has developed&#xD;
      for at least 12 months. However, up to 30-50% of patients may develop virological relapse&#xD;
      and/or HBeAg reversion after cessation of treatment. On the other hand, interferon-based&#xD;
      treatment has a much more durable response. HBeAg seroconversion is maintained in 80% of&#xD;
      patients after successful treatment with peginterferon. Upon long-term follow-up,&#xD;
      peginterferon-treated patients are also more likely to achieve hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
      (HBsAg) seroclearance, a condition closest to a cure of chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
