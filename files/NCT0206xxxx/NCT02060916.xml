    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the effect that PAZ320 has on post-prandial&#xD;
      glucose excursions measured via continuous glucose monitoring and its adverse effect profile&#xD;
      in humans. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are minimally invasive devices that measure&#xD;
      glucose levels in interstitial fluid. A small wire is inserted subcutaneously which transmits&#xD;
      the ambient subcutaneous glucose concentration every 5 minutes to a wireless recorder. In&#xD;
      usual use, the patient can see these data and graph the previous 1, 3 or 9 hours to identify&#xD;
      trends or look back over time (ie over night). In our study, the patient will be blinded to&#xD;
      the data so as not to confound results, as it has been noted in another study that patient's&#xD;
      blood sugar control was better when they were able to see CGM results and modified their&#xD;
      diet. CGM's have been shown to have clinical accuracies of 95.5-98.9% and have been used in&#xD;
      clinical trials and found to be safe. Having the patient do a finger-stick glucose&#xD;
      intermittently during the time they are wearing the CGM improves accuracy.&#xD;
