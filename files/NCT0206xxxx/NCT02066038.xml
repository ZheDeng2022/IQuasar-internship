  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)- ie, erlotinib, gefitinib, has been recommended as the&#xD;
      first option for EGFR-mutated IIIb/IV NSCLC by serial trials as it prolonged patients'&#xD;
      progression-free survival. The OPTIMAl trial indicated that those who received TKI and&#xD;
      chemotherapy during the whole treatment window survived longest. Unfortunately, previous&#xD;
      studies(INTACT, TRIBUTE et al) that concurrently combined TKI and cytotoxic regimens failed&#xD;
      to improve survival in unselected patients. To avoid the potential synergistic antagonism,&#xD;
      the FAST-ACT II trial committed a sequential strategy and find a superiority in the&#xD;
      combination arm upon chemotherapy even in EGFR-mutated group. However, pharmaceutically, the&#xD;
      continuous administration of an EGFR-TKI before subsequent chemotherapy in FAST-ACT II could&#xD;
      obviate the effects of cytotoxic agents due to the erlotinib-induced G1 arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that a better&#xD;
      sequential combination strategy of EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy (adding a EGFR-TKI wash-out&#xD;
      window before chemotherapy) would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators investigate the efficacy(PFS:progression free survival), safety, and&#xD;
      adverse-event profile of chemotherapy plus intermittent and maintenance of erlotinib, when&#xD;
      these drugs were used as first-line treatment in who had non-squamous lung carcinoma with&#xD;
      EGFR gene mutation in China.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Present with histologically proven or cytological diagnosis of non-Squamous NSCLC&#xD;
             Stage IIIB or IV as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Criteria&#xD;
             for Lung Cancer, that is not amenable to curative therapy,such as surgery or&#xD;
             radiotherapy and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy for lung cancer before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed activating mutation of EGFR-ie, an exon 19 deletion or an exon 21 L858R&#xD;
             point mutation.&#xD;

             before study enrollment. Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of&#xD;
             the treatment prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
