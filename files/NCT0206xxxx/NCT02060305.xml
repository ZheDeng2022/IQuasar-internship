      Primary Objective The efficacy of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for secondary&#xD;
      prevention of recurrent hemarthroses for hemophilia patients who has had target joints with&#xD;
      chronic synovitis. The safety profiles of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for&#xD;
      hemophilia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Adult hemophilia patients who have had one or more target joints with&#xD;
      chronic synovitis and recurrent hemarthroses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational therapy: Intra-articular injection of Bevacizumab (20 or 40 mg/ 0.8 or 1.6&#xD;
      ml/ dose) every month (28 days) for up to 4 months, depending on the improvement of target&#xD;
      joint bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The estimated study period is between Jan 2014 and Dec 2015. Totally 10 joints&#xD;
      will be enrolled for this pilot study. Before enrollment, the joint(s) will be evaluated for&#xD;
      their severity both clinically (by 10-point Pain Score, range of motion for the target joint,&#xD;
      and World Federation of Hemophilia Score) and by MRI (using the compatible MRI scales&#xD;
      developed by International Prophylaxis Study Group [IPSG]). Intra-articular injection of&#xD;
      bevacizumab will be administered, after prophylactic factor supplementation, every month for&#xD;
      up to four injections. In the first four patients, 20mg of bevacizumab will be administered.&#xD;
      If there are no Gr 3 or Gr4 dose-limiting toxicities, bevacizumab dose will be escalated to&#xD;
      40mg in the other 6 patients. Before every procedure, the plasma and the synovial fluid&#xD;
      samples will be collected for VEGF quantification for the correlative biomarker study. After&#xD;
      completing the protocol treatment, the efficacy parameters as well as the safety profiles&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: The mechanism of recurrent hemarthroses (joint bleeds) resulted from chronic&#xD;
      synovitis of target joints in hemophilic patients is thought to be a VEGF-based&#xD;
      neo-angiogenic process. Local anti-VEGF therapy with intra-articular bevacizumab (Avastin), a&#xD;
      VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that can efficiently antagonize VEGF activity, may&#xD;
      block the process and decrease the frequency of recurrent bleeding episodes. In addition, we&#xD;
      proved that intra-articular injection of bevacizumab in rat model is safe without significant&#xD;
      local or systemic adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Investigational therapy: Intra-articular injection of Bevacizumab (20 or 40 mg/ 0.8 or 1.6&#xD;

      joint bleeding.&#xD;

      will be enrolled for this pilot study. Before enrollment, the joint(s) will be evaluated for&#xD;
      their severity both clinically (by 10-point Pain Score, range of motion for the target joint,&#xD;

      completing the protocol treatment, the efficacy parameters as well as the safety profiles&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessments The efficacy: the differences of total episodes of recurrent hemarthroses within&#xD;
      3 months before and after completing bevacizumab intra-articular injection. Post-procedure&#xD;
      target joints bleedings will be recorded at intervals of 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months. The&#xD;
      total absence of haemarthrosis (zero bleeding) is rated as &quot;excellent&quot; response; bleeding&#xD;
      reduction between 75% and 99% is rated &quot;good&quot;, between 50% and 74% as &quot;fair&quot;, and below 50%&#xD;
      as &quot;poor&quot;.&#xD;
