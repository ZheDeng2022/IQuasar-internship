      Medical records will reviewed. And all patients who met the inclusion criteria will contacted&#xD;
      by a telephone call by a clinical research coordinator. The telephone interview questionnaire&#xD;
      for Lower Extremity Edema (LEE) and gynecologic cancer lymphedema questionnaire (GCLQ) will t&#xD;
      take approximately 20-30 min to complete. The questionnaire for LEE included onset, severity,&#xD;
      location, duration, and management. Patients will also questioned concerning deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis to exclude other causes of LEE. LEE is defined as subjective edema of lower&#xD;
      extremity based on patients' complaint. LLL is defined based on a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      lymphedema by a physician.&#xD;
