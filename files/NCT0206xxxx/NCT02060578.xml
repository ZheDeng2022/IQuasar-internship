  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the second cause of over-one-year-old children mortality after accident. Survival&#xD;
      rate is more than 70%, but in some cases, curative treatments are not sufficient and&#xD;
      palliative support is implemented for those children in end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric guidelines about the place of end-of-life care are varied. On European scale, home&#xD;
      is recommended (IMPaCCT study, 2007). In France, the 2008-2012 palliative care development&#xD;
      program recommended home or initial hospital care unit. This program also supports&#xD;
      implementation of mobile team rather than specific hospital units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Brittany, a pattern of regional palliative care resource team has been implemented since&#xD;
      2005. In oncology, further to the guidelines, end-of-life place of care is often discussed&#xD;
      several times for each case. Sometimes occur a lot of returns between home and hospital,&#xD;
      psychological difficulties, and difficulties to offer adapted care conditions. Finally, less&#xD;
      than 30% of children in palliative care decease at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to identify main determinants of the place of palliative care in&#xD;
      pediatric oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to clarify the factors of change comparing to the initial planned&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire completed by the parents Interview with the parents and the psychologist&#xD;
      (University Rennes 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects is : Parents of 68 to 93 children who died from cancer after a palliative&#xD;
      phase, that means 136 to 186 parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and perspectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, expected results are the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of the objective and subjective factors, which influenced the decision of&#xD;
           the place of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the factors of change comparing to the initial planned place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified, main factors could be the ones to pay attention to in order to help for&#xD;
      initial decision, better anticipation of change of place and better guidance of palliative&#xD;
      care organization wherever, at home or in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results would be new information for research on palliative care for children but also for&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this work is part of an improving approach of palliative care, related to the&#xD;
      development of open-care hospital networks. We can expect some public health impacts with new&#xD;
      arguments to help for complementary recommendations.&#xD;
