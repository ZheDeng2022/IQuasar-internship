  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 10% to 15% of all cancers and is the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer deaths in Western countries. Approximately half of all patients develop&#xD;
      metastatic disease and become candidates for the palliative chemotherapy which has been&#xD;
      proved to prolong survival and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with metastatic CRC.&#xD;
      The most active chemotherapy regiments include oxaliplatin or irinotecan combined with&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With overall survival in metastatic CRC nowadays routinely around 2 years, the same intensity&#xD;
      of therapy can hardly be maintained throughout the course of therapy. The continuum of care&#xD;
      therefore mandates changes in therapy, with treatment breaks or phases of less-intensive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy interspersed with periods of more-intensive therapy to control tumor&#xD;
      progression. Thereby, chemo-holidays conceivably reduce the cumulative toxicities of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, potentially prevent the unplanned, premature discontinuation of therapy,&#xD;
      preserve the ability to administer further phases of therapy, potentially maximize the time&#xD;
      on therapy, reduce cost, and could increase QOL for patients. Several trials have tested the&#xD;
      influence of chemo-holidays on patient outcome, with various rules on when to stop which&#xD;
      component of antitumor therapy as follows; 1) Completely stopping all therapeutic agents,&#xD;
      giving patients a completely chemotherapy-free interval (OPTIMOX-2, GISCAD), or 2) Stopping&#xD;
      only those agents associated with significant (cumulative) toxicity while continuing other&#xD;
      agents as maintenance therapy (OPTIMOX-1, Combined Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial&#xD;
      [CONcePT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we'd like to test if capecitabine maintenance after 8 cycles of capecitabine&#xD;
      combine with oxaliplatin (XELOX) could prolong progression-free survival without&#xD;
      deterioration of QOL and toxicities in patients metastatic CRC.&#xD;
