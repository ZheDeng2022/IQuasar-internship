    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine an optimal strategy to wean nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm babies. The investigators hypothesize that babies&#xD;
      that are taken off NCPAP at lower settings will need fewer total days on NCPAP than those&#xD;
      babies taken off at higher settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized control trial to investigate an optimal method for&#xD;
      discontinuing NCPAP therapy in preterm neonates. Neonates ≤32 weeks gestational age (GA) who&#xD;
      require NCPAP in the delivery room or following extubation and are delivered in or&#xD;
      transferred to Parkland Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      study team will approach the parents for verbal consent once neonates are stable on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation with a goal of extubation to NCPAP or once they are placed on initial&#xD;
      NCPAP therapy. Neonates will be randomized to the high or low NCPAP arms and managed by their&#xD;
      primary care team until they meet stability criteria as defined for a minimum of 12 hours. At&#xD;
      that time they will be removed from NCPAP using two approaches: Group 1 will be decreased to&#xD;
      5cm H2O by the primary care team at which time NCPAP is removed if the neonate is clinically&#xD;
      stable and the neonate placed in room air or on low-flow nasal cannula at ≤1L/min; Group 2&#xD;
      will be gradually weaned to a NCPAP of 3cm H2O at which time NCPAP is removed if the neonate&#xD;
      is clinically stable for the prior 24 hours and the neonate placed in room air or on low-flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula. Failure criteria will consist of clinical signs and laboratory results&#xD;
      demonstrating the need for escalation of support, e.g., increasing apnea of prematurity (AOP)&#xD;
      or need for increasing O2 supplementation. When a neonate has been stable for 5 days off&#xD;
      NCPAP, they will complete the intervention arm of the study. All neonates will be followed&#xD;
      until discharge, at which time the primary outcomes, e.g., days on NCPAP, duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization and need for O2, will be determined for each group and compared. The&#xD;
      calculated total sample size will require 238 neonates; i.e., 113 neonates per arm with a 5%&#xD;
      drop-out rate will give a power of 0.80 and alpha value of 0.05 to detect a 25% difference in&#xD;
      NCPAP days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NCPAP 5cm H2O&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supplemental oxygen &lt;25% and not increasing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respiratory rate ≤60 b/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No significant respiratory distress, e.g., retractions, dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. &lt;3 episodes of apnea (&gt;20 seconds) with bradycardia (&lt;100 beats/min), and/or&#xD;
           desaturations (&lt;88%) within 1h or &lt;5 episodes in prior 12h&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Average oxygen saturation &gt;87% with stable inspired O2&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Tolerate time off NCPAP during routine care procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Neonates &lt;27 wks GA must be ≥10d postnatal before weaning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Occurrence of ≥3 apneas and/or bradycardia and/or desaturations within 1h or &gt;4 episodes&#xD;
           in a 12h period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increasing need for supplemental O2 &gt;30% to maintain O2 saturation &gt;87%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase in the PaCO2 &gt;65 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increased work of breathing with respiratory rate &gt;75 b/min for &gt;2h&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. AOP requiring resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Initiation of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for respiratory&#xD;
           support&#xD;
