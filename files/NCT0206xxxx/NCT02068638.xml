  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas physical activity clearly results in improvements in glycemic control in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) the impact of exercise on blood sugar&#xD;
      control is more complex. In type 1 diabetes T1DM the inability to reduce exogenous insulin&#xD;
      levels during exercise is a key factor that contributes to an increased risk of&#xD;
      exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Since rapid adaptation of insulin dosage may be especially&#xD;
      difficult in patients on a multiple daily injection regimen, alternative strategies are&#xD;
      required to improve exercise-associated glucose stability. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      the combination of steady state continuous low to moderate intensity exercise with short&#xD;
      bursts of high intensity exertion (eg in the form of sprints) is an effective, well&#xD;
      tolerated, novel strategy to prevent exercise-related hypoglycemia. A further promising&#xD;
      option to stabilize blood sugar levels during and after exercise may be the ingestion of&#xD;
      fructose in addition to glucose in form of a sport drink.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity in both healthy subjects and patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus. However, while the effects of physical activity on glucose control&#xD;
      are undoubtedly beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes, exercise can cause major&#xD;
      disturbances in blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetic individuals. Hypoglycemia is a common&#xD;
      complication in patients with T1DM engaging in endurance activities such as running and&#xD;
      cycling. So far there are limited strategies suggested to improve exercise-related blood&#xD;
      sugar self-management. Current recommendations focus on variation in timing and dosage of&#xD;
      insulin administration and adjustments in carbohydrate intake. Since rapid adaptation of&#xD;
      insulin dosage may be difficult, alternative strategies to improve exercise-related glucose&#xD;
      stability are required. Increasing evidence suggests that intermittent high intensity&#xD;
      exercise (IHE), by triggering a counterregulatory hormone response, may counter-balance the&#xD;
      risk of exercise-associated hypoglycemia. However, previous studies investigating IHE in T1DM&#xD;
      were limited by heterogeneous study populations, comparably short exercise protocols, and&#xD;
      deficits in standardization procedures. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of the&#xD;
      underlying fuel metabolism has not been performed so far. As a consequence, the results&#xD;
      remain controversial and their interpretation as well as applicability are restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further alternative strategy to maintain stable glycemia during exercise may be deduced&#xD;
      from recent studies in non-diabetic individuals suggesting that the combined ingestion of&#xD;
      fructose and glucose during exercise provides the liver with an increased amount of&#xD;
      gluconeogenic precursors, thereby reducing consumption of endogenous glycogen&#xD;
      stores.Moreover, conversion of fructose into glucose and lactate may provide constant and&#xD;
      efficient fuel for working muscles. However, studies assessing the impact of fructose&#xD;
      ingestion during exercise in patients with T1DM have not been performed so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess the impact of two novel non-pharmaceutical and easily&#xD;
      feasible approaches on exercise-related blood glucose stability and its underlying&#xD;
      exercise-related fuel metabolism in patients with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy A will assess the influence on exercise-related glycemia and fuel metabolism of an&#xD;
      IHE protocol compared to an iso-energetic continuous exercise (CONT). It will be investigated&#xD;
      whether individuals reach more stable blood glucose levels when engaging in IHE compared to&#xD;
      CONT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy B will investigate whether fueling the patients with a mixed oral 1:1&#xD;
      glucose-fructose carbohydrate solution will maintain glucose values within a more stable&#xD;
      range when compared to carbohydrate supplementation by glucose alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose levels, counterregulatory hormones, metabolites such as lactate and free fatty&#xD;
      acids as well as inflammatory biomarkers will be assessed by regular blood samplings. By&#xD;
      means of oral and intravenously given stable isotopes (U-13 C glucose and 2H glucose)&#xD;
      exercise-related glucose kinetics will be investigated. Exercise-induced glycogen consumption&#xD;
      will be measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy technology. Late glycemic excursions&#xD;
      will be recorded by continuous glucose monitoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to validate 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurement of hepatic and&#xD;
      myocellular glycogen content a pre-study involving 10 patients and an equal number of matched&#xD;
      healthy controls will be performed (validation and reproducibility study).&#xD;
