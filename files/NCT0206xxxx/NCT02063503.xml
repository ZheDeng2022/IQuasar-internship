  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a consensus that exercise therapy should be used as a therapy approach in CLBP but&#xD;
      little consensus has been reached about the preferential type of therapy. There occurs to be&#xD;
      a wash out effect because of the heterogeneous character of CLBP patients. As a result, no&#xD;
      effect can be demonstrated for the entire sample. This is why one should consider creating&#xD;
      subgroups based on prognostic indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for this trial is to possibly identify prognostic indicators for treatment&#xD;
      response to three forms of exercise therapy for patients with nonspecific chronic low back&#xD;
      pain (CLBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a multicenter cohort design. Patients with nonspecific low back pain of&#xD;
      more than three months duration are recruited in two different hospitals (Antwerp University&#xD;
      Hospital and Sint Vincentius Hospital). After examination patients are assigned to one of&#xD;
      three intervention groups: motor control therapy, isometric training therapy and a&#xD;
      combination therapy. All patients will undergo eighteen treatment sessions during nine weeks.&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken at baseline and after nine weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome used is the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MDQ). For each&#xD;
      type of exercise therapy prognostic indicators will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Never before a multi-arm design was performed for the identification of prognostic indicators&#xD;
      for exercise therapy in patients with nonspecific CLBP.&#xD;

      Methods/ Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval (B300201215600) was obtained from the local ethics committees of the Antwerp&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design In the identification of prognostic indicators is derived from a number of&#xD;
      variables that have predictive potential for therapy outcome. These variables are obtained&#xD;
      from baseline measurements and have a multidimensional character (impairments,&#xD;
      activities/participation and contextual factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment Patients will be recruited by doctors at the service of two settings&#xD;
      located in Antwerp namely the Antwerp University Hospital (UZA) and the Sint-Vincentius&#xD;
      Hospital. Treatment and measurements will be performed at the site where the patient has been&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Current nonspecific LBP persisting at least three months, consulted a&#xD;
      medical doctor during the last month because of the persistent low back pain, age between 18&#xD;
      and 60, sufficient fluency in Dutch to follow treatment instructions and answer survey&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: spinal canal stenosis, spondylolisthesis and spondylitis, large herniated&#xD;
      disc sciatica, radiating pain below the knee, previous back surgery, a history of known&#xD;
      spinal fractures, malignancy, known muscle-, nerve-, skin-, or joint diseases, pregnancy and&#xD;
      lack of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing As primary (dependent) outcome measure the Modified Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire is used (MDQ). The MDQ is a disease specific questionnaire to measure&#xD;
      disability in LBP patients [21-23].&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary (independent) outcome measures the following tests are used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, Measurement of impairments: duration of the LBP/ pelvis impairments / respiratory&#xD;
      impairments (all three items through anamnesis). Prone instability test, Straight Leg Raise,&#xD;
      Beighton scale, Active Straight Leg Raise, sitting knee extension test, waiters bow, pelvic&#xD;
      tilt, side support test, extensor endurance test, active sit-up, Visual Analogue Scale for&#xD;
      pain (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, measurement of limitations in activities and participation: hours of physical&#xD;
      activity/week (trough anamnesis). Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36), Roland Morris&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, measurement of contextual factors: gender/ age / height / weight / body mass index /&#xD;
      smoking / profession / underwent previous therapy / comorbidity (trough anamnesis). Tampa&#xD;
      scale for kinesiophobia, Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ), We performed a&#xD;
      literature search to select all used clinical tests based on their reliability and validity&#xD;
      [24]. The Baseline testing takes about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up takes place after completion of the treatment program at nine weeks. All patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures (PROMs) from the baseline testing will be re-evaluated at this&#xD;
      moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization &amp; blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Sint-Vincentius Hospital, all included patients will follow the combination treatment&#xD;
      since this is the only intervention group which is being organized in this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UZA, patients will be randomly assigned into one of the two treatment groups (motor&#xD;
      control or isometric training) after baseline testing. The responsible researcher will use a&#xD;
      randomization list generated with Microsoft ® Excel ® software (version 14.3.9, 2010 ©&#xD;
      Microsoft Corporation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the nine weeks intervention, patients will be treated two times a week. Patients will&#xD;
      be assigned randomly into one of three intervention groups (motor control therapy, isometric&#xD;
      training therapy or combination therapy). Each intervention will take about seventy minutes.&#xD;
      Ten minutes warming up and cooling down will be the same in each treatment regime. Each group&#xD;
      receives fifty minutes of therapy specific intervention. Previously trained physiotherapists&#xD;
      will give the treatment. To ensure that all therapists provide the same exercises, a&#xD;
      treatment protocol for each treatment group was developed and a treatment diary will be&#xD;
      filled out after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions in derivation and validation phase are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study describes the identification of prognostic indicators in which the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of the interventions cannot be predicted. Therefore, a two-tailed hypothesis was used&#xD;
      to calculate the power. A pilot study showed that the standard deviation of the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure, MDQ, is set at 10.53.6 Given these estimates, 54 patients were needed to&#xD;
      detect a minimum clinically important difference (MCID, effect size 0.84) with 90% power.&#xD;
      Consequently, three groups of 18 patients were needed to complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic indicators aim to detect potential predictive variables for treatment success&#xD;
      (dichotomous, yes/no) in a set of baseline measurements. A minimal decrease in the MDQ score&#xD;
      of 9 points is considered as treatment success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential predictive variables are selected as follows: first, individual variables from the&#xD;
      self-reports, history, and physical examination are tested for their bivariate association&#xD;
      with the reference standard using independent sample t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests or&#xD;
      Chi-square tests based on the nature of the data. Variables with a significance level of P &lt;&#xD;
      0.10 are retained as potential prediction variables. We choose a more liberal significance&#xD;
      level at this stage to avoid excluding potential predictive variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This statistical analysis is performed for each treatment group (motor control therapy,&#xD;
      general active exercise therapy and isometric training therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information form and informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients meet the in- and exclusion criteria they are scheduled for an interview with one&#xD;
      of our researchers to be informed about the trial. If patients decide to participate they&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent. Information form and informed consent are made and have been&#xD;
      approved by the ethics committee of the University of Antwerp.&#xD;
