      The study will evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy on skin comfort of F#1048-082 soothing&#xD;
      cream used just after injection procedure and also the tolerance and the efficacy of the&#xD;
      F#841-020 anti-age cream on aging parameters compared to baseline and to the F#1374-002&#xD;
      placebo cream (comparison within subjects - half face method) to identify additional benefits&#xD;
      delivered by the product compared to a cosmetic procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
            20. Skin tone (0= good complexion to 10= bad complexion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical colorimetry: measurement of skin colour (L*a*b*) by Spectrophotometer CM-2600d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographic documentation: Canfield imaging station equipped with visible, polarized,&#xD;
           fluorescence and UV light and with specific lighting for shadows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin replicas and profilometry at level of crow's feet (image analysis of: total surface&#xD;
           of the wrinkles, mean length of the wrinkles, total length of the wrinkles, number of&#xD;
           the wrinkles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin elasticity measurement by suction (CutometerÂ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerance evaluation (investigator's judgement):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each evaluation time, the investigator considering the appearance of possible adverse&#xD;
      effects related to the tested creams and all comments reported by the subjects on diary card&#xD;
      will judge the tolerance of the products under study.&#xD;

clinical and self grading (performed on injection areas by VAS score)&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The anti-age product will be applied once a day, in the evening, on half face and neck, for 12 weeks and the placebo cream in the morning with the same modalities. On the contralateral face side (according to a previous randomisation list), the volunteers will apply the placebo cream twice a day.&#xD;
5 visits will be performed: a baseline visit (T0 - before aesthetic procedure), a visit 7 days after injection (T0''/T7d), 2 intermediate visits (T4W and T8W - 4 and 8 weeks after the first study product application) and a final visit (T12W - 12 weeks after the first study product application).&#xD;
Tolerance (number of participants with adverse events) and efficacy:&#xD;
clinical and self grading on face and neck (by VAS score)&#xD;
optical colorimetry on both cheeks (L*a*b*)&#xD;
photographic documentation of all the face&#xD;
skin elasticity on both cheeks (deformation-mm)&#xD;
