  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid rise in obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) in the US over the past decade&#xD;
      is responsible for more disease and death than any other single factor. Severe obesity is&#xD;
      associated with numerous co-morbidities contributing to increased mortality risk, including&#xD;
      end stage liver disease. Liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with&#xD;
      end stage liver disease and obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent in this population. In&#xD;
      one study, 54% of patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) were either&#xD;
      overweight or obese [body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2], and 7% were severely or morbidly obese&#xD;
      (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2). In addition, weight gain after solid organ transplantation is common&#xD;
      because of steroid-containing immunosuppression and physical inactivity from decreased&#xD;
      exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity has been shown to increase the surgical morbidity, including wound infections, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, and hernias after transplantation. More significantly, excess pretransplant body&#xD;
      weight hinders the rate of improvement in health-related quality of life after liver&#xD;
      transplantation[7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible approach for treating obesity after a liver transplant is to use bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Currently, bariatric surgery is established as the most effective means for both&#xD;
      weight loss and resolution of metabolic disease in the morbidly obese. Recent publications&#xD;
      emphasize the usefulness of bariatric surgery in the reduction of long-term cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk, cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality, and the management of uncontrolled type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2DM). In addition, it decreases mortality and improves both social functioning&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery may improve eligibility for transplant in patients previously excluded due&#xD;
      to excessive weight. Bariatric procedures, such as sleeve gastrectomy, allow for significant&#xD;
      weight loss over time that greatly reduces or eliminates obesity related illnesses such as&#xD;
      diabetes, high blood pressure and liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Institutes of Health, bariatric surgery is reserved for patients&#xD;
      with a BMI of &gt; 40 or &gt; 35 kg/m2 in the presence of major co-morbidities (e.g. type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, heart disease, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant number of liver transplant candidates have obesity-related illnesses, thus&#xD;
      putting them at risk for cardiovascular and metabolic complications post-transplant. In&#xD;
      addition, patients awaiting OLT are typically no longer medically stable to undergo intensive&#xD;
      diet and exercise regimens as treatment for their diseases. Finally, decreased activity and&#xD;
      medications used to prevent liver graft rejection all contribute to increased weight gain&#xD;
      following transplant. In fact, in a series of 320 non-obese liver transplant recipients,&#xD;
      21.6% of patients became obese within two years of transplant. These comorbidities also&#xD;
      contribute to poorer post-transplant outcomes and development of what is known as the&#xD;
      post-transplant metabolic syndrome. Morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) may also have&#xD;
      higher frequencies of morbidities such as prolonged hospitalization and readmission as well&#xD;
      as infectious, wound, and cardiovascular complications after transplantation. Finally,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal adiposity creates a technically more challenging operative dissection, but no&#xD;
      data exist on whether it increases perioperative morbidity or mortality in liver transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeve gastrectomy is the most attractive restrictive procedure in a liver transplant&#xD;
      population for several key reasons. One, sleeve gastrectomy does not require the implantation&#xD;
      of a foreign body, such as placement of an adjustable gastric band, which in an&#xD;
      immunocompromised post-transplant patient raises concern for severe infectious complications.&#xD;
      Secondly, as stated previously, sleeve gastrectomy is a purely restrictive procedure, and&#xD;
      therefore is least likely to cause significant macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies.&#xD;
      Finally, when compared to other restrictive procedures, such as adjustable gastric band&#xD;
      placement, it has a lower likelihood of treatment failure (i.e. &lt;50% excess weight loss). In&#xD;
      fact, recent reports describe not only high failure rates with adjustable gastric band&#xD;
      placement, but also high reintervention rates for both band-related complications (e.g. band&#xD;
      erosion, leakage, slippage, port infection and esophageal dilatation) and failure to lose&#xD;
      weight such that as few as 54% of patients may have their band in place after 10 years.&#xD;

      PROCEDURAL DETAILS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sleeve gastrectomy is performed with the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position. The&#xD;
      liver is retracted cephalad and to the right, and the short gastric vessels of the greater&#xD;
      curvature and retrogastric attachments are divided from the angle of His to approximately&#xD;
      6-8cm from the pylorus. A 30-40 French bougie is placed in the stomach and directed along the&#xD;
      lesser curve. The antrum is preserved and a vertical subtotal, sleeve gastrectomy is then&#xD;
      fashioned along the lesser curvature 1 cm away from the bougie toward the esophagogastric&#xD;
      junction using linear staplers, beginning 6 cm from the pylorus on the greater curve side and&#xD;
      continuing up to the angle of His. The staple line may be oversewn with a running absorbable&#xD;
      suture or an absorbable staple buttress material may also be used to help prevent bleeding.&#xD;
      Air is infused via an endoscope into the newly created &quot;sleeve&quot; to rule out a leak ([33]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL DATA TO DATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Loss Weight loss surgery has been shown to be a safe, effective and durable option for&#xD;
      the treatment of morbid obesity.[34, 35] The primary weight loss effectiveness parameters&#xD;
      measured are percent excess weight loss (%EWL), defined as the difference in the baseline and&#xD;
      post-surgery weight divided by the difference in baseline weight and ideal body weight (based&#xD;
      on the 1983 Metropolitan Tables for Life Insurance) multiplied by 100, and reduction in BMI.&#xD;
      Studies on the early outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy report a mean EWL of 51-85% at 3 years&#xD;
      and 43-58% after 6 years. [36, 37] Additionally, patients have been shown to reduce their&#xD;
      (average) BMI more than 15 points in the first year. [38-40]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in Obesity-related conditions after bariatric surgery Patients undergoing sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy experience a statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) reduction in glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c). Over two-thirds of patients return to a HbA1c of 6.5% or less within a&#xD;
      year. [41, 42] In addition, more than half of patients experience complete resolution of&#xD;
      diabetes within one year. Blood pressure normalization is seen in 50-75% of patients who&#xD;
      undergo gastric sleeve, and these rates are comparable with those of Roux en Y gastric bypass&#xD;
      and adjustable gastric banding (AGB).[42] Hyperlipidemia, present in nearly half of patients&#xD;
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, has also shown a resolution rate of nearly 100%.[43]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in Quality of Life Fezzi et all conducted a one year follow-up of 78 patients&#xD;
      after sleeve gastrectomy. The SF-36 Questionnaire and Impact of Weight on Quality of&#xD;
      Life-Lite questionnaire (IWQOL-Lite) were used to measure quality of life. In general, there&#xD;
      was an improvement in all eight SF-36 component and domain scores compared to baseline for&#xD;
      all post-surgery visits.[44] Quality of Life (BQL) assessment has shown that compared with&#xD;
      patients who undergo AGB, sleeve gastrectomy patients demonstrated a significantly greater&#xD;
      BQL composite score (66.5 versus 57.9), indicating greater quality of life. Sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy patients also report significantly less vomiting than AGB patients (2% versus&#xD;
      43%).[45]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality Benefit for bariatric surgery Morbid obesity is associated with increased mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity due to its association with many disease states and reduces life expectancy by&#xD;
      five to 20 years.[46] Two recent landmark studies confirmed the benefits of bariatric surgery&#xD;
      in not only achieving substantial weight loss and improving the co-morbidities of obesity,&#xD;
      but in reducing mortality. In the Swedish Obesity Study[10] researchers enrolled 4,047 obese&#xD;
      subjects who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty, gastric bypass or adjustable gastric&#xD;
      band surgery at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers. After ten years,&#xD;
      weight loss was 25±11% for gastric bypass, 16±11% for vertical-banded gastroplasty, and&#xD;
      14±14% for banding, as compared with the baseline weight. Most importantly, they demonstrated&#xD;
      in a prospective, case-controlled surgical intervention trial that bariatric surgery in obese&#xD;
      subjects is associated with a reduction in overall mortality, as compared with conventional&#xD;
      treatment in matched obese controls (hazard ratio 0.76).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adams et al[11] also demonstrated similar results in a large U.S. retrospective cohort trial&#xD;
      comparing 7,925 bariatric surgery patients to matched severely obese controls, followed for a&#xD;
      mean of 7.1 years. The study concluded that adjusted long-term mortality from any cause in&#xD;
      the surgery group decreased by 40%, as compared to controls. Specifically, compared to&#xD;
      controls, the surgically treated group had a 56% decrease in mortality for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, a 92% decrease in diabetes and a 60% decrease in mortality from cancer. In addition,&#xD;
      in a large systematic review and meta-analysis of 136 studies, bariatric surgery achieves&#xD;
      significant results in attaining long-term weight loss and resolution of comorbidities such&#xD;
      as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea.[35]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Safety Profile The American College of Surgeons - Bariatric Surgery Center Network&#xD;
      (ACS-BSCN) Accreditation Program recently published its first report on the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy as compared to the Adjustable Gastric Band(AGB),&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass(LRYGB) and the Open Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass(ORYGB) for&#xD;
      the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases[38]. Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      analyses compare 30-day, 6-month, and one-year outcomes including morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      readmissions and reoperations as well as reduction in body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      weight-related comorbidities. 109 hospitals submitted data for 28,616 patients, from 7/2007&#xD;
      to 9/2010. Sleeve gastrectomy was found to have higher risk-adjusted morbidity, readmission&#xD;
      and reoperation/intervention rates compared to the AGB, but lower reoperation/intervention&#xD;
      rates compared to the LRYGB and ORYGB. There were no differences in mortality. Reduction in&#xD;
      BMI and most of the weight-related comorbidities following the LSG also lies between those of&#xD;
      the LAGB and the LRYGB/ORYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACS-BSCN accredits facilities in the United States that have undergone an independent,&#xD;
      voluntary and rigorous peer evaluation in accordance with nationally recognized bariatric&#xD;
      surgical standards[47]. Hospitals are accredited as Level I, Level II, Level II New or&#xD;
      Outpatient facilities, depending on hospital surgical volume and resources. Level I hospitals&#xD;
      must perform over 125 cases per year, and demonstrate sufficient resources to care for the&#xD;
      most challenging and complex patients. They are accredited to care for patients with all&#xD;
      levels of obesity, ages, comorbidities and are accredited to perform elective revisional&#xD;
      surgery. Level II hospitals have lower volume requirements - 25 cases per year-and are&#xD;
      accredited for the care of less complex obese patients. Level II centers may not perform&#xD;
      elective revisional operations, or any elective primary procedure on high-risk patients.&#xD;
      High-risk patients are defined as follows: non-ambulatory patients, patients over 60 years&#xD;
      old, adolescents under the age of 18, high Body Mass Index (BMI) patients (male patients may&#xD;
      not have a BMI ≥55 and female patients may not have a BMI ≥60), patients who have organ&#xD;
      failure, an organ transplant, or are a candidate for a transplant, and patients with&#xD;
      significant cardiac or pulmonary comorbid conditions. Northwestern Memorial Hospital's&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery Program is a Level I accredited center and thus adheres to the highest&#xD;
      safety and excellence standards as put forth by the ACS-BSCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hutter et al. observed a 30-day mortality of 0.1% and a 1-year mortality of 0.2% in their&#xD;
      prospective study of over 28,000 patients. These rates were higher than those observed for&#xD;
      AGB (0.05% and 0.08%) but lower than for RYGB (0.14% and 0.34%). Thirty-day morbidity was&#xD;
      5.6% and reoperation rate 3%.[38] The 30-day morbidity rate for LSG (5.61%) is statistically&#xD;
      higher than the LAGB rate (1.44%), however this is comparable to the LRYGB rate (5.91%).&#xD;
      Similarly, 30-day readmission rate for the LSG (5.4%) is statistically higher than for the&#xD;
      LAGB (1.71%), but comparable to the LRYGB (6.47%). Reoperation/intervention rates for the LSG&#xD;
      (2.97%) are positioned between the LAGB (0.92%) and the LRYGB (5.02%), which is significant&#xD;
      on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, complication rates following the LSG&#xD;
      seem to be positioned between those for the LAGB (which has lower 30 day morbidity,&#xD;
      readmission and reoperation/intervention rates) and the LRYGB (which has higher reoperation&#xD;
      rates)[38].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other bariatric procedures, patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy have not been found&#xD;
      to suffer from nutritional deficits following surgery, but close monitoring of B12, folic&#xD;
      acid, zinc, calcium and iron are recommended.[48] The most common long-term complication of&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is reported in 22% of&#xD;
      patients at 1 year, but declines to less than 5% after 3 years. A recurrence has been&#xD;
      observed in a small population after 6 years, and has been attributed to asymmetric stapling&#xD;
      of the gastric sleeve leading to a conical shape and relative mid-stomach stenosis.[37] In&#xD;
      addition, compared to the AGB, the sleeve gastrectomy has statistically higher rates for&#xD;
      peripheral nerve injury, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, renal&#xD;
      insufficiency, urinary tract infection, organ space infection, and sepsis. When compared to&#xD;
      the LRYGB, sleeve gastrectomy has higher rates of organ space infection, renal insufficiency,&#xD;
      and sepsis but lower rates of ventilator dependence. Bariatric surgery-specific postoperative&#xD;
      occurrences requiring readmission, reoperation or an intervention within 30-days show that&#xD;
      compared to the AGB, LSG has a higher rate of anastomotic/staple line leaks,&#xD;
      fluid/electrolyte/nutrition problems, strictures, infection/fevers, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      bleeding and events not otherwise specified. Compared to LRYGB, sleeve gastrectomy has a&#xD;
      comparable rate of nearly all postoperative bariatric specific occurrences requiring&#xD;
      readmission, reoperation or an intervention, except for a lower rate of stricture, intestinal&#xD;
      obstruction, and anastomotic ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety in a liver transplant population Campsen and colleagues recently published a case&#xD;
      report of a young morbidly obese woman (BMI 42) with diabetes, hypertension and obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea who underwent adjustable gastric banding (AGB) during liver transplantation.[24]&#xD;
      Six months after surgery, the patient experienced a 45% excess weight loss with resolution of&#xD;
      her hypertension, diabetes and sleep apnea. In another publication, two morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients who were transplanted for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      subsequently developed graft dysfunction secondary to disease recurrence, next underwent&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and at two years post-op showed significant&#xD;
      improvement in liver histology.[49] A recently published case series in obese patients&#xD;
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy post liver transplant demonstrated efficacy and no adverse&#xD;
      effects on graft function.[27] Finally, researchers at Mayo have recently reported a small&#xD;
      case series of 7 patients with end-stage liver disease who were unsuccessful with&#xD;
      pre-transplant weight loss and underwent combined liver transplant plus gastric sleeve&#xD;
      resection. They report minimal additional time added to the transplant procedure, and to&#xD;
      date, there has been no morbidity in 6 to 24 months of follow-up for 6 of the 7 patients[28].&#xD;
      One patient experienced a gastric leak with a complicating intra-abdominal infection that has&#xD;
      since resolved, and he was well with normal liver function and a BMI of 24 kg/m2 6 months&#xD;
      after transplantation[29]. However, no prospective studies have been conducted to examine the&#xD;
      impact of sleeve gastrectomy on the reduction of metabolic risk factors in obese patients&#xD;
      undergoing liver transplantation.&#xD;
