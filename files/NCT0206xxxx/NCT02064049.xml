  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess how feasible it is to treat and prevent the&#xD;
      transmission of Hepatitis C in the prison setting to achieve substantial reductions in the&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence of Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) treatment with&#xD;
      interferon-free Direct Acting Anti-virals (DAAs) in prison inmates will achieve a &gt;50%&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence of HCV infection over a two year period in the prison setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted initially in two maximum security prisons located in New South&#xD;
      Wales, Australia and comprises four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, Surveillance of HCV Incidence and Prevalence and Liver Disease Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCV incidence and prevalence phase is a prospective longitudinal cohort. HCV incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence and liver disease burden will be monitored through regular six-monthly&#xD;
      cross-sectional surveys of participants for 3.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2, Modelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from year 1 of the surveillance of HCV incidence and prevalence phase will be used&#xD;
      to model the number of participants required to be treated to demonstrate a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3, Treatment Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment intervention will only be conducted in one of the maximum security prisons&#xD;
      (Treatment Prison). The second prison will continue to care for HCV infected inmates as per&#xD;
      standard of care (Control Prison). The intervention component of this study will consist of a&#xD;
      phase IV open-label study of interferon-free DAAs for the treatment of HCV infection. The&#xD;
      treatment phase will commence in year 2 and will be two years in duration. The exact drug&#xD;
      combination and regimen to be used in the treatment intervention will be determined in year 1&#xD;
      once phase II and III data of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir and other potential interferon-free&#xD;
      DAA regimens are published. The exact number of participants required to demonstrate a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in incidence will be determined during the modelling phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4, Cost-effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment intervention phase participants will be required to complete a survey to&#xD;
      obtain estimates of health outcomes (EQ-5D survey) at regular intervals. This data will be&#xD;
      used by the health economist to determine the cost effectiveness of treatment as prevention&#xD;
      in the prison setting.&#xD;
