  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is able to exert long lasting effects in children with atopic&#xD;
      disorders. We have shown that Nutramigen LGG accelerates tolerance acquisition in infants&#xD;
      with cow's milk allergy (CMA). The mechanisms of these effects are still largely undefined.&#xD;
      The effect of LGG could be related at least in part by the immunoregulatory role played by&#xD;
      LGG. This probiotic can balance the generation of cytokines possibly involved in IgE- or&#xD;
      non-IgE-mediated CMA (i.e., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ , TGF-beta, and TNF-alfa), which can&#xD;
      contribute to modulation of inﬂammatory processes. We have demonstrated that children with&#xD;
      IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly higher level of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to cow's&#xD;
      milk protein, and that tolerance is associated with a marked reduction of IL-13 production&#xD;
      and a concomitant increased frequency of IFN-γ releasing cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics studies the heritable (and potentially reversible) changes of the genome&#xD;
      inherited from one cell generation to the next which alter gene expression but do not involve&#xD;
      changes in primary DNA sequences, highlighting the complexity of the inter-relationship&#xD;
      between genetics and nutrition. There are three distinct, but closely interacting, epigenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms (histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding microRNAs) that are&#xD;
      responsible for modifying the expression of critical genes associated with physiologic and&#xD;
      pathologic processes. The profile of epigenetic modifications associated with Th lineage&#xD;
      commitment, coupled with the sensitivity of the early developmental period, has led to&#xD;
      speculation that factors that disrupt these pathways may increase the risk of allergic&#xD;
      diseases. Specifically, effects on DNA methylation and endogenous histone deacetylase&#xD;
      inhibitors acting on specific pathways (Th1 and T regulatory cell differentiation) may favour&#xD;
      Th2-associated allergic differentiation. MicroRNAs are another structural components of an&#xD;
      epigenetic mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA translation. It has&#xD;
      been recently identified a specific Th2-associated miRNA (miR-21) that is critical for the&#xD;
      regulation of Th cell polarization.&#xD;
