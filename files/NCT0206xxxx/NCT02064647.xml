  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides up to 288 blood glucose levels per day, updated&#xD;
      every 5 minutes and displayed in real-time on the insulin pump, which can be used to enhance&#xD;
      delivery of insulin through pump therapy. In addition this real-time CGM data includes &quot;trend&#xD;
      arrows&quot; which indicate when the blood glucose is rapidly falling or rising thus enabling the&#xD;
      pump user to make immediate adjustments in insulin delivery to prevent subsequent low or high&#xD;
      blood sugars. The trend arrows are displayed when the blood glucose is rapidly falling or&#xD;
      rising. For example, if the glucose is increasing by 1-2 mmol/L over 20 minutes, a single&#xD;
      upward arrow alerts the pump wearer, who can then decide to give a bolus of insulin or&#xD;
      increase the meal bolus. Should the glucose level be increasing at a rate greater than&#xD;
      2mmol/L over 20 minutes, 2 upward arrows are displayed and the user could decide to give a&#xD;
      larger bolus. The purpose of the bolus adjustment is to add insulin for the predicted rise in&#xD;
      glucose to prevent or reduce subsequent hyperglycemia. Similarly, a decrease in the insulin&#xD;
      bolus is advised if glucose levels are falling as evidenced by one or two downward arrows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, effective strategies for adjusting insulin boluses based on CGM trend arrows are&#xD;
      lacking. The JDRF CGM Study Group recommended that boluses be adjusted based on trend arrows&#xD;
      using a standard 10-20% increase/decrease of the total original recommended bolus dose (10%&#xD;
      for one arrow up or down, and 20% for two arrows up or down), with the original bolus dose&#xD;
      calculated by the pump calculator (i.e. Bolus Wizard). However, the original recommended&#xD;
      bolus dose is dependent on the amount of food to be consumed (grams of carbohydrate) and the&#xD;
      current blood glucose (if above or below target range), as well as the amount of active&#xD;
      insulin, and therefore increasing or decreasing the total recommended bolus by 10-20% may&#xD;
      overcompensate for the trend arrows and result in postprandial hypoglycemia. Attempts to use&#xD;
      the10/20% formula within CHEO's large pediatric pump/CGM population resulted in low&#xD;
      acceptance and adherence by CGM users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGM TIME Trial Study Group develop an innovative tool for adjusting boluses for CGM trend&#xD;
      arrows based on the patient's own insulin sensitivity factor (ISF). The Trend Arrow&#xD;
      Adjustment Tool formula is: if CGM shows a single arrow up or down: adjust bolus by +/-&#xD;
      (1.5/ISF) and for 2 arrows up or down +/- (3/ISF). Use of the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool&#xD;
      within the CGM TIME Trial appears to lead to more appropriate adjustment in bolus dosing, and&#xD;
      more effective prevention of subsequent hyper- and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, this tool&#xD;
      appears to have excellent uptake amongst the TIME Trial participants, with observations that&#xD;
      there is continued usage of the tool throughout the 12 month study, and greater satisfaction&#xD;
      with this component of CGM. However, the tool has not been systematically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool, to determine its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing postprandial hyper- and hypoglycemia, as well as parent,&#xD;
      child/youth satisfaction, and ease of use of the tool based on self-report measures.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made with the 10/20% bolus adjustment &amp; also to no adjustments to meal&#xD;
      boluses (i.e. ignoring CGM trend arrows). Should use of the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool lead&#xD;
      to more time spent within the target glucose range, this will have immediate clinical benefit&#xD;
      for patients, including improved quality of life, and potentially a reduction in HbA1c and&#xD;
      prevention of long-term complications.&#xD;

      Detailed protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1(inpatient evaluation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of the study will take place in a standardized outpatient setting (CHEO Medical Day&#xD;
      Unit/Clinic). The CGM trend arrows will be stimulated using two typical clinical scenarios:&#xD;
      oral fast acting carbohydrate (to stimulate upward trend arrows) and exercise (to stimulate&#xD;
      downward trend arrows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 participants will be enrolled in this phase of the study (20 of whom will have oral fast&#xD;
      acting carbohydrate and 20 of whom will engage in exercise). Once trend arrows have been&#xD;
      triggered, the subjects will receive a standardized meal, and an adjusted insulin bolus.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made between the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool (based on the patient's own&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity factor) and the standard bolus adjustment recommendations (i.e. +/-&#xD;
      10/20%, based on the STAR 1 Trial and JDRF CGM Study Group). Phase 1 of the study will lead&#xD;
      directly to Phase 2's outpatient evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upward CGM trend arrows (Group 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will arrive fasting at the outpatient clinic. They will have been asked to&#xD;
           change their pump and CGM the morning of the previous day and to ensure that both are&#xD;
           functioning well prior to arrival. An iPro2 (blinded) continuous glucose monitor will be&#xD;
           inserted subcutaneously, to provide a second recording of glucose trends. Each subject&#xD;
           will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to either the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool (based on&#xD;
           the patient's own insulin sensitivity factor) or the standard bolus adjustment&#xD;
           recommendations (i.e. +/- 10/20%, based on the STAR 1 Trial and JDRF CGM Study Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline blood glucose will be checked using a validated blood glucose meter, via&#xD;
           capillary sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At study onset, target blood glucose is 3.6-11mmol/L. If CGM shows trend arrows, the&#xD;
           participant will proceed directly to a meal. If there are no upward trend arrows, a&#xD;
           preliminary dose of Glucodex (oral fast acting carbohydrate) will be given. The&#xD;
           participant will wait for up to one hour or until CGM ↑↑ are triggered, and will then&#xD;
           proceed to a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant will be given a standardized meal (containing a fixed amount of&#xD;
           carbohydrate, fat and protein, appropriate for subject's weight) and a bolus of insulin&#xD;
           will be given, via the insulin pump, using either the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool or the&#xD;
           standard 10/20% formula, to adjust the bolus dosage recommended by the bolus wizard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Glucose levels will be monitored using hourly capillary blood samples, CGM and iPro2.&#xD;
           Glucose levels &lt;/= 3.5mmol/L or if &lt; 4.0 mmol/L and the subject complains of&#xD;
           hypoglycemic symptoms, will be treated as per standard hypoglycemia management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Glucose monitoring will continue for 3 hours postprandially, to obtain an adequate&#xD;
           glycemic profile for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A second dose of Glucodex will then be given, to trigger trend arrows again. Subjects&#xD;
           will wait for one hour or until CGM ↑↑ are triggered, and will then proceed to a second&#xD;
           standardized meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A bolus of insulin will be given, via the insulin pump, using either the Trend Arrow&#xD;
           Adjustment Tool or the standard 10/20% formula, to adjust the bolus dosage recommended&#xD;
           by the bolus wizard. The same bolus adjustment method will be used for both meals in the&#xD;
           same participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Glucose monitoring will continue for a further 3 hours postprandially, to obtain an&#xD;
           adequate glycemic profile for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Prior to discharge, the participant and their parents/guardians, will be trained in the&#xD;
           use of the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool or the 10/20% bolus adjustment formula, (matching&#xD;
           the bolus adjustment protocol used in the acute part of the study), and asked to&#xD;
           continue to use this for the next 7 days. Participants will be requested to continue to&#xD;
           use the iPro2 sensor for 6 days and to upload CGM data daily via Carelink Personal. A&#xD;
           log book will be given, to record each time a trend arrow is observed and the methods&#xD;
           used to adjust the bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Downward trend arrows (Group 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will arrive fasting at the outpatient clinic. An iPro2 continuous glucose&#xD;
           monitor will be inserted subcutaneously, to provide a second recording of glucose&#xD;
           trends. Each subject will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to either the Trend Arrow&#xD;
           Adjustment Tool (based on the patient's own insulin sensitivity factor) or the standard&#xD;
           bolus adjustment recommendations (i.e. +/- 10/20%, based on the STAR 1 Trial and JDRF&#xD;
           CGM Study Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline blood glucose will be checked, via capillary sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At study onset, blood glucose should be in a 6-11mmol/L target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If CGM shows trend arrows, subjects will proceed directly to a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If there are no downward trend arrows, the participant will carry out exercise, using a&#xD;
           treadmill. Exercise will be for a period of 15 minutes, followed by a 5 minute rest&#xD;
           period; and repeated as tolerated until downward trend arrows are triggered. CGM will be&#xD;
           monitored for trend arrows. Exercise will be halted if CGM shows ↓↓ or child complains&#xD;
           of hypoglycemic symptoms. At this point, capillary blood glucose will be checked.&#xD;
           Glucose levels &lt;/= 3.5mmol/L, or &lt; 4mmol/L with hypoglycemia symptoms, will be treated&#xD;
           according to the standard hypoglycemia management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The participant will then be given a standardized meal (containing a fixed amount of&#xD;
           carbohydrate, fat and protein, appropriate for the subject's weight) and a bolus of&#xD;
           insulin will be given, via the insulin pump, using either the Trend Arrow Adjustment&#xD;
           Tool or the standard 10/20% formula, to adjust the bolus dosage recommended by the bolus&#xD;
           wizard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Glucose levels will be monitored using hourly capillary blood samples and CGM. Any&#xD;
           glucose levels &lt;/= 3.5mmol/L, or &lt; 4mmol/L with hypoglycemic symptoms, will be treated&#xD;
           as per standard hypoglycemia management plan. Glucose monitoring will continue for 3&#xD;
           hours, to obtain an adequate glycemic profile for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A second standardized meal will then be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. A bolus of insulin will be given, via the insulin pump, using either the Trend Arrow&#xD;
           Adjustment Tool or the standard 10/20% formula, to adjust the bolus dosage recommended&#xD;
           by the bolus wizard. The same bolus adjustment method will be used at both time points&#xD;
           for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Glucose monitoring will continue for a further 3 hours postprandially, to obtain an&#xD;
           adequate glycemic profile for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Prior to discharge, the participant and their parents/guardians, will be trained in the&#xD;
           use of the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool or the 10/20% bolus adjustment formula, (matching&#xD;
           the bolus adjustment protocol used in Phase 1 of the study), and asked to continue to&#xD;
           use this for the next 7days. Participants will be requested to continue to use the iPro2&#xD;
           sensor for 6 days and to upload CGM data daily via Carelink Personal. A log book will be&#xD;
           given, to record each time a trend arrow is observed and the methods used to adjust the&#xD;
           bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Phase 2: Outpatient Evaluation of the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single site, randomized, controlled, single blinded crossover study, involving&#xD;
      the same 40 subjects. Each participant will complete a 3 week assessment. Phase 1 will lead&#xD;
      directly into Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and their parents will have received standardized education on insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy and CGM, with review and optimization of their basal rates, insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      factor(s), and insulin carbohydrate ratios, during the week prior to participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first week of the study, subjects will administer adjusted meal insulin boluses (i.e.&#xD;
      either the Trend Arrow Adjustment Tool, or the 10/20% bolus adjustment formula, whichever&#xD;
      they were randomized to receive in Phase 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week 2, subjects will administer standard meal insulin boluses (i.e. using Bolus Wizard&#xD;
      recommendations only; ignoring any CGM trend arrows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week 3, subjects will crossover to the alternate arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with CGM sensors for use during the study. Each participant&#xD;
      will be asked to wear an iPro2 (blinded CGM) during the first 6 days of each week long&#xD;
      assessment, to increase CGM data capture. A research co-ordinator will visit the participants&#xD;
      at home to insert the iPro2 sensors, at the start of weeks 2 and 3. At the beginning of week&#xD;
      3, the participants and their parents/guardians will be trained in the crossover method of&#xD;
      bolus adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a log book and asked to record each time a trend arrow is observed&#xD;
      (at meal times) and whether they adjusted the subsequent meal bolus, as recommended. If the&#xD;
      adjustment was not used, they will be asked to explain why they didn't use the recommended&#xD;
      bolus adjustment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to upload to CareLink Personal weekly, throughout the study. Study&#xD;
      staff will use CareLink Professional to assess glycemic variability and adherence to diabetes&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each week long assessment period, subjects will be given a questionnaire to&#xD;
      examine their use and satisfaction with the assigned meal bolus method.&#xD;
