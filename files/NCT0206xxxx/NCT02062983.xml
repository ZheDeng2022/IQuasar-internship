    <textblock>
      Early identification of patients at risk for cardiotoxicity represent a primary goal for&#xD;
      cardiologist and oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all adjuvant trials echocardiography is ideal for evaluating Left Ventricular function&#xD;
      though its operator dependent. The use of other technique such as endomyocardial biopsy, is&#xD;
      troublesome in clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have greater reproducibility in evaluating left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This technique provides morphological, functional,&#xD;
      perfusion, and viability information in one assessment. It is expensive and time consuming&#xD;
      but id the diagnostic method of choice for patients with technically limited images from ECG&#xD;
      and in patients with discordant information that is clinically significant from prior tests&#xD;

      Current standard of care for patients while on adjuvant trastuzumab is baseline ECHO are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on one of the above medications should undergo regular monitoring of the heart&#xD;
      function during treatment as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline evaluation of LVEF prior inhibitor of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serial assessment of LVEF using the same modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no clear international guidelines on the frequency and method of LVEF assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac function is usually measured by using (ECHO) echo cardiography and multiple-gated&#xD;
      acquisition (MUGA) The patient should be assessed with the same techniques during treatment&#xD;
      to avoid stressing the myocardium by the use of exercise or ionotropic agent, before&#xD;
      measuring LVEF to prevent earlier evidence of cardiotoxicity. Changes in the early atrial&#xD;
      (E/A) filling ratio reflect ventricular compliance and may predict diastolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      so decline in LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diastolic dysfunction seems to be predictive of cardiac morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials with adjuvant trastuzumab use the rules for stopping cardiotoxic agents. They&#xD;
      identified subset of high risk patients by one or two of the following three criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A decline with 10% or more in absolute LVEF from a normal base line to 50% or less&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a high cumulative dose of Doxorubicin ( &gt; 450 mg/m2 ) and / or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. abnormal baseline LVEF &lt; 50% Patients who stopped taking doxorubicin after an LVEF&#xD;
           decline were less likely to develop congestive heart failure (CHF) than those who did&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography is used regularly to monitor LVEF and is more widely available. The MUGA, in&#xD;
      addition it does not expose patients to ionizing radiation but it is operator-dependent but&#xD;
      training and use of automation may overcome the variation .&#xD;
