      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of oncolytic measles virus&#xD;
      encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) infected mesenchymal stem cells and to&#xD;
      see how well it works in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube&#xD;
      cancer that has come back. Mesenchymal stem cells may be able to carry tumor-killing&#xD;
      substances directly to ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an&#xD;
      Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter&#xD;
      (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by&#xD;
      adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). (Phase I) II. To assess the 12 month&#xD;
      overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the 4 month&#xD;
      progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) III. To assess&#xD;
      the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with&#xD;
      this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and&#xD;
      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS&#xD;
      versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles&#xD;
      virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration. (Phase II) III. To&#xD;
      assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess&#xD;
      in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter&#xD;
      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (MSC) (if MSC are not available, MV-NIS may be given alone) IP over 30 minutes of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
