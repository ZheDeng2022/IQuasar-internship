  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with ageing is thought in part to be related to reduced serum&#xD;
      sex hormones which is well-recognized, especially in females, but poorly understood.&#xD;
      International studies assessing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent/reduce MCI are&#xD;
      ongoing. MCI leads to morbidity, reduced quality of life and substantial healthcare costs.&#xD;
      The commonest therapeutically induced reduction in sex hormone level in men is treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is androgen dependent and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      suppressing testosterone to castrate levels is key therapy for advanced disease. About one&#xD;
      million men worldwide have received ADT for PCa, mostly using luteinising hormone releasing&#xD;
      hormone agonists (LHRHa) although oral oestrogens were used in the pastÍ¾ eventually perhaps&#xD;
      4% of Caucasians may be castrated. MCI as a side effect of castration in men remains poorly&#xD;
      researched. This study aims to demonstrate that pathological changes occur in the brains of a&#xD;
      significant proportion of prostate cancer patients subjected to ADT that correlate with MCI&#xD;
      symptoms. Highlighting the pathological changes of MCI should improve understanding and&#xD;
      interventions for slowing/preventing MCI in PCa survivors. Brain scans employing positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) imaging technique will be used to detect the presence of&#xD;
      pathological changes in the brain that relate to ADT induced MCI. MCI will be assessed by&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments (standard paper-based questionnaires and online) and its&#xD;
      neural basis will be investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In males, MCI with aging is thought in part to be related to reduction in serum androgen&#xD;
      level and international studies are on-going to prevent age-related cognitive decline using&#xD;
      androgen replacement therapy. Reduction in cognitive function often leads to morbidity and&#xD;
      reduction in quality of life. The commonest therapeutically induced reduction in sex hormone&#xD;
      level in men is in the treatment of prostate cancer. As prostate cancer is androgen dependent&#xD;
      for growth, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) to suppress serum testosterone level to&#xD;
      castration levels (&lt; 1.7mM) is the key therapeutic intervention for advanced disease. Up to 1&#xD;
      million men worldwide are estimated to have been prescribed ADT for prostate cancer, mostly&#xD;
      using luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa). ADT is now also used to treat&#xD;
      some early prostate cancer and as early asymptomatic prostate cancer is increasingly being&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated following screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      measurement, estimates suggest that eventually up to 4% of all Caucasians will be castrated,&#xD;
      some of them remaining on ADT for as long as 10 years or more. ADT is associated with&#xD;
      considerable adverse effects, including MCI. Up to 69% of men showed MCI after six to nine&#xD;
      months of ADT, with a decline in at least one cognitive area, most commonly visuospatial&#xD;
      ability and executive function. Little work has been done to quantify MCI due to ADT,&#xD;
      understand the mechanism, predict which patients will be affected and determine ways of&#xD;
      reducing this side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing the presence of pathophysiology in ADT induced MCI first is important due to the&#xD;
      lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism. A plausible scientific approach in this&#xD;
      regard appears to be the use of the brain's immunological response to pathology using a PET&#xD;
      imaging ligand for activated microglia. Brain microglia have been demonstrated to be highly&#xD;
      responsive to brain injury and are rapidly activated in an attempt to envelope/ contain the&#xD;
      focal pathology. When activated, brain microglia have been shown to express the translocator&#xD;
      protein (TSPO). The 18 kilo-Dalton (KDa) translocator protein (TSPO) formerly known as the&#xD;
      peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is widely expressed in the body but is particularly&#xD;
      enriched up to 20 to 50 fold in steroid synthesising tissues. High TSPO expression has also&#xD;
      been reported in immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes and TSPO is a&#xD;
      well-characterised marker of neuroinflammation. PET imaging ligands have been developed for&#xD;
      TSPO and used successfully for researching a range of brain disorders. While such imaging&#xD;
      does not provide mechanistic information of the underlying pathology, except for the&#xD;
      exasperation of frank neuro-inflammation, it does offer a generic sensitive bio-marker for&#xD;
      demonstrating the presence of an on-going active pathology&#xD;
