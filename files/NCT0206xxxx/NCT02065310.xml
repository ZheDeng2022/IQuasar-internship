  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the CEdG assay can produce internally consistent&#xD;
      results and initiate its validation as a biomarker for diabetes in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective is to replicate and validate the CEdG assay to be used in human subjects. A&#xD;
      fully automated assay for urinary CEdG has been developed. the investigators will validate&#xD;
      the observations made in diabetic animal models in human subjects with and without type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specifically, the investigators will investigate and establish the&#xD;
      inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variability in human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective is to determine the correlation between CEdG levels and hemoglobulin A1c&#xD;
      (HbA1c) in human subjects with T2DM and the response to diabetic treatment and to define the&#xD;
      relationship of CEdG with diabetic complications. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      relationship of CEdG with glycemic control, based on HbA1c, which is the current gold&#xD;
      standard, in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The investigators also compare&#xD;
      the changes in CEdG and Hb1Ac levels in response to diabetic treatment in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      The relationship of CEdG with diabetic complications will also be investigated in diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations for the primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Because there are many more variables in human subjects, the investigators&#xD;
      calculated the sample size based on a much more conservative assumption than what the&#xD;
      investigators observed from diabetic animal models. The investigators are planning a study of&#xD;
      a continuous response variable from independent control and experimental subjects with 1&#xD;
      control per experimental subject. Based on the animal data, the investigators expect the&#xD;
      results within each subject group to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of&#xD;
      0.3. If the true difference in the mean between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups is 0.5,&#xD;
      the investigators will need to study 9 diabetic and 9 non-diabetic subjects to be able to&#xD;
      reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups&#xD;
      are equal with probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this&#xD;
      test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. To account for a possible attrition rate of 30%, the&#xD;
      investigators will accrue 12 diabetic and 12 non-diabetic subjects to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The effect of diabetic status on urinary CEdG levels will be compared&#xD;
      using a Student's t-test. Differences in continuous variables between the groups of subjects&#xD;
      will be tested with either one-way ANOVA or Student's t-test when appropriate. Differences in&#xD;
      proportions will be evaluated by a chi-square test. The continuous variables, that fail the&#xD;
      Normality test, will be logarithmically transformed before analysis. To examine the influence&#xD;
      of confounding variables, a stepwise regression analysis will be used. A p value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the NIH guidelines for validation of analytical methods for biomarkers used in&#xD;
      drug development, for small molecules, bioanalytical assays where the analytical run is&#xD;
      accepted as valid when at least 67% (4/6) of the quality controls fall within 15% of their&#xD;
      nominal value. The consistency of 6 repeated runs will be evaluated by Grubbs test for&#xD;
      repeatability within each subject. The overall consistency of CEdG measures can be quantified&#xD;
      by the proportion of subjects with 1+ identified outliers among the 6 repeated runs. To&#xD;
      obtain a baseline estimate of the consistency of the CEdG assay, the investigators will take&#xD;
      the number of those six measurements that fall within 15% of the mean as our outcome measure.&#xD;
      Definitive validation of a biomarker will require definitive quantitative or relative&#xD;
      quantitative assay approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations for the secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will regress study participants' values of y-var (HbA1c) against x-var&#xD;
      (CEdG). Prior data indicate that the standard deviation of x-var is 0.15 and the standard&#xD;
      deviation of the regression errors will be 0.15. If the true slope of the line obtained by&#xD;
      regressing y-var against x-var is 0.3, the investigators will need to study 89 subjects to be&#xD;
      able to reject the null hypothesis that this slope equals zero with probability (power) 0.8.&#xD;
      The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.&#xD;
      Therefore, 100 subjects will be recruited for the study to account for potential attrition of&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic and clinic characteristics will be tabulated using statistics of mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, range, number and percentage when appropriate. CEdG data will be&#xD;
      analyzed as a continuous or transformed variable for the measured expression level. The&#xD;
      univariate correlation between the CEdG expression and each quantitative clinical measure&#xD;
      will be evaluated using Pearson correlation and its 95% confidence interval. The time trend&#xD;
      in longitudinal data and its possible interaction with other risk factors will be explored&#xD;
      using boxplots, fitted curves, generalized linear models, and generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations as appropriate. Estimated correlations between CEdG data and clinical endpoints,&#xD;
      and its possible time trends during the 12 month period will provide valuable information for&#xD;
      choosing the primary endpoint and sample size in a future larger scale correlation study.&#xD;

    <description>Glucose and its adducts, such as HbA1c, decompose non-enzymatically to yield α-oxo-aldehydes are up to 20,000 x more reactive than the parent molecule. Amounts of an α-oxo-aldehyde, methylglyoxal (MG), are elevated up to 6-fold in patients with Type 1 dm. Quantitation of MG, but MG does form stable, irreversible adducts termed &quot;advanced glycation endproducts&quot; (AGEs) that can be measured. MG also reacts with DNA to yield primarily one stable DNA-AGE, CEdG, and suggests that measuring CEdG might allow for a direct method for assessing glycemic status and α-oxo-aldehyde burden.&#xD;
Investigators have shown that CEdG levels are significantly elevated in urine and tissue of Type 1 &amp; 2 dm animal models. DNA-AGE may correlate with the development of diabetes complications and identify patients at higher risk. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that CEdG, a DNA-AGE, can be used as a marker of diabetes control and complications.</description>
