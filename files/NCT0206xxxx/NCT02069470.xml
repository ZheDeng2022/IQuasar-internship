  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Denmark has a lower survival of cancer compared to most European countries. Fast&#xD;
      track pathways for organ specific cancers were established in the years 2008-2010. In 2011&#xD;
      further a fast track pathway for non-specific serious symptoms. Cancer in general practice is&#xD;
      a low prevalence condition. Each general practitioner (GP) will see 8-10 new cancer patients&#xD;
      per year. The investigators know that cancer patients have an increased use of general&#xD;
      practice prior to diagnosis and that 25% of them wait for more than 20 days in general&#xD;
      practice for referral according to the GPs. The latest Danish Cancer Plan therefore includes&#xD;
      a CME as a key strategy to lower the GP threshold to refer patients to cancer fast track&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this CME in early cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
      This is measured by changes in GP knowledge, attitude and risk assessment. GP referral&#xD;
      behavior assessed by primary care interval and use of fast track referrals. GP´s cancer hit&#xD;
      rate, cancer patients´ tumor stage at treatment and 1 year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design The study is conducted as a stepped wedge controlled design based on a&#xD;
      quasi-cluster randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In august 2012 an invitation to participate in the present study were sent to 859 general&#xD;
      Practitioners (GPs) from the Central Denmark Region. GPs completed a form for each patient&#xD;
      they referred to a fast-track diagnostic pathway for cancer within an 8-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every other week, we received data from a regional database. We reminded the referring&#xD;
      GP-practice about non included patients. The collected data will be linked to registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CME-intervention The CME-course was a 3-hour meeting after work. Guided by the available&#xD;
      evidence from the literature following the investigators ensured a multifaceted interactive&#xD;
      teaching method including case-based education. The content included by other topics positive&#xD;
      predictive values, false reassurance from negative testing and other pit-false.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The outcomes will be analyzed in a generalized linear random-effects&#xD;
      model with random effect of GPs. Based on data it will be assessed whether further modeling&#xD;
      of inter correlation within practices and within clusters is required, and whether the&#xD;
      intervention effects are assumed equal for all GPs, or in random interaction with them.&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed both in the full GP-population (&quot;intention to intervening &quot;) and&#xD;
      in the 3 subgroups of GPs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Denmark has a lower survival of cancer compared to most European countries. This could be&#xD;
      explained by an inadequate organization of cancer investigation. In order to improve this, 34&#xD;
      fast track pathways for organ specific cancer diseases were established in the years&#xD;
      2008-2010. In 2011 further a fast track pathway for non-specific serious symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reason could be delay in general practice. Cancer in general practice is a low&#xD;
      prevalence condition. Each general practitioner (GP) will see 8-10 new cancer patients per&#xD;
      year. 50 % of cancer patients presented non-specific symptoms and even when they had organ&#xD;
      specific alarm symptoms the positive predictive value for cancer was most often lower than&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know that cancer patients have an increased use of general practice prior&#xD;
      to diagnosis and that 25% of them wait for more than 20 days in general practice for&#xD;
      referral. A study showed that 20 % of Danish GPs assumed a hypothetical cancer risk higher&#xD;
      than 50% when they refer a 50 year old man to a cancer fast-track pathway. The latest Danish&#xD;
      Cancer Plan included a CME as a key strategy to lower the GP threshold to refer patients to&#xD;
      cancer fast track pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of this CME in early cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
      This is measured by changes in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GP knowledge, attitude and risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GP referral behavior assessed by primary care interval and use of fast track referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GP´s cancer hit rate, cancer patients´ tumor stage at treatment and 1 year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design The study was conducted as a stepped wedge controlled design based on a&#xD;
      quasi-cluster randomization. GPs from a cluster which had received CME were controlled by GPs&#xD;
      from another cluster which had not yet received CME. GPs from each cluster were divided in an&#xD;
      intervention group and a reference group depending on whether they participated in the CME or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In august 2012 an invitation to participate in the present study were sent to 859 general&#xD;
      Practitioners (GPs) from the Central Denmark Region. GPs were asked to complete a form for&#xD;
      each patient they referred to a fast-track diagnostic pathway for cancer within an 8-month&#xD;
      period (September 2012 - May 2013). Data included presented symptoms, a GP-estimated cancer&#xD;
      risk (predictive value) at referral time, date for referral and date for first presentation&#xD;
      of a cancer related symptom to a general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the completeness of data, every other week, the investigators received data from&#xD;
      a regional database on patients referred to a cancer diagnostic pathway. The referring&#xD;
      GP-practice were reminded about non-included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to link the collected data following registries were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Civil Registration Number (CRN), a unique 10-digit personal identification number&#xD;
           assigned to every permanent and temporary Danish Residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hospital Discharge Registry that comprises The Patient Administrative System (PAS)&#xD;
           which holds administrative information on hospital activities. Data includes dates of&#xD;
           hospital admissions and type of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) which holds information on all cancer diagnoses in&#xD;
           Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MedCom data from a web interface (referral hotel) that includes all electronic referral&#xD;
           letters sent from general practice to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Danish National Health Insurance Service Registry (NHSR) which holds information on all&#xD;
           contacts to general practice and all services provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CME-intervention The CME-course was a 3-hour meeting. Guided by the available evidence&#xD;
      from the literature following issues were considered important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multifaceted interactive teaching method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge transfer based on patient cases to create a close relation to every day&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An emotional experience to facilitate change in attitude. An educational film was&#xD;
           created for the occasion. The film illustrated a series of consultations between a GP&#xD;
           and a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following topics were chosen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faster investigation increases survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictive positive values for cancer symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  False reassurance from a negative test and other pit falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delay in making an appropriate cancer referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulties in using fast track pathways for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulties in communicating cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The outcomes will be analyzed in a generalized linear random-effects&#xD;
      model with random effect of GPs. Based on data it will be assessed whether further modeling&#xD;
      of inter correlation within practices and within clusters is required, and whether the&#xD;
      intervention effects are assumed equal for all GPs, or in random interaction with them.&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed both in the full GP-population (&quot;intention to intervening &quot;) and&#xD;
      in the 3 subgroups of GPs; GP participated in CME, Colleague participated, even GP neither&#xD;
      colleagues participated in CME.&#xD;
