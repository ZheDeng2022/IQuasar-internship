  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand how ipilimumab is being used, its safety profile, and&#xD;
      the manner in which Adverse Reactions are managed in routine clinical practice. Another goal&#xD;
      is to identify predictive biomarkers. The study is an observational study and not intended to&#xD;
      test any hypothesis, but can be hypothesis generating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Norway ipilimumab (Yervoy®) has been available for treating patients with advanced,&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, but was not approved for reimbursement until&#xD;
      recently. The Department of Health and Social Services decided that in Norway a national&#xD;
      Phase IV interventional study examining survival and Quality of Life should be performed. In&#xD;
      addition a research project should be launched aiming at isolating biological markers to&#xD;
      identify patients who would benefit the most from ipilimumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ipilimumab is a new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action, it is&#xD;
      important to understand the scope of its impact once being widely available as a treatment&#xD;
      option, i.e. real-world experience. Treatment guidelines and clinical research provide&#xD;
      information on how unresectable or metastatic melanoma is to be treated with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      how Adverse Events should be managed, but may not reflect what actually occurs in clinical&#xD;
      practice compared to controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will provide a more extensive understanding of the safety profile of&#xD;
      ipilimumab in oncology practices in Norway in patients who may differ substantially from&#xD;
      those included in the clinical trial program. In addition, the study results will provide&#xD;
      information on how treatment patterns, patient-reported outcomes, clinical outcomes such as&#xD;
      survival and disease progression may be influenced by ipilimumab. The proposed study&#xD;
      objectives are: assessment of the safety of ipilimumab and analysis of health outcomes, in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, to ensure appropriate patient and provider utilization of&#xD;
      ipilimumab.&#xD;
