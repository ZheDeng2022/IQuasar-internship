      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the result of combined sono-guided&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) and axillary nerve block (ANB) with isolated SSNB in&#xD;
      postoperative pain following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Our hypothesis was that SSNB&#xD;
      combined ANB would show a more effective anesthesia for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair as&#xD;
      compared with SSNB only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty-two patients with rotator cuff tear who had undergone arthroscopic rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair were enrolled in this study. Among them, 21 patients were randomly allocated into&#xD;
      group I, and received SSNB and ANB with each 10mL ropivacaine. The other 21 patients were&#xD;
      allocated into group II, and received SSNB with 10mL ropivacaine and ANB with 10mL normal&#xD;
      saline. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score, patient's satisfaction (SAT), and Lateral&#xD;
      Pain Index (LPI), etc was checked at postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours.&#xD;

      All procedures described in the present study were approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      of our hospital, and all patients gave written informed consent to participate in the present&#xD;
      study. Between November 2012 and July 2013, forty-two patients with rotator cuff tear who had&#xD;
      undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs were enrolled in this study. Rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      were diagnosed by use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the size of a&#xD;
      rotator cuff was confirmed at the time of arthroscopic operation. Indication for surgery was&#xD;
      symptomatic full thickness rotator cuff tear or partial thickness rotator cuff more than 50%&#xD;
      thickness in case of failed conservative therapy. Among them, 21 patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into group I, and received suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) and axillary nerve&#xD;
      block (ANB) with each 10mL ropivacaine. The other 21 patients were allocated into group II,&#xD;
      and received SSNB with 10mL ropivacaine and ANB with 10mL normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cases in this study, the inclusion criteria were (1) an definite rotator cuff tear on&#xD;
      preoperative MRI which needed repair, (2) accept an arthroscopic surgery including rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair, (3) more than 20 years old,(4) accept preemptive regional block and patient&#xD;
      controlled analgesia (PCA). Some patients were excluded for the following reasons (1)did not&#xD;
      underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (2) stopped PCA before postoperative 48 hours due&#xD;
      to associated side effect (3) history of previous shoulder operation or fracture, (4) a&#xD;
      concomitant neurologic disorder around the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder&#xD;
      score, Constant score, height, and weight, etc were checked preoperatively. All the regional&#xD;
      blocks were preemptively performed under sono-guidance. PCA was set at the fixed dose (0.05&#xD;
      ug/kg of loading dose and 0.03ug/min.kg of continuous dose, fentanyl) to remove the effect of&#xD;
      variable amount of PCA. VAS pain score, patient's satisfaction (SAT), the percentage of&#xD;
      lateral pain of affected shoulder, and Lateral Pain Index (LPI: VAS × the percentage of&#xD;
      lateral pain of shoulder ÷ 100) was checked postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48&#xD;
      hours. VAS pain score was selected from 0 to 10. 0 was no pain and 10 was severe pain that&#xD;
      the patient had ever experienced.1 SAT was also selected from 0 to 10. 0 was unsatisfactory&#xD;
      and 10 was very satisfactory. The percentage of lateral pain was determined as a value&#xD;
      between 0 and 100. LPI was determined as VAS pain score × the percentage of lateral pain of&#xD;
      shoulder ÷ 100. Rebound of postoperative pain was confirmed if there had been an increase of&#xD;
      VAS pain score after postoperative 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis indicated that a total sample size of 34 patients (17 patients in each cohort)&#xD;
      would provide a statistical power of 99% with a 2-sided α level of .05 to detect significant&#xD;
      differences in VAS at postoperative 6 hours, assuming an effect size of 1.56 (mean&#xD;
      difference: 2.5, standard deviation: 1.6). This was based on the mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      of VAS at postoperative 6 hours observed in a pilot study of 20 patients. Double blinded&#xD;
      randomization was performed as follows. The 48 patients who had met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups depending on the combined ANB. Randomization was&#xD;
      performed with a computer random sequence generator by an independent nurse, who prepared a&#xD;
      syringe for combined ANB according to the assignment. The patient and all the medical staff&#xD;
      who participated in the operation were blinded of the assignment. After this study, according&#xD;
      to the exclusion criteria, two patient with no rotator cuff tear and three patient with only&#xD;
      rotator cuff fraying who underwent only arthroscopic debridement were excluded from this&#xD;
      study. One patient who stopped PCA at postoperative 1 hour was done, too. In the end, the 42&#xD;
      patients were included in this study. Among them, 21 patients belonged to group I, and the&#xD;
      other 21 patients belonged to group II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the regional blocks were preemptively performed. When the patient was positioned in beach&#xD;
      chair position, SSNB and ANB were performed by one anesthesiologist under sono-guidance. 23&#xD;
      gauge spinal needle was used. Just after skin preparation using povidone Iodine solution, a&#xD;
      thin layer of sterile ultrasound transmission gel was placed between the ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer and the skin. SSNB was done at first and the entry site was the mid point between&#xD;
      an anterolateral angle of acromion and medial end of scapular spine. With the linear probe&#xD;
      parallel to the scapular spine, the suprascapular notch was identified and the block was&#xD;
      performed penetrating the transverse scapular ligament because the scapular nerve and artery&#xD;
      were located at the suprascapular notch. Just after the SSNB, ANB was performed and the entry&#xD;
      site was the point 1.5 cm medial and 2cm inferior to posterolateral angle of acromion. With&#xD;
      the linear probe parallel to the longitudinal axis of the humerus, posterior circumflex&#xD;
      artery was identified and the block was done at just above the artery. The color Doppler&#xD;
      sonography may be helpful for identifying the arterial structures, but they were sometimes&#xD;
      undetectable, and therefore they could be identified by detecting a pulsatile motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients in this study underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and subacromial&#xD;
      decompression. All procedures were performed by one surgeon who had specialized in shoulder&#xD;
      and elbow surgery, and sports medicine. Four routine arthroscopic portals (anterior,&#xD;
      posterior, lateral, and posterolateral) were used in arthroscopic surgery. After bursectomy,&#xD;
      arthroscopic subacromial decompression was performed with acromioplasty and spur removal in&#xD;
      all patients. Suture bridge technique was mainly used for rotator cuff repair with 5.0mm&#xD;
      Bio-Corkscrew suture anchor (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) and 4.75mm Bio-SwiveLock&#xD;
      (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA). Tendon to tendon suture was sometimes used for small to&#xD;
      medium tear located around musculotendinous junction. According to the concomitant diseases,&#xD;
      long lead of biceps (LHB) tenotomy or tenodesis, distal clavicle resection, and anterior&#xD;
      capsulotomy were performed simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, a shoulder-immobilizing sling with an abduction pillow was prescribed to&#xD;
      each patient. The postoperative rehabilitation was individualized according to the size of&#xD;
      rotator cuff tear and the tissue quality of torn rotator cuff. The patients without a rotator&#xD;
      cuff tear were allowed passive forward elevation using a pulley at postoperative 48 hours&#xD;
      just after PCA had been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normally distributed data between the groups was analyzed using a t test for independent&#xD;
      samples. Otherwise, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Probable factors which might affect&#xD;
      rebound of pain were analyzed using univariate logistic regression. Statistical analysis was&#xD;
      performed using the SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.). The significance level&#xD;
      was set at P&lt;.05.&#xD;
