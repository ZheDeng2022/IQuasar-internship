      Background: Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles&#xD;
      resulting in energy expenditure (Caspersen, 1985). According to classical work physiology,&#xD;
      energy expenditure was considered as basis for assessing the severity of manual work&#xD;
      (Grandjean 1991). Steele et. al. found blue collar workers to report significantly more&#xD;
      walking activity, daily step counts and MET min/week than professionals and white collar&#xD;
      workers. However, the energy cost of physical activity may not necessarily be equivalent to&#xD;
      body movement. Therefore, modern concepts include also other aspects reflecting the amount of&#xD;
      workload. Soer et. al. applied an evaluation system consisting 12 work-related tests to&#xD;
      establish functional capacity in healthy employees. The assessment included various lifting&#xD;
      and energetic tasks as well as coordination exercises. In occupational rehabilitation a&#xD;
      balance between workload and work capacity is necessary for professional reintegration. Thus,&#xD;
      it is of great value to evaluate a wide range of work requirements across occupational groups&#xD;
      in terms of energy expenditure, physical activity and aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the amount of physical activity and energy&#xD;
      expenditure during a normal working day with focus on differences between occupational&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: To analyze the situation in Switzerland, 300 healthy and full-time employed adults&#xD;
      between 18-65 years will be investigated in the Basel region. Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      by occupational category according to the ISCO-88 and will then be merged into 3 groups with&#xD;
      low-, moderate- and high-intensity occupational activity. By wearing the SenseWear Mini&#xD;
      Armband on 7 consecutive days, average daily energy expenditure, activity duration at&#xD;
      different intensities and step counts will be assessed during work-time. In addition,&#xD;
      individual's aerobic capacity will be determined by the 20-meter shuttle run test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outlook: This study is expected to provide detailed information about physical work&#xD;
      requirements with regard to professional reintegration. For developing adequate intervention&#xD;
      and treatment strategies, it is of great value to evaluate performance criteria across&#xD;
      occupational groups.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding occupational rehabilitation, a balance between workload and individual's work&#xD;
           capacity is required for returning to work successfully after an injury or illness.&#xD;
           Therefore, it is of great value to evaluate a wide range of physical work requirements&#xD;
           and to assess employee's work capacity across occupational groups. Although several&#xD;
           approaches have been made in this regard, there are few objective data available so far&#xD;
           and no established reference values exist to evaluate, whether, when and how a return to&#xD;
           work is possible. One reason could be that objectifying workload and work capacity is&#xD;
           methodically challenging because of their multidimensional nature [1, 2].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles&#xD;
           resulting in energy expenditure [3]. In classical work physiology, energy expenditure&#xD;
           was therefore considered as basis for assessing the amount of workload [4, 5]. However,&#xD;
           the energy cost of physical activity may not necessarily be equivalent to body movement&#xD;
           [6]. For that reason, modern concepts include also other aspects reflecting the severity&#xD;
           of manual work. The 'Dictionary of Occupational Titles' (DOT), developed by the U.S.&#xD;
           government, classifies professions into five categories (sedentary, light, medium,&#xD;
           heavy, very heavy) based on the amount of energy expended as well as on the intensity&#xD;
           and duration of lifting or carrying during work [7]. Though, the DOT classification has&#xD;
           not been based on quantitative work-related analyses, but rather on consensus meetings&#xD;
           of experts. Furthermore, its validity has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Work capacity can be assessed using functional capacity evaluations (FCEs), which&#xD;
           measure the ability of subjects to perform specific activities [8]. Worldwide, there are&#xD;
           various FCE protocols available being job specific [9], pathology specific [10, 11] or&#xD;
           of a more general type. Soer et al. applied an evaluation system consisting of 12&#xD;
           work-related tests to establish functional capacity in healthy employees [12]. The&#xD;
           assessment included various lifting and energetic exercises as well as coordination&#xD;
           tasks. From the test results, normative FCE values were acquired for each DOT-category,&#xD;
           which can be compared to patient data in order to make work recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, since validity of the DOT has not been proved, further analysis concerning&#xD;
           workload assessment is required. Moreover, the application of such complex FCE tools is&#xD;
           related to high expenses and efforts and may therefore not be appropriate in a general&#xD;
           clinical or field context. Especially in large populations, implementing highly accurate&#xD;
           instruments is difficult due to high costs and poor practicability [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
           For these reasons, the present study will focus on workload by investigating a wide&#xD;
           range of physical work requirements across occupational groups and putting them in&#xD;
           relation to employees' aerobic capacity. Since physical activity is characterized by&#xD;
           various dimensions, such as duration and intensity [3], these factors will be considered&#xD;
           for a comprehensive analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary aim of this study is to investigate healthy employees in Switzerland&#xD;
           regarding energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents (METs), physical activity duration&#xD;
           at different intensities and the number of steps taken during a normal working day with&#xD;
           focus on differences between occupational groups. Furthermore, the association between&#xD;
           physical activity and aerobic capacity will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.1 Individuals practising heavy work are more physically active and consume more&#xD;
           energy than those with light work.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.2 Aerobic capacity (VO2max) correlates positively with work and non-work related&#xD;
           physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Potential significance&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is expected to provide detailed information about physical work requirements&#xD;
           and performance criteria of different occupational groups. This may be valuable&#xD;
           regarding treatment and professional reintegration after an injury or illness, since up&#xD;
           to now no established reference values exist. Objective workload data might improve&#xD;
           intervention strategies and clinicians' recommendations for a successful return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.1 Primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our primary objective is to analyze work related physical activity parameters measured&#xD;
           by the SenseWear Mini armband and aerobic capacity determined by the 20-meter shuttle&#xD;
           run test across occupational groups. Furthermore, perceived work intensity, activity&#xD;
           behaviour in recreation, quality of life, body composition and several personal- and&#xD;
           job-related factors will be investigated as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2 Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this cross-sectional study, we plan to recruit healthy and full-time employed adults&#xD;
           from different occupational fields in the Basel region, Switzerland. It is intended to&#xD;
           start with a pilot study in January 2013, in which a total of 15 persons will be&#xD;
           examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment will initiate in May 2013 and will end as soon as 300 individuals are&#xD;
           included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential subjects will be contacted and asked for study participation by phone or by&#xD;
           mail. Willing individuals meeting the inclusion criteria will fill out the informed&#xD;
           consent form before starting the measurement procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the first study visit, body measurements will be carried out such as height, weight&#xD;
           and waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) will be calculated. In addition,&#xD;
           a variety of personal- and job-related factors will be recorded. Furthermore, subjects&#xD;
           will perform a 20-meter shuttle run in order to measure aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the subsequent week, participants will be instructed to document their daily work&#xD;
           activities and to rate their work related physical exertion twice per day using the Borg&#xD;
           Scale. Moreover, by wearing the SenseWear Mini armband on seven consecutive days,&#xD;
           physical activity and energy expenditure will be objectified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One week later at the second study visit, all subjects will complete several&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaires concerning work and non-work related physical activity&#xD;
           behaviour (IPAQ), health-related quality of life (SF-36) and self-assessment of&#xD;
           professional activity and its intensity (VAS). In addition, open questions will be asked&#xD;
           to each participant about past-week physical exertion in comparison to a normal week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time required for the two study visits taking place at the individual's workstation,&#xD;
           will be around 90 minutes per person. In addition, every participant will wear the&#xD;
           activity monitor on seven consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Termination criteria for the measurements are skin irritations caused by the SenseWear&#xD;
           Mini armband and exertional dyspnea during 20-meter shuttle run.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Selection of study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1 Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this study, it is intended to recruit 300 subjects from different occupational groups&#xD;
           with low-, moderate- and high-intensity occupational activity, which are defined in a&#xD;
           later section (see chapter 2.3.2). Based on this classification, companies will be&#xD;
           selected. In each occupational group, 100 participants will be enrolled. Furthermore,&#xD;
           homogeneity of age and gender within each group will be aimed at recruiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, we will contact the management of potential enterprises in order to present our&#xD;
           project. If they are interested in a collaboration, we will ask for contact details of&#xD;
           potentially recruitable employees, who will then be addressed by a member of our&#xD;
           research team. Individuals will be informed and asked for study participation by phone&#xD;
           or by email. Furthermore, it is planned to distribute study flyers in the companies, so&#xD;
           that interested employees have the opportunity to contact us directly. In both&#xD;
           situations, the recruitment and information process will be done externally.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Healthy and full-time employed individuals between the age of 18 and 65, who have a&#xD;
           sufficient knowledge of the German language in order to fill in the self-administered&#xD;
           questionnaires by themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects not giving consent for participation as well as those with movement&#xD;
           restrictions, various diseases and accidents within the last three months that affect&#xD;
           productivity at the workplace, cannot take part in this study. Furthermore, night shift&#xD;
           workers will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.1 Personal- and job-related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each subject, gender (male / female) and employment (temporary / permanent) will be&#xD;
           assessed as binary variables. Nationality (Swiss / EU / other), marital status (single /&#xD;
           married / divorced) and smoking status (yes / no / never) will be recorded with three&#xD;
           categories, while alcohol consumption (never / once to several times per month / once to&#xD;
           several times per week / once per day), German skills (very good / good / medium / bad /&#xD;
           very bad), highest education (compulsory school / apprenticeship / higher vocational&#xD;
           school / diploma or maturity / university) and working time model (flextime / fix time /&#xD;
           shift work / weekend work) will be evaluated with four, five and six categories,&#xD;
           respectively. Age, native language, profession, avocation, medication, illnesses,&#xD;
           accidents and working hours will be asked as open questions. Furthermore, to get an&#xD;
           overview of the individual work activity, participants will be asked to keep a daily&#xD;
           list of the main completed tasks including time information in accordance with the&#xD;
           questionnaire regarding professional integration and pension [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2 Classification of occupations&#xD;
&#xD;
           The reported professions will be classified into 9 categories based on the International&#xD;
           Standard Classification of Occupations ISCO-88 [15] (1. Managers, 2. Scientists, 3.&#xD;
           Technicians, 4. Office workers, 5. Service workers, 6. Agricultural workers, 7.&#xD;
           Craftsmen, 8. Machine operators, 9. Labourers). These 9 categories will then be&#xD;
           collapsed into 3 groups with low-, moderate-and high-intensity occupational activity&#xD;
           according to Suva experts in the field of ergonomics (1st group: Categories 1&#xD;
           (Managers), 2 (Scientists) and 4 (Office workers); 2nd group: Categories 3&#xD;
           (Technicians), 5 (Service workers) and 8 (Machine operators); 3rd group: Categories 6&#xD;
           (Agricultural workers), 7 (Craftsmen) and 9 (Labourers). Reliability of this&#xD;
           stratification has been previously shown [16, 17].&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.3 International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) represents a convenient and&#xD;
           simple instrument for measuring health enhancing physical activity at the population&#xD;
           level. The self-administered long version of the IPAQ, being freely available in&#xD;
           internet [18], will be used in the present study. It includes 26 questions and assesses&#xD;
           past-week frequency (days) and duration (time per day) of physical activity within the&#xD;
           domains of work, leisure-time, transport, domestic and garden. Moreover, each domain&#xD;
           consists of walking, moderate and vigorous activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the IPAQ guidelines for data analysis [19], continuous scores in form of&#xD;
           MET-minutes per week will be calculated for each domain. MET-minutes per week, defined&#xD;
           as energy costs of physical activity, will be computed by multiplying the intensity&#xD;
           (specific MET value) of an activity with its frequency (days) and duration (minutes).&#xD;
           The corresponding MET values are set by the IPAQ guidelines based on the compendium of&#xD;
           physical activity [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to numerous validity and reliability tests carried out in twelve different&#xD;
           countries, the IPAQ is considered as an internationally valid assessment tool with&#xD;
           acceptable measurement properties [21]. The long version of the IPAQ was translated into&#xD;
           German as part of a dissertation and was validated in an Austrian sample [22]. It could&#xD;
           be shown that it is suitable for research purposes with regard to physical activity&#xD;
           detection [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4 SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SF-36 is a general quality of life questionnaire consisting of 36 items, which are&#xD;
           formatted as binary questions or as semantic six-point differential scales. It refers to&#xD;
           the past four weeks and includes nine content areas concerning vitality, general health&#xD;
           perception, physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations&#xD;
           (emotional/physical problems), pain, mental health and health change [24]. The SF-36 is&#xD;
           considered to be the gold standard for measuring functional status and health-related&#xD;
           quality of life and is therefore the most used questionnaire in this context [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since physical and mental disorders as well as pain may influence activity behaviour,&#xD;
           the SF-36 will be used in the present study to adjust for potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.5 Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measuring instrument for subjective characteristics&#xD;
           that cannot be directly measured. Individuals express their response to a VAS item by&#xD;
           marking a position along a continuous line between two end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The indicated locus will then be quantified by a defined scale [26]. In epidemiologic&#xD;
           and clinical research, the most common VAS is a straight horizontal line of 100 mm&#xD;
           length with its ends representing extreme limits of the measured parameter (worst -&#xD;
           best) [27]. The VAS score is determined by measuring the distance in mm from the left&#xD;
           end of the line to the point marked by the participant. Validity and reliability of VAS&#xD;
           have been scientifically tested for a variety of parameters, such as acute and chronic&#xD;
           pain [28, 29].&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this study, individual's perception of past-week work and non-work related physical&#xD;
           exertion and effort will be assessed by 100mm VASs. This may be valuable to evaluate&#xD;
           whether the investigated period (exposure time) is representative and reflects a normal&#xD;
           week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.6 Borg Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Borg Scale represents a simple method to rate perceived exertion and can be compared&#xD;
           to other scales, such as VAS. It is used for various purposes, such as measuring&#xD;
           patient's exertion during a performance test or assessing the intensity of training and&#xD;
           competition in athletes [30].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The original scale developed by Borg ranging from 6 (no exertion at all) to 20 (maximal&#xD;
           exertion) was updated and transformed into a combined category-ratio scale CR10 with the&#xD;
           ratings 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (very very hard) [31, 32].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The latter will be used in the present study. Subjects will be instructed to rate their&#xD;
           work related physical exertion twice per day, at the end of the morning and in the late&#xD;
           afternoon. The indicated Borg value should reflect how heavy and strenuous work feels to&#xD;
           them considering all sensations of physical stress, effort and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4.1 Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anthropometric measurements include body height, body weight and waist circumference.&#xD;
           Body height will be assessed without shoes by a medical measuring stick to the nearest&#xD;
           mm. The measurement of body weight will be performed on subjects in light clothing&#xD;
           without shoes by a medical scale with an accuracy of 0.1 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Waist circumference will be determined midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest&#xD;
           according to the Swiss Heart Foundation using a medical measuring tape with a precision&#xD;
           of 0.1 cm. The measurement will be carried out on standing subjects after a moderate&#xD;
           expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4.2 20-meter shuttle run&#xD;
&#xD;
           The multistage 20-meter shuttle run is a common endurance fitness test to evaluate the&#xD;
           maximal aerobic power of healthy adults [33]. It is simple in use and economical and&#xD;
           large groups can be tested at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This test will be conducted on a flat, non-slip surface and participants will be&#xD;
           instructed to run back and forth between two lines, which are 20 meters apart (Figure&#xD;
           1). Running velocity is determined by intervals between two audio signals emitted by a&#xD;
           pre-recorded tape. Subjects have to touch the 20 meter lines simultaneously with the&#xD;
           sound of these signals. The initial running velocity is 8.5 km/h. Every minute (stage),&#xD;
           the intervals are shortened and speed is increased by 0.5 km/h. The test ends when the&#xD;
           subject gives up or when he can no longer keep the pace and does not reach the line in&#xD;
           time (&gt; 3 metre away from the 20 meter line) twice in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The test result corresponds to the number of reached stages. According to a validated&#xD;
           table [34], this score is used to predict maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), which can be&#xD;
           compared to age-dependent normative data for males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Validity of the 1 minute stage version of the 20-meter shuttle run to predict VO2max in&#xD;
           adults was established by Léger et al. [35], who compared the maximal shuttle run speed&#xD;
           to VO2max attained during a multistage treadmill test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be assessed prior to testing in&#xD;
           order to detect potential contraindications. Resting pulse and recovery pulse (2 minutes&#xD;
           after test) will be measured and heart rate will be continuously recorded during test.&#xD;
           Furthermore, participants will be instructed to rate their perceived physical exertion&#xD;
           before and after test using the Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4.3 SenseWear Mini armband&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SenseWear Mini armband is a small, lightweight and wireless multisensory activity&#xD;
           monitor developed by Bodymedia (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), which integrates motion&#xD;
           data from a three-axis accelerometer along with several other physiological sensors such&#xD;
           as heat flux, skin temperature and galvanic skin response. Validity was established by&#xD;
           Johannsen et al. [36] comparing energy expenditure estimates of the SenseWear Mini&#xD;
           armband against the criterion method 'Doubly-Labeled-Water' in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects will be instructed to wear the SenseWear Mini armband on the upper left arm&#xD;
           (triceps area) for 7 consecutive days, including while sleeping, with the exception of&#xD;
           one hour daily spent on personal hygiene (23 hours per day). Reliability of this&#xD;
           assessment period has been previously shown [37].&#xD;
&#xD;
           For recording non-wearing periods, such as water activities and showers, participants&#xD;
           will be asked to keep a diary. The physiological data collected by the armband's sensors&#xD;
           will be processed by specific algorithms (professional software V.7.0, algorithm&#xD;
           V.2.2.4) to calculate participants' daily energy expenditure, METs, physical activity&#xD;
           duration at different intensities and the number of steps. Gender, age, height, weight,&#xD;
           smoking status and handedness will also be considered in these calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5 Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analyses will be done using the software R (version 2.15.1) and IBM SPSS&#xD;
           Statistics (version 19.0). Statistical significance will be acquired if a p value of&#xD;
           less than 0.05 is attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be presented by descriptive statistics within occupational groups. Cross&#xD;
           tables are reported as counts and percentages. Ordinal variables are reported as median&#xD;
           and Interquartile range (IQR). Metric variables are reported as mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate primary endpoints, linear regressions will be performed. Independent&#xD;
           variable is &quot;occupational group&quot;, dependent variables are &quot;average daily active energy&#xD;
           expenditure&quot;, &quot;average daily physical activity duration&quot; and &quot;average daily number of&#xD;
           steps&quot;. Optionally, personal and job related factors can be included in the regression&#xD;
           analyses as covariates. If appropriate, data will be log-transformed. Regression results&#xD;
           will be presented as differences of means between &quot;occupational categories&quot; with&#xD;
           corresponding 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) and p-values. In case of logarithmic&#xD;
           distributed data, geometric mean ratios will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate secondary endpoints, linear regressions will be conducted. In case of&#xD;
           ordinal variables, non-parametric methods will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, the mean and individual time courses of physical activity periods will be&#xD;
           plotted for all primary and secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6 Sample-size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since &quot;average daily active energy expenditure&quot; measured by the SenseWear Mini armband&#xD;
           represents a valid and reliable parameter, it is considered to be the most important&#xD;
           primary endpoint of the present investigation. For this reason, only this variable is&#xD;
           subject to a power calculation. In a previous study, the SD of &quot;average daily active&#xD;
           energy expenditure&quot; during a normal work shift was found to be 730 kcal [38]. The&#xD;
           expected mean difference between the three occupational groups will be around 500 kcal.&#xD;
           Assuming a sample size of 100 subjects in each occupational group, there is a power of&#xD;
           &gt;90% to detect a mean difference of 500 kcal between any of these groups. This&#xD;
           calculation is based on the assumption of a within group SD of 730 kcal and on a&#xD;
           two-sided significance level of 5%.&#xD;
