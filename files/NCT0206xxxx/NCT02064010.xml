  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SNC-102 in subjects&#xD;
      with drug-induced Tardive Dyskinesia (TD). To ensure an adequate evaluation of SNC-102, a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was designed. Two dosing&#xD;
      levels of SNC-102 are employed to evaluate the proposed dosing range. A target enrollment of&#xD;
      90 subjects with drug-induced TD will provide sufficient data to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profiles of SNC-102 in the target population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females 18-75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis, at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit, of drug-induced TD&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. AIMS ≥3 (moderate or worse) for ≥1 body area, or AIMS = 2 (mild) for ≥2 body&#xD;
                  areas; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &gt;3 months exposure to antipsychotic drug or metoclopramide; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Other causes of dyskinesia have been ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AIMS score is confirmed at the Screening Visit by the Principal Investigator and the&#xD;
             Trial Reading Center, and at the Baseline Visit at least 1 week later by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If using antipsychotic medication or metoclopramide, dose has been stable for at least&#xD;

             course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If using opioid medication, dose has been stable for at least 14 days prior to the&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. If using vitamin or dietary supplements, dose and type has been stable for at least 14&#xD;
             days prior to the Baseline Visit and is expected to remain stable through the course&#xD;

&#xD;
