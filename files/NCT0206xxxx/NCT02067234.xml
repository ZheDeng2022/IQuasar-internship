      The goal of the current investigation is to determine whether the inclusion of a&#xD;
      parent/patient psychoeducational session in initial dermatology appointments with new&#xD;
      pediatric atopic dermatitis patients affects (a) extent of medical follow-up, (b) patient's&#xD;
      quality of life, and (c) parenting stress in comparison to treatment as usual for initial&#xD;
      pediatric dermatology appointments for new pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

      Youth will be selected to participate based on request for initial intake appointments&#xD;
      regarding atopic dermatitis or eczema at the Pediatric Dermatology office at 'Specially for&#xD;
      Children. Once consented into the study, youth and parents will be randomized into either the&#xD;
      routine care group (medical visit with nurse and medical provider) or the prevention group&#xD;
      (medical visit with nurse and medical provider, psychoeducation session with psychologist).&#xD;
      Randomization will occur through a pre-determined randomized list. Next, youth and parents&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires (listed above, see Appendix X) in the clinic setting prior to&#xD;
      their appointment with the medical provider. At that time, the intervention will commence.&#xD;
      All patient interaction between the patient, patient's family, and the study investigators&#xD;
      will be conducted at the Pediatric Dermatology Clinic at 'Specially for Children or Dell&#xD;
      Children's Medical Center. Demographic and clinical data will be collected and de-identified&#xD;
      from the patients' medical records. Each condition's details are listed below along with a&#xD;
      flowchart describing the investigation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine Care Group Initial Evaluation: The family will be requested to fill out all measures&#xD;
      for an initial assessment (Parenting Stress Index, Children's Dermatology Quality of Life&#xD;
      Index/Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life Index, and the Patient Oriented SCORAD). As part of&#xD;
      the medical initial evaluation, the medical provider will complete the SCORAD as part of&#xD;
      his/her medical evaluation. Further, nursing staff will spend time educating the patient and&#xD;
      family about therapy involved in medically treating atopic dermatitis. The total time&#xD;
      estimated to fill out measures and complete initial intake evaluation is about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Follow-up Appointment: Patient will be seen two weeks later for a follow-up visit where&#xD;
      the family will complete the Patient Oriented SCORAD and the medical provider will complete&#xD;
      the SCORAD as part of the medical evaluation and recommendations that make up the follow up&#xD;
      appointment. Nursing staff will again spend time educating the patient and family about&#xD;
      therapy involved in medically treating atopic dermatitis to determine that family has&#xD;
      sufficient education regarding care. Additional data collected at this time will be the&#xD;
      number of days since initial visit (collected through medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two month Follow-up Appointment: Finally, the family will be requested to schedule a 2 month&#xD;
      follow up to fill out all measures again and have a follow up medical visit. Additional data&#xD;
      collected at this time from the medical chart will be number of times the family has&#xD;
      contacted the dermatology office since the initial evaluation appointment. The family will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete a satisfaction survey about their experience at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention Group Initial Evaluation: The family will be requested to fill out all measures&#xD;
      for an initial assessment (Parenting Stress Index, Children's Dermatology Quality of Life&#xD;
      Index/Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life Index, and the Patient Oriented SCORAD). During the&#xD;
      medical part of the visit, the medical provider will complete the SCORAD as part of his/her&#xD;
      medical evaluation. Nursing staff will briefly educate the patient and family about therapy&#xD;
      involved in medically treating atopic dermatitis. Then, the family will meet with the&#xD;
      psychologist for about 30 minutes following medical visit to get psychoeducation and&#xD;
      introduction to coping, sleep, and behavior strategies. The total time estimated to fill out&#xD;
      measures and complete initial intake evaluation is about 50 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Follow-up Appointment: Patient will be seen two weeks later for a follow-up visit where&#xD;
      the family will complete the Patient Oriented SCORAD and the medical provider will complete&#xD;
      the SCORAD as part of the medical evaluation and recommendations that make up the follow up&#xD;
      appointment. Additional data collected at this time will be the number of days since initial&#xD;
      visit (collected through medical record). The family will meet with the psychologist for&#xD;
      another 30 minutes a review or elaboration of coping, sleep, and behavior strategies.&#xD;
      Additional data collected at this time will be the number of days since initial visit&#xD;
      (collected through medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two month Follow-up Appointment: Finally, the family will be requested to schedule a 2 month&#xD;
      follow up to fill out all measures post prevention and have a follow up medical visit.&#xD;
      Additional data collected at this time from the medical chart will be number of times the&#xD;
      family has contacted the dermatology office since the initial evaluation appointment. The&#xD;
      family will also be asked to complete a satisfaction survey about their experience at this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
