    <measure>Co-Primary Endpoint 1: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission as Measured by Partial Mayo Score (PMS) at Week 8 - Induction Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in PMS indicates improvement. Clinical remission was defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-Primary Endpoint 2: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission Per Full Mayo Score (FMS) at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline. Clinical remission per FMS is defined as Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ranked Secondary Endpoint 1: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response Per FMS at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline. Clinical response per FMS is defined as a decrease in FMS ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ranked Secondary Endpoint 2: Percentage of Participants With Mucosal Healing at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those participants with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline. Mucosal healing per Mayo endoscopy subscore is defined as a subscore of ≤ 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ranked Secondary Endpoint 3: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission Per FMS at Week 52 in Week 8 Remitters Per PMS - Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS remitters are defined as those participants with a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1. Clinical remission per FMS is defined as Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ranked Secondary Endpoint 4: Percentage of Participants With Corticosteroid-Free Clinical Remission Per FMS at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline. Among participants receiving systemic corticosteroids at Baseline, corticosteroid-free clinical remission per FMS at Week 52 is defined as having discontinued systemic corticosteroids prior to Week 52 and being in FMS clinical remission at Week 52 (defined as Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Prior to Protocol Amendment 4, participants were randomized 3:2 at baseline to adalimumab induction high dose or adalimumab induction standard dose. At Week 8, those demonstrating a clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) were randomized 2:2:1 to adalimumab maintenance standard dose, adalimumab maintenance high dose, or maintenance placebo.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After Protocol Amendment 4, participants received adalimumab induction high dose open-label. At Week 8, those demonstrating a clinical response per PMS were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adalimumab maintenance standard dose or adalimumab maintenance high dose. &quot;Integrated Study&quot; data includes data from both the Main Study and the Japan Sub-Study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Full Mayo Score (FMS)</title>
          <description>The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease).</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Endpoint 1: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission as Measured by Partial Mayo Score (PMS) at Week 8 - Induction Period</title>
        <description>The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in PMS indicates improvement. Clinical remission was defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1.</description>

        <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline.

          <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline.

        <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS remitters are defined as those participants with a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1.

          <title>Ranked Secondary Endpoint 4: Percentage of Participants With Corticosteroid-Free Clinical Remission Per FMS at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period</title>
          <description>The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline. Among participants receiving systemic corticosteroids at Baseline, corticosteroid-free clinical remission per FMS at Week 52 is defined as having discontinued systemic corticosteroids prior to Week 52 and being in FMS clinical remission at Week 52 (defined as Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1).</description>
          <population>mITT: all Week 8 PMS responders who were re-randomized at Week 8 and received at least 1 dose of study drug during the Maintenance period; analyzed as randomized at the beginning of the Maintenance phase.
