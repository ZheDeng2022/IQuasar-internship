  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To show non-inferiority of flutiform pMDI 50/5 µg (2 puffs bid) versus fluticasone pMDI 50 µg (2 puffs bid) based on the mean lower leg growth rates.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in growth rate during the each treatment and washout period which is 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower leg length will be measured in the afternoon, between 13:00 and 19:00h. Each individual subject will have their knemometry measurements performed at the same time of day (+/- 1 hour).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the safety of flutiform pMDI 50/5 µg (2 puffs bid) versus fluticasone pMDI 50 µg based on overnight urinary free cortisol (corrected for creatinine).</measure>
    <time_frame>every two weeks for duration of study which is two months.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will empty their bladder into the toilet before going to bed at night (or no later than at 10pm). This urine will not be collected. This voiding time will be recorded as the start time of the urine collection. Urine passed after this time during the night (if any) and until 8 am in the morning will be collected into a clean container. Subjects will empty their bladders a final time at 8 am in to the container. This voiding time will be recorded as the stop time of the urine collection.</description>

               2. Regular non-ICS controller medications for asthma (e.g., cromones or leukotriene&#xD;
                  receptor antagonists) at a stable dose for ≥ 3 months prior to the screening&#xD;
                  visit.&#xD;

          8. Demonstrated FEV1 of ≥ 80% predicted value at visit 1following appropriate withholding&#xD;
             of asthma medications (if applicable) (no SABA use within 6 hours of the PFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Demonstrated satisfactory technique in the use of the pMDI plus spacer and Autohaler&#xD;
