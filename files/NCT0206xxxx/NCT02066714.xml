    <textblock>
      Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease in childhood. Several&#xD;
      enteroviruses are associated with the disease. However, since 1997, large outbreaks of HFMD&#xD;
      in Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam have seen unusual neurological complications such as&#xD;
      brainstem encephalitis with rare fatal outcomes. The pathogen associated with this severe&#xD;
      disease is Enterovirus 71.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, Vietnam had a large outbreak of Hand Foot and mouth disease resulting in 110,000&#xD;
      cases and 164 deaths. HFMD affects children during their early years of child development,&#xD;
      but there is limited information on what the potential long-term consequences are. Small&#xD;
      studies have suggested language and cognitive difficulties in more severe disease but this&#xD;
      has not been evaluated in a large cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally recognized and standardized assessment tools are not available for early&#xD;
      childhood in Vietnam. This project will translate and adapt the Bayley Scales of Toddler and&#xD;
      Infant Development 3rd edition (Bayley III) and Movement ABC, 2nd edition (MABC) into&#xD;
      Vietnamese as outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether there are neurodevelopment difficulties following severe&#xD;
      HFMD. The study design is a prospective observational cohort study. Hospitalised children&#xD;
      with a clinical diagnosis of HFMD will be eligible to enroll. Written parental consent will&#xD;
      be required. Participants enrolled will be assessed 3 times over 18 months from discharge&#xD;
      from hospital into the study. Since there is no standardization of Bayley III or MABC for&#xD;
      Vietnam, a healthy cohort, age and sex matched to the least severe HFMD participants will be&#xD;
      recruited. This healthy cohort will follow the same assessment program over 18 months. A&#xD;
      total of 350 HFMD participants and 150 healthy children (matched to the least severe HFMD&#xD;
      participants) will be recruited.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand foot and mouth disease outbreaks associated with enterovirus 71 (EV71) were unusual in&#xD;
      their neurological manifestations. Since 1997, Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam have experienced&#xD;
      large outbreaks of EV71-HFMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological manifestations include meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, and rare&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary failure, thought to be neurogenic in origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Vietnam, children are admitted to hospital if they show signs of systemic disease. The&#xD;
      Vietnam Ministry of Health has developed a grading system to stratify management and&#xD;
      intervention. Grade 1 have solely the typical rash on palms of hands, soles on feet and&#xD;
      buttock with ulcers in the mouth. Grade 2 have systemic features such has high fever,&#xD;
      irritability and myoclonus. Grade 2 is split into 2a for parental report of symptoms or 2b if&#xD;
      a health professional has observed neurological signs. Grade 2 onwards are admitted to&#xD;
      hospital. Grade 3 develop irregular breathing, persistent tachycardia, hypertension, all&#xD;
      features of autonomic disturbance due to brainstem encephalitis. Grade 4 develop often fatal&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary failure, believed to be a consequence of excessive unopposed sympathetic&#xD;
      activation from brainstem disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different countries use different grading or staging systems for HFMD. A study in 142 EV71&#xD;
      suggested children affected at a younger age of onset of disease might have consequences for&#xD;
      verbal comprehension. In 63 children with EV71 disease, 14% had cognitive or motor deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to identify the neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes following severe&#xD;
      (hospitalised) HFMD in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective observational cohort study. There are two cohorts in this study. The HFMD&#xD;
      participants and healthy children. All children hospitalized with HFMD are eligible for&#xD;
      participation. From preliminary review of admissions to the hospital, we identified the&#xD;
      majority of patients were admitted from a local district in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (District&#xD;
      8). All participants will be asked if they agree for an optional brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will approach kindergartens in that district to enroll healthy children, and also approach&#xD;
      participants in another Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, HCMC study run at a local&#xD;
      obstetric hospital to enroll healthy infants. This healthy cohort will be age and sex matched&#xD;
      to the least severe grade of HFMD participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFMD will have neurological and neurodevelopmental assessments carried out 1 week after&#xD;
      discharge, 6 months later and the last assessment 18 months after the initial assessment. The&#xD;
      Healthy cohort will have a neurodevelopmental assessment at enrollment. 6 months and 18&#xD;
      months after the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of neurodevelopment scores at discharge, at 6 and at 18 months of follow up&#xD;
           between least severe HFMD children and an age and sex matched healthy comparison cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of neurodevelopment scores at 1 week after discharge, at 6 and at 18 months&#xD;
           after discharge between children stratified by HFMD disease grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Descriptive Brain MRI Changes according to severity of HFMD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to include up to 350 children with HFMD grade 2a, 2b, 3 and 4, and 150 healthy&#xD;
      children (matched for Grade 2a) and follow them up at enrolment, 6 and 18 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayley scoring system has a mean score of 100 with a standard deviation (SD) of 15 in&#xD;
      healthy American children. Based on this, we assume an SD of approximately 15 in all 5 study&#xD;
      populations. As little is known about within-child longitudinal changes in Bailey scores over&#xD;
      time, power considerations are based on pair-wise comparisons between groups at each time&#xD;
      point separately. With the sample sizes given, we will have 80% power at the two-sided 5%&#xD;
      significance level to detect differences in mean scores of - 7.4 or larger between grade 2a&#xD;
      or 2b children compared to grade 3 or 4 children, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Standard data summaries such as median (inter-quartile range) for&#xD;
      continuous variables and frequency (%) for categorical variable together with graphical&#xD;
      summaries (histograms, box plots and scatterplots) will be used for descriptive analyses in&#xD;
      all studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal profiles of development scores over time will be visualized by line plots of&#xD;
      individual subjects' data with overlaid smoothed lines for average development scores over&#xD;
      time within groups. Modeling of longitudinal profiles over time and group comparisons will be&#xD;
      based on standard methods for longitudinal data analysis such as linear mixed effects models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To public health implications of HFMD require evaluation of long-term. If the burden of&#xD;
      disease continues to have a neurological impact on a significant proportion of children, a&#xD;
      vaccine-based approach is essential and cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As intense efforts are underway in vaccine development, research is essential in helping&#xD;
      clinicians on the front line to identify the minority of children who may progress and focus&#xD;
      limited resources appropriately.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Hand Foot and Mouth Disease</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Vietnamese Ministry of Health has a clinical grading system. Grade 1 disease is uncomplicated and are not admitted to hospital. Grade 2 and above are admitted to hospital with clinical features of neurological or systemic involvement. Grade 2 is split into Grade 2a and 2b depending if neurological manifestations such as myoclonus have been witnessed by the parents or by a health professional. In total, it is anticipated that 125 Grade 2a and 125 Grade 2b and 100 more severe Grade 3 and 4 will be recruited over one year. A subset who agree for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also have a scan done during their hospital admission.</description>
