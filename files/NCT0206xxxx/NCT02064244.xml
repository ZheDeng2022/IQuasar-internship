      Bedside ultrasonographic assessment of IVC size and IVC collapsibility index can be used to&#xD;
      guide the management of patients with acute kidney injury with and without volume overload in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients presenting to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute renal&#xD;
      failure (defined as a 1.5 fold increase in plasma Creatinine level compared to baseline ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be recorded and followed for each patient, these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hemodynamic parameter such as Central Venous Pressure (CVP), Mean Arterial Pressure&#xD;
           (MAP) , and measurement of superior vena cava (SVC) size by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Laboratory parameter such as chemistry, fractional excretion of sodium , fractional&#xD;
           excretion of urea , beta natriuretic peptide , albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Radiographic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Echocardiographic parameters including Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), Right&#xD;
           Ventricular (RV) function and IVC size and variations&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Daily fluid balance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focused bedside ultrasound will be performed for each patient as part of their routine care&#xD;
      and initial assessment. The IVC size will be measured at the subcostal window, during&#xD;
      inspiration and expiration, using the (Sonosite) Cardiac probe P-21 (5-1 MHZ). The&#xD;
      measurement is obtained by applying the M-mode, perpendicular to the IVC axis and 2 cm caudal&#xD;
      from its junction with the right atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spontaneously breathing, non-ventilated patients, we will calculate the IVC collapsibility&#xD;
      index (IVC-CI) = [IVC max-IVC min]/IVC max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas in patients who are mechanically ventilated we will calculate their IVC variation&#xD;
      index (ΔIVC) = IVC max-IVC min/ IVC mean diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVC-CI, ΔIVC, IVC size will be used to classify patient as volume responders or&#xD;
      non-responder. Prior studies have suggested Intravascular volume depletion is likely present&#xD;
      when the, IVC&lt;1 cm , IVC-CI is &gt; 50% in spontaneously breathing patients and volume&#xD;
      responsiveness when the ΔIVC is ≥ 12% in mechanically ventilated patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fractional excretion of sodium as well as the fractional excretion of urea (when&#xD;
      diuretics are used) will be calculated to classify the etiology of the renal failure as&#xD;
      pre-renal or intrinsic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid balance as well as the change in plasma Creatinine level at 48 hours post admission&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 includes the patients who were managed in concordance with their IVC&#xD;
           measurements (Volume responders who had a positive fluid balance at 48 h post admission&#xD;
           and volume non responders who had an even or negative fluid balance at 48 hours post&#xD;
           admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 includes the patients in whom the fluid management was discordant with the IVC&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be done at 24 as well as 48 hours post admission.&#xD;
