      The purpose of the study is to investigate if paravertebral block for breast surgery may&#xD;
      improve postoperative analgesia and shorten length of hospital stay. Within a prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial sixty women (ASA I - III) undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery with&#xD;
      axillary dissection are enrolled. Exclusion criteria are general infection and local&#xD;
      infection at the site of planned puncture, anatomic deformities of the thoracic spine,&#xD;
      coagulation disorders, allergy against local anesthetics or contrast agents, pregnancy or&#xD;
      breast-feeding and BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to two groups, 30 patients each, by using block of four&#xD;
      method. Group I patients receive paravertebral block at spine level Th 4 via catheter; Group&#xD;
      II patients will have general anesthesia without nitrous oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (PVB) will be entirely performed by one person (1st author) with the&#xD;
      patient in prone position. In randomly selected patients the catheter localization will be&#xD;
      detected by fluoroscopy after injection of 0.5 ml contrast agent. The catheter positioned at&#xD;
      about 8 cm from skin level, a mixture of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus 20 ml lidocaine 2% with&#xD;
      adrenaline 1:200,000 will be injected sequentially 10 ml each while withdrawing the catheter&#xD;
      2 cm after the first and again 2 cm after the second injection. Then the catheter will be&#xD;
      removed. Low dose intraoperative sedation is provided with IV midazolam 2-3 mg, ketamine 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg bolus and continuous propofol using target-controlled infusion (TCI) system aiming at&#xD;
      effect site concentration (Ce) of 1 - 1.5 mcg/mL to allow spontaneous breathing. In case&#xD;
      surgical approach is not tolerated, the regional block is graded insufficient, and it is&#xD;
      switched to general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At postoperative care unit (PACU) the pain score using visual rating scale (VRS) from 0 to 10&#xD;
      (worst imaginable pain) is assessed at rest and on movement of the shoulder every 15 minutes&#xD;
      until 60 minutes. Analgesia is provided by IV morphine 0.04 mg/kg boluses with a 15-min&#xD;
      dosing interval to maintain VRS - score &lt; 3. Time to first analgesic demand and 24-hr&#xD;
      analgesics consumption is recorded as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).&#xD;
      Complications are recorded including those related to the paravertebral block, such as&#xD;
      Horner's syndrome, epidural spreading, hypotension that is not related to another. Patients&#xD;
      will be checked 6, 12, and 24hr postoperatively for adverse effects, pain scores, and&#xD;
      satisfaction scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have shown that breast surgery is associated with significant postoperative&#xD;
      pain, nausea, vomiting, and development of chronic pain. General anaesthesia is associated&#xD;
      with a 50% incidence of nausea and vomiting among breast cancer surgery patients. The&#xD;
      proposed benefits of regional anesthesia including paravertebral block compared to general&#xD;
      anaesthesia are decreasing stress response, improving postoperative pain control and&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary function, decreasing cancer recurrence, and reducing thromboembolic&#xD;
      events. However, the debate about these benefits is still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block for breast surgery, either alone or additional to general anaesthesia is&#xD;
      favored by many investigators, due to better postoperative analgesia and shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay. In an elder investigation thermographic imaging was used to apply paravertebral block.&#xD;
      After a single injection of 15 ml 0.5% bupivacaine at spine level Th9-Th10 there was a mean&#xD;
      distribution of somatic block of five and of sympathetic block of eight dermatomes without&#xD;
      any hemodynamic side effects. No bilateral spread was found. The authors contradicted the&#xD;
      suggestions paravertebral block being ineffective and sometimes hazardous. However, their&#xD;
      patients were chronic pain patients with a number of six only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-injection paravertebral block may not be sufficient to cover the relevant dermatomes&#xD;
      C6 - Th6 for radical mastectomy with axillary dissection, when applied as the sole anesthetic&#xD;
      technique. Some study groups performed paravertebral block with several injections. Four&#xD;
      injections resulted in sufficient anaesthesia in 97% of these patients, whereas one injection&#xD;
      was effective in only 11%. Though there is limited published evidence yet, a single injection&#xD;
      for paravertebral block may be insufficient for extensive breast surgery, such as mastectomy&#xD;
      including axillary evisceration. However, considering the potential risks of deep&#xD;
      paravertebral puncture a limitation of punctures would be preferable. Inserting a&#xD;
      paravertebral catheter far enough and in proper position offers the opportunity to apply the&#xD;
      anesthetic agent at different sites, by moving the catheter backwards after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to find out if injections via paravertebral catheter at three&#xD;
      different levels are advantageous and efficient compared to general anesthesia in patients&#xD;
      having mastectomy with axillary dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, instead of 4 cm catheter insertion inside the paravertebral space (PVS) as the&#xD;
      recommended, we used ultrasound-guided PVB (transverse view, out of plane technique), to&#xD;
      facilitate further insertion of the catheter (8 cm) in the PVS. A contrast agent will be used&#xD;
      in randomly selected patients to prove the exact site of the inserted catheter and to&#xD;
      exclude/detect obstructions such as kinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective clinical trial. Patients have to agree documented by written&#xD;
      informed consent. Sixty women, ASA I - III undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery with&#xD;
      axillary dissection, including radical lymph node removal or sentinel node biopsy are&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to two groups, 30 patients each, by using block of four&#xD;
      method. Group I patients receive paravertebral block at spine level Th 4 via catheter with&#xD;
      injections at three different levels; Group II patients will have general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic preparation: After arrival at the OR standard monitoring is applied including ECG,&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oxymetry. Midazolam 0.05 mg per kilogram bodyweight is&#xD;
      given intravenously to all patients to achieve mild sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (Group I). Paravertebral block will be entirely performed by one person&#xD;
      (first author) with the patient in prone position. The superior aspect of the Th4 spinous&#xD;
      process is marked. After skin disinfection an 18-gauge Tuohy needle including attached saline&#xD;
      filled syringe is inserted perpendicular to the skin at the Th3-Th4 interspace, using the&#xD;
      area 2.5 cm lateral to T4 spinous process as Landmark. Under ultrasound guidance, the needle&#xD;
      is advanced by out of plane technique, angled anteriorly until contact with the transverse&#xD;
      process, and then redirected either caudal or cephalad and parallel to the spine advanced&#xD;
      further until loss of resistance. After placement of the needle an end-hole 20 gauge catheter&#xD;
      is inserted and advanced 8 cm beyond needlepoint into the paravertebral space. The catheter&#xD;
      insertion is scored as 'easy', 'difficult' or 'impossible'. In randomly selected patients the&#xD;
      catheter localization will be detected by fluoroscopy after injection of 0.5 ml contrast&#xD;
      agent. The catheter positioned, a mixture of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus 20 ml lidocaine 2%&#xD;
      with adrenaline 1:200,000 will be slowly injected sequentially 10 ml each while withdrawing&#xD;
      the catheter 2 cm after the first and again 2 cm after the second injection. Then the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed. Patients are returned to the supine position and remain for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes in the preoperative area. Sensory blockade is assessed by using pin-prick&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When analgesia is adequate patients are moved into the operating room. Intraoperative&#xD;
      sedation is provided with low dose IV midazolam, ketamine bolus and continuous propofol using&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion system to allow spontaneous breathing. In case skin incision or&#xD;
      further surgical approach is not tolerated, the regional block is graded insufficient, and it&#xD;
      is switched to general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Anaesthesia (Group II): Anesthesia is induced intravenously with propofol and&#xD;
      fentanyl. Atracurium is used to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia is maintained with&#xD;
      sevoflurane and 50% oxygen in air. Additional Fentanyl will be administered on discretion of&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Patients' biometric data, details of the clinical course, such as amount of&#xD;
      anesthetics used, operation time, surgical difficulties, hemodynamic instability (if any) and&#xD;
      similar are recorded. At postoperative care unit (PACU) the pain score using visual rating&#xD;
      scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) is assessed at rest and on movement of&#xD;
      the shoulder every 15 minutes until 60 minutes. Analgesia is provided by IV morphine boluses&#xD;
      with a 15-min dosing interval to maintain VRS - score &lt; 3. Time to first analgesic demand and&#xD;
      24-hr analgesics consumption is recorded. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is assessed using&#xD;
      a 3-point scale; Ondansetron is administered to treat it. Any complications are recorded&#xD;
      including those related to paravertebral block, such as Horner's syndrome, epidural&#xD;
      spreading, hypotension that is not related to another reason, pneumothorax and adverse effect&#xD;
      of local anesthetics. Patients will be checked 6, 12, and 24hr postoperatively for adverse&#xD;
      effects, pain scores, and satisfaction scores. During hospital stay, the patients receive one&#xD;
      tablet of Ultracet (tramadol plus acetaminophen) and Celebrex 200 mg two times a day for pain&#xD;
      relief and oral lorazepam before bedtime. Residents or nurses on postoperative care station&#xD;
      and surgical ward both are blinded to the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: According to the data from a previous study paravertebral block&#xD;
      compared to general anesthesia can reduce postoperative analgesia requirement (opioids +&#xD;
      non-steroidal analgesics) up to 80%. Taking a 5% significance level as basis 30 patients per&#xD;
      group is adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Parametric data are expressed as mean and analyzed using Student's T&#xD;
      test. The non-parametric data are expressed as median (range) and analyzed using Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U Test. Repeated analysis of variance is used to compare VAS between groups. The association&#xD;
      between the techniques and incidence of complications are evaluated by chi-square or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test as appropriate. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v20.0 for&#xD;
      Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). All tests are two-sided and a p-value of &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
