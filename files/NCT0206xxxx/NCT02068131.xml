             within 3 months following the last administration of approved standard therapies and&#xD;
             terminate standard treatment due to unacceptable toxicity warranting.).If recurrence&#xD;
             and metastasis occurred within 6 months after discontinuation of adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy, the adjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be first-line&#xD;
             treatment.Subject received last-line treatment not including capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria that has not been&#xD;
             previously local treated. Minimum indicator lesion size as follows: greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 10 mm measured by spiral CT or NMR.Malignant lymph nodes short diameter as&#xD;
             follows: greater than or equal to 15 mm measured by spiral CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum of 4 weeks since any local radiotherapy or surgery for the control of symptoms&#xD;
             or severe complications(local radiotherapy for the control of bone metastases is not&#xD;
             the limit)，and adequately recovered from toxicities of any prior therapy).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with novaferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding women or women who may be pregnant were positive drug test&#xD;
             before administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
