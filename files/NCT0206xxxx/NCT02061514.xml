      -  Major surgery can lead to postoperative disturbances in sleep patterns with subjective&#xD;
           deterioration of sleep quality according to patients' reports as well as objective&#xD;
           alterations of sleep architecture, as recorded by polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors implicated in postoperative sleep disturbances include but are not limited to&#xD;
           the severity of the surgical procedure, the neuroendocrine response to surgery,&#xD;
           inadequate treatment of postoperative pain and external factors interfering with sleep,&#xD;
           such as light, noise and therapeutic procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are differences in the molecular mechanisms inhalational anesthetics and&#xD;
           intravenous agents affect different brain regions to induce anesthesia. Our hypothesis&#xD;
           is that these differences may also be evident during the postoperative period, affecting&#xD;
           brain functions which are involved in postoperative sleep architecture. So, the aim of&#xD;
           this study will be to assess the effect of two different anesthetic techniques (propofol&#xD;
           versus desflurane) of maintaining general anesthesia in patients subjected to similar&#xD;
           major operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI),&#xD;
           regarding preoperative and long term postoperative sleep quality, sleep diaries&#xD;
           regarding early postoperative sleep quality and biochemical markers (cortisol, prolactin&#xD;
           and melatonin) regarding neuroendocrine response to surgery and disturbances in&#xD;
           endogenous circadian secretion associated with sleep&#xD;

      -  Major surgery can lead to postoperative disturbances in sleep patterns with subjective&#xD;
           deterioration of sleep quality according to patients' reports as well as objective&#xD;
           alterations of sleep architecture, as recorded by polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These disturbances include severe sleep fragmentation, rapid eye movement (REM) and slow&#xD;
           wave sleep significant reductions in duration as well as an increase in non-REM sleep&#xD;
           stages. Spontaneous awakenings are also frequently reported&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the third or fourth postoperative day, there is a substantial rebound in total REM&#xD;
           activity, with frequent reports of vivid nightmares&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors implicated in postoperative sleep disturbances include but are not limited to&#xD;
           the severity of the surgical procedure, the neuroendocrine response to surgery,&#xD;
           inadequate treatment of postoperative pain and external factors interfering with sleep,&#xD;
           such as light, noise and therapeutic procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are differences in the molecular mechanisms inhalational anesthetics and&#xD;
           intravenous agents affect different brain regions to induce anesthesia. Our hypothesis&#xD;
           is that these differences may also be evident during the postoperative period, affecting&#xD;
           brain functions which are involved in sleep architecture, since sleep is an altered&#xD;
           state of consciousness like anesthesia. So, the aim of this study will be to assess the&#xD;
           effect of two different anesthetic techniques of maintaining general anesthesia in&#xD;
           patients subjected to similar major operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients taking part in the study will be evaluated regarding their preoperative sleep&#xD;
           quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI). The PSQI examines seven&#xD;
           components of sleep quality retrospectively over a period of four weeks: subjective&#xD;
           sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep&#xD;
           disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.&#xD;
           The patient self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of answers is based&#xD;
           on a 0-3 scale, whereby '3' reflects the negative extreme on the Likert scale. The&#xD;
           global score is generated by summing up all seven component scores and ranges from 0 to&#xD;
           21, with higher values corresponding to reduced sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consequently, patients will be randomized to one of two groups: one group with general&#xD;
           anesthesia maintenance based on an intravenous agent (propofol) and a second group with&#xD;
           general anesthesia maintenance based on an inhalational agent (desflurane)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed postoperatively with sleep diaries regarding potential sleep&#xD;
           disturbances while they will be subjected to a long-term assessment of sleep quality by&#xD;
           the use of the PSQI one and three months postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since anesthetic-related differences in hormone profiles are expected, markers related&#xD;
           to the neuroendocrine response to stress (cortisol, prolactin) will also be assessed to&#xD;
           investigate differences between the two different anesthetic regimes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired melatonin secretion has been proposed as one of the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
           postoperative sleep disturbances. It is therefore expected that different methods of&#xD;
           anesthetic maintenance may affect the endogenous circadian melatonin rhythm in a&#xD;
           different way. Consequently, melatonin secretion will also be measured to investigate&#xD;
           potential desynchronization of melatonin rhythm as well as differences in melatonin&#xD;
           secretion between the two different anesthetic techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical implications of this study lie in the fact that postoperative sleep&#xD;
           disturbances can lead to postoperative hemodynamic instability, episodic hypoxemia and&#xD;
           mental status deterioration, which can all untowardly affect the short and long-term&#xD;
           postoperative outcome. It would be interesting to determine whether one of the two&#xD;
           anesthetic regimes is superior to the other as far as postoperative disturbances in&#xD;
           sleep architecture are concerned&#xD;
