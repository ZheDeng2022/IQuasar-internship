      The significance of this clinical trial lies in its potential to increase the success of&#xD;
      immunosuppression (IS) therapy withdrawal in liver transplant (LT) recipients, thus&#xD;
      decreasing the negative impact of IS on their long-term outcomes. Lifetime immunosuppression&#xD;
      (IS) with standard agents, the calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine and tacrolimus&#xD;
      (TAC), is currently required at clinically recommended doses and trough levels to prevent&#xD;
      allograft rejection. However, this occurs at the significant expense of long-term CNI&#xD;
      toxicity, i.e. chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,&#xD;
      infections and malignancy. With improvements in early graft and patient survival, long term&#xD;
      adverse IS effects have become increasingly important in this rapidly expanding patient&#xD;
      population. The strategies to reduce long term CNI toxicity include dose minimization that&#xD;
      still leaves patients on CNI therapy, conversion to non-CNI therapy, or even complete IS&#xD;
      withdrawal. The second approach, conversion to non-CNI IS therapy, is attractive in the&#xD;
      potential to stabilize or improve renal function and other CNI toxicities. One such&#xD;
      non-nephrotoxic IS agent, the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR-I) SRL, has a&#xD;
      different mechanism of IS action and studies have shown that CNI to SRL conversion can&#xD;
      stabilize renal dysfunction with a low risk of rejection. Yet even with these possible&#xD;
      benefits, patients on SRL are still subject to lifetime IS therapy with side effects and&#xD;
      costs, highlighting the need to investigate the strategies that promote full IS withdrawal&#xD;
      without rejection (3rd approach), also known as 'operational tolerance'.&#xD;

      Study Overview The study proposed is a prospective trial of controlled SRL monotherapy&#xD;
      minimization and withdrawal in up to 25 stable non-immune non-viremic LT recipients. Given&#xD;
      the sample size calculations (see Statistical section), we plan to enroll up to 25 SRL&#xD;
      monotherapy patients for this study (Figure 1). All patients will be consented to undergo&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation as well as an enrollment liver biopsy and blood tests. If the patient&#xD;
      meets inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria (see below), SRL will be minimized over 6 months&#xD;
      until once a week dosing is achieved. Repeat clinical and immunological blood tests as above&#xD;
      will be performed, and if no biochemical signs of rejection, SRL will be discontinued with&#xD;
      blood tests and liver biopsy 12 months later for similar biochemical, histological and&#xD;
      immunological measures. At any concern for rejection, liver biopsy and assays for equivalent&#xD;
      biochemical, histological and immunological measures will be performed and if rejection is&#xD;
      diagnosed on biopsy, a second attempt at withdrawal will not be performed. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored as standard of care with clinic visits every 6 months and laboratory tests every 2&#xD;
      weeks. The total study length will be 18 months: 6 month minimization phase and 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up after withdrawal success/failure. The primary outcome will be the proportion of&#xD;
      tolerant patients off SRL therapy with normal liver biochemistry and graft histology at 18&#xD;
      months. Secondary outcomes will include the incidence, severity and reversibility of&#xD;
      rejection, patient/graft survival, resolution of SRL and other non-specific IS effects, and&#xD;
      the assessment of clinical/immunological biomarkers of tolerance. All continuous/categorical&#xD;
      clinical variables will be compared with the appropriate statistical analyses.The goal is&#xD;
      that the primary and secondary aims will provide valuable preliminary data to further&#xD;
      elucidate the mechanisms of mTOR-I immunoregulation and for determining the initial clinical&#xD;
      success/feasibility of the mTOR-I approach (vs. historical 20% CNI withdrawal success seen in&#xD;
      studies from the Immune Tolerance Network [ITN] and other groups). This is all so as to guide&#xD;
      a submission to the Immune Tolerance Network for larger, more adequately powered prospective&#xD;
      trials comparing SRL vs. CNI withdrawal and accompanying biomarker predictors of tolerance.&#xD;
      If this pilot study fails to show a correlation between our biomarkers and the&#xD;
      success/failure of SRL withdrawal, or is associated with an unacceptable low (e.g. &lt;20%) rate&#xD;
      of operational tolerance, then this would avoid the necessity for such large, expensive&#xD;
      trials and support the continued development of alternative approaches to tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Initial Phase of Enrollment (see Study Protocol Figure- Appendix A) These liver&#xD;
      transplant candidates (up to 25 SRL) will be approached for consideration and informed&#xD;
      consent into the study. The consent form will include discussion of the risks/benefits of&#xD;
      their current therapy (SRL) and the planned minimization/withdrawal. Specifically, the risks&#xD;
      of minimization/withdrawal (i.e. developing acute or chronic rejection, alloimmune hepatitis&#xD;
      during any portion of the study), although unlikely, will be a major emphasis of the consent&#xD;
      process. The consent form will also include the strict requirement for patients to follow all&#xD;
      instructions from the PI in regard to the close laboratory follow-up occurring throughout the&#xD;
      trial, to diagnose any episode of rejection or concern as early as possible to be able to&#xD;
      respond appropriately. All of the study procedures will be discussed with the patient during&#xD;
      clinic visits. They will be informed that neither participation nor refusal will influence&#xD;
      their clinical care. All laboratory tests or costs related to their care in the study, with&#xD;
      the exception of non-standard of care items (i.e. liver biopsies, blood assays), will be the&#xD;
      responsibility of the patient and/or his/her insurance company. They will be asked questions&#xD;
      afterwards to verify comprehension and then sign the consent form documenting their agreement&#xD;
      to participate. A signed copy of the consent form will be given to them. Participation is&#xD;
      completely voluntary and they may discontinue participation the study at any time without&#xD;
      affecting their care or participation in any other study. No financial compensation will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Evaluation at Enrollment (see Study Protocol Figure) After long term (&gt; 3 years&#xD;
      post-LT, &gt; 3 months on SRL monotherapy) on SRL monotherapy, inclusion/exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be reviewed and if appropriate, consent as above will be obtained. If the patient agrees and&#xD;
      signs consent, baseline standard of care screening laboratories complete blood count,&#xD;
      comprehensive metabolic panel, sirolimus (CBC, CMP, SRL trough level, fasting lipid profile,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C [HbA1C], urine protein/creatinine ratio) and non-standard of care biomarker&#xD;
      assays (blood immunophenotyping, proteogenomics) and liver biopsy (histology and graft&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry) will be performed as dictated by the protocol. In addition, the liver&#xD;
      biopsy will be used to determine stability in graft function (i.e. no evidence of rejection&#xD;
      or immune-mediated hepatitis) before considering minimization/withdrawal. SRL&#xD;
      minimization/withdrawal will only be performed if clinically, biochemically and&#xD;
      histologically [by biopsy; liver transplant pathology read (Yang, Rao)] stable. Throughout&#xD;
      the entire study, liver function tests will be monitored every 2 weeks (monthly is standard&#xD;
      of care, so the interim non-standard of care 2 week blood tests will be covered by the study&#xD;
      funds). Patients entering the minimization/withdrawal phases will be reduced by a total dose&#xD;
      of 50% of their baseline dose every month until patients are on 0.5 mg SRL daily. At this&#xD;
      point, every other day dosing will begin x 1 month. If no LFT abnormalities, twice weekly&#xD;
      dosing x 1 month, then once a week dosing x 1 month. Prior to complete discontinuation,&#xD;
      repeat clinical (screening labs above) and blood biomarker assays (blood immunophenotyping,&#xD;
      proteogenomics) will be performed. Liver biopsy will not be performed at this juncture unless&#xD;
      there are biochemical signs of liver injury. If complete withdrawal is deemed safe (no&#xD;
      evidence of biochemical abnormalities) patients will be withdrawn completely (i.e. the&#xD;
      once/week SRL dose discontinued) and followed off IS therapy for one year. In this time&#xD;
      period, liver function tests will be monitored every 2 weeks, as usual, and repeat clinical&#xD;
      (screening labs above), liver biopsy and blood (blood immunophenotyping, proteogenomics)&#xD;
      assays performed at the end of this year or at any concern for rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and Tissue Samples Standard of care laboratories (CBC, CMP) will be performed every&#xD;
      month on all patients, and only LFTs performed in the interim 2 weeks between each month&#xD;
      (non-standard of care; covered by the study funds) until complete withdrawal. 3 green top 5&#xD;
      mL and 3 red top 5 mL tubes of blood for biomarker assays will be taken on all patients prior&#xD;
      to study enrollment, prior to complete withdrawal, and one year after withdrawal or at the&#xD;
      time of suspected rejection. Liver biopsy (one 3 cm biopsy- 2 cm for histology and 1 cm for&#xD;
      genomic assays) will be performed at baseline (pre-minimization) and 1 year post withdrawal.&#xD;
      A separate clinical informed consent will be obtained each time a liver biopsy is performed.&#xD;
      If the patient develops elevation in liver transaminases requiring a liver biopsy at any&#xD;
      stage of the study protocol, blood (all for immune monitoring (IM) assays) will be requested&#xD;
      from the patient at the time of the biopsy. If rejection occurs, the patient will be followed&#xD;
      in the study until completion but not be further withdrawn from SRL or have a liver biopsy at&#xD;
      the end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Laboratory follow-up is described above- every 2 weeks throughout the trial until&#xD;
      complete withdrawal. Any biochemical (or clinical) signs or significant liver function test&#xD;
      abnormalities will be acted on immediately either by liver biopsy or a pause in IS withdrawal&#xD;
      per investigator discretion. All patients will be seen in the clinic every 3 months to assess&#xD;
      for any new signs or symptoms or resolution of drug side effects in the minimization or&#xD;
      withdrawal arm. Quality of life questionnaires; Post Liver Transplant Quality of Life&#xD;
      Instrument (pLTQ) and the Promis-29 profile v1.0 will be administered at the study onset and&#xD;
      after successful vs. unsuccessful withdrawal (end of study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients off SRL therapy with&#xD;
      normal liver biochemistry and graft histology at 12 months (i.e. tolerant). Thus, the&#xD;
      incidence of graft dysfunction (acute rejection, immune mediated or autoimmune hepatitis,&#xD;
      chronic rejection) or non-tolerance will be assessed in this SRL withdrawal group and&#xD;
      compared to the historical CNI group (20% tolerant; 80% failure) as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      This rate will be a composite of the cumulative number of biopsy-proven graft dysfunctions&#xD;
      requiring conversion back to SRL or additional IS therapy or discontinuation of&#xD;
      minimization/withdrawal that occur during the course of the study. Major secondary measures&#xD;
      compared will be the predictive capacity of the blood and graft biomarker assays&#xD;
      (immunophenotyping, genomic/proteomics) before and after minimization/withdrawal in the&#xD;
      success vs. failure groups. Clinical secondary outcomes will be compared: the number of&#xD;
      infectious complications, liver biopsy complications, cardiovascular outcomes (i.e. blood&#xD;
      pressure, diabetes control, lipid levels), renal function, hematopoietic parameters,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal effects, or other side effects of SRL that may or may not improve or develop&#xD;
      with minimization/withdrawal. These will all be documented by a study database during patient&#xD;
      visits, electronic charts and/or by phone communication. Finally, quality of life (Post Liver&#xD;
      Transplant Quality of Life Instrument (pLTQ) and the Promis-29 profile v1.0) will be analyzed&#xD;
      at the end of the study to determine the effect of IS minimization/withdrawal on other health&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
