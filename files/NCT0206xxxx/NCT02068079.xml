  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combination therapy with vemurafenib&#xD;
      and trientine in patients with BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vemurafenib is a drug that is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat adult patients with&#xD;
      melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. It can&#xD;
      only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in the &quot;BRAF&quot; gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggests that use of a copper chelator (reducer) is a strategy to block&#xD;
      cellular signaling activity which would result in anti-tumor effects (slow tumor growth).&#xD;
      Trientine is a copper chelator and is FDA approved for the treatment of Wilson's disease (a&#xD;
      disease of copper metabolism) and is generally well tolerated. It works by binding to copper&#xD;
      to help remove it from the body. Trientine is not FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma&#xD;
      and its use in this study is investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot; means the study drug is still&#xD;
      being tested in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive vemurafenib at 960mg PO twice daily with continuous dosing in&#xD;
      combination with trientine in escalating doses. The dose of trientine will depend on what&#xD;
      portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate in the study, patients must test positive for the change (mutation)&#xD;
      in the BRAF gene.&#xD;
