    <textblock>
      Patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) often die from intrahepatic&#xD;
      disease or are excluded from liver-directed treatment because of extrahepatic disease.&#xD;
      Adjuvant liver-directed treatment is warranted to control both intra- and extrahepatic&#xD;
      disease. Patients with liver metastases of NET will be included in this study (n = 30-48).The&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant 166Ho-radioembolization (166Ho-RE) after systemic&#xD;
      177Lu-dotatate will be studied in a non-comparative phase II study. The study is an&#xD;
      interventional, treatment, non-randomized, open label, non-comparative, phase II study.&#xD;
      166Ho-RE will be performed via a catheter during angiography.&#xD;

      Acronym :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holmium Embolization Particles for Arterial Radiotherapy Plus 177Lu-dotatate in Salvage NET&#xD;
      patients- HEPAR PLUS-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) often die from intrahepatic&#xD;
      disease or are excluded from liver-directed treatment because of extrahepatic disease.&#xD;
      Adjuvant liver-directed treatment is warranted to control both intra- and extrahepatic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate efficacy of adjuvant 166Ho-radioembolization (166Ho-RE) after systemic&#xD;
           177Lu-dotatate in a non-comparative phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the safety and toxicity profile of adjuvant 166Ho-RE after systemic&#xD;
           treatment with 177Lu-dotatate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate biodistribution / dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional, treatment, non-randomized, open label, non-comparative, phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with liver metastases of NET will be included in this study (n = 30-48). These male&#xD;
      and female patients must be aged ≥18 years. All NET histologies are acceptable, provided no&#xD;
      standard therapeutic options are available, such as chemotherapy and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      166Ho-RE will be performed via a catheter during angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour response at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and toxicity profile of 166Ho-RE as adjuvant treatment after 177Lu-dotatate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in tumour markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biodistribution / Dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening phase of approximately 2 weeks followed by a treatment&#xD;
      phase of approximately 2-3 weeks. Patients will be followed until liver specific tumour&#xD;
      progression or death has occurred, to a maximum of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first cohort of 30 patients will be treated with 166Ho-RE. After the first cohort, up to 3&#xD;
      additional cohorts of 6 patients will be treated with 166Ho-RE. The total number of patients&#xD;
      treated in the HEPAR PLUS trial will therefore be at least 30 and at most 48 patients,&#xD;
      depending on the observed number of responses. Early termination at a response interim&#xD;
      analysis (after 30, 36 or 42 patients) is determined by pre-defined boundaries on the number&#xD;
      of observed responses. The boundary in favour of treatment effect may be crossed before 30&#xD;
      patients are reached, but then the study will continue to at least 30 patients to allow&#xD;
      estimation of the key secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center (UMC Utrecht).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
