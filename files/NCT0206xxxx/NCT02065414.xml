  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be given special instructions about taking care of their teeth during the&#xD;
      18 hours before they come to the dentist's office for screening/baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks and&#xD;
      4 weeks. At that first visit, they will be examined by a dentist, who will examine their&#xD;
      mouths with a dental instrument to determine whether they qualify to participate in the&#xD;
      trial. Someone who works for the dentist will also take some oral measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who qualify to be in the study will receive a treatment for their gingivitis and&#xD;
      have an equal chance of being assigned to one of three treatment groups. Participants in all&#xD;
      three groups will be given toothpaste that is already available in stores. They will brush&#xD;
      their teeth twice daily in their regular manner. After brushing, participants in one group&#xD;
      will use an experimental mouth rinse that is not available in stores. Another group will be&#xD;
      given a mouth rinse to use that is already available in stores, and the third group will use&#xD;
      a placebo mouth rinse. After they receive their assigned products participants will be&#xD;
      supervised while they brush their teeth and rinse to ensure they understand exactly how to&#xD;
      use the products. Participants will be required to stay at the site 20 minutes after the&#xD;
      first use of product during visit 1 to monitor any potential allergic reaction. All other&#xD;
      brushing and rinsing over the next four weeks will be at home, but participants will be&#xD;
      required to keep a diary to record their brushing and rinsing times twice each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to bring their diaries and any left-over toothpaste and mouth&#xD;
      rinse with them for three more scheduled appointments after about 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4&#xD;
      weeks. At those appointments, the dentist will examine their mouths, make sure there are no&#xD;
      safety concerns, and examine again to get the measurements needed. One of the dentist's staff&#xD;
      members will take other measurements as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the measured effects of the experimental mouth rinse on bleeding as&#xD;
      a result of gingivitis, and compare these results to the mouth rinse that is already&#xD;
      available.&#xD;

      At screening Participants will present to the clinical site having refrained from oral&#xD;
      hygiene for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours for baseline examinations (safety&#xD;
      oral and hard soft tissue exam, MGI - Modified Gingival Index, BI - Bleeding Index and PI-&#xD;
      Plaque Index and Extrinsic Staining. After the baseline oral examinations, qualifying&#xD;
      participants will receive a whole-mouth supragingival dental prophylaxis and will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to the negative control treatment group will brush twice daily&#xD;
      with a marketed fluoride toothpaste in their usual manner and rinse with a placebo mouth&#xD;
      rinse. Participants randomly assigned to the experimental treatment group will brush twice&#xD;
      daily with a marketed fluoride toothpaste brush in their usual manner and use an experimental&#xD;
      mouth rinse. The last treatment group randomly assigned to the positive control will brush&#xD;
      twice daily with a marketed fluoride toothpaste in their usual manner and rinse with a&#xD;
      marketed available mouth rinse. Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned each&#xD;
      of the three groups. The first product use will be conducted under supervision of study&#xD;
      personnel. Participants will be required to stay at the site 20 minutes after the first use&#xD;
      of product during visit 1 to monitor any potential analytic reaction. All other brushing and&#xD;
      rinsing will be unsupervised and the participants will be required to maintain a diary card&#xD;
      to document twice-daily product use, brushing and rinsing times. Diaries along with product&#xD;
      accountability will be used to check for subject compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinical site after 1 week (Day 7±1 day), 2 weeks (Day 14±2&#xD;
      days) and 4 weeks (Day 28±3 days). Oral hard and soft tissue safety, Modified Gingival Index&#xD;
      (MGI), Bleeding Index (BI), and Plaque Index (PI) will be assessed by the primary examiner 1&#xD;
      at all visits Extrinsic stain will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks by the&#xD;
      secondary examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, subjects will return all used and unused product to the clinical&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
