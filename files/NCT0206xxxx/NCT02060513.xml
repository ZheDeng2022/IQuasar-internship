  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Military service members and the U.S. veteran population face a growing and serious health&#xD;
      threat: widespread antibiotic resistance resulting from resistant bacteria and a dwindling&#xD;
      pipe-line of sufficiently potent antibiotics. Infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria&#xD;
      are increasing significantly. They cause major complications and mortality, and drive up&#xD;
      healthcare costs. Powerful but non-targeted antibiotics, while in widespread use, can&#xD;
      actually pressure bacteria to develop resistance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current methods for diagnosing infections typically require 2-3 days to produce results that&#xD;
      can guide antibiotic choice. That is frequently too delayed to help clinicians make good&#xD;
      treatment decisions. This also results in inappropriate or over-treatment with non-targeted&#xD;
      antibiotics that are started while awaiting lab results. More rapid technologies that can&#xD;
      accurately diagnose the specific cause of an infection could guide early, targeted antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. This would result in more effective early treatment of infection, decrease&#xD;
      unnecessary exposure to excess antibiotics, and could slow the development of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance. By diagnosing infections earlier, we expect to reduce the complications and&#xD;
      mortality of combat-related infections in Wounded Warriors and Military Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a new ultra-rapid technology (called MADM) that uses a digital microscope to&#xD;
      detect bacteria growing directly from a patient's specimen, rather than waiting for growth in&#xD;
      lab cultures. The innovative new method supports identification of the infecting bacteria&#xD;
      within 2 hours of receiving a specimen. The technology also shows the effect of selected&#xD;
      antibiotics on the bacteria including multidrug resistant bacteria so that doctors know&#xD;
      within 6 hours from specimen collection which antibiotic kills the bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves collection of any excess volume of microbiology specimens after it has&#xD;
      been determined sufficient sample is available for clinical care. All microbiological samples&#xD;
      and results are being obtained for solely non-research purposes as part of usual care; only&#xD;
      leftover/discarded materials from clinical or research procedures already performed will be&#xD;
      used for this study. Samples will be tested in tandem with usual care on the new technology&#xD;
      to test the accuracy and speed. Results obtained from the new technology will not be used in&#xD;
      patient care or to make treatment decisions.&#xD;
