  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a common chronic auto-immune disease, characterised by&#xD;
      inflammation of the exocrine glands, resulting in progressive dryness of the eyes and the&#xD;
      mouth. Furthermore, many patients experience extraglandular symptoms such as restricting&#xD;
      fatigue. Currently, biological agents have been introduced in various systemic autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. No biological agent&#xD;
      has yet been approved for the treatment of pSS. In an open-label study, we have shown that&#xD;
      abatacept treatment of pSS patients has promising results (Meiners et al., 2014). Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of subcutaneous abatacept treatment&#xD;
      in pSS in a larger and randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic inflammatory and&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disease with autoimmune features. pSS is characterised by a progressive&#xD;
      lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, notably the lacrimal and salivary glands.&#xD;
      The main clinical features are a progressive dryness of the eyes, mouth, vagina and skin.&#xD;
      Furthermore, various extraglandular manifestations may develop of which restricting fatigue&#xD;
      is the most common. Patients may be restricted in their activities and their participation in&#xD;
      society, resulting in a reduced health-related quality of life and an impaired socioeconomic&#xD;
      status. The latter results in lower employment rates and more disability as compared to the&#xD;
      general population. The estimated prevalence of pSS in the general population is between&#xD;
      0.5-2%, which makes pSS, after rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common systemic autoimmune&#xD;
      disease. Most of the traditional anti-rheumatic drugs used in RA and systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus have been tried in pSS with limited results. Currently, biological agents have&#xD;
      been introduced in various systemic autoimmune diseases. These biological agents enhance or&#xD;
      replace conventional immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast to RA and systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE), no biological agent has yet been approved for the treatment of pSS.&#xD;
      Abatacept is a fully human soluble co-stimulation modulator that selectively targets the&#xD;
      CD80/CD86:CD28 co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation, and T cell&#xD;
      dependent activation of B-cells. We have recently shown in a phase II open label study that&#xD;
      Abatacept treatment of pSS patients has promising efficacy results, as reflected by a&#xD;
      significant decrease in disease activity indices such as the EULAR Sjögrens Syndrome Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index and Patient Reported Index (ESSDAI and ESSPRI) (Meiners et al., 2014).&#xD;
      Importantly, we also have shown that Abatacept is safe and side effects are very limited in&#xD;
      pSS patients. For these reasons a larger and randomized clinical trial with Abatacept is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Primary: to evaluate efficacy of weekly subcutaneous (SC) administration of&#xD;
      Abatacept vs placebo on disease activity assessed with ESSDAI at in patients with pSS.&#xD;
      Secondary: to assess efficacy of Abatacept on clinical, functional, laboratory, subjective,&#xD;
      and histological parameters over 48 weeks in patients with pSS. To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      abatacept, by monitoring serious adverse events (SAE), adverse events (AE) related SAE and&#xD;
      AE, treatment discontinuation related to SAE and AE, and lab abnormalities over 48 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with pSS. Exploratory: to assess efficacy on laboratory parameters over 48 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with pSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The first stage is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase&#xD;
      III study to assess the efficacy and safety of Abatacept (weekly SC administration of 125 mg&#xD;
      Abatacept or placebo) in patients with pSS. The primary endpoint (ESSDAI) will be evaluated&#xD;
      at 24 weeks. The second stage is composed of a 24-week open-label period in which both&#xD;
      Abatacept and placebo treated patients will receive Abatacept for 24 weeks. The total study&#xD;
      duration will be 48 weeks where after the study will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 88 adult pSS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Weekly subcutaneous administration of 125 mg Abatacept up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main endpoints: The primary endpoint is the difference in ESSDAI score between the Abatacept&#xD;
      and the placebo group at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints are clinical, functional, laboratory,&#xD;
      subjective, and histological parameters and the prevalence of adverse events, treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation and laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
