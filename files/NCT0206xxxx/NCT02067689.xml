  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the influence of non-invasive brain stimulation on different&#xD;
      elements of cognitive function in healthy persons between the ages of 18-90 years. It will&#xD;
      specifically use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between certain brain structures and cognitive abilities, like attention, working memory,&#xD;
      visual search, etc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team conducting the research procedures will perform several tests.&#xD;
      Investigators will ask participants if participants are right or left handed, how far&#xD;
      participants went in school, their job, and a medical history including brain and nervous&#xD;
      system disorders, psychiatric disorders, heart related disorders, and other significant&#xD;
      disorders. Investigators will ask participants for their current medications. Investigators&#xD;
      will ask participants about their history of cognitive function. If participants are a woman&#xD;
      of child bearing potential, Investigators will perform a pregnancy test and the result must&#xD;
      be negative to receive stimulation. Prior to stimulation, Investigators will have&#xD;
      participants complete pre-stimulation computerized cognitive tests involving tasks where&#xD;
      participants are asked to respond to images or sounds presented by a computer. Investigators&#xD;
      will also collect measures of physiological function during the testing session, specifically&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, respiration rate, and pupillary response. These&#xD;
      will be measured using recording electrodes attached to the fingertip, arm, and chest and a&#xD;
      respiration band around the chest. A small camera will record changes in their pupil size.&#xD;
      Investigators will also collect measures of brain structure and function using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. Investigators will also ask participants to fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      describing their experience during each study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants decide to take part in this study, participants will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in up to four different testing sessions separated by at least 24 hours. In each of these&#xD;
      testing sessions, participants will be asked to receive either electrical stimulation or&#xD;
      placebo stimulation during different testing sessions. Placebo stimulation looks like and is&#xD;
      performed in the same way as electrical stimulation, but stimulation is stopped before it can&#xD;
      have an effect. Placebo stimulation is used in research studies to show what effect a&#xD;
      treatment has compared with receiving a lower level of stimulation or nothing at all. Studies&#xD;
      have shown, however, that about 1 in 3 persons who take a placebo have an effect, if only for&#xD;
      a short time. Participants will not know whether participants are receiving placebo&#xD;
      stimulation or electrical stimulation, but that information is available if it is needed. In&#xD;
      the remainder of the description of what will be done, both the electrical stimulation and&#xD;
      the placebos stimulation will be called &quot;stimulation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation will be completed with a Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator. This is an&#xD;
      experimental device that is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for any treatment. Participants will receive stimulation for up to 20 minutes. To perform the&#xD;
      stimulation, Investigators will either apply two salt-water soaked sponges to their head or&#xD;
      five smaller gel covered disk electrodes. Gel-covered disk electrodes are placed in specially&#xD;
      designed holders held in a cap that fits on their head. Caps are fitted to their head size&#xD;
      for comfort. Following the stimulation, Investigators will remove the sponges or electrodes&#xD;
      and have participants perform a series of computerized tests to assess their cognitive&#xD;
      ability. These involve tasks where participants will have to respond to images or sounds&#xD;
      presented by a computer screen or headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be asked to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brain&#xD;
      before, during, and after undergoing transcranial direct current stimulation. Investigators&#xD;
      will use an MRI safe Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator to perform stimulation and&#xD;
      evaluate how their brain responds to stimulation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a&#xD;
      procedure that allows doctors to look inside the body by using a scanner that sends out a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field and radio waves. This procedure is used routinely for medical care and&#xD;
      is very safe for most people, but participants will be monitored during the entire MRI scan&#xD;
      in case any problems occur. The risks of MRI are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet. Therefore, participants may not be able to&#xD;
      have the MRI if participants have any type of metal implanted in their body, for example, any&#xD;
      pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in their eyes, or certain types of heart&#xD;
      valves or brain aneurysm clips. Someone will ask participants questions about this before&#xD;
      participants have the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not much room inside the MRI scanner. Participants may be uncomfortable if&#xD;
      participants do not like to be in close spaces (&quot;claustrophobia&quot;). During the procedure,&#xD;
      participants will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system, and, in the&#xD;
      event of an emergency, participants can tell them to stop the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very&#xD;
      small number of patients. Participants will be given earplugs to reduce this risk.&#xD;
