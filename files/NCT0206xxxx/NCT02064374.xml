    <textblock>
      This study will be a phase 1, open label, parallel group, three period crossover study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of dolutegravir (DTG) on the steady state pharmacokinetics of metformin&#xD;
      and on the safety and tolerability of dolutegravir and metformin. Subjects will have a&#xD;
      screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, three treatment&#xD;
      periods, and a follow up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of the two treatment cohorts. Subjects will receive metformin 500&#xD;
      milligram (mg) after every 12 hours (q12h) for 5 days in Period 1; metformin 500 mg q12h plus&#xD;
      dolutegravir 50 mg after every 24 hours (q24h) (Cohort 1) or 50 mg q12h (Cohort 2) for 7 days&#xD;
      in Period 2; and metformin 500 mg q12h for 10 days in Period 3. There will be no washout&#xD;
      periods between treatments. All doses of study drug will be taken following a meal. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations will be collected during each period. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be&#xD;
      collected for metformin on the last day of each period and for dolutegravir on the last day&#xD;
      of Period 2.&#xD;
