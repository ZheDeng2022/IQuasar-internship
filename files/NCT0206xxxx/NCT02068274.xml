    <textblock>
      Opioids are an effective instrument for patients with acute and chronic pain. Their route of&#xD;
      administration ranges from transdermal to subcutaneous application through to Intravenous&#xD;
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of IV-PCA-pumps has considerable advantages including decreased delay in the&#xD;
      administration of opioids from the time requested, individual dose intervals, self -control&#xD;
      of their therapy, rapidity and ease of dose titration . These potential benefits, however are&#xD;
      balanced by the need for careful assessment of adverse effects, including decreased quality&#xD;
      of life because of the patient's sedation, constipation and possible episodes of bradypnoea&#xD;
      and desaturation, eventually leading to respiratory depression (RD) requiring treatment.&#xD;
      Often described safety features that help prevent overdosing are PCA bolus dose, delay, and&#xD;
      lockout interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the risk of serious, potentially life threatening complications by using IV-PCA&#xD;
      without a background infusion was described to be very low (0.24%) compared to other methods&#xD;
      of opioid delivery , adverse effects like worrying degrees of hypoxemia and bradypnoea do&#xD;
      occur and often remain undetected due to the lack of continuous monitoring. One of the&#xD;
      possible causes of patient harm are medication errors associated with PCA administration, a&#xD;
      common form of PCA errors, which is a significant source of preventable patient morbidity and&#xD;
      hospital resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual patient response to a particular dose of opioids depends on diagnosed or&#xD;
      unrecognized comorbidities. Clinical experience has shown that it is not possible to&#xD;
      prospectively identify all patients who may be at increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional opioid monitoring protocol may fail to detect frequent episodes of bradypnoea&#xD;
      and desaturation measured by the respiratory rate (RR) and Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen&#xD;
      (SpO2) because even at a low respiratory rate SpO2 is usually maintained, so that pulse&#xD;
      oxymetry might fail to detect respiratory deterioration, particularly if a patient is&#xD;
      receiving supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, continuous monitoring could be considered more sensitive, especially if it&#xD;
      contains the measurement of Partial Pressure of Carbon dioxide (PCO2), which is a good&#xD;
      parameter for monitoring ventilatory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'gold standard' method to measure the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)&#xD;
      is still the arterial blood gas analysis. But arterial sampling including catheterization or&#xD;
      intermittent arterial puncture is invasive and expensive and associated with pain and&#xD;
      discomfort for the patient. Therefore cutaneous carbon dioxide tension (PcCO2) measurement&#xD;
      was suggested to be used as a non-invasive surrogate measure of PaCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2, and tcPCO2, are important clinical parameters that should be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      each other. SpO2 reflects oxygenation, while tcPCO2 reflects ventilation; the first can still&#xD;
      be normal while the second may herald early changes in respiratory status. Capnography may&#xD;
      provide the earliest indication of opioid-induced respiratory depression. It is important to&#xD;
      monitor changes from a baseline tcPCO2 level. As the tcPCO2 level starts to increase, early&#xD;
      intervention and changes in medication can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to examine combined oxymetry and transcutaneous capnography using a&#xD;
      single earlobe sensor (V-Sign™, Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland) in chronic pain patients&#xD;
      treated with opioids where non-invasive monitoring of ventilation is needed because&#xD;
      ventilatory disturbances are suspected. This may, potentially, improve patient's quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

      1. Aim of study 1.1 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Opioids are an effective instrument for patients with acute and chronic pain. Their&#xD;
           route of administration ranges from transdermal to subcutaneous application through to&#xD;
           Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of IV-PCA-pumps has considerable advantages including decreased delay in the&#xD;
           administration of opioids from the time requested, individual dose intervals, self&#xD;
           -control of their therapy, rapidity and ease of dose titration . These potential&#xD;
           benefits, however are balanced by the need for careful assessment of adverse effects,&#xD;
           including decreased quality of life because of the patient's sedation, constipation and&#xD;
           possible episodes of bradypnoea and desaturation, eventually leading to respiratory&#xD;
           depression (RD) requiring treatment. Often described safety features that help prevent&#xD;
           overdosing are PCA bolus dose, delay, and lockout interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Even though the risk of serious, potentially life threatening complications by using&#xD;
           IV-PCA without a background infusion was described to be very low (0.24%) compared to&#xD;
           other methods of opioid delivery , adverse effects like worrying degrees of hypoxemia&#xD;
           and bradypnoea do occur and often remain undetected due to the lack of continuous&#xD;
           monitoring. One of the possible causes of patient harm are medication errors associated&#xD;
           with PCA administration, a common form of PCA errors, which is a significant source of&#xD;
           preventable patient morbidity and hospital resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           But not only patients with IV-PCA-pumps are at risk of harm, but all patients treated&#xD;
           with opioids (distinguished by their formulations; oral, dermal, intravenous,&#xD;
           short-acting, continuous-release) are due to the feared adverse effect of respiratory&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It can be caused by a self-potentiating &quot;vicious cycle&quot; which may result in respiratory&#xD;
           arrest: Hypoventilation impairs gas exchange, resulting in increased carbon dioxide,&#xD;
           decreased oxygen and pH (respiratory acidosis). In turn, suppression of the&#xD;
           chemoreceptor responses to increased carbon dioxide levels reduces the normally&#xD;
           protective central response which would increase breathing efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The individual patient response to a particular dose of opioids depends on diagnosed or&#xD;
           unrecognized comorbidities. Clinical experience has shown that it is not possible to&#xD;
           prospectively identify all patients who may be at increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conventional opioid monitoring protocol may fail to detect frequent episodes of&#xD;
           bradypnoea and desaturation measured by the respiratory rate (RR) and Saturation of&#xD;
           Peripheral Oxygen (SpO2) because even at a low respiratory rate SpO2 is usually&#xD;
           maintained, so that pulse oxymetry might fail to detect respiratory deterioration,&#xD;
           particularly if a patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, continuous monitoring could be considered more sensitive, especially if it&#xD;
           contains the measurement of Partial Pressure of Carbon dioxide (PCO2), which is a good&#xD;
           parameter for monitoring ventilatory function. As the American Society of&#xD;
           Anesthesiologists emphasizes, ventilation and oxygenation must be considered as separate&#xD;
           physiologic processes. Ventilatory function is monitored by PCO2 whereas oxygenation is&#xD;
           expressed through SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, even continuous monitoring of heart rate and SpO2 by pulse oxymetry is not a&#xD;
           substitute for monitoring respiratory rate (RR) and PCO2. By capnographic monitoring&#xD;
           patient's desaturation might be anticipated if a decrease in RR and thus rise of PCO2&#xD;
           level from baseline occurs. Hence, adjustment of medication doses can be made earlier&#xD;
           and serious adverse events may be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 'gold standard' method to measure the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide&#xD;
           (PaCO2) is still the arterial blood gas analysis. But arterial sampling including&#xD;
           catheterization or intermittent arterial puncture is invasive and expensive and&#xD;
           associated with pain and discomfort for the patient. Therefore cutaneous carbon dioxide&#xD;
           tension (PcCO2) measurement was suggested to be used as a non-invasive surrogate measure&#xD;
           of PaCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transcutaneous measurement of CO2 (tcPCO2) is based on the observation that this gas has&#xD;
           a high tissue solubility and diffusion through the skin. This permits the non-invasive&#xD;
           measurement of the arterial PCO2. But despite increasing interest, the role of PCO2 as&#xD;
           the real measure of respiratory function appears to be widely underestimated. The reason&#xD;
           for PCO2 playing only a minor role may be referred to different causes: For many years&#xD;
           measurement of tcPCO2 was inaccurate and impracticable with sensors being fragile and&#xD;
           expensive, requiring frequent calibration and changing of skin site of the sensor to&#xD;
           avoid thermal injury to the skin. But modern devices have features like automatic&#xD;
           calibration, shorter response and equilibration times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combined cutaneous capnography (tcPCO2) and oxymetry (SpO2) can now be gathered by a&#xD;
           single earlobe sensor. Based on the Severinghaus principle , tcPCO2 is measured by a&#xD;
           sensor with a heated surface electrode on the skin. The local hyperaemia induces an&#xD;
           increase of arterial blood in the dermal capillary bed under the sensor. The usefulness&#xD;
           of this method is limited in some clinical situations including profound peripheral&#xD;
           vasoconstriction or circulatory centralization in shock or skin edema. Chhajed et al.&#xD;
           could show a good agreement between values obtained by using combined oxymetry and&#xD;
           transcutaneous capnography with arterial blood gas analyses in a large study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In conclusion, SpO2, and tcPCO2, are important clinical parameters that should be used&#xD;
           in conjunction with each other. SpO2 reflects oxygenation, while tcPCO2 reflects&#xD;
           ventilation; the first can still be normal while the second may herald early changes in&#xD;
           respiratory status. Capnography may provide the earliest indication of opioid-induced&#xD;
           respiratory depression. It is important to monitor changes from a baseline tcPCO2 level.&#xD;
           As the tcPCO2 level starts to increase, early intervention and changes in medication can&#xD;
           be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study aims to examine combined oxymetry and transcutaneous capnography using&#xD;
           a single earlobe sensor (V-Sign™, Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland) in chronic pain&#xD;
           patients treated with opioids where non-invasive monitoring of ventilation is needed&#xD;
           because ventilatory disturbances are suspected. The Sentec Monitoring System is already&#xD;
           in use for years in clinical settings, for instance: Neonatology, Pneumology and&#xD;
           Surgery, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intention of this study is to prove the feasibility for using this sensor in a&#xD;
           hospital setting which may allow avoiding oversedation leading to decreased activity and&#xD;
           other troublesome adverse effects. This may, potentially, improve patient's quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           We want to show that continuous monitoring using combined transcutaneous capnography and&#xD;
           oxymetry allows for a better support for patients treated with opioids for chronic pain&#xD;
           regarding pain quality and possible adverse events. Furthermore we want to use this&#xD;
           study as a feasibility trial to generate new hypotheses for possible future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous monitoring of tcPCO2 and SPO2 may help to warrant for a better support of&#xD;
           patients with opioid administration by a minimal additional effort. In the end an&#xD;
           effective monitoring shall contribute to enhance therapy control and therefore increase&#xD;
           both patient's safety and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be used as a Feasibility Trial for possible future studies. Our primary&#xD;
      objective is to investigate whether continuous monitoring by using the SenTec Monitoring&#xD;
      System is feasible in patients with opioid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to consecutively recruit patients who need for their pain control the IV-PCA,&#xD;
      transdermal, oral or subcutaneous opioids and are hospitalized in the Hildegard Hospital in&#xD;
      Basel, Switzerland. Recruitment of patients will start June 2012 and will end as soon as 30&#xD;
      patients are recruited (at the latest in September 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients needing IV-PCA, subcutaneous, transdermal or oral Opioids for their pain control,&#xD;
      will be conventionally monitored during 24 hours after having filled out the informed consent&#xD;
      form. Care workers will record principal and secondary diagnosis, measure respiratory rate&#xD;
      (RR), note quantity and name of consumed opioids, record serious adverse events requesting&#xD;
      antagonists, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or death and inquire for common adverse&#xD;
      effects in opioid therapy such as sedation, pruritus, nausea/vomiting, dryness of the mouth,&#xD;
      dizziness, myoclonus, constipation, fatigue, sweating, confusion and hallucinations. All&#xD;
      patients will qualify their pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as well as&#xD;
      quantify their pain with the aid of a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subsequent 48h all patients will continuously be monitored by a single earlobe sensor&#xD;
      (SenTec Monitoring System) in addition to the measurements/ questionnaires described above.&#xD;
      Furthermore nurse's ratings of the additional time expense caused by the use of the SenTec&#xD;
      Monitoring System will be recorded using a NRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects 3.2 Recruitment of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with an IV-PCA and other application forms of opioids such as transdermal or&#xD;
      subcutaneous opioid-administration for chronic pain who are hospitalized in the Hospital&#xD;
      Hildegard, Basel, Switzerland, will be approached by a member of our study team. Patients are&#xD;
      not only terminal Patients but as well Patients that are hospitalized for adjustment of pain&#xD;
      medication and are going to be discharged. Participation in this study is voluntarily and the&#xD;
      participating subjects will not be advantaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capable of giving informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needing opioids (oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, IV-PCA) for pain control (opioid naïve&#xD;
           or patients on chronic opioid therapy ) 3.2 Subject exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No consent for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of power of judgment 3.3 Subject Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case a subject decides to discontinue our study for personal reasons, the withdrawal will&#xD;
      be documented on the CRF (case report form) of the patient and another patient will be&#xD;
      recruited to replace the study drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Measures and Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 SenTec Digital Monitoring System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SenTec Digital Monitoring System allows a continuous and non-invasive monitoring of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), functional oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate. The&#xD;
      portable patient monitor receives its signals over a cable adapted to a specific sensor&#xD;
      (V-Sign™ Sensor) and sends it to a remote monitoring station and secondary alarm surveillance&#xD;
      (V-CareNeT™). The signal will be forwarded additionally to a mobile application which is at&#xD;
      the time designed and developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined digital SaO2/PcCO2 sensor unifies the elements of an electrochemical&#xD;
      Severinghaus-type carbon dioxide tension sensor with a conventional, reflectance&#xD;
      2-wave-length pulse oxymetry which allows a noninvasive and continuous estimation of arterial&#xD;
      carbon dioxide tension and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method to measure CO2 potentiometrically by determining the pH of electrolyte layer&#xD;
      separated from the skin by a highly permeable membrane was described by Severinghaus and&#xD;
      Bradley. The sensor is warmed to a constant surface temperature of 42.0°C to improve local&#xD;
      arterialization and, hence, diminish the arterio-venous PCO2 difference and increase gas&#xD;
      diffusion. Regular recalibration is mandatory for optimal transcutaneous signals and is known&#xD;
      as a limiting factor. At this occasion skin surface will be inspected to avoid local&#xD;
      side-effects. Sensors can be safely kept continuously for periods of up to 8 h with minimal&#xD;
      risk of thermal skin injury. In case of further continuance in position the sensor will be&#xD;
      programmed to trigger an alarm message and to cool down to 39.0°C automatically after 15&#xD;
      minutes (a total of 8h 15 min) if the alarm hasn't been switched off in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subsequent analysis measurements will consecutively be downloaded from the SenTec Digital&#xD;
      Monitoring System using V-STATS™ PC Software. The maximum period of measuring will be 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of pain scales as the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is recommended for assessment of&#xD;
      pain intensity based on self- report. The NRS is an 11-point scale consisting of integers&#xD;
      from 0 (no pain) through 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Respondents then select the&#xD;
      single number that best represents their pain intensity. An advantage of NRS is that&#xD;
      incorrect responding does not appear to be associated with persons at risk for cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties such as some elderly individuals or persons on high doses of opioid analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore nurses ratings of the additional time expense by using the SenTec Monitoring&#xD;
      System will be gathered by using the NRS (0 = no additional effort, 10 = maximal additional&#xD;
      effort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common adverse effects of opioid therapy will be reported by asking the patients themselves&#xD;
      if they feel bothered by pruritus, nausea, dryness of the mouth, dizziness, myoclonus,&#xD;
      constipation, fatigue, sweating, confusion and hallucinations (answer yes/no). Depth of&#xD;
      sedation will be recorded by the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The McGill Pain Questionnaire was designed in 1975 for the use in pain patients to specify&#xD;
      sensory, affective and evaluative dimensions of subjective pain experience. It provides&#xD;
      quantitative information that can be treated statistically and is supposed to be sufficiently&#xD;
      sensitive to detect differences among different methods to relieve pain. In 1988 a German&#xD;
      version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Respiratory Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of respiratory status goes hand in hand with sedation assessment. The nurse should&#xD;
      watch the rise and fall of the patient's chest to determine the rate, depth, and regularity&#xD;
      of respirations. There is no consensus on definition of a clinically significant respiratory&#xD;
      depression. Clinical significance is featured by a decrease in rate and depth from patient's&#xD;
      baseline respiratory status. We define respiratory depression as a decrease of respiratory&#xD;
      rate on less than 8 breath per minute and/or PtcCO2 ≥ 6.0 kPa (≥45mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 Serious adverse events and complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events necessitating intervention such as the use of antagonists, positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or death will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7 Quantity of consumed opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantity of consumed opioids during measuring time will be recorded noted in [mg]&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.8 Advantage and disadvantage for nursing staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing staff will be asked to declare gain and further efforts caused by additional&#xD;
      monitoring using Sentec Monitoring System.&#xD;
&#xD;

      6 Study Management and Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Adherence to Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the approved protocol. In case of any&#xD;
      significant deviations from the study protocol the investigator will send an amendment for&#xD;
      further approval to the Ethical Committee EKBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Data Collection and Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect &quot;bed side&quot; data a computer generated paper sheet containing the name and date of&#xD;
      birth of the subject will be used. This data will be transferred to a CRF (case report form)&#xD;
      and in doing so rendered anonymous before statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
      Subsequently data transfer will be controlled by at least one person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Archiving and Data Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study-related records, such as CRFs, medical records, informed consent documents,&#xD;
      information regarding participants who discontinued, and other pertinent data will be&#xD;
      maintained and therefore retained as long as required by the applicable Swiss regulatory&#xD;
      requirements (10 Years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Direct Access to Original Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator (s) will provide the study related monitoring visits, audits and regulatory&#xD;
      inspections for direct access to all data acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Finances and Insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator declares that he has taken out an insurance policy for the total study&#xD;
      length, covering the participants in respect of the risks involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will receive no financial compensation for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Ethical Consideration 7.1 Subjects Information and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating subjects will receive a consent form describing the study to help the&#xD;
      subjects to make an informed consent about their participation in this study. Only after&#xD;
      signing the consent form the subject will be submitted to any study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This consent form that will be used is submitted with this protocol for approval by the EKBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Risks and benefits for study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aren't exposed to any risk by participating in this study. In case of upward trend&#xD;
      of the tcPCO2 detected by the SenTec Monitoring System or a decrease of the patient's&#xD;
      respiratory rate leading to a possible future respiratory depression, dosage of opioids may&#xD;
      be adjusted according to the responsible physician's prescription.&#xD;
