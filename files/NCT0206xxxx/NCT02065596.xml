      This is a phase I/II study of patients with sickle cell disease. It aims to find out if&#xD;
      people with sickle cell disease can be cured by changing their immune system before they have&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplants. Doctors will give patients a new drug (fludarabine) to see if&#xD;
      this drug changes patients immune system and reduces the patient's cells (host) from&#xD;
      rejecting donor cells (graft) after the patient gets a Hematopoietic (blood) stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after&#xD;
      treatment with fludarabine in adult patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s), in HSCT for SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the rates of disease-free and overall survival in both MSD and alternate&#xD;
           graft donor (MUD, haploidentical, or cord blood-derived) recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate fertility in matched sibling and alternate-donor graft recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate GVHD rates in MSD and Alternate Graft Donor recipients in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate cerebral, pulmonary, renal, and generalized vasculopathy before and after&#xD;
           HSCT in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis before and before HSCT in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Modulation of SCD Phenotype by Allogeneic Transplantation. Rigorous clinical follow-up&#xD;
           will be performed, per routine care, to evaluate those consequences of SCD that will be&#xD;
           modified by allogeneic transplantation in the short-term (4-12 weeks), in the&#xD;
           medium-term (12-24 weeks) and in the long-term (&gt;24 weeks). Short-term changes would&#xD;
           include disappearance of stress hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis; medium- and long-term&#xD;
           changes would include effects on pain, fertility (TSH, LH), cognition (routine cognitive&#xD;
           assessments), and end-organ damage (including urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios and&#xD;
           tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities, as indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with at least 10 and up to 25 patients. They will be given the lowest&#xD;
      starting dose of fludarabine. This is done to make sure it is safe. Researchers will watch&#xD;
      the patients during what is called the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period. Their safety will&#xD;
      be monitored by a Safety Monitoring Committee, which is made up of people who run research&#xD;
      studies. The study will not take new patients until the DLT period is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at least 3 of the 10 patients enrolled do not benefit, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      will be considered exceeded. After the DLT period is complete, patients will receive a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant from a genetically matched donor. Patients will be continued to be monitored&#xD;
      for a year after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prepare for the transplant patients will have to undergo the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an exchange transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a stem cell graft infusion from either a:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  perfectly matched sibling donor (called MSD),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  perfectly matched but unrelated donor (called MUD),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a half-matched related donor (called Haploidentical), or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a cord blood donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cytoxan (a type of chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fludarabine (you get this medicine a few weeks before transplant and again, as part of&#xD;
           the routine chemotherapy treatment). This is the main drug being studies in this&#xD;
           research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total body irradiation (also called TBI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tacrolimus, mycophenolate (MMF) and/or methotrexate (MTX). These drugs will weaken your&#xD;
           immune system. They are given to lower your chances of getting GVHD and rejecting the&#xD;
           donor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be in the study for approximately 14 months.&#xD;
