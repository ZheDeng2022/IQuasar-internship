    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that classic hallucinogens such as psilocybin can&#xD;
      facilitate behavior change in addictions such as alcohol dependence. The proposed&#xD;
      investigation is a multi-site, double-blind active-controlled trial (n = 180, 90 per group)&#xD;
      contrasting the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin to those of diphenhydramine in the&#xD;
      context of outpatient alcoholism treatment.&#xD;

      Two to four sites will participate in this study. Aims of the study are 1) to characterize&#xD;
      the acute effects of PO psilocybin 25 mg/70 kg, 30 mg/70 kg, and 40 mg/70 kg in alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients; 2) to evaluate the effect of psilocybin treatment on drinking outcomes&#xD;
      for 32 weeks after the first administration, relative to diphenhydramine control; 3) to test&#xD;
      whether or not characteristics of the drug administration session experiences mediate effects&#xD;
      of psilocybin on short-term (1 week) persisting effects and post-session drinking behavior,&#xD;
      4) to evaluate the explanatory value of changes in alcohol craving, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      motivation, and other psychological domains in accounting for the observed experimental&#xD;
      effect of psilocybin relative to diphenhydramine control, and 5) to evaluate pre-post changes&#xD;
      in drinking in participants after they receive psilocybin in the third session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of psychosocial treatment in the double-blind period will be 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      double-blind drug administration sessions will occur after 4 and 8 weeks. In the first&#xD;
      psilocybin session, a dose of 25 mg/70 kg will be administered. Depending on the response in&#xD;
      the first session, the dose for the second session may be increased to 30 mg/70 kg or 40&#xD;
      mg/70 kg, or held at 25mg/70kg. The dose of diphenhydramine will start at 50 mg, and may be&#xD;
      increased to 100 mg or held at 50 mg in the second session, depending on response in the&#xD;
      first session. Following completion of the double-blind period (34 weeks after randomization)&#xD;
      all participants who meet interim safety criteria will be offered an additional session in&#xD;
      which psilocybin will be administered. The drug will be administered during 8-hour sessions&#xD;
      in an outpatient setting under close medical and psychiatric monitoring. The drug&#xD;
      administration sessions will occur in the context of an extended version of Motivational&#xD;
      Enhancement Therapy (Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action, META) with the addition of&#xD;
      standardized preparation before and debriefing and follow-up after the psilocybin&#xD;
      administration sessions. Extensive screening and baseline assessment will be completed,&#xD;
      including thorough safety screening and assessment of participant characteristics that could&#xD;
      potentially moderate treatment response. Within-session and short-term persisting effects&#xD;
      will be assessed. Drinking outcomes and changes in several potential mediators of treatment&#xD;
      effect, including motivation, self-efficacy, craving, depression, anxiety, and spiritual&#xD;
      dimensions of the experience, will be measured until 50 weeks after the first drug&#xD;
      administration session, for a total of 54 weeks from the initiation of treatment.&#xD;
