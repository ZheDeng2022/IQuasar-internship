    <textblock>
      Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain. Studies with rodents&#xD;
      indicate that levels of KYNA can impact levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate and&#xD;
      dopamine. One way to reliably increase KYNA levels is by ingesting the amino acid tryptophan.&#xD;
      Tryptophan is a normal part of the human diet. Tryptophan gets metabolized/changed to other&#xD;
      chemicals in the body- including KYNA. By giving people 6 grams of tryptophan, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to increase the KYNA level in a controlled way. The investigators&#xD;
      will then be able to study the effects of KYNA on neurotransmitters by using cognitive tests&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance imaging techniques (measuring brain activity and brain chemistry using&#xD;
      the MRI magnet). They will test people using tryptophan and also using a placebo to look for&#xD;
      differences. The investigators will test healthy controls and people with schizophrenia to&#xD;
      look for differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence to suggest that disturbances in the kynurenine pathway may be&#xD;
      related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several post-mortem studies have documented&#xD;
      specific abnormalities in the kynurenine pathway, including increased levels of kynurenine&#xD;
      and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (1-4).&#xD;
      Increased levels of kynurenine and KYNA have also been observed in the cerebral spinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) of people with this illness (5). In addition, post-mortem studies have documented&#xD;
      changes in key enzymes, including increased expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (2, 6)&#xD;
      (TDO), which converts tryptophan to kynurenine, and reduced activity of kynurenine&#xD;
      3-monooxygenase (KMO) (4), which may shift metabolism towards enhanced KYNA formation.&#xD;
      Finally, a number of genetic studies have implicated the KYNA pathway in this disease. Wonodi&#xD;
      et al. (7) found decreased KMO gene expression in the frontal eye field of people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and Holtze et al. (8) recently reported an association between a KMO SNP and&#xD;
      CSF levels of KYNA. Notably, although the exact mechanism underlying the KP impairment in&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia is unknown, immune and stress mechanisms have been implicated&#xD;
      (7,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased KYNA may have a number of adverse consequences of importance in schizophrenia. In&#xD;
      particular, KYNA is an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic and NMDA glutamate receptors.&#xD;
      Dysfunctions of these receptors have been linked to the cognitive impairments and symptom&#xD;
      manifestations observed in people with schizophrenia. The purpose of the proposed project is&#xD;
      to examine the impact of increased brain KYNA on performance of cognitive tasks and related&#xD;
      neuroimaging measures in people with DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder patients and healthy controls. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      secondarily investigate the relationship of peripheral inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      glucocorticoid levels as part of the HPA stress axis to examine relationships and shift to a&#xD;
      Type 2 immune response in schizophrenia. Using tryptophan loading to increase KYNA levels,&#xD;
      the study will test the hypothesis, based on complementary preliminary studies in rodents,&#xD;
      that disease-related cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia are preferentially&#xD;
      susceptible to (further) elevations in KYNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that tryptophan-induced elevations in brain KYNA levels will:&#xD;
      1) acutely impair performance on measures of verbal and visual memory, attention, working&#xD;
      memory, and processing speed in people with schizophrenia; 2) alter dorsolateral-hippocampal&#xD;
      activation and connectivity, which underlies the performance of the relational memory task;&#xD;
      and 3) decrease mPFC MRS measures of glutamate, consistent with preclinical microdialysis&#xD;
      data. In an exploratory framework, the investigators hypothesize that increased brain KYNA&#xD;
      levels alter default network activation and connectivity, an effect which may be mediated by&#xD;
      the action of KYNA on α7 nicotinic and/or NMDA receptors. The investigators will also&#xD;
      investigate the extent to which cytokine and HPA axis peripheral measures are related to the&#xD;
      effect of tryptophan-induced elevated KYNA levels on cognitive performance and fMRI and MRS&#xD;
      measures. Comparisons with results from healthy controls will determine if participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia have an aberrant or exaggerated response to increased KYNA levels.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The order in which participants received either the tryptophan or placebo was randomized. The HVLT was administered 90 minutes prior to treatment and 4 hours post treatment. There were at least two weeks between the challenge days.</time_frame>
    <description>The following assessment was used to assess the outcome measure: the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). HVLT total scores range from 0 to 36. In order to conduct group comparisons, the HVLT raw total scores are converted to a t-score (range: -10 to 80). The mean t-scores for each condition are below (see outcome measure data table). Higher scores represent better performance. Participants performed the same task before pre- and post-treatment with Tryptophan and again with placebo (2 weeks between conditions). Change in scores pre- and post-treatment were compared between the Tryptophan and placebo conditions.</description>

        <title>Change in Verbal Memory Scores From Baseline to 4 Hours Post-Treatment</title>
        <description>The following assessment was used to assess the outcome measure: the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). HVLT total scores range from 0 to 36. In order to conduct group comparisons, the HVLT raw total scores are converted to a t-score (range: -10 to 80). The mean t-scores for each condition are below (see outcome measure data table). Higher scores represent better performance. Participants performed the same task before pre- and post-treatment with Tryptophan and again with placebo (2 weeks between conditions). Change in scores pre- and post-treatment were compared between the Tryptophan and placebo conditions.</description>
        <time_frame>The order in which participants received either the tryptophan or placebo was randomized. The HVLT was administered 90 minutes prior to treatment and 4 hours post treatment. There were at least two weeks between the challenge days.</time_frame>
