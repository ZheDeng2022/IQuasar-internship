  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to prospectively evaluate a group of patients with shaft&#xD;
      compound fracture of the tibia, treated with a biplanar external fixator or locked&#xD;
      intramedullary reamed nail. The investigators evaluate the quality of life, bone healing and&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      68 patients will be followed for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As inclusion criterion, the investigators considered those with shaft compound fracture of&#xD;
      the tibia (occurring two inches below the knee and two inches above the ankle), that per the&#xD;
      classification Gustillo and Anderson were grades I, II, and IIIA, in patients with a mature&#xD;
      skeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of extensive skin lesions and soft tissue or arterial injury requiring surgical&#xD;
      repair (Grades IIIB and C) in the initial care, other fractures with the exception of the&#xD;
      fibula, or the presence of wounds with signs of infection in the period between the accident&#xD;
      and definitive surgery, were used as exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated in two ways, biplanar external fixator (Group I) and locked&#xD;
      intramedullary reamed nail in the tibia (Group II), being divided into these groups by simple&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During initial care in the emergency room, antibiotic prophylaxis, cleaning, debridement, and&#xD;
      external splinting of the fracture were performed by staff on duty. There was no interference&#xD;
      with respect to the type of assembly to be used in the initial care, leaving the doctor on&#xD;
      duty free to use the type of external fixators which he is most used to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients remained hospitalized and received first-generation cephalosporin and dressing of&#xD;
      the wound daily. In the 4th to the 7th postoperative day after the initial procedure, the&#xD;
      patient underwent another surgery to reassemble the biplanar external fixation or to convert&#xD;
      to the locked intramedullary reamed nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External fixation consists of the biplanar assembly with six Schanz pins of six millimeters.&#xD;
      The placement of these follows the sequence: two proximal to the fracture in different planes&#xD;
      and two distal similar to the first. The investigators performed reduction and placement of&#xD;
      two bars, one medial and one lateral. Assessed by radiography, two more pins were then&#xD;
      introduced into the medial rod, ending with the fixation of a tube-to-tube rod at the level&#xD;
      of the fracture. For fixation by locked intramedullary reamed nail, the access path of&#xD;
      introduction used was through the patellar tendon, with the knee flexed at 100 degrees on a&#xD;
      radiotransparent table.&#xD;
