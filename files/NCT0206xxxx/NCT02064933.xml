  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare serious medical condition that causes problems&#xD;
      both with the immune system and with easy bruising and bleeding. The immune abnormalities&#xD;
      cause patients with WAS to be very susceptible to infections. Depending on the specific type&#xD;
      of primary immune deficiency diseases, there are effective treatments, including antibiotics,&#xD;
      cellular therapy and gene therapy, but studies of large numbers of patients are needed to&#xD;
      determine the full range of causes, natural history, or the best methods of treatment for&#xD;
      long term success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter study combines retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional analyses of&#xD;
      the transplant experiences for patients with WAS who have already received HCT since 1990, or&#xD;
      who will undergo Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) during the study period. The&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective portions of the study will address the impact of a number of&#xD;
      pre and post-transplant factors on post-transplant disease correction and ultimate benefit&#xD;
      from HCT and the cross-sectional portion of the study will assess the benefit of HCT 2 years&#xD;
      post-HCT in consenting surviving patients.&#xD;
