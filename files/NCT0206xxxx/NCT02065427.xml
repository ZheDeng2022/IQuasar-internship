      The purpose of this study is to determine wether a multi-factor intervention involving the&#xD;
      primary caregiver of a dependent patient, with the goal of improving his or her social and&#xD;
      family support and carried out by the professionals of the patient's regular PHCT, will&#xD;
      decrease the burden and increase quality of life for the primary caregiver.&#xD;

      Objective: To assess whether an intervention designed to improve the social support for&#xD;
      caregivers effectively decreases caregivers burden and improves their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Controlled, multicentre, community intervention trial, with patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers randomized to the intervention or control group according to their assigned&#xD;
      Primary Health Care Team (PHCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area: Primary Health Care network (9 PHCTs). Study participants: Primary informal&#xD;
      caregivers of patients receiving home health care from participating PHCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Required sample size is 282 caregivers (141 from PHCTs randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      group and 141 from PHCTs randomized to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: a) PHCT professionals: standardized training to implement caregivers&#xD;
      intervention. b) Caregivers: 1 individualized counselling session, 1 family session, and 4&#xD;
      educational group sessions conducted by participating PHCT professionals; in addition to&#xD;
      usual home health care visits, periodic telephone follow-up contact and unlimited telephone&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Caregivers and dependent patients: usual home health care, consisting of bimonthly&#xD;
      scheduled visits, follow-up as needed, and additional attention upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Dependent variables: Caregiver burden (short-form Zarit test), caregivers&#xD;
      social support (Medical Outcomes Study), and caregiver reported quality of life (SF-12)&#xD;
      Independent variables: a) Caregiver: sociodemographic data, Goldberg Scale, Apgar family&#xD;
      questionnaire, Holmes and Rahe Psychosocial Stress Scale, number of chronic diseases. b)&#xD;
      Dependent patient: sociodemographic data, level of dependency (Barthel Index), cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (Pfeiffer test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the intervention intended to improve social and family support is effective in reducing&#xD;
      the burden on primary informal caregivers of dependent patients, this model can be readily&#xD;
      applied throughout usual PHCT clinical practice.&#xD;
