      This is a pilot study evaluating the effect of hydroxytyrosol, a component of olive oil, on&#xD;
      mammographic density in women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Participants will&#xD;
      take hydroxytyrosol orally once daily for 1 year. Breast density as determined by mammography&#xD;
      and the safety/toxicity of hydroxytyrosol will be assessed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female aged ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Elevated risk of breast cancer as defined by at least one of the following categories&#xD;
             and have declined tamoxifen and/or raloxifene therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal, or lobular&#xD;
                  hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A known deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, or TP53. (Note: The&#xD;
                  participant must be a documented carrier to meet this criterion. If there is a&#xD;
                  known mutation in a hereditary breast cancer susceptibility gene in a&#xD;
                  participant's family member, the participant herself must have undergone genetic&#xD;
                  testing as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines to be eligible&#xD;
                  per this criterion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Modified Gail/CARE model risk at 5 years ≥ 1.67%. (Note: Risk models are to be&#xD;
                  used only if there is no known previous diagnosis of resected ductal carcinoma in&#xD;
                  situ [DCIS] or LCIS and there is no known deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2,&#xD;
                  PTEN, or TP53)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. 10% or more probability of BRCA mutation by BRCAPRO or similar model&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have at least one breast available for imaging and biopsy. A previously&#xD;
             irradiated breast (i.e., for resected DCIS) is not evaluable for breast imaging or&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Allow for submission of core needle breast material for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Baseline mammogram performed within 90 days prior to study entry, done on a digital&#xD;
             mammography machine, that are reported as normal or benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline mammographic density &gt; 10% based upon the classification system (2 = 11-50%,&#xD;
             &quot;scattered fibroglandular densities&quot;; 3 = 51-75%, heterogeneously dense; 4 = &gt;75%,&#xD;
             extremely dense). Women with a baseline mammographic density of ≤ 10% (1 = ≤10%,&#xD;
             breasts are almost entirely fat) will not be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior anticoagulant therapy use is allowed provided therapy is discontinued at least 7&#xD;
             days prior to the breast biopsy in order to reduce the risk of bleeding. For&#xD;
             participants who have taken an anticoagulation within the past 7 days, international&#xD;
             normalized ratio must be ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal and prothrombin&#xD;
             time and partial thromboplastin time ≤ ULN prior to the breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must agree to use effective consistent contraception. Hormone-based birth control&#xD;
             (pills, patches, or shots) is allowed. Hormone replacement therapy is not allowed for&#xD;
             postmenopausal participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must not participate in any other clinical trial for the treatment or prevention of&#xD;
             cancer unless they are no longer receiving the intervention and are in the follow-up&#xD;
             phase only. Participants must also agree not to join such a trial while participating&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. DCIS or previous invasive ductal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer and in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior tamoxifen or raloxifene use in the past 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Bilateral breast implants. Prior breast reduction surgery is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Mammograms that are reported as suspicious.&#xD;
