      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean section (C/S) is usually performed under spinal with preservative free morphine for&#xD;
      pain relief, but the investigators have a severe shortage of this formulation of morphine.&#xD;
      Hydromorphone is a narcotic which acts peripherally and centrally to decrease pain. It has&#xD;
      been used in spinals for postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic&#xD;
      pain. No randomized controlled studies have evaluated intrathecal (IT) hydromorphone for post&#xD;
      C/S pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down sequential&#xD;
      allocation method1,2 to find the best dose of IT hydromorphone that provides pain relief&#xD;
      following C/S. Patients will be given a morphine PCA pump for additional pain relief. Our&#xD;
      first patient will receive 200 mcg of IT hydromorphone. Pain, nausea, and itching will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following the C/S via numeric rating scales; vomiting and&#xD;
      morphine use per hour will be recorded. Success will be a median morphine usage of less than&#xD;
      or equal to 1mg/hour in the following 16 hours. If a success, the next patient will be given&#xD;
      10 mcg less IT hydromorphone; if a failure, she will receive 10 mcg more. The study will end&#xD;
      after 5 successes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to find the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for pain relief&#xD;
      following C/S. The secondary objectives are to define the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      hydromorphone's side effects and determine the duration of analgesia.&#xD;

      SpecificAims Cesarean section (C/S) is usually performed under spinal anesthesia with&#xD;
      preservative free morphine added for pain relief, but currently the investigators have a&#xD;
      severe shortage of this formulation of morphine. Hydromorphone is a narcotic which has been&#xD;
      used in spinals for acute postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic&#xD;
      pain. The investigators hypothesize that a dose between 25 and 200 mcg of IT hydromorphone&#xD;
      will provide pain relief for at least 16 hours following C/S, with the need for minimal&#xD;
      rescue medication, and therefore may be a reasonable alternative to IT morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance Cesarean section is usually performed under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      using bupivacaine. Intrathecal preservative free morphine is often added to decrease&#xD;
      postoperative pain for 12-24 hours with only the need for minor rescue medication (a&#xD;
      significant intravenous and oral opioid sparing effect). This allows earlier mobilization and&#xD;
      interaction with family/infant of these hypercoagulable patients. With the critical shortage&#xD;
      of this formulation of morphine, we must find an alternative medication. Hydromorphone is a&#xD;
      narcotic which acts peripherally and centrally to decrease pain. It has been used in spinal&#xD;
      anesthetics for acute postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic pain.&#xD;
      Currently hydromorphone is not approved for intrathecal administration by the FDA, but pain&#xD;
      practitioners commonly prescribe hydromorphone for intrathecal pumps and have so for years.&#xD;
      The most recent Poly Analgesic Consensus Conference (PACC) of 2012 included IT hydromorphone&#xD;
      as an acceptable opioid for chronic use. Its inclusion for the management of neuropathic and&#xD;
      nociceptive pain infers hydromorphone's relative neurologic safety, as it is used in much&#xD;
      higher doses than for cesarean section. The investigators reviewed the literature to learn if&#xD;
      IT hydromorphone has been used for post C/S pain relief, and if so, at what dose. A&#xD;
      retrospective chart review comparing IT hydromorphone to fentanyl after C/S and a case report&#xD;
      of IT hydromorphone for a repeat C/S were all the investigators found.3,4 No randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will find the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for pain relief following cesarean&#xD;
      section as well as delineate the incidence and severity of side effects and how long the drug&#xD;
      lasts. This information is critical as no other viable alternatives currently exist to&#xD;
      replace IT morphine in this capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies/Progress Report&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spinal anesthetic including the IT hydromorphone will be performed by a competent&#xD;
      anesthesia resident or attending (residents on the obstetric anesthesia service, the&#xD;
      principal investigator, or one of the co-investigators). Our C/S rate is about 31% of 2100&#xD;
      deliveries per year and most (&gt;80%) are done under spinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down sequential&#xD;
      allocation method (continual reassessment)1,2 to find the best dose of IT hydromorphone that&#xD;
      provides pain relief following C/S. Spinal anesthetic containing the specified dose of IT&#xD;
      hydromorphone will be administered in the OR by the anesthesia resident or attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, the first patient will be assigned to a dose of 200 mcg of IT&#xD;
      hydromorphone. Although the dose of IT hydromorphone equivalent to that of IT morphine for&#xD;
      post cesarean section pain is not known, some sources suggest that 50 - 100 mcg of IT&#xD;
      hydromorphone may be similar to 100 - 200 mcg of IT morphine5-8. After preliminary&#xD;
      observations using varying doses of IT hydromorphone for post C/S analgesia, the&#xD;
      investigators observed that average and median morphine consumption in the following 16 hours&#xD;
      was not markedly decreased until a dose of 200 mcg IT hydromorphone was reached (40&#xD;
      observational patients to date, no increased side effects). The investigators now use this&#xD;
      dose routinely on labor and delivery so the investigators have chosen this as a starting&#xD;
      dose. The spinal anesthetic will also include 15mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine. All patients&#xD;
      will be provided with a morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump in the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for additional pain relief. At 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours&#xD;
      following the C/S, the patient will rate her pain, degree of nausea, and itching with verbal&#xD;
      numeric rating scales, (pain: 0 - 10, nausea and itching: 0 - 5) and the investigators will&#xD;
      record the incidence of vomiting. These verbal numeric rating scales are commonly used at&#xD;
      Thomas Jefferson for any patient using IV PCA pumps for postoperative pain. The investigators&#xD;
      will also obtain a (validated) &quot;quality of recovery scale&quot; from each patient. Standard&#xD;
      nursing orders include monitoring respiratory rate every 1 hour for 6 hours, then every 2&#xD;
      hours for 6 hours, for signs of respiratory depression, use of pulse oximetry, and&#xD;
      administration of naloxone if needed. These orders are currently standard for all patients&#xD;
      receiving IT preservative free morphine and are in an order set in Jeff Chart. The PCA pump&#xD;
      will be queried the next day to evaluate the number of attempts and actual use of morphine in&#xD;
      the first 16 hours postoperatively. The data will be compiled and analyzed by our&#xD;
      statistician. Success will be defined as a median dose of less than or equal to 1mg/hour of&#xD;
      morphine usage in the following 16 postoperative hours. If a patient is determined to be a&#xD;
      success, the next patient will be assigned to a dose of IT hydromorphone that is 10 mcg less&#xD;
      than the previous patient. (If the first patient is a success, the second patient will&#xD;
      receive 190 mcg of IT hydromorphone). If a patient is deemed a failure, the next patient will&#xD;
      receive a dose of IT hydromorphone that is 10 mcg higher than the previous patient. (If the&#xD;
      first patient is a failure, the second patient will receive 210 mcg of IT hydromorphone). Our&#xD;
      goal is to stop the study when the investigators get 5 points of success using the lowest&#xD;
      concentration of IT hydromorphone resulting in a median dose of less than or equal to 1mg/hr&#xD;
      of morphine consumption in the 16 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down&#xD;
      sequential allocation method of Dixon and Massey.1,2 On the basis of previous non-probability&#xD;
      sequential dosing studies with binary outcomes (success vs failure), the investigators&#xD;
      estimate on enrolling 40-50 patients.9-11 Using the referenced studies, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate a minimum of 10 independent negative-positive up-and-down deflections in the study.&#xD;
      Our goal is to stop the study when the investigators get 5 points of success using the lowest&#xD;
      concentration of IT hydromorphone resulting in less than or equal to 1mg/hr of morphine&#xD;
      consumption for 16 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS&#xD;
      software, Version 21.0 (IBM Corporation). The continuous data will be reported as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD). Tests of significance include the t test for independent samples,&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-parametric data and Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for&#xD;
      frequency count data. Repeated measurements (pain scores, nausea scores) will be analyzed by&#xD;
      repeated measure analysis of variance where normally distributed, with further paired&#xD;
      comparisons at each time interval performed using the t-test. A P value &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered significant. A dose response curve will also be created to determine the effective&#xD;
      dose in 95% of patients (ED95) and effective dose in 50% of patients (ED50) for the patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators would like to enroll at least 40 - 50 patients as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PCA pump attempts and usage for 16 hours, pain medication adjuncts used, verbal numeric&#xD;
           rating scores for nausea, itching and pain, incidence of vomiting, and respiratory rate&#xD;
           (recorded every one hour) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will be approached if she meets inclusion criteria when she is admitted to&#xD;
           the labor floor on the morning of her scheduled C/S. The study will be explained to her,&#xD;
           the possible risks, benefits, and alternatives will be discussed, she will be given the&#xD;
           opportunity to ask questions and if she agrees, the consent will be signed. The dose of&#xD;
           IT hydromorphone will be determined and made up by our statistician physician. The&#xD;
           spinal anesthetic will be administered to the patient in the operating room and the C/S&#xD;
           will proceed as usual. Data will be collected over the next 16 hours according to the&#xD;
           above research design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risks of any narcotic medication include analgesia, drowsiness, mental clouding, changes&#xD;
           in mood, euphoria or dysphoria, respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased&#xD;
           gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure,&#xD;
           increased biliary pressure, pinpoint constriction of the pupils, increased&#xD;
           parasympathetic activity and transient hyperglycemia. There is also the risk that the&#xD;
           study drug is ineffective at controlling post C/S pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standard nursing orders will include monitoring respiratory rate every 1 hour for 6&#xD;
           hours, then every 2 hours for 6 hours, for signs of respiratory depression, use of pulse&#xD;
           oximetry, and administration of naloxone if needed. These orders are currently standard&#xD;
           for all patients receiving IT preservative free morphine and are in an order set in Jeff&#xD;
           Chart. They allow early recognition of and/or minimize the risk of respiratory&#xD;
           depression should it occur. Also, the dosages the investigators will use are well below&#xD;
           documented safe doses of this drug for the IT route. All patients will be provided with&#xD;
           a morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump in the postanesthesia care unit&#xD;
           (PACU) for additional pain relief whether or not the study drug is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential benefit of the study is pain relief in the postoperative period following C/S&#xD;
           (Our usual medication is currently unavailable or in critically limited supply).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The side effect profiles for our standard drug, IT morphine and the study drug IT&#xD;
           hydromorphone are similar. Delayed respiratory depression and itching are more notable&#xD;
           with IT morphine than described with IT hydromorphone so this may be beneficial. The&#xD;
           duration of action of IT hydromorphone may not be as long as that of IT morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study poses minimal risk. This is a dose finding study. The dosages the investigators&#xD;
      will use are well below documented safe doses of this drug for the IT route.&#xD;
