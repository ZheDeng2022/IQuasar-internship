  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In mouse models and in patients, expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on various&#xD;
      cancers has been correlated with aggressive biological behavior, including increased rates&#xD;
      and certain sites of metastasis, and decreased survival. Plerixafor (Mozobil ; Genzyme;&#xD;
      Cambridge, MA) has been identified as a specific inhibitor of CXCR4, and it is currently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a stem-cell mobilizing agent in combination&#xD;
      with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Our group has recently shown that plerixafor can be labeled with the&#xD;
      positron-emitting radionuclide copper-64((64)Cu) to form (64)Cu-plerixafor, which can be used&#xD;
      to visualize CXCR4-positive tumor xenografts in mice using small-animal positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET). Determining CXCR4 expression in tumors using (64)Cu-plerixafor and&#xD;
      PET/computerized tomography (CT) scanning could be useful in predicting tumor behavior and&#xD;
      responses to current and experimental therapies, including therapies targeting CXCR4, which&#xD;
      could lead to more effective personalized cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study s primary objective is to evaluate (64)Cu-plerixafor as an imaging agent for&#xD;
      quantifying CXCR4 expression in subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) with&#xD;
      cancer; at least 1 detectable solid tumor of greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter found&#xD;
      outside of the lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, gallbladder, kidney, bladder, and brain; and&#xD;
      preexisting biopsies of the tumors obtained since the first detection of the current&#xD;
      occurrence/recurrence of disease. The secondary objectives are to correlate (64)Cu-plerixafor&#xD;
      standardized uptake value in the target lesion with the level of CXCR4 expression detected&#xD;
      via immunohistochemistry and to calculate human dosimetry for (64)Cu-plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preexisting tumor biopsies from less than or equal to 75 subjects recruited from the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute and the Georgetown University Hospital will be evaluated for CXCR4&#xD;
      expression via immunohistochemistry. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will continue&#xD;
      onto the study. Five subjects with CXCR4-positive tumor biopsies will be administered an&#xD;
      initial intravenous infusion of (64)Cu-plerixafor (8 +/-0.8 mCi ; 0.48+/- 0.048 rem; not to&#xD;
      exceed 5 microg of (64)Cu -plerixafor) over 2 minutes. They will then undergo an initial&#xD;
      low-dose transmission CT scan followed by 3 consecutive torso PET scans as soon as practical&#xD;
      after the infusion, and 2 additional PET/CT scans at 4 hours +/- 1 hour and 24 hours +/- 2&#xD;
      hours post-infusion. Human dosimetry will be calculated based on these results, and a maximum&#xD;
      dose will be used, not to exceed the calculated limit of a total effective dose of 5 rem, or&#xD;
      the radiation exposure limit for each organ. The remaining subjects with CXCR4-positive&#xD;
      (n=15) and CXCR4-negative (n=5) tumor biopsies will be administered 64Cu-plerixafor at the&#xD;
      same, or a newly calculated dose, and will undergo 1 PET/CT scan between 1 and 4 hours&#xD;
      post-infusion, depending on the dosimetry results. All subjects will undergo one&#xD;
      comprehensive final study visit between study days 19 and 23 (11-17 days after injection with&#xD;
      (64)Cu -plerixafor). Additionally, blood will be collected 2 more times between study days&#xD;
      13-16 and study days 26-30 to measure blood cell counts.&#xD;

      cancer; at least 1 detectable solid tumor of greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in diameter&#xD;
      found outside of the vertebral bodies, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and bladder; and tissue&#xD;
      sample(s) of the tumors obtained since the first detection of the current&#xD;

      standardized uptake value in the target lesion with the level of CXCR4 expression detected&#xD;

&#xD;
      Tumor samples from less than or equal to75 subjects recruited from the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute and the Georgetown University Hospital will be evaluated for CXCR4 expression via&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. With the exception of subjects with adrenocortical carcinoma,&#xD;
      evaluation of tissue for expression of CXCR4 will be required before PET scanning. Subjects&#xD;
      who meet the eligibility criteria will continue onto the study. Five subjects with&#xD;
      adrenocortical carcinoma and/or CXCR4-positive tumor samples will be administered an initial&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of 64Cu-plerixafor (up to 8+0.8 mCi; 0.48+0.048 rem; not to exceed 5 g&#xD;
      64Cu-plerixafor) at Day 0. They will then undergo an initial low-dose transmission CT scan&#xD;
      followed by 3 consecutive torso PET scans as soon as practical after the infusion, and 2&#xD;
      additional PET/CT scans at 4 hours +/- 1 hour and 24 hours +/- 3 hours post-infusion. Human&#xD;
      dosimetry will be calculated based on these results, and the dose may be adjusted, not to&#xD;
      exceed the calculated limit of a total effective dose of 5 rem, or the radiation exposure&#xD;
      limit for each organ. The remaining subjects will be administered 64Cu-plerixafor at the&#xD;
      same, or a newly calculated dose, and will undergo 1 PET/CT scan between 1 and 4 hours&#xD;
      post-infusion, depending on the dosimetry results. All subjects will undergo an assessment at&#xD;
      the NIH or by phone on study Day 14 3. Additionally, blood will be collected 3 more times at&#xD;
      Day 7 2, Day 14 3 and Day 21 3 to measure blood cell counts, and urine collected once more at&#xD;
      Day 7 2.&#xD;
