      The guiding questions for this study are: can a U.S. adaptation of a successful Scandinavian&#xD;
      approach (TIPS) to early detection substantially reduce the duration of untreated psychosis&#xD;
      (DUP) and improve outcomes beyond an established first-episode service (FES)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether an early detection intervention can reduce DUP in the US, as&#xD;
           compared to usual detection. Early detection (ED) will be implemented in one US&#xD;
           community (New Haven, CT), and usual detection efforts will continue in another (Boston,&#xD;
           MA). DUP will be measured at admission to the corresponding first-episode services (STEP&#xD;
           &amp; PREP) in each community, over one year before and throughout ED implementation. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that DUP will be reduced significantly in the early detection&#xD;
           site compared to the usual detection site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary aim is to determine whether DUP reduction can augment the outcomes of&#xD;
           established FES on outcomes in the U.S. The investigators will measure symptoms,&#xD;
           functioning and engagement with treatment at entry and over 1 year at each site. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that shorter DUP at one FES (STEP) will predict reduced&#xD;
           distress and illness severity at entry and better early outcomes at STEP compared to&#xD;
           PREP.&#xD;

      Early detection, or reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) can substantially&#xD;
      ameliorate the distress and disability caused by psychotic illnesses. The TIPS project in&#xD;
      Scandinavia used a combination of public and targeted education campaigns coupled with rapid&#xD;
      availability of comprehensive services to improve the identification, referral and early&#xD;
      treatment of psychotic illness. By targeting the dual 'bottlenecks' of inadequate mental&#xD;
      health literacy and delayed access to effective treatment, TIPS significantly reduced DUP2&#xD;
      and experimentally demonstrated improved clinical presentations and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective service models for new onset psychosis exist in the U.S. Multi-element specialty&#xD;
      'first-episode' services (FES), highlighted in this FOA, provide care that is adapted to the&#xD;
      specific needs of younger patients and their families and can improve symptoms and functional&#xD;
      outcomes during the critical early phase of psychotic illnesses. The NIH-funded Specialized&#xD;
      Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP, New Haven) project, included the first U.S.-based&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a public-sector&#xD;
      approach to FES.5 The Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis (PREP, Boston) clinic has&#xD;
      advanced a similar model of care within an analogous public-academic collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is required, as the next logical step, is a test of the effectiveness of TIPS' powerful&#xD;
      approach to early detection in a policy-relevant U.S. setting, where relatively fragmented&#xD;
      pathways to care raise both the challenges and potential public health impact of early&#xD;
      detection. The expertise within the investigators investigative team in the design of early&#xD;
      detection and the presence of 2 similar, effective, geographically separated and&#xD;
      collaborative FES programs (STEP and PREP) presents an excellent opportunity to conduct such&#xD;
      a test and thereby advance secondary prevention for psychotic illnesses in the U.S.&#xD;

    <description>A trained assessor will administer the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scale to every subject for levels of social and occupational functioning. The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210.</description>
