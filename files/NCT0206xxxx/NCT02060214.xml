    <textblock>
      Urinary urgency is the key symptom of overactive bladder (OAB). A critical barrier in&#xD;
      understanding OAB is the lack of a method to separate urgency that derives directly from&#xD;
      bladder filling or what we term &quot;tension sensor output&quot; and urgency that derives from&#xD;
      abnormal brain interpretation. The central hypothesis is that measureable biomechanical&#xD;
      parameters can directly affect the output (urgency) of the detrusor tension sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of novel cystometric tests for the improved diagnosis and treatment of OAB&#xD;
      and for the potential identification of novel mechanistic targets in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      OAB.&#xD;

      Aim 1. Validate an Urgency Meter and quantify urgency-volume relationship. Test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the tension sensor output of urinary urgency can be objectively measured and&#xD;
      is reflected by the input of filling volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Quantify the bladder geometry-urgency relationship. Test the hypothesis that bladder&#xD;
      geometry (wall thickness, surface area, and shape) affects the load on the detrusor tension&#xD;
      sensor as reflected by objective changes in the output of urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Quantify the dynamic compliance-urgency relationship. Test the hypothesis that dynamic&#xD;
      compliance (strain-history and activation-history dependent compliance) affects the load on&#xD;
      the detrusor tension sensor as reflected by objective changes in the output of urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Quantify the spontaneous rhythmic contraction-urgency relationship. Test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that spontaneous rhythmic contractions affect the load on the detrusor tension&#xD;
      sensor as reflected by objective changes in the output of urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary urgency is the key symptom in Overactive Bladder (OAB) that occurs during the filling&#xD;
      phase of micturition, and increased detrusor wall tension is thought to be a critical factor&#xD;
      in the pathophysiology of OAB. However, because pressure increases little during bladder&#xD;
      filling and does not reflect changes in detrusor wall tension, true filling phase physiology&#xD;
      cannot be evaluated during clinical cystometrics. Thus, objective assessments of OAB using&#xD;
      standard clinical cystometric testing is difficult or impossible. Furthermore, evaluation of&#xD;
      OAB using verbal sensory thresholds recommended by the International Continence Society are&#xD;
      subjective and poorly defined. Thus, there is a pressing need for a mechanistically relevant&#xD;
      diagnostic test of OAB that incorporates objective metrics for the direct evaluation of&#xD;
      detrusor wall tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a systems model of the filling phase of micturition, the detrusor smooth muscle and its&#xD;
      in-series tension sensitive afferent nerves can be represented as a tension sensor with a&#xD;
      definable input (volume), an objectively measurable output (urgency), and objectively&#xD;
      measurable biomechanical parameters that affect the load on the tension sensor. Based on our&#xD;
      previous investigations and the work of others, we have identified the following&#xD;
      biomechanical parameters that can directly affect the load on the detrusor tension sensor&#xD;
      during filling: bladder geometry, dynamic compliance, and spontaneous rhythmic contractions.&#xD;
      In the current proposal, we will develop novel cystometric tests to assess bladder geometry,&#xD;
      dynamic compliance, and spontaneous rhythmic contractions during the filling phase of&#xD;
      micturition. Our new cystometrics will include 1) a sliding scale Urgency Meter that will&#xD;
      allow patients to continuously record the tension sensor output of urgency, 2) two and three&#xD;
      dimensional bladder ultrasonography to provide real-time measurements of bladder geometry&#xD;
      that will be used to measure the effect of geometry and used for dynamic compliance&#xD;
      calculations, and 3) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to objectively measure filling&#xD;
      phase spontaneous rhythmic contractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new metrics will provide a quantitative mechanistic link between OAB symptomatology and&#xD;
      detrusor function, and we will use these new metrics to identify tension-mediated and&#xD;
      non-tension mediated sub-groups of OAB. In this proposal, our central hypothesis, that&#xD;
      measurable biomechanical parameters can directly affect the output (urgency) of the detrusor&#xD;
      tension sensor, will be tested in clinical experiments involving accelerated hydration,&#xD;
      abbreviated cystometrics, and repeat-fill cystometrics, and extended-hold cystometrics.&#xD;
      Successful completion of this multi-PI proposal involving the combined skill sets of a&#xD;
      neuro-urologist and a mechanical engineer will allow for the development of novel cystometric&#xD;
      tests for the improved diagnosis and treatment of OAB and for the potential identification of&#xD;
      novel mechanistic targets in the pathophysiology of OAB.&#xD;
