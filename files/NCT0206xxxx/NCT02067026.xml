           Study Design Overview and Endpoints The study is set up as a placebo-controlled,&#xD;
           randomized, double-blind parallel trial with 2 test foods, wheat Aleurone-rich foods or&#xD;
           control foods (placebo). The primary and secondary endpoints are given in the above&#xD;
           section, STUDY OBJECTIVES.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design Overview Participants will be identified and recruited at the U.O.S. di Dietetica&#xD;
           e Nutrizione Clinica, St Chiara, APSS Trento and Fondazione Edmund Mach. Participants&#xD;
           will be informed about the study aims and procedures and will be pre-screened on the&#xD;
           basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria. If eligible, they will sign the informed consent&#xD;
           and enter the study with visit T-1, performed at the clinic between 8.00 and 9.00 a.m.,&#xD;
           where a clinical and biochemical evaluation of the health status will be performed. If&#xD;
           subjects are still eligible for the study according to all the exclusion criteria, they&#xD;
           will be included into the trial and randomised to receive the active supplementation or&#xD;
           placebo at visit T0, 2 weeks later (run-in period). A dietary counselling will be&#xD;
           administered at visits T-1 and T0. Participants will be advised to follow Mediterranean&#xD;
           dietary habits and practice moderate physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical visit, clinical tests, and blood drawing will be performed after an overnight&#xD;
           fasting at the start of the run-in phase (visit T-1). Clinical tests, blood drawing,&#xD;
           stool and urine collection will be performed, at visit T0 (week 2) and T1 (week 6). A&#xD;
           four days food diary will be distributed and filled in for four consecutive days by&#xD;
           study participants before visit T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participant will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical and biochemical evaluation to exclude possible disease status (T-1, week&#xD;
                0): anamnestic questionnaire, ECG, hemocrome, creatinine, liver enzymes).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood drawing (30 ml) for biochemical analyses (T-1 -week 0-, T0 - week 2- and T1 -&#xD;
                week 6-).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stool and 24 hrs urine collection for biochemical analyses (T0 - week 2- and T1 -&#xD;
                week 6-).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anthropometric evaluation: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
                height and weight for BMI calculation and waist and hip circumferences (T-1 -week&#xD;
                0-, T0 - week 2- and T1 - week 6-).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the visits will be performed at the clinic between 8.00 and 9.00 a.m., in fasting&#xD;
           status. Each visit will last about 1 hr. Participants will be asked do not modify their&#xD;
           current diet, with the exception of supplement introduction in substitution to the&#xD;
           corresponding foods. They will also be asked to avoid drugs, supplement and integrators&#xD;
           and to immediately communicate to the monitors any disease status or changes in drug&#xD;
           prescription (new or current drug therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant recruitment Participants will be identified and recruited at the U.O.S. di&#xD;
           Dietetica e Nutrizione Clinica, St Chiara, APSS Trento and Fondazione Edmund Mach. They&#xD;
           will include workers at both institutions and members of the public. Participants will&#xD;
           be informed about the study aims and procedures and will be pre-screened on the basis of&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria. If eligible, they will sign the informed consent and enter&#xD;
           the study with visit T-1, during which a clinical and biochemical evaluation of the&#xD;
           health status will be performed. If subjects remain eligible for the study according to&#xD;
           all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be included into the trial and&#xD;
           randomized to receive the active supplementation or placebo at visit T0, two weeks later&#xD;
           (run-in period).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Supplementation After a run-in phase of two weeks, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
           receive supplementation with either wheat Aleurone-rich food or placebo foods for four&#xD;
           weeks in a double-blind manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dietary counseling Dietary counseling will be administered at visits T-1 and T0.&#xD;
           Participants will be advised to follow Mediterranean dietary habits and practice&#xD;
           moderate physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up The intervention will include a four week treatment periods. Clinical visit,&#xD;
           clinical tests, and blood drawing will be performed after an overnight fasting at visit&#xD;
           T-1 - week 0-. Clinical tests, blood drawing, and stool and urine collection will be&#xD;
           performed at visit T0 and T1 (T0 the day before supplementation, T1 will be week 4 after&#xD;
           the treatment either aleurone supplemented foods or placebo supplemented foods). A one&#xD;
           year recall food frequency questionnaire will be administered at visit T-1. A one week&#xD;
           recall food frequency questionnaire will be performed before visit T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical evaluation Electrocardiogram. A 12-lead ECG will be performed at screening.&#xD;
           Electrocardiographs will be reviewed and interpreted by U.O.S. di Dietetica e Nutrizione&#xD;
           Clinica, St Chiara, APSS Trento.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arterial blood pressure (BP) will be measured according to the guide-lines for&#xD;
           hypertension of ISH/WHO 2004. The 'OMRON HEM705CP Oscillometric blood pressure monitor'&#xD;
           will be used. Subjects will be kept resting and seated for 10 minutes before measuring&#xD;
           blood pressure on the right arm; The first measure will be discharged; the second and&#xD;
           the third measures will follow the first by 2 minutes each, on a relaxed and naked arm&#xD;
           and with the arm angle at the same level of the heart. The mean of the last two measures&#xD;
           will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weight and height will be measured on a standard scale, with an attached altimeter for&#xD;
           height measurements and will be recorded as equal to the closest 100 g and 1 cm, if&#xD;
           necessary, respectively. Measures will be carried out on subjects without shoes, coats&#xD;
           or heavy dressing. BMI will be calculated as kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Waist (Umbilical) circumference will be measured according to National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Clinical guidelines on the&#xD;
           identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults; the&#xD;
           evidence report. In practice, with the subject standing erect with the abdomen relaxed,&#xD;
           the arm at the sides and the feet together, the waist circumference will be measured, at&#xD;
           the nearest 0.1 cm, at a level midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest with&#xD;
           the tape all around the body in horizontal position. Hip circumference will be measured&#xD;
           at bitrochanteric level. The ratio of waist to hip circumference (WHR) will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires. All the information will be collected and recorded in validated&#xD;
           questionnaires, including personal identification, medical history, and information on&#xD;
           risk factors for CVD, drug use, physical activity, and dietary habits. Moreover a three&#xD;
           days food diary will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood sampling and urine collection Blood (≤ 30 ml) will be collected from an&#xD;
           antecubital vein, with minimal stasis between 8.00 and 9.00 a.m. after 12 h fasting,&#xD;
           from subjects who refrained to smoking for at least 6 h. 24 h urine collections will be&#xD;
           obtained from each participant. Urine volume will be measured and 5 aliquots of 5 ml&#xD;
           will be stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Faecal sample collection Feacal samples will be processed within 2 hours of sample&#xD;
           production. Briefly, 1 g aliquotes of faeces will be mixed with RNA-later and stored at&#xD;
           -80°C for later DNA. Faecal samples will also be frozen directly at -80°C for metabolite&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory tests (U.O.S. di Dietetica e Nutrizione Clinica, St Chiara, APSS Trento)&#xD;
           Blood samples will be centrifuged according to the requirements of the tests to be&#xD;
           performed, immediately after blood collection. Plasma or serum will be separated, in&#xD;
           part immediately tested and the remaining fraction stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and glucose will be evaluated by chromogenic&#xD;
           assays. LDL cholesterol will be calculated according to the Friedewald formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insulin levels will be evaluated by ELISA. Blood cells counts will be evaluated by&#xD;
           standard tests. C-RP will be measured by nephelometric assays; F2-isoprostanes will be&#xD;
           measured in urine as a measure of oxidant stress, by specific EIA kit (Cayman Chemicals,&#xD;
           Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA), after purification by solid phase chromatography (SepPack&#xD;
           columns).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory tests (Fondazione Edmund Mach [FEM]) Plasma LPS, LPS specific IgG, CD14,&#xD;
           LPS-binding protein, and urinary 8-Isorpostane will be measured spectrophotometrically&#xD;
           using a commercial ELISA kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Urinary and plasma metabolite profiling (FEM). Urine and blood (plasma and serum)&#xD;
           samples will be subjected to both targeted metabolomics (UPLC-MS/MS for non-volatile&#xD;
           compounds and GC-MS/MS for volatile compounds) and untargeted metabolomics&#xD;
           (ULPC-Q-TOF-MS and Nano-FTMS-Q-TOF for non-volatile and GC-TOF for volatile compounds)&#xD;
           (Vanza et al., 2001 2012). For targeted metabolite profiling of plasma, the MS based&#xD;
           Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® p180 Kit will be used, generating accurate quantitative data on&#xD;
           180 human metabolites related to diabetes disease risk. Also specific targeted analysis&#xD;
           will be applied for serum lipid profiles, bile acids, SCFA, and microbial polyphenol&#xD;
           metabolites quantification in biofluids (including faeces) using UPLC/QqQ-MS/MS&#xD;
           (Vrhovsek et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fecal microbiota analysis (FEM). Fecal microbiology changes will be assessed using 454&#xD;
           pyrosequencing metagenomics. Briefly, following delivery of fecal samples metagenomic&#xD;
           DNA will be extracted using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for FECES from MPbio.com. Using&#xD;
           universal bacterial primers, the V1-V3 region inclusive of the 16S rRNA gene present&#xD;
           within the fecal metagenomic DNA will be amplified and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing.&#xD;
           Multiplex Identifier (MID) Adaptors will be used for the GS FLX Titanium Chemistry -&#xD;
           Extended MID Set to obtain sequences of about 600 bp length which will be BLASTED&#xD;
           against publically available 16S rRNA phylogenetic databases using the QIIME pipeline&#xD;
           (http://qiime.org/ ) giving good species level identifications of the human gut&#xD;
           microbiota. A total of 20,000 usable sequences per fecal sample is targeted. Following&#xD;
           quality control and microbial ecological analysis, multivariate statistics will be&#xD;
           employed to correlate changes within the fecal microbiota composition and structure in&#xD;
           subjects after consumption of Aleurone supplemented foods compared to the control foods&#xD;
           (De Filippo et al., 2010). Quantitative PCR with species and group specific primers will&#xD;
           be employed to confirm changes in microbial populations identified from the&#xD;
           pyrosequencing metagenomic data. Using qPCR, total bifidobacteria, total enterobacteria,&#xD;
           total bacteria and lactobacilli in all fecal samples will be enumerated. This will be a&#xD;
           minimum and will act as independent quality control for the pyrosequencing. In addition&#xD;
           and depending on what is seen in terms of species level changes from the pyrosequencing,&#xD;
           species specific primers will be employed to confirm all statistically significant&#xD;
           differences seen upon comparison between Aleurone and control feeding time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization and Blinding Participants, stratified by sex will be randomized to&#xD;
           aleurone treatment or placebo treatment by electronic generated number provided by the&#xD;
           statistician. Clinical investigators and laboratory personnel will be blinded about&#xD;
           randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study products (bread flour, biscuits, RTE cereals) will be delivered by Cargill in a&#xD;
           blinded manner but marked with either E or W to differentiate treatments. Test products&#xD;
           will be packaged in similar wrappings and in daily portions. Placebo foods contain the&#xD;
           same ingredients as the active foods except with cellulose substituting for Aleurone and&#xD;
           are very similar to the latter in size, shape and color.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment The study supplementation will be introduced in the daily diet according to&#xD;
           the participant preference to a total of 27 g of Aleurone/day or equivalent dose of&#xD;
           placebo. One bread slice (35 g) contains 4.8 g Aleurone; one biscuit (15 g) contains 4.5&#xD;
           g Aleurone; 36 g of RTE cereals contain 9 g Aleurone. Placebo foods contain the same&#xD;
           ingredients as the active foods except with cellulose substituting for Aleurone fiber&#xD;
           content and are very similar to the latter in size, shape and color. The study products&#xD;
           (active or placebo) will be provided in product packages that will be labeled in the&#xD;
           local language with the study code number, site code number, name of the manufacturer,&#xD;
           patient number, the study visit number, batch number, storage instructions, and expire&#xD;
           dates. Products will be dispensed to participants at visit T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Duration and Scheduling After a run-in phase of two weeks, participants will be&#xD;
           randomized to to the Aleurone supplemented food group or placebo supplemented group for&#xD;
           4 weeks of dietary intervention..&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall duration of the study, including run-in and treatment will be 6 weeks.&#xD;
           Subject recruitment will commence upon favourable assessment by the APSS research and&#xD;
           ethics committee and the first subjects will start the run-in period within two weeks of&#xD;
           this start point. Subjects will be recruited over a 6 month period and the study will be&#xD;
           completed by 8 months from the time of first subject recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Discontinuation Criteria Criteria In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH&#xD;
           Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
           (FDA) Regulations, a subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for&#xD;
           any reason without prejudice to his/her future medical care by the physician or at the&#xD;
           institution. The Investigator and Sponsor also have the right to withdraw subjects from&#xD;
           the study (see below). Additionally, the Sponsor may choose to terminate the study at&#xD;
           any time for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should a subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative) decide to withdraw,&#xD;
           all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as&#xD;
           possible. A complete final evaluation should be made at the time of the subject's&#xD;
           withdrawal, the reason for the withdrawal should be recorded and an attempt should be&#xD;
           made to perform a follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects may be removed from the study for reasons including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  significant protocol violation on the part of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  significant noncompliance on the part of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  refusal of the subject to continue treatment or observations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  decision by the Investigator that termination is in the subject's best medical&#xD;
                interest&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  unrelated medical illness or complication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  evidence of alcohol or substance abuse Subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn&#xD;
                from the study will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure for Early Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should a subject discontinue prior to completion of the study, the reason for, and date&#xD;
           of discontinuation will be obtained. The date of last dose of study product will also be&#xD;
           obtained. In the event of an early discontinuation, the following procedures should be&#xD;
           performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical tests (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, height and&#xD;
                weight for BMI calculation, and waist and hip circumferences),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood drawing, stool and urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A 1 week food recall questionnaire In the event that the subject cannot return for&#xD;
                the follow-up visit, the site should attempt to contact the subject by phone to&#xD;
                follow any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a subject withdraws consent to receive study product, they will be encouraged to&#xD;
           remain in the study without receiving treatment for the collection of safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Accountability Procedures for Study Product The study products (active or placebo) will&#xD;
           be provided in product packages that will be labeled in the local language with the&#xD;
           study code number, site code number, name of the manufacturer, product code number, the&#xD;
           study visit number, batch number, storage instructions, and expire dates. Products will&#xD;
           be dispensed to participants at visit T0. Bread will be frozen in portions of 2 buns and&#xD;
           biscuits will be frozen in portions of 2 biscuits that will be defrosted at home by&#xD;
           participants prior to consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization Code Maintenance Randomization codes for participants will be kept in a&#xD;
           sealed envelope at FEM. Product code informations will be kept in a sealed envelope at&#xD;
           Cargill.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Source Data Control All data collected during the course of the study will be obtained&#xD;
           from primary sources that have been recorded in written and electronic documents such as&#xD;
           the subject's medical file. The results of clinical exams, laboratory findings, and ECG&#xD;
           tracings will be recorded in the subject's electronic medical file. No data will be&#xD;
           entered directly onto the case report form (CRF) without being transferred from some&#xD;
           other prior source such as written or electronic records.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects Inclusion Criteria At least one of the following&#xD;
           conditions: Aged 18-65 years; BMI &gt;27 kg/m^2. Exclusion Criteria Subjects are to be&#xD;
           excluded from study participation if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
           fasting blood glucose &gt;300 mg/dl; triglycerides &gt;500 mg/dl; uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
           (BP &gt;160/100 mm Hg under antihypertensive therapy); cardiovascular disease (myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           grafting, unstable angina pectoris, stoke, peripheral arterial disease); hypo- or&#xD;
           hyperthyroidism; acute inflammatory diseases; severe gastrointestinal diseases; heart,&#xD;
           liver, renal or pulmonary failure or other life threatening disease with prognosis &lt;5&#xD;
           years; chronic use of systemic corticosteroids, anti-coagulants, anti-inflammatory, or&#xD;
           lipid lowering and anti-diabetics drugs; treatment within the previous 6 weeks with any&#xD;
           medication that is known to affect lipoprotein levels or fecal microbiota (specifically,&#xD;
           antibiotics); food intolerances; alcohol intake &gt;5 drinks per day or use of narcotic&#xD;
           substances; use of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements; special diet; pregnancy,&#xD;
           smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant Drug Therapy Any therapy received by the subject within one month prior to&#xD;
           the start of the study and/or administered during the study will be regarded as&#xD;
           concomitant therapy. Such treatment must be documented on the appropriate CRF page and&#xD;
           in the subjects' medical records. Any changes to the concomitant therapy during the&#xD;
           study must be clearly recorded and the reason for the change should be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Use of the following medications will not be allowed during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, antinflammatory, lipid lowering and antidiabetics&#xD;
           drugs; any medication that is known to affect lipoprotein levels or fecal microbiota&#xD;
           (specifically antibiotics), supplements, probiotics, prebiotics, or herbs, except for&#xD;
           the management of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject Compliance To evaluate the compliance to the supplementation, urinary phenols&#xD;
           will be measured in subjects supplemented with Aleurone-rich food at time T0 and T1.&#xD;
           Moreover, all unused or empty packets at the end of each week accompanied by a self&#xD;
           record of the used portions will be returned to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recording and Reporting Adverse Events Adverse Events Adverse events, both solicited and&#xD;
           unsolicited, will be recorded throughout the study and for 30 days following the last&#xD;
           treatment with study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event (AE) is any physical or clinical change or disease experienced by the&#xD;
           subject at any time during the course of the study, whether or not considered related to&#xD;
           the use of the study product. This includes the onset of new illness and the&#xD;
           exacerbation of pre existing conditions. Abnormal laboratory values or test results&#xD;
           should not generally be considered AEs, unless they induce clinical signs or symptoms or&#xD;
           require therapeutic intervention. Adverse events will be followed carefully until&#xD;
           resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A verbatim description of the event, its relationship to study product, and whether or&#xD;
           not the event was also recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) must be reported on the&#xD;
           Adverse Event CRF for each AE recorded in the subject's chart. Any AEs occurring after&#xD;
           the first study procedure and during the entire course of the study, through the final&#xD;
           study procedure should be reported, whether or not they are deemed to be related to&#xD;
           study product. Each entry must include the onset and end dates and times, seriousness,&#xD;
           severity, relationship to study product, and action/outcome. All AEs should be recorded&#xD;
           using terminology as defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities&#xD;
           (MedDRA), version 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analyses Planned Enrollment and Justification The sample size 34 was&#xD;
           determined to detect a change of 0.4 μmol/L total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma with a&#xD;
           standard variation of 0.5 μmol/L (taken from Price et al., 2010) using the Snedecor and&#xD;
           Cochran equation with α of 0.05 and 1-β of 0.9 (Dell et al., 2002). Taking into&#xD;
           consideration the previous study with aleurone in healthy individuals of Price et al.,&#xD;
           (2010), and the need to account for drop outs, we propose to recruit 40 individuals per&#xD;
           treatment group in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Basal characteristics will be presented for each group. Eventually residual differences&#xD;
           between active food and placebo group after randomization will be considered for&#xD;
           adjustment in multivariable models in all further analyses. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
           expressed as means +/- standard deviation or medians with interquartile ranges and as&#xD;
           percentage for categorical variables. Post-intervention data will be compared by ANOVA&#xD;
           using the General Linear Model with baseline as a covariate. Data with a skewed&#xD;
           distribution will be log transformed before analyses. Simple and multiple linear&#xD;
           regression will be used to determine relationships between variables and independent&#xD;
           t-tests performed to evaluate differences in reported compliance between groups. Results&#xD;
           will be expressed as mean +/- SEM and differences will be considered significant at P &lt;&#xD;
           0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 'intention to treat' principle will be adopted for the analysis of the primary&#xD;
           endpoints: the evaluation of efficacy takes into account the initial randomization&#xD;
           independently from the compliance to the treatment of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main analysis will be based on the comparison of the difference in mean levels at&#xD;
           the end of the study in subjects supplemented with active foods and subjects given&#xD;
           placebo foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main analysis will be based on the comparison of the difference in mean levels at&#xD;
           the end of the study in subjects supplemented with active foods and in placebo foods&#xD;
           supplemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The differences over time between treatment arms will be evaluated by the analysis of&#xD;
           the Variance for repeated measures (GLM Procedure, SAS Institute Inc. SAS/STAT User&#xD;
           Guide, Version 9.1.3 for WINDOWS. Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc. 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The significance level will be alpha=0.05 two-tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics&#xD;
           including but not limited to age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight, height, and body&#xD;
           mass index, blood pressure and dietary habits will be tabulated using descriptive&#xD;
           statistics Baseline Assessments Any abnormal findings at baseline electrocardiogram&#xD;
           assessment, drug screen, or virus screen will be summarized descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory Values Laboratory data from each sampling and changes from baseline will be&#xD;
           summarized for each Visit by the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS Regulatory authorities may wish to conduct audits&#xD;
           of clinical research activities to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. A&#xD;
           regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or even&#xD;
           after its completion). If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority and/or&#xD;
           IRB, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor or its designee immediately. The&#xD;
           Investigator must agree to provide regulatory authorities access to study-related&#xD;
           documentation. The Investigator will allow the Sponsor to assist in responding to any&#xD;
           citations as well as receive copies of any documents provided to an inspector/auditor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ETHICS Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Before implementing this study, the&#xD;
           protocol and the informed consent will be reviewed by the Comitato etico per le&#xD;
           Sperimentazioni Cliniche c/o APSS di Trento. A signed and dated statement that the&#xD;
           protocol and informed consent have been approved by the Comitato etico per le&#xD;
           Sperimentazioni Cliniche c/o APSS di Trento must be on file at the site before study&#xD;
           initiation. A listing of the members of the Comitato etico per le Sperimentazioni&#xD;
           Cliniche c/o APSS di Trento must also be on file at the site. Any amendments to the&#xD;
           protocol, other than administrative ones, must be approved by the Comitato etico per le&#xD;
           Sperimentazioni Cliniche c/o APSS di Trento.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed Consent Informed consent forms will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disclosure and Confidentiality By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to keep&#xD;
           all information provided by Cargill in strict confidence and to request similar&#xD;
           confidentiality from his/her staff and the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study documents provided by Cargill (protocols, Investigator Brochures, and other&#xD;
           material) will be stored appropriately to ensure confidentiality. The information&#xD;
           provided by Cargill to the Investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct&#xD;
           written authorization from Cargill except to the extent necessary to obtain informed&#xD;
           consent from subjects who wish to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING Source data/documentation is defined as the first place&#xD;
           that data is recorded. Any and all source documents must be maintained and be&#xD;
           retrievable at the site. The Investigator must maintain source documents for each&#xD;
           subject in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collected on CRFs during the trial will be documented in an anonymous fashion, and&#xD;
           subjects will only be identified by subject numbers and initials. If, as an exception,&#xD;
           it is necessary for safety or regulatory reasons to identify the subject, Cargill, and&#xD;
           the Investigator are bound to keep this information confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data entered on the CRFs must be legibly recorded in black ink. If a correction is&#xD;
           necessary, it should be made by striking through the incorrect entry with a single line&#xD;
           and entering the correct information adjacent to it. The correction must be initialed&#xD;
           and dated by the Investigator or a designated qualified individual. Any requested&#xD;
           information that is not obtained as specified in the protocol should have an explanation&#xD;
           for the omission noted on the CRF. A copy of each subject's CRF, along with related&#xD;
           queries, must be maintained at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All information on CRFs must be traceable to source documents, which are generally&#xD;
           maintained in the subject's file. The source documents should contain all demographic&#xD;
           and medical information including laboratory data, ECGs, etc., and also a copy of the&#xD;
           signed informed consent form, which should indicate the study number and title of the&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Essential documents, as listed below, must be retained by the Investigator for a period&#xD;
           identified by Cargill at the beginning of the study. Cargill will notify the&#xD;
           Investigator/institution when the study related records are no longer required. The&#xD;
           Investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention procedures by signing the&#xD;
           protocol. Essential documents include, but are not limited to, protocols, advertising&#xD;
           materials, AE reports, subject source records, IRB correspondence, consent forms,&#xD;
           curriculum vitaes, monitoring visit logs, laboratory records, reference ranges,&#xD;
           certifications, quality control documentation, and any other pertinent documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any change or addition to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must&#xD;
           be approved by Cargill before implementation. If substantial changes to the design of&#xD;
           the study are made the IRB must be notified, and when necessary, approve the change&#xD;
           before the inclusion of new subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data management procedures will be detailed in separate, specifically identified&#xD;
           files that collectively will be referenced as the Data Management Plan (DMP).&#xD;
