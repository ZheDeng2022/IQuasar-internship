  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the project is to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine receipt&#xD;
      rates among low-income, ethnic minority adolescents (girls and boys 11-17 years of age) in&#xD;
      Los Angeles County. We will accomplish this goal by implementing and rigorously evaluating&#xD;
      interventions in multiple venues that serve our target population, including the Los Angeles&#xD;
      County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) and two large Federally Qualified Health Centers&#xD;
      (FQHCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group will have a higher rate of HPV vaccine initiation at follow-up&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The intervention group will have higher vaccine completion rates (3 doses) at follow-up&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the project is to increase HPV vaccine receipt rates among low-income,&#xD;
      ethnic minority adolescents (girls and boys ages 9-17 years) in LA County. We will accomplish&#xD;
      this goal by implementing and rigorously evaluating interventions in multiple venues that&#xD;
      serve our target population, including the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health&#xD;
      (LACDPH) and two large Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group will have a higher rate of HPV vaccine initiation at follow-up&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The intervention group will have higher vaccine completion rates (3 doses) at follow-up&#xD;
           compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Venue 1: Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. At the LACDPH, the&#xD;
      multi-component intervention will be directed at caregivers of age-eligible adolescents&#xD;
      (11-17 years) and include brief individually-tailored telephone education, referral to a&#xD;
      clinic offering low cost/free vaccine, and a mailed brochure. The control group will receive&#xD;
      usual care and a standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HPV vaccine fact&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary hypotheses for this recruitment venue include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intervention group will have higher knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine than the&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The intervention will have a greater effect on the more acculturated than less&#xD;
           acculturated participants (moderator effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The intervention will exert its effect on vaccine receipt by increasing knowledge and&#xD;
           reducing barriers (mediator effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This recruitment venue will utilize a two-arm time-randomized (on-off) controlled design to&#xD;
      assess the effect of a multi-component intervention targeting mothers and fathers, to&#xD;
      increase HPV vaccine uptake among their adolescents (ages 11-17). Hotline users will be&#xD;
      randomized into the intervention or control condition on an alternating (on/off) weekly&#xD;
      schedule. Eligible participants will complete a baseline telephone interview. Immediately&#xD;
      following the baseline interview, participants calling during intervention weeks will receive&#xD;
      the individually-tailored multi-component intervention, including tailored education and&#xD;
      clinic referral. A tailored print intervention will also be mailed to intervention&#xD;
      participants. All participants will be re-contacted at 3 months and 9 months for telephone&#xD;
      follow-up interviews. Control group participants will receive the intervention after the&#xD;
      9-month follow-up. Prior to study protocol implementation, about 25-50 individuals will be&#xD;
      recruited to pre-test the baseline survey in different languages (English, Spanish, Chinese,&#xD;
      Armenian) to ensure the baseline questionnaires are similar in content across languages and&#xD;
      the questions are clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study site will enroll men and women of diverse racial-ethnic backgrounds from the Office&#xD;
      of Women's Health (OWH) women's health telephone hotline database. The database includes&#xD;
      contact information about adult women LA County residents who telephoned a 1-800 hotline to&#xD;
      receive information and referrals about women's health issues, including cervical cancer and&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening. Male callers also use the hotline. The OWH has promoted the&#xD;
      hotline through partnerships with over 300 community-based organizations. Recruitment of&#xD;
      callers from the database will consist of operators calling women to invite them to be&#xD;
      screened for study eligibility. Recruitment of new hotline callers will take place during&#xD;
      their first contact with the hotline. Upon receiving an incoming call, operators will first&#xD;
      respond to the caller's request using routine hotline protocols which include screening for&#xD;
      income eligibility (&lt;200% of poverty) for county services. Following this, operators invite&#xD;
      the caller to be screened for study eligibility. Eligible participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the baseline interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Callers will be randomized to the intervention or control condition on alternating weeks&#xD;
      (on-off or time randomized design). This randomization scheme was selected in close&#xD;
      consultation with OWH to ensure the integrity of the randomization process and minimize&#xD;
      disruption of routine hotline operation. The telephone intervention will be delivered&#xD;
      immediately following the baseline telephone interview to participants calling during&#xD;
      intervention weeks. The intervention is based on the Health Behavior Framework and pilot&#xD;
      study findings and incorporates individual-level tailoring. The three segments of the&#xD;
      telephone intervention include: 1) basic information about the HPV vaccine; 2)&#xD;
      individually-tailored information to address each participant's primary concerns regarding&#xD;
      the vaccine; 3) individually-tailored referral to a local clinic where free/low cost vaccine&#xD;
      is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline interviews (10-15 mins) will be conducted immediately following the eligibility&#xD;
      screener and the verbal informed consent, via a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing&#xD;
      System. All eligible subjects who complete the baseline interview will receive brief (&lt;10&#xD;
      mins) 3 and 9-month follow-up telephone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 3-month interviews, half of intervention participants will receive a &quot;booster&quot;&#xD;
      intervention wherein we will repeat the clinic referral procedure/language given during the&#xD;
      intervention at baseline. Intervention participants will be randomized to the &quot;booster&quot; or no&#xD;
      &quot;booster&quot; condition based on the order in which they completed the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Venue 2: AltaMed Health Services Corporation. At AltaMed Health Services&#xD;
      Corporation, the largest federally qualified health center in the nation, we will implement a&#xD;
      multi-level intervention that includes patient (i.e., caregiver) and provider reminders,&#xD;
      physician, nurse, and other staff training regarding the HPV vaccine and processes and&#xD;
      procedures for its delivery. We will utilize a quasi-experimental study design to assess the&#xD;
      effect of this multi-level intervention to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion&#xD;
      among adolescents (ages 9-17). Eight clinic sites that serve the majority of AltaMed's&#xD;
      adolescent population will be matched based on the size of the adolescent population served&#xD;
      and baseline HPV vaccination rates. We will randomly assign matched paired clinics to either&#xD;
      the intervention (n=4) or usual care group (n=4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinics assigned to the usual care condition will only receive: (1) the standing order for&#xD;
      the HPV vaccine, which authorizes non-physician providers to assess adolescents' immunization&#xD;
      eligibility and administer the HPV vaccine without a physician examination or order and (2) a&#xD;
      required web-based training module for medical assistants and nurses containing basic&#xD;
      information on HPV, the HPV vaccine, and standing order implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to usual care activities, intervention clinics will receive the following: (1)&#xD;
      health care provider training on the importance of HPV vaccination and a strong provider&#xD;
      recommendation, strategies to appropriately frame the HPV vaccine conversation, and&#xD;
      recommended processes and procedures for vaccine delivery; (2) staff training on the&#xD;
      importance of HPV vaccination, strategies to promote uptake of the vaccine, and recommended&#xD;
      processes and procedures for vaccine delivery; (3) patient and provider reminders to promote&#xD;
      completion of the three-dose vaccine series; and (4) organizational strategies to improve&#xD;
      processes for vaccine delivery, in addition to usual care activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be developed in close collaboration with administrative leadership and&#xD;
      providers, who will provide input at each stage of the design, implementation, and evaluation&#xD;
      process. A physician vaccine champion from the organization will assist with the development&#xD;
      of and lead a one-hour, in-person provider presentation and discussion. For the staff&#xD;
      training presentation, nurse managers will be convened regularly to discuss processes for HPV&#xD;
      and general standing order implementation, strategies to optimize clinical workflow and&#xD;
      increase follow-up, and development of back office staff training. Using a train-the-trainer&#xD;
      approach, the nurse mangers will lead the approximate one-hour presentation and discussion at&#xD;
      their respective clinics. They will also monitor process implementation through direct staff&#xD;
      observation and quality reports and retrain staff as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to provider and staff trainings, organizational strategies at intervention sites&#xD;
      will include implementation of standard practices for HPV vaccine delivery that complement&#xD;
      existing clinical workflow. At intake, back office staff will check vaccination history at&#xD;
      each visit, implement needed standing orders, inform caregivers of vaccines due, and notify&#xD;
      the provider of vaccines ordered. During the provider encounter, providers will confirm&#xD;
      recommended vaccinations and recommend the HPV vaccine as part of other routine vaccines. At&#xD;
      check-out, back office staff will administer vaccines, schedule a visit for the second dose,&#xD;
      and provide caregivers both a standard appointment card and an intervention site reminder&#xD;
      magnet. A clinic provider vaccine champion will be identified to monitor implementation,&#xD;
      adapt processes, and serve as a resource at intervention sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate intervention effects, we will use data extracted from AltaMed's electronic&#xD;
      medical record system to measure HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates among&#xD;
      adolescents ages 9-17 at baseline and at regular intervals post intervention implementation.&#xD;
      Patient, provider and clinic factors associated with vaccine receipt will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Venue 3: Northeast Valley Health Corporation. At Northeast Valley Health&#xD;
      Corporation, another large federally qualified health center, we will implement and evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of three different clinic-level reminder systems (mailed letter, automated/robo&#xD;
      telephone call, text message) on HPV vaccine initiation and completion among adolescents&#xD;
      (ages 12-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will utilize a quasi-experimental study design. This FQHC comprises 8 sites that provide&#xD;
      primary care for medically underserved adults and adolescents in LA County. We will select 6&#xD;
      clinics matched on baseline vaccine receipt rates and other clinic characteristics and&#xD;
      randomly assign matched paired clinics to usual care or one of the three reminder system&#xD;
      interventions: mailed letter, automated/robo telephone call, or text message. Eligible&#xD;
      caregivers of adolescent boys and girls ages 12-13 who have received no doses or only one&#xD;
      dose of the HPV vaccine will be identified through Northeast Valley's electronic medical&#xD;
      record and population health management systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of eligible patients (i.e. caregivers), the centralized call center will&#xD;
      generate a standard letter and the automated/robocalls. A third-party vendor will send the&#xD;
      text messages. The reminder content will be adapted from existing clinical message scripts&#xD;
      and include a short message, which will be consistent across all modalities, on the&#xD;
      importance of HPV vaccination and how to make an appointment. Reminder messages will be&#xD;
      delivered in the patients' preferred language (either English or Spanish). The same reminder&#xD;
      type (either letter, call, or text message) will be used on up to two occasions: once at&#xD;
      baseline and a second time approximately one month after baseline for those who have not yet&#xD;
      received the targeted vaccine dose. To monitor receipt of reminders, number of unaccepted&#xD;
      telephone calls, returned letters, and stopped text messages will be monitored. Clinics&#xD;
      assigned to the usual care condition will receive standard of care, which does not include&#xD;
      any systematic reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the AltaMed FQHC site, to estimate intervention effects, we will use data&#xD;
      extracted from electronic medical records to measure HPV vaccine initiation and completion&#xD;
      rates at baseline and at regular intervals post intervention implementation.&#xD;
