      Disprove the null hypothesis as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the investigator's egg bank donors undergoing ovulation induction with recombinant FSH&#xD;
      medication per treatment protocol outlined below, use of adjunctive LH activity medication&#xD;
      Menopur ™ , will result in the same number of mature oocytes recovered and cryopreserved as&#xD;
      from egg donors not treated with Menopur™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare efficacy of recombinant FSH (Follistim ™) with and without adjunct LH activity&#xD;
      medication Menopur ™ for our volunteer egg bank donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. #Days of ovarian stimulation to GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peak serum estradiol level on day of GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of follicles &gt;15 mm average diameter on day of GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of mature oocytes recovered and cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: Randomized prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection: Voluntary egg donors who have satisfied all screening criteria for FDA and&#xD;
      the Michigan Egg Bank: Age range 18-to 39 years. BMI 18 to 25. Resting antral follicle count&#xD;
      of 16 or greater. Cycle day 3 FSH &lt;10 mIU/ml. AMH &gt;2.0 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups- Group A- Recombinant FSH Follistim only; Group B- Recombinant FSH Follistim and&#xD;
      adjunct Menopur. Both groups will use GnRH agonist trigger 36 hours prior to egg retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random number generator with patients assigned basd on odd or even numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 25 in each group. Total of 50 subjects. This takes into account possible&#xD;
      cycle cancellation for poor ovarian response or patient elective withdrawal to result in at&#xD;
      least 20 subjects in each group completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measure of outcome: number of mature oocytes recovered and cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures of outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. #Days of ovarian stimulation to GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peak serum estradiol level on day of GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of follicles &gt;15 mm average diameter on day of GnRH agonist trigger.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's Center has been studying human oocyte cryopreservation by vitrification&#xD;
      since July 1, 2008 (Western Institutional Board Review -WIRB Pro. Nr: 20081080, WIRB Study&#xD;
      Nr.: 1100421). The first phase of the investigator's study was to assess efficacy of oocyte&#xD;
      cryopreservation among voluntary egg donors with end points for outcomes including rates of&#xD;
      oocyte thaw survival, fertilization, embryo development, implantation, clinical pregnancy,&#xD;
      live birth and infant health. The rationale for starting with egg donors was that they&#xD;
      represent a population of women most likely to have optimal egg quality and a short&#xD;
      turnaround time from vitrification to thaw, IVF and embryo transfer into an appropriate egg&#xD;
      recipient patient. If the investigator could establish good outcomes when egg quality is&#xD;
      optimal, then there would be good hope to provide reliable egg cryopreservation technology to&#xD;
      women in need of fertility preservation when facing treatment of cancer; other illnesses for&#xD;
      which treatments harm their eggs; women choosing personal egg banking and for women who wish&#xD;
      to avoid excess embryo creation on moral or religious grounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's study observations were that outcomes with use of previously cryopreserved&#xD;
      donor eggs was equivalent to fresh donor eggs: 90% of mature oocytes survived the thaw, 76%&#xD;
      of thawed oocytes fertilized normally with ICSI, 98% of recipient women had a day 5 embryo&#xD;
      transfer with one or two embryos transferred, implantation rate of 42%, 60% or recipient&#xD;
      women achieved clinical pregnancy, 58% live birth rate and no birth defects have been&#xD;
      observed in over 40 babies delivered through this technology at our Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning of 2012, we opened up the second phase of the investigator's study to&#xD;
      include women in need of fertility preservation for the indications mentioned above. No&#xD;
      outcomes are yet known due to the expected time deferment from oocyte cryopreservation to&#xD;
      use. The favorable outcomes from donor egg bank IVF led to the investigator's establishing&#xD;
      the Michigan Egg Bank. On October 22, 2012, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine&#xD;
      announced a new practice guideline that oocyte cryopreservation technology should be&#xD;
      considered mainstream medical therapy and no long be considered experimental medical care.&#xD;
      The investigator's closed the WIRB study November, 26, 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation for egg donation should be provided offering the safest and simplest&#xD;
      process for our egg donors. Avoiding complications of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome while&#xD;
      assuring recruitment and harvest of good quality oocytes is a main goal in caring for the&#xD;
      investigator's volunteer egg donors. Use of FSH medications with GnRH antagonist and GnRH&#xD;
      agonist trigger is the protocol of choice for all of the investigator's egg donors. The&#xD;
      investigator's egg donors have experienced no complications and rapid recovery. GnRH&#xD;
      antagonists have been shown to suppress endogenous ovarian androgen synthesis. In using GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist, adjunctive LH or low dose hCG combined with FSH medication has been a mainstream&#xD;
      assumption to assure sufficient endogenous ovarian testosterone is present as a substrate for&#xD;
      estrogen synthesis and normal folliculogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to improve patient compliance by simplifying the use of medications for the&#xD;
      investigator's egg donors, the investigator wishes to examine the efficacy of recombinant FSH&#xD;
      without additional separate medication of adjunct LH activity in the form Menopur ™.&#xD;
