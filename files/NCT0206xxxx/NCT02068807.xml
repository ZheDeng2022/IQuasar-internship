    <textblock>
      The balance of the redox state is important for normal embryonic and fetal development .&#xD;
      During the perinatal period, a variety of conditions are responsible for an excessive&#xD;
      production of free radicals. The following oxidative stress is exacerbated by a lack of&#xD;
      antioxidant substances that have not yet matured. At the moment there are no therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies with single or combined antioxidants that have been shown to be clinically&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding is important for the contribution of the antioxidant defenses of the newborn&#xD;
      and the nutritional status of the mother plays a key role because it influences the&#xD;
      nutritional status of the newborn. Lutein is a carotenoid that is not produced by the body ,&#xD;
      but taken with food or supplements. The molecule carries out different activities :&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer , neuroprotective. Its main activity of inhibition&#xD;
      of peroxidation of membrane lipids is peculiarly important for the photoreceptors and neurons&#xD;
      whose membranes are rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Current evidence on its role as an&#xD;
      antioxidant indicate that supplementation with lutein may play a significant role in the&#xD;
      prevention of free radical disease in the newborn&#xD;

      In recent years many scientific studies demonstrated that lutein, a nutrient belonging to the&#xD;
      family of carotenoids, may constitute a valid and important preventive and protective factor&#xD;
      against a large number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people around the world .&#xD;
      Studies from literature highlight and confirm that lutein is able to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      developing some ocular diseases or slow down their progression. Lutein is a fat-soluble&#xD;
      derivative of polar hydroxylated xanthophyll which belongs to the family of carotenoids.&#xD;
      Carotenoids are linear polyenes, ie double bonds conjugated hydrocarbons containing 40 atoms&#xD;
      of carbon. Today there are 35 known carotenoids that are ingested, absorbed, metabolised and&#xD;
      found in human serum. Lutein is the most important corotenoid and it is only in the retina,&#xD;
      in the macula and in the lens. In tissues and serum lutein is found together with its isomer,&#xD;
      the zeaxanthin. Lutein, commonly ingested with other foods, is partially eliminated directly&#xD;
      in the faeces (50-90%) and partially absorbed with fatty foods. It is incorporated into&#xD;
      chylomicrons reaching the blood where it binds some lipoprotein and thanks to its fat&#xD;
      solubility it reaches different organs: liver, breast, colon, cervix, lens, iris and the&#xD;
      retina where it is concentrated in the central region: the macula. Inside cells Lutein is&#xD;
      placed through the lipid bilayer binding its polar groups with those of cell membranes.&#xD;
      Lutein and zeaxanthin are present in the umbilical cord and pass through the placental&#xD;
      barrier. They are also found in high concentrations in breast milk (higher than in plasma),&#xD;
      particularly in colostrum; indicating an active secretion in milk. The rates of lutein in&#xD;
      blood increases of 67% versus 14% for beta-carotene after the intake of foods rich in&#xD;
      carotenoids. Coordinated and interdisciplinary studies, conducted both in vitro and in vivo,&#xD;
      have shown that lutein plays a role in tissues defense through a functional mechanisms using&#xD;
      the phenomenon of deactivation (quenching) of singlet oxygen and of reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      (ROS). This action gives the molecule different activities: antioxidant and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, promotion of anti-carcinogenic effects, induction of detoxifying enzymes and&#xD;
      promotion of proteins with a positive effect on the junctional communication (up-regulation).&#xD;
      New chemical and experimental data show that oxidative stress and harmful effects of ROS may&#xD;
      play an important role in the pathogenesis of some neurological diseases like Alzheimer,&#xD;
      Parkinson, etc.. This could be explained by the fact that the central nervous system is&#xD;
      characterized by membranes rich of polyunsaturated lipids that are the first target of ROS&#xD;
      attack (lipid peroxidation). A similar mechanism may occur in some ocular tissues (macula,&#xD;
      lens, retina), which are more vulnerable than other tissues to oxidative damage being&#xD;
      particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The photo-protective action seems to be&#xD;
      predominant in the iris, while in the retinal pigment epithelium may operate both light&#xD;
      filtering and antioxidant mechanisms. The development of the human eye includes a complex&#xD;
      series of consecutive events beginning with the first differentiation of the fertilized egg&#xD;
      cell and continuing after birth until the first years of life. The eye of the newborn,&#xD;
      although smaller than that of adults, has a well developed and mature dioptric apparatus,&#xD;
      consisting of cornea, aqueous humor, lens and vitreous, transparent structures that allow the&#xD;
      passage of light and focus images on the retina. Contrariwise the macula and its central part&#xD;
      (fovea), useful for vision and color discrimination, are not yet mature at birth. The full&#xD;
      development of the fovea occurs only after the 4 / 5 month of life. This process along with&#xD;
      the development of more sensitive ways, gives to the child a greater resolving power and a&#xD;
      distinct vision. The partial pressure of blood gases that regulates blood flow to the retina&#xD;
      has the same importance. Indeed oxygen consumption by the retina is constant and a defect or&#xD;
      an excess of this gas can be highly detrimental for the natural development of retinal&#xD;
      structures. An example of the importance of oxygen partial pressure in regulating retinal&#xD;
      blood flow is represented by retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), an usually bilateral&#xD;
      condition, affecting the immature retinal vessels. ROP has been one of the major cause of&#xD;
      blindness in infants in the past. Nowadays the use of oxygen concentrations based on the&#xD;
      levels of its partial pressure in the arterial blood, has reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      retinopathy. The vascularization of the retina begins on the 4th month of gestation. The&#xD;
      vessels progress from the center to the periphery, reaching the nasal area at the 8th month&#xD;
      and the temporal at the 9th month of intrauterine life. In the retinopathy of prematurity,&#xD;
      the development of retinal vasculature is impaired because the increase in PA02 levels leads&#xD;
      to an arteriolar vasoconstriction and to the obliteration of the newly formed capillaries.&#xD;
      Consequently the mesenchyme stops to proliferate, forming a marginal tissue. The arteries and&#xD;
      veins of this margin does not drain their blood in capillaries, but in small arteriovenous&#xD;
      anastomosis forming shunt. The endothelium of these new vessels is also very permeable&#xD;
      because it is immature and incomplete. The capillary bed of the shunt is largely obliterated,&#xD;
      and this causes anomalies of pressure responsible of dilation and tortuosity, microaneurysms,&#xD;
      neovascularization and resulting in exudative and haemorrhagic phenomena with the possibility&#xD;
      of developing vitreous traction and retinal detachment. This represents the active phase of&#xD;
      the disease, which often regresses spontaneously, and the magnitude of which depends on the&#xD;
      precocity of hyperoxia. The evolution could be the regression, the scarring, or more&#xD;
      frequently, a combination between the two. During pregnancy, the percentage of fatty acids in&#xD;
      maternal plasma increases to 51%. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are significantly prone to&#xD;
      oxidation, the changes in their plasma levels affect the status of the antioxidant systems in&#xD;
      pregnant and consequently in the newborn. Several studies reported that the increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy is accompanied by&#xD;
      an equivalent increase in plasma tocopherol levels but its level decreases dramatically&#xD;
      immediately after birth. Plasma antioxidant levels of the newborn were found lower if&#xD;
      compared with those of the mother. Tocopherols and carotenoids levels are significantly lower&#xD;
      in the umbilical cord than those recorded in maternal plasma and the concentration of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in the newborn is higher than that of the mother. Many scientific&#xD;
      studies have also shown an increasing interest in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species that accumulate after birth. OS is assessed by the quantification of thiobarbituric&#xD;
      acid reactive species (TBRS) in plasma. TBRS levels were significantly increased in premature&#xD;
      infants after the exposure to blue light for 96 hours. Studies on premature infants have&#xD;
      shown a correlation between low plasma levels of antioxidants and an increased risk of&#xD;
      free-radical relates diseases. Therefore it could be useful to increase antioxidant defenses&#xD;
      in infants in order to restore the redox unbalance and to prevent the damage caused by a&#xD;
      prolonged exposure to high levels of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Oxidative&#xD;
      stress is considered one of the main determinants of retinal damage as in age-related&#xD;
      diseases. A proper balance between oxidant and antioxidant factors may help to prevent or&#xD;
      reduce eye damage that can occur in newborns, especially in preterm infants, such as ROP.&#xD;
      Indeed preterm babies are often exposed to potentially harmful concentrations of oxygen due&#xD;
      to respiratory problems or undergo phototherapy with high intensity blue light. These&#xD;
      therapies are sources of free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin in the macular pigment, may&#xD;
      play an important role in protecting the eyes of the newborn from the damage of light thanks&#xD;
      to their ability to absorb blue light and their antioxidant action. Lutein increases macular&#xD;
      pigment density and can protect through two synergistic mechanisms: the absorption of blue&#xD;
      light before it reaches the sensitive retinal structures, namely the photoreceptors inducing&#xD;
      a photochemical damage, the quencing effect that determines the neutralization of singlet&#xD;
      oxygen and of other free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many evidences that suggest a protective effect of lutein against photo-oxidation&#xD;
      damage in adult (Leeuwen 2006, AREDS 1, AREDS 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lutein and zeaxanthin are present in the umbilical cord and several studies have shown that&#xD;
      there is a direct correlation between mother and newborn plasma levels of lutein. Lutein is&#xD;
      also present in breast milk in concentrations three times higher than other carotenoids with&#xD;
      the same plasma concentrations. There is also a correlation between plasma levels of lutein&#xD;
      in the mother and levels in the breastfed infant. Studies on infants have shown that&#xD;
      carotenoids levels in the first four/six months of life are very low. This is probably due to&#xD;
      the fact that the infants diet is entirely made of milk without solid foods (such as green&#xD;
      leafy vegetables) sources of this nutrient. Children breastfed have higher lutein plasma&#xD;
      levels than children fed with formula milk. The different types of formula milks are&#xD;
      currently not enriched with these carotenoids and their content of both lutein and zeaxanthin&#xD;
      is very low, except for some formulations which are prepared using egg homogenate but they&#xD;
      are not sold in Italy. Breast milk is therefore the only source of lutein for infants before&#xD;
      the weaning, and the breastfeeding is very important as a primary source of these nutrients&#xD;
      for the proper development and protection of the vision. Considering the correlation between&#xD;
      lutein content in plasma and in breast milk and the lowering of lutein levels in milk already&#xD;
      six days after birth, it is really important to take foods rich in lutein during lactation. A&#xD;
      diet enriched with lutein is especially important for mothers of premature or low birth&#xD;
      weight newborns. Indeed the premature and underweight children need many nutrients essential&#xD;
      for a rapid growth because they did not receive highly nutritious elements and energy&#xD;
      transferred from the mother during the last weeks of gestation. Moreover, their&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and renal functions are not fully developed and this could reduce the&#xD;
      absorption and retention of some micronutrients including important antioxidants that protect&#xD;
      the infant from exposure to high levels of free radicals produced in excess at birth and&#xD;
      often as a result of the resuscitation technics used. Breastfeeding is important for the&#xD;
      intake of antioxidant defenses in the newborn and the nutritional status of the mother plays&#xD;
      certainly a key role because it affects the nutritional status of the infant, and especially&#xD;
      the status of some soluble nutrients such as lutein and zeaxanthin. The preparations of&#xD;
      lutein and zeaxanthin have never had gastrointestinal or systemic toxic effects in humans&#xD;
      after supplementation. In recent studies, no adverse effects after administration of 20&#xD;
      mg/day of lutein or zeaxanthin administered for 6 months or interactions with other&#xD;
      fat-soluble nutrients were reported.&#xD;
