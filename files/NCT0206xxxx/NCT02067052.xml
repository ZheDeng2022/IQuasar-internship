    <textblock>
      Vulvar cancer is a rare disease that is treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      When tumors are large (greater than 4 cm) or compromise the urethra (urine canal) and the&#xD;
      anus, or when it is in the groin lymph nodes, surgery alone is not always able to be&#xD;
      performed. In this circumstance, is necessary to add radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far it is not known the best sequence of treatment: surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;
      The radical surgeries usually need long recovery term both in the region of the vulva and in&#xD;
      the region of the groin lymph nodes. When it is performed, convalescence can delay other&#xD;
      treatments, like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, the use of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and chemotherapy as a first step treatment can result in a complete elimination of the&#xD;
      disease in at least 30% of the cases or substantial reduction of its size, allowing less&#xD;
      extensive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to use surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of vulvar&#xD;
      cancer, but in a sequence that has not been studied, in order to increase benefits of these&#xD;
      treatments, and reduce morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be offered to patients who have disease of the vulva less than 4 cm (sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node), or greater than 4 cm, or illness that compromises urethra and anus, or patients&#xD;
      with disease in groin lymph nodes (glands).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On the eve of the surgery, investigators will inject dextran-70 labeled with&#xD;
           technetium-99 m. Only patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm will do this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the day of the surgery, the groin lymph nodes will be removed from the inguinal&#xD;
           (groin) only. If lymph nodes are disease positive, the vulvectomy will not be performed&#xD;
           at this time. Patients will be treated with radiation therapy with concomitant&#xD;
           chemotherapy for approximately six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, investigators will perform a&#xD;
           surgery to remove the remaining tumor in the vulva.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar cancer is a rare disease, striking 2 to 3/100,000 women annually. Dissemination of&#xD;
      vulvar cancer is predominantly lymphatic; contiguous invasion also occurs, though much less&#xD;
      frequently, whereas hematogenic dissemination is quite rare, especially in the absence of&#xD;
      lymphatic spread. Approximately 25% - 35% of the patients in the early stages of the disease&#xD;
      have metastasis. The standard treatment for the initial stages consists of radical excision&#xD;
      of the vulvar tumor and uni- or bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy. The latter&#xD;
      procedure is necessary, for the non-removal of the lymph nodes, even if the disease seems&#xD;
      undetectable in the nodes, may be fatal. Treatment effectiveness is good, and the likelihood&#xD;
      of a recurrence of the disease in the inguinal-femoral lymph nodes is 1% - 10% . The&#xD;
      determinants for prognosis are lymph node metastasis, tumor size and stage, depth of tumor&#xD;
      invasion, and lymphovascular involvement. In locally advanced stages of the disease,&#xD;
      involvement of the inguinal-femoral lymph node chain has consistently been demonstrated as&#xD;
      the most important predictive factor of survival for the patient. In the last 30 years,&#xD;
      changes in surgical treatment, such as separate incisions for the performance of&#xD;
      inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy and vulvectomy, preservation of the saphenous vein, and a&#xD;
      more conservative excision of the primary vulvar lesion, have reduced morbidity. Despite of&#xD;
      the advances in surgical treatment, postoperative complications are still paramount. The&#xD;
      locally advanced disease generates greater morbidity when It involves the urethra, anus, or&#xD;
      rectum, for wide resections, urinary derivations, or even pelvic exenteration is then&#xD;
      required in order to obtain an adequate surgical margin. Such procedures entail not only&#xD;
      mutilation of the patient but also a high morbidity rate. A concomitant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy (CT-RT) regimen has been advocated for the patient with the purpose of&#xD;
      downsizing the initial disease, thereby enabling a less mutilating complementary surgical&#xD;
      treatment. A study by the Gynecologic Oncology Group used preoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      combined with cisplatin / 5-fluouracil for stage III and IV patients. After the treatment,&#xD;
      only 2 (3%) out of 71 patients remained with a residual disease that showed no signs of&#xD;
      shrinking. A study using data from 63 patients with advanced vulvar cancer (stages III and&#xD;
      IV) who underwent either surgery (30 patients) first or CT-RT followed by surgery (33&#xD;
      patients), compared disease-free interval and survival and recurrence rates of the disease.&#xD;
      The patients who received CT-RT treatment before surgery were younger and had larger vulvar&#xD;
      growths and less lymph node metastasis. An important point is that the positive lymph node&#xD;
      rate of the patients just prior to surgery was 83% for those initially treated with surgery&#xD;
      and 54% for those treated with CT-RT plus surgery. This shows that, in advanced cases, CT-RT&#xD;
      reduces the mass of positive lymph nodes, but the disease persists in more than 50% of the&#xD;
      patients at the original site. Thus, excision of the lymph nodes is necessary to obtain as&#xD;
      much control over the disease as possible. As the inguinal-femoral lymph node status is the&#xD;
      most important prognostic factor in vulvar cancer, it is crucial to assess lymph node&#xD;
      condition prior to therapy in order to select the best approach strategy for the disease. At&#xD;
      present, the non-invasive techniques for the detection of lymph node metastasis are&#xD;
      insufficiently accurate.The low accuracy of the non-invasive techniques for detecting&#xD;
      inguinal-femoral lymph nodes, the importance of a diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in&#xD;
      patients with vulvar cancer in the early stages, and lymphadenectomy morbidity open the way&#xD;
      for the development of minimally invasive techniques, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy.&#xD;
      Most advantages accruing from the adoption of sentinel lymph node biopsy are related to the&#xD;
      lesser morbidity and mortality of the surgical procedure because of its reduced&#xD;
      aggressiveness. Nevertheless, the desired information concerning the metastatic potential of&#xD;
      the primary tumor is gained. In the case of other malignancies, such as breast cancer and&#xD;
      melanoma, the sentinel lymph node false negative rate is low (0%-29%; 7.3% mean).A&#xD;
      multicentric study that analyzed 403 patients with early-stage vulvar cancer (tumor up to 4&#xD;
      cm) showed that sentinel lymph node excision was a safe surgical procedure. A total of 259&#xD;
      patients with a negative sentinel lymph node were merely kept under observation after&#xD;
      surgery. Recurrence in the inguinal region was 2.5% and the survival rate in a 3-year span&#xD;
      was 97%. For the patients with a positive sentinel lymph node, a systematic inguinal-femoral&#xD;
      lymph node excision was performed. These patients benefited from a high accuracy rate in the&#xD;
      identification of micro-metastases with a predictive value close to 100%. A multicentric,&#xD;
      observational study (GROINSS-V) subsequent to the study by Van der Zee et al. examined the&#xD;
      evidence from 403 patients to determine the relationship between the metastasis size of the&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node and the metastasis risk in non-sentinel lymph nodes and disease-free&#xD;
      survival for early-stage vulvar cancer. It was impossible to establish a cutoff point below&#xD;
      which the likelihood of a non-sentinel lymph node metastasis would be close to zero, thus&#xD;
      insignificant. What was found, though, is that the larger the spread of the sentinel lymph&#xD;
      node, the greater the probability of the other lymph nodes metastasizing. Besides, if the&#xD;
      size of the sentinel lymph node was larger than 2 mm, the prognosis was bad. The present&#xD;
      study has the main purpose of outlining a new strategy for vulvar cancer treatment, combining&#xD;
      sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery in a way as yet&#xD;
      untested. Objectives: Analysis of the complete pathological response in patients with an&#xD;
      anatomicopathologic diagnosis of invasive vulva cancer, (stages II to IVa - FIGO), treated&#xD;
      with surgery, chemiotherapy and radiotherapy in the following proposal: nodal debulking of&#xD;
      the groin, chemoradiation and vulvectomy. Materials and methods: Patient enrollment: Twenty&#xD;
      one consecutive patients from the Outpatient Clinic of Gynecological Oncology, Cancer&#xD;
      Institute, São Paulo State (ICESP) with a diagnosis of vulvar carcinoma (early and advanced&#xD;
      stages) will be studied as long as they agree to participate and sign an informed consent&#xD;
      statement. All patients with tumors up to 4 cm in greatest diameter, uncompromised urethra or&#xD;
      anus, and lymph nodes smaller than 15 mm in greatest diameter in scan images will be&#xD;
      considered early-stage cases. Any other cases will be deemed advanced. In the first phase&#xD;
      will be included 21 patients. If there are seven or more complete clinical and pathological&#xD;
      response (patients who underwent surgical biopsy or surgical excision of the primary tumor&#xD;
      site), the study continued with the inclusion of further 30 patients. Preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation: Biopsy and anatomicopathologic, exam of the vulvar lesion, MRI of the pelvis and&#xD;
      vulvar region. Clinical evaluation and surgical risk assessment: Patients with early-stage&#xD;
      tumors: After sentinel lymph node analysis, patients with early-stage tumors will undergo&#xD;
      systematic uni- or bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy. In addition, an intraoperative&#xD;
      frozen-section examination of the sentinel lymph node(s) will be conducted. On the eve of&#xD;
      surgery, a peritumoral infusion will be made with dextran-70 marked with technetium-99 (a&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical from the Nuclear Medicine Service, Radiology Institute, School of&#xD;
      Medicine, USP), volume of 0.1 ml per injection point (0.3 millicurie of technetium in each&#xD;
      syringe) with total activity of 1.2 mCi in the 4 points. Following injection of the&#xD;
      peritumoral infusion, the patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy on the very same day in&#xD;
      order to locate and record the inguinal lymph nodes marked by the radioactive substance. On&#xD;
      the next day, patients will be injected with a patent blue infusion in the peritumoral area&#xD;
      immediately before the inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy. With the aid of a gamma-probe&#xD;
      (endoprobe model 2002, France), the supposedly compromised lymph nodes will be removed first&#xD;
      and then the others. Finally, the excision will be performed with a margin around the primary&#xD;
      vulvar lesion. After its identification and excision, the sentinel lymph node will be&#xD;
      dispatched for an intraoperative anatomicopathologic exam and classified as positive,&#xD;
      negative, or suspicious for neoplastic cells. It will be handled immediately after excision,&#xD;
      isolated, and subjected to transverse cuts at 1.5-mm-intervals. All fragments will be&#xD;
      embedded in paraffin, cross-sectioned to obtain 3- µm-thick cuts, and stained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin and eosin. if the initial sections of each and every paraffin block test&#xD;
      negative, the lymph node will be additionally submitted to serial cuts at 50- µm-intervals up&#xD;
      to the 6th level. From each interval of all of the fragments of all blocks, 2 sections will&#xD;
      be taken, one to be stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the other to be mounted on a&#xD;
      silane-coated slide, for immunohistochemical analysis. The initial sections of each block&#xD;
      with the transverse cuts of the lymph node at 1.5-mm-intervals will be immunohistochemically&#xD;
      examined for detection of cytokeratins anion exchanger 1 and 3(clone AE1/AE3, Dako). If the&#xD;
      sentinel lymph nodes are disease-free, the surgical procedure continues with the resection of&#xD;
      the vulvar lesion leaving a 1-cm-wide margin at the least (ideal margin=2 cm) and reaching&#xD;
      into deeper planes. An intraoperative anatomicopathologic evaluation of the surgical margins&#xD;
      is also carried out, and the patient will be excluded of the study. If the sentinel lymph&#xD;
      nodes test positive, it is a case of advanced-stage tumor, and the surgery will be stopped at&#xD;
      this time for further chemoradiation. Patients with advanced-stage tumors: Patients with&#xD;
      advanced-stage tumors, the superficial fascia was incised, and all palpably enlarged nodes&#xD;
      were removed and sent for frozen section. If proven positive for metastatic spread, no&#xD;
      further groin dissection will be undertaken. If negative, a full inguina-femoral&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy will be performed, and these patients will be excluded of the study. After&#xD;
      nodal debulking of the groin, patients will receive cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 once a week for 7&#xD;
      weeks throughout radiotherapy, which will be performed at a 45-50-Gy dose, 1.8 Gy/day, 5&#xD;
      times a week. A dose reinforcement of over 5-10 Gy may be given depending on the number of&#xD;
      compromised lymph nodes and the size or extracapsular extension of the lesion. The presence&#xD;
      of obvious metastatic disease will require the inclusion not only of inguinal lymphatic&#xD;
      drains but also of pelvic drains (even the iliac lymphatics) in the radiotherapy fields. If&#xD;
      after reevaluation for surgery, the lesion shows no signs of shrinking, a dose reinforcement&#xD;
      of up to 60 Gy or 66 Gy total dose will be administered. Surgery - resection of the vulvar&#xD;
      lesion with a 1-cm-margin at least (ideal margin = 2 cm) including the deeper planes and&#xD;
      evaluation of surgical margins by means of intraoperative anatomicopathologic exam - will be&#xD;
      performed 30-120 days after the end of chemoradiotherapy. Data analysis: The following data&#xD;
      will be analyzed: Perioperative data: % → Fisher's test; Immediate and late complications;&#xD;
      Disease-free interval; Survival. Predicted duration of project:3 years&#xD;
