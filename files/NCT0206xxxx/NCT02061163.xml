      To determine if contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and shear wave elastography can&#xD;
      accurately diagnose bowel wall inflammation and fibrosis in patients with known Crohn's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory condition that affects the intestinal tract (large&#xD;
      and small bowels). Some patients with CD may get swelling of the intestinal tract&#xD;
      (inflammation) or scarring of the intestinal tract (fibrosis). Fibrosis develops because of&#xD;
      chronic injury. Both inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) can cause the bowel to&#xD;
      narrow, which can lead to the bowel becoming blocked. The long-term goal of this project is&#xD;
      to develop new noninvasive radiology imaging tests that can show the difference between bowel&#xD;
      wall inflammation and fibrosis. Currently there are no imaging tests that can do this&#xD;
      reliably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current imaging methods (CT and MRI) that are ordered to help diagnose and follow-up CD are&#xD;
      excellent at showing inflammation, but are not accurate for finding fibrosis. CT also exposes&#xD;
      patients to small amounts of radiation, and both CT and MRI are costly. We are therefore&#xD;
      studying ultrasound imaging, as it is more cost-effective and does not expose patients to&#xD;
      radiation. CEUS uses microbubbles in a solution that are injected into a vein in one of the&#xD;
      arms. This allows doctors to see the blood flow to parts of the body. This microbubble&#xD;
      contrast agent (dye) is called Optison. Another imaging method, called shear wave&#xD;
      elastography, uses sound waves to noninvasively measure the stiffness of structures in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to be able to tell the difference between inflammation and fibrosis in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, because narrowing of the bowel due to inflammation generally responds well&#xD;
      to medications, whereas narrowing caused by fibrosis does not respond well to medications and&#xD;
      may require surgery.&#xD;
