    <textblock>
      Study of the assay, Mammostrat®. to verify its utility as a predictor or outcome tool to&#xD;
      determine whom would benefit from chemotherapy prior to surgery. Also could be used as a&#xD;
      clinical marker to identify patients with breast cancer who do not benefit from some&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapies.&#xD;

      The purpose of this phase II study is to find out if the test, Mammostrat® can be used as a&#xD;
      predictor or outcome tool to determine who will best benefit from chemotherapy prior to&#xD;
      surgery. This can be used to determine if Mammostrat assay may be used as a clinical marker&#xD;
      to identify a subset of women with breast cancer who do not benefit from preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, either taxane/taxane-like (T) chemo agents or anthracycline-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      and cyclophosphamide (AC).&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologic confirmation of invasive breast carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have intact primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with bilateral breast cancer are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with second primary breast cancers are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The primary breast tumor must be ≥ 2 cm by physical exam or imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The tumor must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative (defined by ratio of HER2 to&#xD;
                  CEP17 must be &lt; 2.2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IHC 2+ and FISH-negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Negative serum pregnancy test ≤7 days of treatment initiation and a serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test must be repeated ≤ 3 days prior to starting treatment for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (WOCBP). For WOCBP, adequate contraception must be used&#xD;
             throughout the study. For this study, acceptable methods of contraception include a&#xD;
             reliable intrauterine device or a spermicide in combination with a barrier method.&#xD;
             Women who are already on hormonal forms of birth control may continue that treatment&#xD;
             but must also use a barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent&#xD;
             and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information, and agree to&#xD;
             abide by the study restrictions and return for the required assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient must be willing to undergo breast biopsies as required by the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Sufficient tissue must be available from the diagnostic core biopsies. If not,&#xD;
             patients must undergo additional biopsies to perform Mammostrat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies diagnosed and treated within&#xD;
             the previous 5 years, except non-melanoma skin cancer and non-invasive cervical&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of New York Heart Association class III or greater cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or symptomatic&#xD;
             conduction abnormality within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., active systemic infection,&#xD;
             diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart Failure or major&#xD;
             surgery) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the&#xD;
             patient or compromise the ability of the patient to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or nursing women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known allergic reaction to Cremophor or any of the chemo agents on this trial.&#xD;
