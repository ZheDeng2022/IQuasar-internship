    <textblock>
      M032 is a second-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that is conditionally&#xD;
      replication competent; that is, similar to G207, a first generation oHSV, it can replicate in&#xD;
      tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this&#xD;
      process. Replication of M032 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells, but&#xD;
      causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are&#xD;
      released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the&#xD;
      vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic&#xD;
      activity, the virus carries a therapeutic payload--acting as a gene therapy vector, too--and&#xD;
      causes the tumor cell to synthesize and secrete an immunity-stimulating protein called&#xD;
      Interleukin-12 (IL-12) before it is killed. This IL-12 is released and promotes an immune&#xD;
      response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy.&#xD;
      The IL-12 that is expressed can also produce an anti-angiogenic effect, by interfering with&#xD;
      the production of new tumor blood vessels necessary to allow tumor growth. Anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapies potentially starve the tumor of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Thus, the M032 oHSV&#xD;
      produces three different potential mechanisms for antitumor effects. The virus has also been&#xD;
      genetically-engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects for the patient&#xD;
      receiving the therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme,&#xD;
             anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy: Patients must have failed external beam radiotherapy to the brain, and&#xD;
             if eligible and tolerated, undergone appropriate treatment with temozolomide&#xD;
             chemotherapy. All radiation and additional chemotherapies must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Prior therapy with nitrosoureas must have been&#xD;
             completed at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years (age of majority for clinical trials in Alabama). Because no dosing or&#xD;
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of M032 in patients &lt;18 years of&#xD;
             age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             phase 1 single-agent trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes: &gt;3,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count: &gt;1,500/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets: &gt;100,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)(aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT(SGPT)(alanine aminotransferase): &lt;2.5 X&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance: &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual lesion must be ≥1.0 cm and &lt; 5.5 cm in diameter without bilateral extension&#xD;
             through the corpus callosum as determined by MRI as this is a locally delivered&#xD;
             treatment. These parameters will be re-evaluated on imaging done on the day of&#xD;
             catheter implantation and if the lesion no longer meets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of M032 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to&#xD;
             study entry and for the first six months after receiving M032. Because it is currently&#xD;
             unknown if M032 can be transmitted by sexual contact, a barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control must be employed and for six (6) months following the administration of the&#xD;
             study drug. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. For two weeks after receiving M032,&#xD;
             subjects should avoid intimate contact with pregnant women, infants and young children&#xD;
             and individuals with decreased immunity (ability to fight infection). Subjects should&#xD;
             also refrain from donating blood during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant; this will be confirmed by a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid use is allowed as long as dose has not increased within 2 weeks of scheduled&#xD;
             M032 administration. Whenever possible, the patient should be on a steroid dose that&#xD;
             is equivalent to a dexamethasone dose of ≤ 2mg daily at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas), surgical resection within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to entering the study, or have received experimental viral therapy or gene&#xD;
             therapy at any time (e.g., adenovirus, retrovirus or herpes virus protocol). However,&#xD;
             this does not preclude re-treatment with M032 at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to therapeutic interventions&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar biologic composition&#xD;
             to M032 or to IL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor involvement which would require ventricular, brainstem, basal ganglia, or&#xD;
             posterior fossa inoculation or would require access through a ventricle in order to&#xD;
             deliver treatment. Also, since M032 is a local treatment, patients whose tumors have&#xD;
             bilateral extension through the corpus callosum, those with actively growing&#xD;
             multifocal disease by MRI, and/or CSF dissemination/ leptomeningeal disease, are&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or other CNS infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required steroid increase within 2 weeks of scheduled M032 administration. When&#xD;
             possible, the patient should be on a dexamethasone equivalent dose of ≤ 2mg daily at&#xD;
             the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active oral herpes lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy with any drug active against HSV (acyclovir, valacyclovir,&#xD;
             penciclovir, famciclovir, gancyclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or any other medical condition that precludes surgery. Also, psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excluded patient groups&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M032 is a viral oncolytic&#xD;
                  therapy with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
                  there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
                  secondary to treatment of the mother with M032, breastfeeding women will not be&#xD;
                  included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because patients with immune deficiency will be unable to mount the anticipated&#xD;
                  immune response underlying this therapeutic rationale, HIV-seropositive patients&#xD;
                  are excluded from this study. Other treatment studies for this disease that are&#xD;
                  less dependent on the patients' immune response are more appropriate for&#xD;
                  HIV-seropositive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history of allergic reaction to IV contrast material that is not&#xD;
             amenable to pre-treatment by University of Alabama at Birmingham protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pacemakers, ferro-magnetic aneurysm clips, metal infusion pumps, metal&#xD;
             or shrapnel fragments or certain types of stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of Gliadel Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy within 4 weeks of scheduled M032&#xD;
             administration. (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) greater than 4 weeks of scheduled&#xD;
             M032 administration does not exclude patient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other reason the investigator deems subject is unfit for participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
