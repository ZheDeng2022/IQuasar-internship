      Both clinical and experimental studies demonstrate the importance of the pre-existing, ie&#xD;
      innate collateral supply in different vascular regions. Furthermore, pathophysiological&#xD;
      considerations and experimental data imply an important role for the association of&#xD;
      collateral function between different vascular regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESES 1. In the absence of atherosclerotic stenoses, there is a direct association&#xD;
      between the collateral function in the coronary, renal and peripheral circulation. 2. The&#xD;
      increase in plasma renin in response to a unilateral main renal artery balloon occlusion is&#xD;
      inversely related to its functional collateral supply. 3. The decrease in renal vein oxygen&#xD;
      saturation in response to a unilateral main renal artery occlusion is inversely related to&#xD;
      its functional collateral supply.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTECTIVE EFFECT AND INTER-INDIVIDUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE COLLATERAL CIRCULATION IN&#xD;
      DIFFERENT VASCULAR REGIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of all vascular regions, the collateral circulation of the heart is probably the most&#xD;
      extensively studied since the initial studies by Fulton.1 The clinical importance of the&#xD;
      coronary collateral circulation2 has been established by numerous investigations&#xD;
      demonstrating a protective role of well vs. poorly grown coronary collateral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas involvement of the peripheral arterial network by obstructive arterial disease is&#xD;
      frequently asymptomatic, it is, nevertheless, relevant through the association with increased&#xD;
      mortality and as a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The clinical&#xD;
      relevance of the collateral circulation in the lower extremities can be epitomized by the&#xD;
      discrepancy of frequently encountered long segmental occlusions and the rare occurrence of&#xD;
      severe ischemia or amputation. With regard to a systematic evaluation of this apparently&#xD;
      well-collateralized region, it was, however, only very recently that assessment using a&#xD;
      direct and quantitative method was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the kidney, the collateral circulation has hitherto been subject to systematic&#xD;
      research only in experimental studies,while data in humans are sparse and limited to&#xD;
      angiographic assessment. While the hypertensive effect of renal arterial constriction is&#xD;
      well-known since the seminal studies of Goldblatt in 1934, the effect of renal collaterals in&#xD;
      this context has been neglected despite the readily apparent effects therefrom in the same&#xD;
      experiment. The duration of the ensuing hypertension was only short in Goldblatt's&#xD;
      experiments with dogs, an observation explained by the abating effect of efficient&#xD;
      collaterals on renal artery constriction and consequently developing reduction of the renal&#xD;
      ischemia. In humans, only limited and indirect data on the compensatory effect of the renal&#xD;
      collateral circulation in the setting of renal arterial constriction exist.The ratio of&#xD;
      selective renin concentrations sampled from the renal vein of both kidneys&#xD;
      (affected/unaffected) is commonly used to assess the hemodynamic significance of a unilateral&#xD;
      renal artery stenosis. Ernst et al., in 37 patients with unilateral renal stenosis,&#xD;
      determined the (selective) renal vein renin ratio and additionally performed angiography for&#xD;
      presence of renal collaterals( documented in 68%). Renal collaterals tended to normalize&#xD;
      renin excretion in a kidney affected by renal artery stenosis. Indeed, 7 patients with a&#xD;
      severe stenosis and visible renal collaterals had a normal renin ratio below the cut-off of&#xD;
      1.4. The clinical relevance of renal artery stenosis is underscored by its prevalence in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients undergoing routine cardiac angiography.22, 23 In the above&#xD;
      context, it is noteworthy that hypertension is not present in almost one half of patients&#xD;
      with angiographically significant narrowing of a renal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-EXISTING COLLATERAL CIRCULATION AND ITS INTRA-INDIVIDUAL DISTRIBUTION As alluded to&#xD;
      before, acute vascular occlusion in arteriosclerosis can ensue in the absence of relevant&#xD;
      narrowing. In this situation, solely the native, pre-existing collateral extent can lessen&#xD;
      the ischemic tissue injury. On the other hand, the gradual narrowing of a vessel allows&#xD;
      development of large arterial anastomoses from pre-existing smaller arterioles in the process&#xD;
      known as arteriogenesis. The notion that the pre-existing collateral extent nevertheless&#xD;
      remains the basis for the capacity of anastomoses to enlarge is supported by an instructive&#xD;
      experimental study by Zbinden et al.: Flow recovery after superficial femoral artery ligation&#xD;
      correlated strikingly with the pre-existing collateral extent. Thus, mice with an already&#xD;
      high level of pre-existing collaterals had concordantly high flow recovery, while mice with&#xD;
      low levels of pre-existing collaterals had low flow recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the systemic process of atherosclerosis, the preformed or innate human collateral&#xD;
      function in the different vascular regions mentioned before is of interest. On a patient&#xD;
      level, this relates to the intra-, as opposed to the inter-individual distribution of the&#xD;
      collateral network. While the inter-individual distribution of collateral function in humans&#xD;
      has been shown to vary widely also in the absence of vascular narrowings, recent experimental&#xD;
      studies in mice have shown that innate collateral extent is shared qualitatively in different&#xD;
      tissues. However, in humans, the association between the collateral function in different&#xD;
      vascular regions in humans has so far not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, both clinical and experimental studies demonstrate the importance of the&#xD;
      pre-existing, ie innate collateral supply in different vascular regions. Furthermore,&#xD;
      pathophysiological considerations and experimental data imply an important role for the&#xD;
      association of collateral function between different vascular regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the in vivo prevalence and distribution of functional collateral supply in the&#xD;
      coronary, renal and peripheral circulation, and the intra-individual association of&#xD;
      collateral function between the different vascular territories. Additionally, the effect of&#xD;
      renal collaterals on the response of the kidney to a short bout of ischemia will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
