  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of heated&#xD;
      intra-abdominal oxaliplatin that can be given to patients with colon cancer. Researchers also&#xD;
      want to learn more about the ways that pediatric and young adult colon cancer may be&#xD;
      different from colon cancer in adults.&#xD;

      Surgery and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, abdominal surgery will be&#xD;
      performed to try to remove as many tumors as possible. The abdominal surgery is not being&#xD;
      performed specifically for this research study and would be performed even if you did not&#xD;
      take part in this study. You will be given a separate consent form to sign that explains the&#xD;
      details and risks of surgery in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, the abdomen will be temporarily closed. Then the abdominal wash will begin.&#xD;
      During the &quot;abdominal wash,&quot; heated oxaliplatin will be delivered through plastic tubing that&#xD;
      is connected to a pump into the abdomen. The pump pushes the heated oxaliplatin into the&#xD;
      abdomen and then pulls it out and recirculates the oxaliplatin. The skin of the abdomen is&#xD;
      temporarily closed during the abdominal wash. The surgeon will also &quot;wash&quot; over the closed&#xD;
      area of the surgical site. A pump will be used to pump heated oxaliplatin in and out of the&#xD;
      abdomen over 90 minutes while the surgeon gently presses on the abdominal wall so the&#xD;
      oxaliplatin reaches all areas in the abdomen. After 90 minutes, the oxaliplatin is removed&#xD;
      and the abdomen will be &quot;washed&quot; with saline and all fluid will be removed before the surgeon&#xD;
      permanently closes the abdomen with 3 layers of stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) pea-sized tissue samples (tumor and normal abdominal tissue), 2 tablespoons of blood&#xD;
      will be sent to the laboratory of Dr. Scott Kopetz for tissue evaluation and extraction of&#xD;
      RNA (genetic material). One (1) tumor sample will be removed before the procedure and the&#xD;
      other sample will be removed at the end of the procedure. The samples will be examined under&#xD;
      a microscope and DNA (the genetic material in cells) will be removed to look for any changes&#xD;
      to the DNA. The results of these tests will not be shared with you, nor will they be used for&#xD;
      any decisions regarding your treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a chance that the surgeon may decide during the surgery that the abdominal wash will&#xD;
      not be performed, for example if the disease has spread to or attached to certain organs. If&#xD;
      this occurs, your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2-5, 11, 14, and 30 after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 30 only, you will have a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have follow up visits at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery. If these visits occur here at MD Anderson, you will not have a hearing test,&#xD;
      but you will have an MRI, CT, or PET-CT scan to check the status of the disease. The 3 and 6&#xD;
      month visits following surgery may be performed at your local doctor's office and/or&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for up to 6 months. You will be taken off study if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor learns that the disease has come back or gotten worse at the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up visit, you may be eligible for a re-perfusion, which is a repeat of the surgery and&#xD;
      study drug administration. If you are eligible for a re-perfusion, your participation on this&#xD;
      study will end and you will be given a new consent form to sign in order to be re-enrolled&#xD;
      back onto this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Oxaliplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, metastatic testicular cancer, metastatic ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, metastatic appendiceal cancer, and abdominal&#xD;
      mesothelioma. The use of heated oxaliplatin given intra-abdominally in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with colon cancer is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is&#xD;
      designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>MTD is highest dose in which 1 or fewer patients in 6 treated experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT may occur at any time during the initial hospitalization before discharge following the hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HITC). DLT defined in two ways: Hematologic DLT defined as Grade IV neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia; and Non-hematologic DLT is any Grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity excluding Grade III nausea or vomiting, Grade III hepatic toxicity which returns to Grade I within two weeks of the HITC, or before hospital discharge, or Grade III fever occurring after the HITC.</description>
