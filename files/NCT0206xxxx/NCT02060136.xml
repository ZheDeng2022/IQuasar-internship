  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary diaries have proven to be beneficial in assessing lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
      (LUTS), however they have not achieved widespread acceptance. The likely reason is the fact&#xD;
      that the pen and paper diaries are labor intensive for both patient (need to carry a pen and&#xD;
      paper and record each event) and doctor (need to transfer, summarize and analyze the data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Electronic voiding diary, would automate the recording and analysis of data,&#xD;
      expedite the process, improve its accuracy and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic recording of lower urinary tract symptoms (SUF) uses wireless phone and web based&#xD;
      technologies to record LUTS remotely and store the data on a secure website which can be&#xD;
      accessed by the doctor or patient whenever needed. The goal of this study was to compare its&#xD;
      validity and reliability to the traditional micturition chart (MC) recording method - the&#xD;
      current gold standard where the patient records the time of micturition and degree of urgency&#xD;
      using a pen and paper.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SUF records the sound of the urine stream striking the water in a toilet bowl. This generates&#xD;
      a sound file, which resembles the standard uroflowmetry recording. The degree of urgency is&#xD;
      recorded by pressing the number 1-5 on the key pad which corresponds to the 5-point urgency&#xD;
      scale. Urgency is recorded immediately following micturition or whenever experiencing urgency&#xD;
      without bladder emptying. A dedicated server runs a program, which automatically processes&#xD;
      incoming data. All data recorded from an individual is stored prospectively, in separate&#xD;
      files, on a secure website. Each record is associated with a time stamp, providing&#xD;
      information on urinary frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pen and pencil MC will be used to record baseline parameters (voiding urgency and&#xD;
      frequency). Quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated using International Prostate Symptom&#xD;
      Score (IPSS) Questionnaire, and two standardized questions: Quality of Life due to Urinary&#xD;
      Symptoms (QoL US) and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame: Participants were followed for the duration of the study which consists of two&#xD;
      three day periods when every micturition event and lower urinary tract symptom not associated&#xD;
      with micturition was recorded. An expected average time will be 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty nine men, average age 67.8 years (range 49 - 80), which presented to the urology&#xD;
      clinic with LUTS, were included in the study. After signing the informed consent, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to record every micturition and degree of urgency using SUF for a period of 3&#xD;
      days. They will then be asked to record their frequency of micturition and the degree of&#xD;
      every episode of urgency using a pen and paper MC for an equal length of time. The efficacy&#xD;
      of recording LUTS with each method will be analyzed and compared. The content validity of SUF&#xD;
      (assessment of whether the instrument makes sense to patients), will be assessed at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study when all patients will be interviewed one-on-one by a specialized&#xD;
      research nurse. Patients will be asked to state their preference for one of the two diaries,&#xD;
      and disclose the number of events they forgot to or could not record. The construct validity&#xD;
      (relationship between the recorded data and underlying theories) will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      correlation of symptoms recorded with SUF or MC based on QoL measures. The results of this&#xD;
      study will be compared to previously published evidence, suggesting that more severe LUTS are&#xD;
      associated with a lower score on the health related QoL questionnaires.&#xD;
