  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the United States, and is on the rise in many&#xD;
      industrialized nations. The rate of recidivism for long-term weight loss is substantial and&#xD;
      presents a critical problem given the importance of obesity as a modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      diseases like type 2 diabetes. Further, the comorbidity of depression with diseases like&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease suggest that there may be an underlying&#xD;
      shared biology for diseases of metabolic dysfunction and emotional dysregulation. The shared&#xD;
      biology of these diseases may actually promote the precipitation and exacerbation of comorbid&#xD;
      conditions, impacting the success of treatment. Endogenous opioid systems regulate a number&#xD;
      of physiological and psychological processes including mood, energy management, and reward.&#xD;
      Endogenous opioid µ-receptor-mediated reward processing is thought to be involved both in the&#xD;
      short-term control of eating and hedonic food consumption, based on data in animal models.&#xD;
      The present proposal will examine the function of the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) system in lean&#xD;
      and obese human volunteers following an overnight fast and the change in µ-opioid receptor&#xD;
      occupancy (i.e., endogenous opioid release) following the consumption of a standardized meal&#xD;
      using PET imaging with the µ-selective radiotracer [11C]carfentanil. The obese individuals&#xD;
      will be retested in the fasting and fed state following a 15% weight loss with a Very Low&#xD;
      Calorie Diet. Further, the investigators will evaluate the function of the MOR system within&#xD;
      the context of the individual's metabolic and psychological profile including aspects of mood&#xD;
      and inhibitory control. This information will provide the neurobiological bases to develop&#xD;
      novel avenues of intervention based on individual variations in central mechanisms associated&#xD;
      with motivational systems and appetite and their potential role in weight regain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that overeating in chronically obese individuals will be&#xD;
      associated with a dysregulation of MOR system function, manifested by reductions in baseline&#xD;
      MOR availability (binding potential, BP) in limbic and reward circuitry, and lower release of&#xD;
      endogenous opioids after a standard meal, compared to lean volunteers. The latter is observed&#xD;
      as acute reductions in the BP measure after meal ingestion.&#xD;

      Neuroimaging Study. Male and Female volunteers will be recruited from the Investigational&#xD;
      Weight Management Clinic (IWMC) at the University of Michigan for this study. All&#xD;
      neuropsychological instruments will be collected in lean and obese individuals at baseline,&#xD;
      and between 4-6-months. Obese individuals will undergo 4 PET scans: 1) at baseline following&#xD;
      an overnight fast; 2) at baseline following consumption of an Ensure shake; 3) after at least&#xD;
      a15% reduction in body weight following an overnight fast; 4) and following consumption of an&#xD;
      Ensure shake at the post-weight loss time point. Lean individuals will undergo the two scans&#xD;
      at baseline after fasting and post-Ensure shake consumption. All lean subjects will consume&#xD;
      their normal diets prior to the initial scanning. The obese subjects will undergo their&#xD;
      second set of scans, post-weight loss, while still consuming the HMR diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging Measures. Two PET studies with [11C]carfentanil (a selective µ-opioid receptor&#xD;
      radiotracer) will be acquired for each lean volunteer and 4 PET studies with [11C]carfentanil&#xD;
      will be acquired for obese individuals. Structural and functional MRI will be acquired for&#xD;
      obese individuals before and after weight loss, and for lean individuals at baseline for&#xD;
      co-registration and anatomical standardization of the PET data and activation response to&#xD;
      visual stimuli. After their completion, the following data will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analyses: 1) Baseline µ-opioid receptor availability in vivo (binding potential, BPND) in&#xD;
      lean and obese individuals following an overnight fast. 2) µ-opioid system activation after&#xD;
      consuming 500 kcal (16fl oz, 18% protein, 14% CHO, 25% fat) of Ensure shake (fed) in lean and&#xD;
      obese individuals as measured by acute reductions in BPND. 3) Baseline MOR BPND in obese&#xD;
      individuals who have lost ≥15% of their body weight over 4-6 months (fasting), following an&#xD;
      overnight fast. 4) µ-opioid system activation in obese individuals who have lost ≥15% of&#xD;
      their body weight after consuming 250 kcal of Ensure shake (fed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Acquisition. Briefly, [11C]carfentanil a selective and specific µ-opioid receptor&#xD;
      radioligand, is administered at tracer doses using a bolus/continuous infusion protocol to&#xD;
      achieve rapid steady-states between specific and non-specific binding regions (5-7 min&#xD;
      post-tracer administration). Twenty-eight frames will be acquired over 70 minutes with an&#xD;
      increasing duration (30 sec to 5 min). Two scans will be acquired twice each: A baseline,&#xD;
      without challenges, and a scan following consumption of an Ensure shake. Subsequently,&#xD;
      dynamic image data for the receptor scans is transformed, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, into&#xD;
      parametric maps, and co-registered to each other. These include, 1) a tracer transport&#xD;
      measure (K1 ratio, proportional to cerebral blood flow; tracer transport = blood flow x&#xD;
      tracer extraction), and receptor-related measures, (BPND), during 2) baseline scans, and 3)&#xD;
      following shake consumption. The reduction in BPND from baseline to post-shake consumption&#xD;
      represents a measure of endogenous opioid system activation following shake consumption&#xD;
      (related to the occupancy and ligand-receptor interactions by the endogenous ligand). These&#xD;
      parametric images are calculated using a modified Logan graphical analysis, with the&#xD;
      occipital cortex as the reference region. PET images are then co-registered to the T1 MRI&#xD;
      structural, anatomical image, affine transformed and warped to standard Montreal Neurological&#xD;
      Institute (MNI) stereotactic space using mutual information algorithms. The baseline scan, in&#xD;
      the fasted state, will precede the post-consumption scan due to time constraints, and to&#xD;
      avoid carry-over effects from active (fed) to baseline (fasted) states. Both PET scans will&#xD;
      be performed on the same day to reduce travel time for the subjects and hence experimental&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measures Psychobehavioral measures to be acquired during the imaging studies&#xD;
      include: The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Profile of Mood Scales, State portion of the&#xD;
      Spielberg Anxiety Inventory, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for appetite and palatability&#xD;
      will be administered before and after each experiment. These measures will assess emotional&#xD;
      state and appetite for correlative purposes with changes in neuroreceptor and circulating&#xD;
      hormone levels during performance of the studies. The MINI International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview (MINI600), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR), EuroQol measure of&#xD;
      health outcome, Trait portion of the Anxiety Inventory, and NEO Personality Inventory will be&#xD;
      obtained prior to scanning for secondary analyses (e.g. relationship between imaging measures&#xD;
      and &quot;stable&quot; traits).&#xD;
