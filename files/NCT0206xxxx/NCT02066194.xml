  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved to become an important diagnostic tool and its&#xD;
      interventional role is rapidly expanding. In order to improve patient's comfort and&#xD;
      satisfaction during and after procedure, the use of sedation is usually recommended. However,&#xD;
      sedation may be associated with serious adverse events of including hypotension, aspiration&#xD;
      and respiratory depression. Moreover, the cost of performing the procedure would be increased&#xD;
      due to the costs of the medications and the need of additional personnel in monitoring of the&#xD;
      patient. As a result, the drive to seek alternative and safer approaches of pain-relief&#xD;
      during EUS is ever present. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used in Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine (TCM) for more than 2000 years. The benefits and success of EA in treatment of acute&#xD;
      and chronic pain of various origins have been well-recognised. Many researches have been&#xD;
      performed to address the role of EA in treating pain and anxiety during OGD and colonoscopy.&#xD;
      However, only limited data is availabe in the Chinese and the Western literature concerning&#xD;
      the use of EA in EUS. Therefore it is worthwhile to conduct a well-designed study to evaluate&#xD;
      the role of EA in treating pain during EUS.&#xD;
