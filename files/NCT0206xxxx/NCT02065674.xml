      Objective: To ascertain whether homoeopathic medicine ABROMA AUGUSTA has a clinical role in&#xD;
      changing the Glycated Hb Level in Diabetes mellitus Type II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most important epidemic diseases in&#xD;
      the world in this century, and accounts for 90% of cases of diabetes globally. Studies have&#xD;
      suggested that Abroma Augusta plays a role in acute controlling blood glucose level. The aim&#xD;
      of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of &quot;Abroma Augusta Ѳ&quot; in chronic control through&#xD;
      GlycatedHb (HbA1c %) in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (NIDDM) as a pretest post-test study.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset&#xD;
      diabetes) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)&#xD;
      in the context of insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin. According to recent survey&#xD;
      reports about 5% of the total world population is suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. The&#xD;
      incidence rate is also reasonably high in India. Currently about 20% of Indian Population is&#xD;
      at High risk to develop Diabetes Mellitus in future i.e. they are having abnormal glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance test. Studies have revealed that diabetic women suffer more than men. Diabetes is&#xD;
      the single most important metabolic disease which can affect nearly every organ system in the&#xD;
      body. According to the World Health Organization estimates, India had 32 million diabetic&#xD;
      subjects in the year 2000 and this number would increase to 80 million by the year 2030. The&#xD;
      International Diabetes Federation (IDF) also reported that the total number of diabetic&#xD;
      subjects in India is 41 million in 2006 and that this would rise to 70 million by the year&#xD;
      2025. A male who is diabetic has double the chances of heart failure. In case of women it&#xD;
      grows to almost 5 times and it is 8 times more if the patient is a young female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of diabetes is rapidly rising all over the globe at an alarming rate1 . Over&#xD;
      the past 30 yr, the status of diabetes has changed from being considered as a mild disorder&#xD;
      of the elderly to one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality affecting the youth and&#xD;
      middle aged people. It is important to note that the rise in prevalence is seen in all six&#xD;
      inhabited continents of the globe2 . Although there is an increase in the prevalence of type&#xD;
      1 diabetes also, the major driver of the epidemic is the more common form of diabetes, namely&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of all diabetes cases. Nowhere is&#xD;
      the diabetes epidemic more pronounced than in India as the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      reports show that 32 million people had diabetes in the year 2000. The International Diabetes&#xD;
      Federation (IDF) estimates the total number of diabetic subjects to be around 40.9 million in&#xD;
      India and this is further set to rise to 69.9 million by the year 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes - and the&#xD;
      less controlled your blood sugar - the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes&#xD;
      complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular disease.Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various&#xD;
           cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina),&#xD;
           heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels&#xD;
           (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause&#xD;
           tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or&#xD;
           fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of&#xD;
           feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause&#xD;
           problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to&#xD;
           erectile dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney damage (nephropathy). The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters&#xD;
           (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate&#xD;
           filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage&#xD;
           kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye damage (retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic&#xD;
           retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of&#xD;
           other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk&#xD;
           of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious&#xD;
           infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot&#xD;
           or leg amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including&#xD;
           bacterial and fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The&#xD;
           poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are&#xD;
           theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So Diabetes is associated with long term complications that affect almost every major part of&#xD;
      the body. Type 2 diabetes is initially managed by increasing exercise and dietary changes. If&#xD;
      blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered by these measures, medications or intervention&#xD;
      is needed. In those on medication, there is absolute requirement of routinely check up of&#xD;
      blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good number of Homoeopathic medicine to control blood sugar level. They are&#xD;
      Cephalandra Indica, Syzegium, Gymnema Sylvestree, Abroma Augusta, Rhus Aromatica rtc. It is&#xD;
      noticed that the blood sugar (HbA1c) is not controlled by other system of medicine; the&#xD;
      patients come for Homoeopathic treatment and after homoeopathic treatment there is a&#xD;
      remarkable improvement in FBS, PPBS as well as HbA1c along with the general improvement of&#xD;
      health like tiredness, lethargy, numbness, polyurea, polydypsia and polyphagia etc. But there&#xD;
      is no scientific validation for that. Among those Abroma Augusta is selected for this study&#xD;
      and this study is conducted for achieving the scientific validation, the homoeopathic&#xD;
      hypoglycemic &quot;Abroma Augusta&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABROMA AUGUSTA Family: Sterculiaceae Bengali/vernacular name: Ulatkambal. Tribal name:&#xD;
      Polumaoeba (Chakma); Daiya (Garo). English name: Devil's Cotton. Usually it has been used&#xD;
      widely as an emmenagogue but its glycemic use is rare. Abroma Augusta commonly known as Olat&#xD;
      Kambal. The plant of Abroma Augusta grows wild throughout the hotter part of India. In&#xD;
      ancient times, it was used therapeutically as an emmenagogue in menstrual disorders. Late Dr.&#xD;
      D.N.Roy of Calcutta proved this drug. A tincture of the drug is prepared from its leaves&#xD;
      according to class III of American Homeopathic Pharmacopoea. It is used in diabetes insipidus&#xD;
      with very gratifying results. Clinically it is indicated in Diabetes, albuminuria, enuresis,&#xD;
      debility, vertigo, sleeplessness, carbuncle, amenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the plant: ABROMA AUGUSTA L. is a large shrub. Leaves large, 10-15 by 10-12.5&#xD;
      cm, repand - denticulate, upper smaller, narrower, entire. Flower is solitary, auxiliary,&#xD;
      pendulous, peduncle up to 4 cm long; sepals 2.5 cm, lanceolate; petals scarcely exceeding the&#xD;
      sepals, dark red.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical constituents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leaves contain taraxerol, its acetate and β-sitosterol. Stem bark contains friedelin and&#xD;
      β-sitosterol. Root and root bark contain gum, fixed oil, resin, alkaloids, abromine, choline&#xD;
      and betaine, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, digitonide, magenesium salts of hydroxyl acids and&#xD;
      polysaccharide. Seeds contain 20.2% fixed oil with 71.5% linoleic acid. Augustic acid an&#xD;
      oleanane derivative and a stigmasterol glycoside have been isolated from the roots. Heartwood&#xD;
      contains β-sitosterol, glycol and octacosane-1, 28-diol (Ghani, 2003; Rastogi &amp; Mehrotra,&#xD;
      1993; Asolkar et al., 1992). Among them Taraxerol is the most important component which has&#xD;
      hypoglycemic as well as anti-inflammatory action. It also contains flavinoid &amp; phenolic&#xD;
      component and they are phyto- antioxidant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homoeopathic uses: Fragmentary proving was conducted by Dr. D.N. Ray of Calcutta in 1919 and&#xD;
      Dr. Jugal Kishore of New Delhi in 1972. It has been subsequently proved by CCRH and has shown&#xD;
      its affinity for female reproductive organs producing symptoms of dysmenorrhoea and&#xD;
      leucorrhoea, which have been confirmed during verification trials too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus - Urine profuse &lt; at night and of high specific gravity. Excessive thirst&#xD;
      with dryness of mouth. Patient suffers from insomnia and prostration, and patient is averse&#xD;
      to do any physical and intellectual labour. Mentally patient is of irritable nature,&#xD;
      forgetful and morose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysmenorrhoea - Colicky pains in lower abdomen. Menses are irregular, lasting for short or&#xD;
      long time. Blood is dark and clotted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is lots of study on Aboma Augusta in modern system of Medicie as well as the Ayurveda&#xD;
      on Rats and it was proved that this drug has not only the hypoglycemic effect (Taraxerol) but&#xD;
      also has effect on antioxidant and lipid control. So this study was conducted to investigate&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy on Human being.&#xD;
