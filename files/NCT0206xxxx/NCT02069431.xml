  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The life expectancy of older Americans continues to increase, with persons aged &gt; 65 years&#xD;
      representing the fastest growing segment of the US population (Manton et al., 1995). While&#xD;
      prolongation of life remains an important public health goal, a goal of even greater&#xD;
      significance is that extended life should involve preservation of the capacity to live&#xD;
      independently and to function well physically, cognitively, and socioemotionally (Katz et&#xD;
      al., 1983). Therefore, identification of proven interventions to maintaining functioning&#xD;
      across these domains and prevent disability is a major public health challenge (Branch et&#xD;
      al., 1991). Greater physical and cognitive independence in older adults has been shown to&#xD;
      crucially influence social integration in old age (Cornwell &amp; Waite, 2009), resulting in&#xD;
      significant increase in quality of life and reduction of risk for morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      social stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (Bassuk et al., 1999; Seeman, 1996). A&#xD;
      promising candidate to promote functional levels across physical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      socioemotional domains is the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) (Barraza et al., 2013; Bartz et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Feifel et al., 2012; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011; Szeto et al., 2012). Combining&#xD;
      neuroendocrine with behavioral approaches (e.g., performance-based measures of physical and&#xD;
      cognitive function), the proposed multidisciplinary research therefore sets out to clarify&#xD;
      the extent to which intranasal administration of OT over a period of 4 weeks can reduce&#xD;
      inflammation and improve physical and cognitive function in older men. Constituting a&#xD;
      complementary piece to the IRB approved currently ongoing Faces Study (IRB # 39-2013), this&#xD;
      project will also allow examination of interactions between OT's effect on physical health,&#xD;
      cognition, and socioemotional function.&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 baseline study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-week treatment phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 study visits after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up phone contact&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will be conducted at the Institute on Aging or the McKnight Brain Institute&#xD;
      at the University of Florida. The treatment phase will take place in the participant's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be assigned by chance to receive either the oxytocin or the placebo. The&#xD;
      placebo is a substance, like salt water, that looks like and is given in the same way as the&#xD;
      oxytocin but contains no oxytocin. Neither the participant nor the research assistant will&#xD;
      know which type of dose they are getting. This information is coded and securely stored away&#xD;
      until the data is analyzed, but that information is available if it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: Together with the information obtained in the phone pre-screening that the&#xD;
      investigators have already conducted, the main purpose of the screening visit is to find out&#xD;
      if the participant is eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will ask the participant questions about their health condition and&#xD;
           recent activities and the investigators will review the participant's current and past&#xD;
           medical health as well as their education and living situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will then have a short physical exam by a licensed physician including&#xD;
           measurement of blood pressure and pulse, and a brief consultation to go over the&#xD;
           participant's medical review. This will not be a clinical doctor visit for routine&#xD;
           medical care, but a visit to confirm the participant's eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
           study. Next, the participant's vision will be tested. The participant will be asked to&#xD;
           view a rotating C-shape and identify the direction of the break in the C faces. The C&#xD;
           will get larger and smaller depending on the participant's response and in another task&#xD;
           the shade of grey for the C and the background will vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the physical status of the participant will be determined based on the following&#xD;
      activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to walk at his/her usual pace for a distance of 13 feet (4&#xD;
           meters) two (2) separate times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to stand from a sitting position, without using their&#xD;
           arms. If they are able to perform this task, they will be asked to stand up from and sit&#xD;
           down on a chair five (5) times as fast as they can.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to maintain their balance while standing in three&#xD;
           different positions, 1) with feet together, 2) with the heel of one foot beside the big&#xD;
           toe of the other foot, and 3) the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of&#xD;
           the other foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood draw (~30milileters or ~2 tablespoons) and urine collection (~2mL or ~0.14 tbs)&#xD;
           will follow. Result of blood or/and urine testing may indicate that the participant&#xD;
           should not participate in the study. The blood test will also be used to determine the&#xD;
           level of oxytocin occurring normally in the participant's blood and to determine level&#xD;
           of inflammation in their body. If any incidental or clinically significant findings&#xD;
           occur, the investigator will inform you of this and give you a copy of the lab results.&#xD;
           The participant will also be encouraged to see their primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the blood and a saliva sample (~2mL or ~ 0.14 tbs) that the participant will be&#xD;
           asked to provide will help to find out how the activity of their genes may impact how&#xD;
           they perform on some tests. All samples will be stored in a locked space at the&#xD;
           Institute on Aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and answer&#xD;
           questionnaires related to physical, auditory (hearing), and social and emotional&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first test is a learning and remembering task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is followed by a Physical Test Battery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to walk for 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will also be asked to walk a distance of 33 feet (10 meters) three&#xD;
           times. They will be asked to walk the same distance another three times while counting&#xD;
           out loud.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to perform upper- and lower-body muscle strength and&#xD;
           endurance assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to respond to various questionnaires related to their&#xD;
           physical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory Test Battery o The participant will be asked to complete tasks that require them to&#xD;
      listen and attend to desired stimuli in the presence of a competing message or noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioemotional Test Battery&#xD;
&#xD;
      o The participant will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure their social and&#xD;
      emotional health, which will include questions to measure their current mood, their general&#xD;
      level of trust, their level of loneliness, and their drive to identify emotions and thoughts&#xD;
      in others and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. These questions will also&#xD;
      measure the participant's selflessness and concern for the well-being of others, their&#xD;
      emotional attention and clarity, their anxiety level, and personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the beginning of this visit, we will ask the participant about recent activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will then be asked to participate in an electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
           recording session, that is a recording of electrical activity along their scalp. An EEG&#xD;
           cap, selected for the participant's head size, will be placed on their head. The cap&#xD;
           contains small electrodes that record brain electrical activity. During this part of the&#xD;
           study, the participant will sit in a chair while watching pictures on a computer screen&#xD;
           and listening to sounds through headphones, or resting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While recording EEG, the participant's eye movements will be monitored with an eye&#xD;
           tracker. The eye-tracking camera will be placed in front of them and after a brief&#xD;
           calibration procedure will track the participant's eye movements while viewing stimuli&#xD;
           on the screen and hearing sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the tasks start, the participant will receive detailed information and have a&#xD;
           chance to ask any questions that they may have about the tasks or about the EEG and eye&#xD;
           tracking procedures. The participant will also have the chance to work on some practice&#xD;
           trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the EEG and eye tracking recording, the investigator will then ask the participant&#xD;
           about the amount of pain they experienced in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be followed by brief sensory testing. In particular, the investigator will&#xD;
           apply pressure to several sites on the participant's face and body. The pressure will be&#xD;
           slowly increased, and the participant will be asked to tell the investigator when they&#xD;
           begin to feel discomfort or mild pain. As soon as the participant indicates that they&#xD;
           feel pain, the pressure will be removed. Also, the investigator will tap the participant&#xD;
           with a small nylon tip on their knee and the back of their hand and will ask the&#xD;
           participant to indicate how painful this feels. The investigator will do that twice at&#xD;
           each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the beginning of this visit, the investigator will ask the participant about their&#xD;
           recent activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is assigned to the MRI/MRS portion of the study the investigator will&#xD;
           ensure that they are eligible and safe to participate in the scanning session that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will then practice the tasks that they will work on while in the MRI&#xD;
           scanner. The tasks will involve viewing geometrical shapes, faces, and images of objects&#xD;
           and scenes. The participant will receive detailed information and have a chance to ask&#xD;
           any questions that they may have about the tasks or about the MRI procedure before they&#xD;
           go into the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At this point, the participant will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute, and get&#xD;
           settled into the MRI scanner, all with the assistance of the trained researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While the participant is resting comfortably in the scanner, the investigator will ask&#xD;
           them to work on the tasks mentioned above and while they do the MRI machine will produce&#xD;
           images of their brain, as well as scan their brain at rest. The participant will be in&#xD;
           the scanner for less than 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to&#xD;
           questionnaires related to their memory and thought process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This Cognitive Test Battery comprises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tasks that ask the participant to attend to, respond to, or remember various stimuli on&#xD;
           the computer screen and on paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will self-administer either oxytocin or a placebo into their nose by&#xD;
           using a nasal spray bottle. The spray will be administered twice a day over 4 weeks. The&#xD;
           investigator will give the participant guidance about how to administer the spray and&#xD;
           will ask them to keep a log book of their oxytocin/placebo administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, during the treatment phase the investigator will ask the participant to&#xD;
           fill in a short diary about social activities they engaged in during their day as well&#xD;
           as emotions they experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Week 1 and 4 of the intervention phase, the participant will be fitted with a device&#xD;
           (i.e., bio-harness) that allows the investigator to measure physiological functions of&#xD;
           the participant's body such as their heart rate and breathing rate, for over a period of&#xD;
           24 hours while the participant engages in their daily activities. The participant will&#xD;
           be asked to wear it on a typical day, representative of their normal daily activity. The&#xD;
           24-hour period will be one in which the participant is not traveling out of town. A&#xD;
           trained research assistant will visit the participant in their home to fit them with and&#xD;
           take off the bio-harness. The bio-harness will be comfortably fitted with a chest strap&#xD;
           around the participant's upper body. It generally will not affect the clothes the&#xD;
           participant can wear, it is water resistant, and the participant will be able to pursue&#xD;
           the large majority of their daily activities in the usual manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the treatment phase, research assistants will call the participant once a week to&#xD;
           ask whether they experience any drug side effects or any problem with their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will ask the participant questions about their health condition and&#xD;
           recent activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will again be physically examined (including vitals) under the&#xD;
           supervision of a licensed physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another blood draw (~30mL or ~2 tbs) will be conducted to run blood tests and determine&#xD;
           the level of oxytocin after the treatment phase as well as the level of inflammation in&#xD;
           the participant's body. Urine (~2mL or ~0.14 tbs) will be collected again to ensure that&#xD;
           no adverse changes have occurred during the treatment phase. The samples will be stored&#xD;
           in a locked space at the Institute on Aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will again ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and&#xD;
           respond to questionnaires related to recent activities as well as physical, auditory&#xD;
           (hearing), and their social and emotional functioning. These measures will be very&#xD;
           similar to the ones they did before the intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the beginning of this visit, the investigator will ask the participant about recent&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will ask the participant to participate in ERP and eye tracking&#xD;
           recordings similar to the ones before the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will also ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and&#xD;
           respond to questionnaires related to their memory and thought process. These measures&#xD;
           will be very similar to the ones they did before the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be followed by brief sensory testing, similar to the one that took place&#xD;
           before the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the beginning of this visit, the investigator will ask the participant about recent&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is assigned for the MRI/MRS portion of the study the investigator&#xD;
           will ensure that the participant is eligible and safe to participate in the scanning&#xD;
           session that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then practice the tasks that they will work on while in the MRI scanner,&#xD;
      which will be similar to the ones they engaged in before the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At this point, the participant will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute, and get&#xD;
           settled into the MRI scanner, all with the assistance of the trained researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will again be in the scanner for less than 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to&#xD;
           questionnaires related to their memory and thought process, similar to the ones they&#xD;
           engaged in before the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon completion of the study, the investigator will tell the participant about the&#xD;
           general goals of the study and answer any questions that they may have&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Week Follow-Up Phone Call:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A research assistant will call the participant about one week after the participant's&#xD;
           last study visit to inquire whether they experienced any drug side effects or any health&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic material that is obtained from the blood, saliva, and urine samples will be&#xD;
      stored until the end of the study. By temporarily storing the genetic material, the&#xD;
      investigator will be able to examine the importance of different oxytocin genes as well as&#xD;
      other genes that are not yet known as being involved in how people think and behave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is no longer sufficient amounts of blood, saliva, and urine samples for analysis,&#xD;
      or samples become degraded, or the participant requests in writing that the sample be&#xD;
      destroyed, any remaining genetic material will be destroyed. The genetic material will only&#xD;
      be accessible to the research staff and will be labeled only by an identification number, not&#xD;
      the participant's name. The University of Florida will not sell the samples and will not use&#xD;
      the DNA for cloning.&#xD;
