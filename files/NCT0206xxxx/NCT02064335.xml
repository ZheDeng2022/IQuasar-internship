  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators like to develop a methodology to stimulate more physical&#xD;
      activity in inactive diabetic persons by an adapted physical activity program. An&#xD;
      individually oriented and medically adapted exercise plan will be set up. Participants will&#xD;
      be stimulated to be physically active in the long term, even when the coaching has been&#xD;
      finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial the health effects of the coaching are studied in the short&#xD;
      and long term. This trial, in addition to a process evaluation by all stakeholders, gives&#xD;
      more information about the implementation of the project in Flanders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being physically active on a regular base makes part of a healthy lifestyle. Research has&#xD;
      shown several positive effects of physical activity on physical and mental health. This is&#xD;
      also the case in diabetic persons, who are more vulnerable for certain diseases (e.g.&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a lot of people are not interested and motivated to participate in the local&#xD;
      exercise activities. The offer often does not satisfy the different needs of those subjects&#xD;
      or the barriers for participating are too high. Diabetic persons are also confronted with&#xD;
      these problems. However, physical activity is an important part in the treatment of the&#xD;
      disease. There is an urgent need for accessible physical activity programs which motivate&#xD;
      diabetic persons to adapt a healthy lifestyle, in the short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical activity coach can set up a physical activity plan, individually adapted and&#xD;
      according to the medical needs of a diabetic person. This program is created, based on the&#xD;
      principles of need supportive coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the researchers will investigate the effects of an individually adapted&#xD;
      physical activity plan on health and behavior in diabetic persons. The focus of this project&#xD;
      will be on the tertiary prevention. For the recruitment of the subjects, there will be a&#xD;
      collaboration with a health insurance company in Belgium (CM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication: Possible participants (cfr database CM) will receive a letter with the&#xD;
      invitation of an information session. This information session handles about the importance&#xD;
      of being physically active enough in diabetic persons and will present the project where&#xD;
      participants are guided by a physical activity coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information session: In the end of the session, participants can register for the physical&#xD;
      activity coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: All General Practitioners in the neighborhood were informed about the project,&#xD;
      several weeks before the information sessions took place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the physical activity coaching, participants have to visit their General&#xD;
      Practitioner. The doctor will perform a screening and will decide if the subject is able to&#xD;
      participate. For this screening, a fixed protocol is set up by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set up: This study is a randomized controlled trial. An intervention (60 subjects) - and&#xD;
      control (40 subjects) group will be included in the study. CM will recruit these people by&#xD;
      looking in the database (only people with type 2 diabetes and intake of oral antidiabetic&#xD;
      medications will be included). The control group will operate as a waiting group. It means&#xD;
      that in the first 6 months of the project, the subjects of the control group will only be&#xD;
      measured and will not receive any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following measure moments will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: pretesting (start), posttest (after 6 weeks), follow up 1 (after 6&#xD;
      months), follow up 2 (after 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: baseline 1 (start), baseline 2 (after 6 weeks), pretesting (after 6 months),&#xD;
      posttest (after 6 months + 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and control group receive an intervention (group sessions + physical&#xD;
      activity plan) between pretest and posttest.&#xD;

    <description>Physical activity coaching: Participants will be coached by a professional physical activity coach through individual and group sessions.&#xD;
Intake: This talk (1 hour) is the start of the coaching. A physical activity plan will be set up, according to the needs and possibilities of the participant. Activities in leisure time and daily physical activity will be included.&#xD;
Group sessions: During 5 weeks and one time a week, the subjects will take part in the exercise lessons. About 5 subjects will be in one group and all sessions are supervised by a professional physical activity coach. Activities are walking, Nordic walking and conditional fitness.&#xD;
Evaluation: After the 5 weeks of group sessions, an evaluation moment will take place between each participant and the physical activity coach. The physical activity plan will be refined.</description>
