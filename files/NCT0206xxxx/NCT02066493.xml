      The purpose of this study is to generate detailed insight into which therapies of giant&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms are being conducted, to document the natural history and the outcome&#xD;
      of treatment over 5 years after inclusion into the Registry and to follow imaging data of&#xD;
      giant aneurysms over years after diagnosis.&#xD;

      Definition of aims, eligibility of patients and data flow&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2009 a steering committee was appointed and its first meeting took place in Berlin.&#xD;
      Here the aims of the registry were defined as follows: 1) To generate detailed insight into&#xD;
      which therapies are being conducted. 2) To document the natural history of patients and&#xD;
      follow it over years after diagnosis. 3) To follow imaging data of giant aneurysms over years&#xD;
      after diagnosis, whether treated conservatively or not. 4) To expand the register into&#xD;
      several disciplines (by inviting neuroradiologic and neurologic centers to join) and&#xD;
      internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are a) the diagnosis of a giant intracranial aneurysm by CT, MRI or&#xD;
      regular angiography, b) age 18 years and older and c) informed consent. There are no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. If a patient is not able to give informed consent due to his or her&#xD;
      clinical situation, the legal representative of the patient (e.g. family member) will be&#xD;
      informed and asked to sign the consent form on behalf of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited consecutively in responsibility of each center. In addition to the&#xD;
      prospective part there is a retrospective part in which patients are included that were&#xD;
      admitted after January 2006. Data are gathered at admission, discharge and 1/3/5 years after&#xD;
      discharge. Starting from February 2010 a 9-month pilot phase was conducted in order to&#xD;
      identify and correct possible problems of data acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant variables were discussed on the basis of existing literature on giant intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms. All variables were chosen so that they can be determined in a routine clinical&#xD;
      context even in small centers with minimal technical equipment. Data collection was decided&#xD;
      to be carried out using a modular structure, consisting of a basic module and additional&#xD;
      modules for specific research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee decided on the content of a mandatory basic data collection for all&#xD;
      centers. This basic module was designed to keep the amount of variables at a minimum so that&#xD;
      data collection can be conducted as safely and quickly as possible by physicians of all&#xD;
      disciplines. It focuses on the clinical course between initial presentation and discharge but&#xD;
      also includes data on patient history, such as risk factors and possible prior aneurysm&#xD;
      therapy. A neurological examination of cranial nerve functions, motor capability and speech&#xD;
      is conducted initially, at discharge and during 3 mandatory follow-up examinations. At each&#xD;
      examination the patients' physical condition is recorded using internationally accepted and&#xD;
      reliable grading systems. The investigator is asked to not only record a clinical diagnosis,&#xD;
      such as epileptic seizure or incidental finding, but also use imaging data to produce a&#xD;
      radiological diagnosis and characterize the aneurysm regarding its location, size, shape and&#xD;
      structure. The mode of therapy is documented choosing between conservative, surgical and&#xD;
      endovascular options and combinations thereof. Possible complications are recorded as well as&#xD;
      radiologic results of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center is given the option to take part in additional extra modules, which serve as a&#xD;
      basis for spin-off projects resulting from the discussion within the study group. This&#xD;
      comprises for example an imaging module to lead to a better understanding of how giant&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms develop over time. It will monitor changes in aneurysm configuration&#xD;
      and flow dynamics using 3D-imaging data. A cost module will integrate data on treatment&#xD;
      expenses making it possible to compare the costs of each mode of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external review of the study protocol was conducted to ensure high methodological quality&#xD;
      and wide acceptance of the results. For this purpose a preliminary working report was&#xD;
      forwarded to 4 independent experts in the field of neurovascular research. The reviewers were&#xD;
      asked to comment on the appropriateness of the methods, the practicability of our variables&#xD;
      and the coverage of relevant aspects of giant intracranial aneurysm care. The comments of the&#xD;
      external reviewers were gathered and discussed within the steering committee. Based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the external reviewers, a final revision of the study protocol took place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis, study outcome and statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that conservative, endovascular and surgical therapy&#xD;
      result in equal aneurysm rupture rates. Therefore primary outcome will be aneurysm rupture&#xD;
      rate at 5 years of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the estimated 5-year cumulative rupture rates for&#xD;
      patients with unruptured giant aneurysm given in the ISUIA-Trial. According to their results&#xD;
      we assume a 5-year rupture rate of 0.30 irrespective of which specific treatment is applied.&#xD;
      Because of a lack of data on special rupture rates regarding patients treated with the three&#xD;
      considered methods, sample size calculation was done for one proportion based on precision&#xD;
      analysis. Consequently, a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.10 is&#xD;
      achieved by a sample size of 320 patients. For the outcomes death or rupture the&#xD;
      corresponding survival functions with 95% confidence intervals will be estimated by the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. The null-hypotheses of equal survival curves for two treatment groups&#xD;
      will be tested by the Log-Rank test. With documented dates of rupture events the sample size&#xD;
      of 320 calculated above is sufficient to detect moderate effects of possible predictors for&#xD;
      rupture by Cox proportional hazards regression within a secondary analysis. Furthermore we&#xD;
      can model the logit of rupture after 5 years by binary logistic regression detecting possible&#xD;
      moderate to considerable effects of predictors. Therapy (conventional, surgery or&#xD;
      endovascular) will be the main factor of interest for both multivariable analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment / Data storage / Quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008 patient recruitment began at the Charité Berlin, one year later data from other&#xD;
      centers were included as well, initially only in Germany, later on throughout Europe and&#xD;
      Japan. Patient data are stored using pseudonyms. Centers can either use a fax-based data&#xD;
      inclusion form or a web-based entry form. All data are stored at the Charité - Berlin. For&#xD;
      quality assurance a monitoring visit to the 7 most-including centers was conducted in 2013.&#xD;
