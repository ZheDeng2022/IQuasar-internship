  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of Escitalopram, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake&#xD;
      Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, in the treatment of Bipolar II Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antidepressants for those with bipolar disorder appears common in clinical&#xD;
      practice but is not countenanced - at least as monotherapy - in formal treatment guidelines.&#xD;
      This view reflects concerns about the possibility of antidepressant drugs inducing switching&#xD;
      and rapid cycling in those with Bipolar Disorder. Although the effectiveness of treating&#xD;
      Bipolar II patients with SSRIs has received very little attention in the literature,&#xD;
      observations of Bipolar II patients treated with SSRIs suggest they may have general mood&#xD;
      stabilising properties. Many patients have reported improvements not only in their depressed&#xD;
      mood, but also a reduction in the severity, duration and frequency of hypomanic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proof of concept study we specifically assess whether a standard dose of an SSRI&#xD;
      antidepressant is more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency, severity and&#xD;
      duration of both depressive and hypomanic episodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of&#xD;
      Escitalopram (10 mg) versus placebo (identical presentation) in subjects identified as having&#xD;
      Bipolar II Disorder. The nine-month study will commence with a no-treatment baseline period&#xD;
      of three months (Baseline Phase) to ensure that subjects meet criteria for episode frequency.&#xD;
      Subjects compliant with and completing baseline period requirements will then be randomized&#xD;
      to receive Escitalopram or placebo for three months (Phase 2) and will then subsequently&#xD;
      cross over to receive the alternative compound for the final three-month period (Phase 3).&#xD;
      Prior to that cross-over, there will be a two-day taper period to avoid potential withdrawal&#xD;
      effects, followed by a seven-day wash-out period to avoid carry-over effects from drug to&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will be assessed at the start of the study, and every month thereafter for&#xD;
      the entire nine-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects aged 18-65 meeting diagnostic criteria for Bipolar II disorder will be recruited.&#xD;
      Diagnosis will be based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders with the&#xD;
      exception of the minimum four-day duration criterion for hypomanic episodes. Subjects must&#xD;
      have a minimum 2-year history of depressive and hypomanic episodes, with a mood disturbance&#xD;
      (either 'high' or 'low') occurring at least monthly. Subjects will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      previously been treated with anti-depressants or mood-stabilisers, or have a history of&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms during episodes of either hypomania or depression. Subjects who are&#xD;
      actively suicidal, have a significant personality disorder, substantive illicit drug use, or&#xD;
      alcohol consumption &gt;30g/day will also be excluded. Exclusion will also apply to subjects who&#xD;
      are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those with a history of heart disease, liver disease,&#xD;
      epilepsy or seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a number of self-report questionnaires about their mood and&#xD;
      functioning on a monthly basis as well as monitoring their mood on a daily basis. A research&#xD;
      psychologist or psychiatrist will complete (at monthly intervals) the Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating, Young Mania Rating Scale and the DSM-IV Social and Occupational Functioning&#xD;
      Assessment Scale based on functioning over the previous week throughout the nine-month&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
