  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to conduct an innovative, culturally-tailored&#xD;
      demonstration project designed to facilitate the adoption and maintenance of regular,&#xD;
      moderate physical activity (i.e., brisk walking) in a sample of sedentary African American&#xD;
      women. In addition, we will test the impact of varying types of counseling and social support&#xD;
      on the adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity and help women improve their&#xD;
      weight control. The core behavioral change program will be based on a comprehensive wellness&#xD;
      oriented website offered by the National Black Women's Health Project (NBWHP). Comparisons&#xD;
      will be made between the effects of the web-based program with only minimal face to face&#xD;
      contacts, primarily for enrollment, data collection, and participant retention, the web-based&#xD;
      program with the addition of telephone counseling and support, and the web-based program with&#xD;
      face to face group counseling and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses. Hypothesis 1. Participation in the intervention will result in increased physical&#xD;
      activity levels, regardless of the level of social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. The intervention arm involving the lowest level of social support will be&#xD;
      marginally effective for increasing physical activity levels, and additional social support&#xD;
      will result in significantly improved physical activity levels when compared with the lowest&#xD;
      level of social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific intervention questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How well do the interventions address the program objectives ((quality of&#xD;
           implementation), to be determined through protocol review for operationalization of&#xD;
           theoretical constructs)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Was the program implemented as planned ((fidelity to protocol and dose of intervention),&#xD;
           to be determined from implementation process variables, including characteristics of&#xD;
           women recruited, fidelity to protocols for contact with participants, and quality of&#xD;
           counseling given, where applicable)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Did the program (separately for each format tested) have a significant effect on&#xD;
           potential mediators of behavior change (influence on presumed intermediate outcomes)?&#xD;
           For the purpose of this proposal, a mediator is defined as any barrier to or facilitator&#xD;
           of physical activity participation (e.g., time, self efficacy, social support, access,&#xD;
           perceived norms) as implied in the 12 behavioral objectives that have been specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the optimum type of counseling and support to enhance the on-line activities in&#xD;
           order to produce significant behavior change (importance of various program components)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Did the program (separately for each format tested) have a significant effect on the&#xD;
           primary study outcomes (influence on primary behavioral outcome, e.g., physical activity&#xD;
           by self-report of activity levels or pedometer counts)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Do changes in mediators explain changes in the primary outcomes (multivariate models to&#xD;
           understand if presumed process of behavioral change was observed in practice)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Does the internet only program appear to result in increased physical activity&#xD;
           participation when compared to extant data on trends among Black women in the U.S.&#xD;
           population (what is accomplished with very minimal intervention and how does it compare&#xD;
           with a more extensive program)?&#xD;
