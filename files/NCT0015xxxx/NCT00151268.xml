  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a separate protocol the Department of Genetic Medicine is proposing to carry out a study&#xD;
      using gene transfer to treat the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of late&#xD;
      infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), a fatal, rare, recessive disorder of the&#xD;
      (CNS) in children. In the context that there is little known about the genotype - phenotype&#xD;
      correlations of LINCL, and that our referral far exceed the number (n=11) of children that&#xD;
      will be entered into the gene transfer protocol, we are proposing to capitalize on this&#xD;
      unique opportunity to evaluate this disorder in this separate study. In this context, the aim&#xD;
      of this protocol is to study the genotype - phenotype correlations of the CNS manifestations&#xD;
      of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This will be accomplished by comparing the&#xD;
      genotype to a neurologic assessment, and LINCL clinical rating scale; magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) assessments of the CNS; and routine&#xD;
      clinical evaluations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed clinical protocol is designed to assess genotype - phenotype correlations of&#xD;
      LINCL, including a preliminary assessment regarding the genotype - phenotype correlations of&#xD;
      progressive CNS deterioration inherent to this disorder. The trial will include the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of neurological assessment including the LINCL clinical rating scale and parental&#xD;
      evaluations; and the secondary endpoint of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopic (MRS) assessments of the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in children diagnosed with LINCL in all stages. The staging is&#xD;
      based on a modification of the scale of Steinfeld et al (Steinfeld, 2002). The study&#xD;
      anticipates a total n=30 children assessed over a period of 18 months. Of these, we&#xD;
      anticipate that approximately two-thirds will not be entered into the proposed gene therapy&#xD;
      protocol and thus approximately n=20 will be available for this study to be reassessed at 1&#xD;
      year. Thus, we anticipate that we will be able to capture a one-time genotype - phenotype&#xD;
      snapshot for all n=30, and a 1 year genotype - phenotype progression assessment for n=20.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A definitive diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between the age of 2 and 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not previously participated in a gene transfer study for LINCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents of study participants must agree to comply in good faith with the conditions&#xD;
             of the study, including attending all of the required baseline and follow-up&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both parents or legal guardians must give consent for their child's participation in&#xD;
             the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with heart disease that would be a risk for anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent participation in any other FDA approved Investigational New Drug clinical&#xD;
             protocol is not allowed, although the Principal Investigator will work with other&#xD;
             doctors to accommodate specific requests (e.g., a study of nutritional supplements&#xD;
             probably would not be a disqualification).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have a contraindication to MRI/MRS assessment including: (1) heart&#xD;
             pacemaker and/or related implants; (2) metal fragment/chip in the eye or other sites;&#xD;
             (3) an aneurysm clip in their brain; and (4) metallic inner ear implants.&#xD;
