      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which was originally&#xD;
      introduced in the clinic years ago for the treatment of malignant lymphomas. The antibody is&#xD;
      an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light-and heavy chain variable region&#xD;
      sequences and human constant region sequences. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20&#xD;
      antigen on B lymphocytes. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent&#xD;
      cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism(s) behind the favourable response of rituximab in autoimmune cytopenias are&#xD;
      unsettled. A depletion of peripheral blood B cells occurs after just one antibody infusion.&#xD;
      Accordingly, it has been proposed that opsonized CD20+ B cells inhibit and saturate&#xD;
      macrophage Fc-receptor function and thereby clearance of IgG-coated blood cells by&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial cells. Suppression of auto reactive B-cell clones may be another&#xD;
      potential mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently several studies have shown that rituximab- also is very effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of various autoimmune cytopenias and autoimmune diseases - idiopathic&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), warm and cold autoimmune haemolytic anemias, autoimmune&#xD;
      neutropenia, pure red cell aplasia, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      membranous glomerulonephritis, and rheumatoid arthritis - , including disorders which have&#xD;
      been considered to be primarily diseases elicited by aberrant T-cell responses, e.g.,&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. However, recently the importance of the B-cell in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      these autoimmune disorders have been debated and emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease in which both B- and T-cells are activated and&#xD;
      participate in its pathogenesis. However, B-cell activation with the production of IgG -&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating antibodies, binding to and activating the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid&#xD;
      cells is a prerequisite for the development of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating antibodies cause thyroid hypersecretion, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of&#xD;
      the thyroid follicles and ultimately diffuse goiter together with clinical hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
      In addition to thyroid-stimulating antibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase&#xD;
      are also produced in Graves' disease. The pathogenesis of the other clinical features of&#xD;
      disease - the ophthalmopathy and the localized dermopathy or myxedema - is far less&#xD;
      elucidated. It has been proposed that the ophthalmopathy develops consequent to an autoimmune&#xD;
      response to the thyrotropin receptor, which is also expressed by a preadipocyte subpopulation&#xD;
      of orbital fibroblasts. The treatment of Graves' disease includes antithyroid drugs,&#xD;
      radioactive iodine and surgery. All three treatment modalities are associated with adverse&#xD;
      effects or side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most serious complication of antithyroid drugs is agranulocytosis and less frequently&#xD;
      acute hepatic necrosis, cholestatic hepatitis and vasculitis. As to treatment with&#xD;
      radioactive iodine this therapy may worsen ophthalmopathy. In addition, the treatment is&#xD;
      followed by hypothyroidism in a large proportion of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the above mentioned observations of a very effective response in many patients&#xD;
      with otherwise refractory autoimmune disorders and the pathogenetic concept of Graves'&#xD;
      disease as a disorder elicited by auto antibodies stimulating the thyrotropin receptor on&#xD;
      thyroid cells ( hyperthyroidism and goiter) and similar antigens in the orbit (&#xD;
      ophthalmopathy ) the hypothesis is that B-cell depletion with rituximab may be a very&#xD;
      efficacious therapy reducing or abolishing the production of the auto antibodies which are&#xD;
      responsible for Graves' disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase II pilot study encompassing 20 patients with Graves' disease to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of rituximab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Biochemically as assessed by markers of disease activity ( free T4, free T3, TSH,&#xD;
      TSH-receptor antibodies, anti-TPO)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods 20 patients with recent onset untreated Graves' disease start&#xD;
      antithyroid treatment (methimazole). When euthyroidism is reached - defined by normal thyroid&#xD;
      parameters (free T4, free T3, and TSH) - the patients are randomised to +/- rituximab&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the 2 patient groups are followed for 1 year:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 euthyroid patients treated 4 weeks with rituximab, when antithyroid treatment is&#xD;
           discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 euthyroid patients who do not receive rituximab antithyroid treatment being&#xD;
           discontinued after 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in relapse, remission rate at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow up/ time to relapse as&#xD;
      assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Biochemistry ( free T4, free T3, TSH, TSH-receptor antibodies, anti-TPO)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab in a dose of 375 mg/m², administered by iv. Infusion once a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication with paracetamol 1g p.o. or tavestin 2 mg i.v. is given 30-60 min. before each&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
