  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as a promising new cancer treatment modality,&#xD;
      which involves the uptakes of a photosensitizer by tumor cells, followed by the activation of&#xD;
      photosensitizer with approximate wavelength of light. The mechanisms of the PDT-induced&#xD;
      cytotoxic effect relate to singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen intermediates generated&#xD;
      by PDT, which give rise to cellular stress and cause cell death. Previously, using the&#xD;
      homemade LED light source, we have shown that ALA-PDT is effective for the treatment of&#xD;
      premalignant lesions such as mucosal dysplasia and carcinoma in situ of oral cavity. Due to&#xD;
      the advantages of low cost, high reliability, and portability, LED light source provides an&#xD;
      alternative approach for the light irradiation of PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verruca vulgaris are benign skin papillomas caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). They&#xD;
      are very common and can affect many different sites including the face, hands, feet and&#xD;
      genitalia. Although the present therapeutic approaches are more or less effective in&#xD;
      eradicating the lesions, relapses are very common. Furthermore, at times the anatomical&#xD;
      location and depth of lesions often make the treatment difficult, time-consuming and painful.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to develop new modalities for wart treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to develop topical ALA-PDT as an alternative treatment&#xD;
      of wart but without the unwanted side effects of pain and burning. To fulfill this goal, the&#xD;
      following works will be performed. First, topical ALA formulation and LED array will be&#xD;
      specifically designed and developed for the skin lesions. Second, the efficacy of the ALA&#xD;
      formulation designed for wart treatment will be evaluated with in vivo fluorescence imaging&#xD;
      system. Third, the therapeutic efficacy of ALA-PDT will be evaluated by using a LED array&#xD;
      designed for skin irradiation. Forth, the unwanted side effects of pain and burning will be&#xD;
      further compared between red and green LED array.&#xD;

      Verruca vulgaris or warts are benign skin papillomas caused by the human papilloma virus&#xD;
      (HPV). They are very common and can affect many different sites including the face, hands,&#xD;
      feet and genitalia. Although the present therapeutic approaches are more or less effective in&#xD;
      eradicating the lesions, scars and relapses are very common. Furthermore, at times the&#xD;
      anatomical location and depth of lesions often make the treatment difficult, time-consuming&#xD;
      and painful. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new modalities for wart treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as a promising new cancer treatment modality,&#xD;
      which involves the uptakes of a photosensitizer by tumor cells, followed by the activation of&#xD;
      photosensitizer with approximate wavelength of light. The endogenous conversion of&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has broadened the use of PDT. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of the PDT-induced cytotoxic effect relate to singlet oxygen and other reactive&#xD;
      oxygen intermediates generated by PDT, which give rise to cellular stress and cause cell&#xD;
      death. Previously, using the homemade LED light source, we have shown that topical ALA-PDT is&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of warts. However, the excruciating pain induced by ALA and red&#xD;
      LED could be due to deeper penetration of the ALA formulation or the deeper penetration of&#xD;
      red light. Thus the pain might be related to the injured nerve fibers underlying the skin.&#xD;
      This study is to provide evidence of these two green or red LED efficacy in removing the&#xD;
      warts and also their side-effect of pain.&#xD;
