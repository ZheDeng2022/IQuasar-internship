        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has severe or moderately severe hemophilia A defined by a baseline factor&#xD;
             VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal documented at screening or historically (e.g., at&#xD;
             hemophilia diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may enroll regardless of their serologic status for human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject requires a surgical, dental or other invasive procedure--either elective&#xD;
             or emergency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of at least 150 exposure days for all other factor VIII&#xD;
             products (as estimated by the study site investigator) prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a life expectancy of at least 28 days from the day of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions,&#xD;
             and signed and dated the informed consent form approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC and&#xD;
             Baxter BioScience&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a detectable inhibitor to factor VIII in the local hemostasis&#xD;
             laboratory at the investigative site at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of inhibitor to factor VIII &gt; 1.0 BU. Note: If the subject&#xD;
             has a history of an inhibitor titer &gt; 1.0 BU at any time prior to enrollment but&#xD;
             demonstrated expected clinical responses to conventional doses of factor VIII therapy,&#xD;
             the subject may enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has known hypersensitivity to Recombinate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug study, or has&#xD;
             participated in any clinical trial involving an investigational drug within 30 days of&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has clinical and/or laboratory evidence of abnormal hemostasis from causes&#xD;
             other than hemophilia A (e.g., late-stage chronic liver disease, immune&#xD;
             thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to&#xD;
             cooperate with study procedures.&#xD;
