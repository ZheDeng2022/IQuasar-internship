    <textblock>
      Childhood leukemias which cannot be cured by chemotherapy alone may be effectively treated by&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, for patients with chronic myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia (CML), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only proven&#xD;
      curative modality of treatment. Patients who have received hematopoietic stem cells from an&#xD;
      HLA matched sibling donor have proven to be less at risk for disease relapse and regimen&#xD;
      related toxicity. However, about 70% of patients in need of HSCT do not have an HLA matched&#xD;
      sibling donor. This necessitates the search for alternative donors, which may increase the&#xD;
      risk of a poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the hematopoietic stem cell graft has been implicated as a primary factor&#xD;
      determining these outcomes. The standard stem cell graft has been unmanipulated bone marrow,&#xD;
      but recently several advantages of T-lymphocyte depleted bone marrow and mobilized peripheral&#xD;
      blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have been demonstrated. However, T-cell depletion may increase&#xD;
      the risk of infectious complications and leukemic recurrence while an unmanipulated stem cell&#xD;
      graft may increase the risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD). A key element in long range&#xD;
      strategies in improving outcomes for patients undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT&#xD;
      is to provide the optimal graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to estimate the incidence of acute GVHD in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies who receive HSCT with an unmanipulated&#xD;
      marrow graft. The results of this study can be used as the foundation for future trials&#xD;
      related to engineering unrelated donor graft.&#xD;

      Secondary outcome evaluations for this clinical study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall survival in patients with high risk hematological malignancies&#xD;
           who receive a HSCT with an unmanipulated marrow graft or a peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
           graft&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate disease-free survival and relapse rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rates of chronic GvHD and graft failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic peri-transplant regimen-related toxicity&#xD;
           and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the degree of NK cell and T-cell immune reconstitution at 30 days and 100&#xD;
           days post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of EBV reactivation or post-transplant lymphoproliferative&#xD;
           disease (PTLPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) in patients&#xD;
           receiving allogeneic transplantation and the development of rATG antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally this study began as a randomized comparison between unmanipulated bone marrow and&#xD;
      T-cell depleted bone marrow utilizing the investigational CliniMACS selection system. The&#xD;
      hypothesis to be tested at the time was that the incidence of severe acute GvHD was&#xD;
      significantly reduced in children who received HSCT with a T-cell depleted bone marrow stem&#xD;
      cell graft as compared to those receiving an unmanipulated graft. Approximately midway&#xD;
      through the study the evidence indicated that although the incidence of severe acute GvHD&#xD;
      with T-cell depletion was low, it was not significantly lower than the standard treatment of&#xD;
      unmanipulated bone marrow. Therefore the study was amended to remove the T-cell depleted arm&#xD;
      and continue accrual to one arm providing all patients with an unmanipulated bone marrow stem&#xD;
      cell graft. The primary objective then being to determine if the true incidence of severe&#xD;
      acute GvHD was below 15% as reported. The observational group receiving PBPC remained open&#xD;
      for those patients whose donors or donor centers chose to provide PBPC in lieu of bone&#xD;
      marrow. Only one such patient was assigned to this group; therefore, no valid conclusions can&#xD;
      be formulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention analysis was based on those patients who received an unmanipulated stem cell&#xD;
      product only. For this study, the investigators had requested bone marrow for all study&#xD;
      subjects. However, the final determination of the source of the hematopoietic stem cells,&#xD;
      bone marrow or peripheral blood, was at the discretion of the donor and the donor center.&#xD;
      Those participants who received a peripheral blood stem cell product were followed in the&#xD;
      observational group only. All participants, whether recipients of a bone marrow or blood stem&#xD;
      cell product, received the same preparative conditioning regimen&#xD;
