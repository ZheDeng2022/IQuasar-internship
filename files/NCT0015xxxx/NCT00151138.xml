  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of two antihypertensive drugs of known efficacy to investigate whether one&#xD;
      has more favorable effects on brain blood flow and cognitive function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project examines the neuropsychological status, peripheral blood flow, and structural&#xD;
      cortical (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and functional cortical blood flow (quantitative&#xD;
      positron emission tomography, PET) status of previously unmedicated hypertensives. These&#xD;
      individuals are then medicated for one year with one of two effective blood pressure&#xD;
      medications. Our hypothesis is that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but not the&#xD;
      beta-blocker will normalize cerebral blood flow and possibly, cognitive function. This&#xD;
      hypothesis is tested by a repetition of our initial examinations at the completion of one&#xD;
      year of treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will be between 35 and 65 years of age, and must have a diastolic BP&#xD;
             between 90 and 109 mm Hg, systolic BP between 140 and 179 mm Hg, or both. Eligibility&#xD;
             will be based upon readings taken at two screening visits. For resting BP&#xD;
             determinations, eating, smoking, drinking and heavy physical activity will be&#xD;
             proscribed for 1 hour prior, and drinking caffeinated beverages 2 hours prior.&#xD;
             Systolic and diastolic (5th phase) BP will be determined twice separated by 2 minutes&#xD;
             using a 2-3 mm Hg/sec deflation rate. Before readings, a 60 s resting pulse will be&#xD;
             obtained. Two readings over two such sessions will be averaged. All measurements will&#xD;
             be obtained by individuals certified in BP measurement by the Department of&#xD;
             Epidemiology of the Graduate School of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential subjects must have either no prior pharmacologic treatment for hypertension or&#xD;
        minimal lifetime exposure. The latter is defined as no more than 6 months of blood pressure&#xD;
        medication within the past 5 years. No blood pressure medication taken at all in the 6&#xD;
        months preceding study enrollment. To establish medical eligibility and to screen for&#xD;
        secondary causes of hypertension, subjects will provide a medical history and have their&#xD;
        standard blood chemistry determined to screen for occult renal failure and primary&#xD;
        hyperaldosteronism. All women will be postmenopausal or tested (urine specimen) to ensure&#xD;
        the absence of pregnancy. To ensure their ability to complete the behavioral assessments,&#xD;
        subjects must have at least an 8th grade education and immigrants must have spoken English&#xD;
        as their primary language for at least five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria. Exclusion criteria will include current use of any cardiovascular or&#xD;
        psychotropic medications, or contraindication for use of an ACE inhibitor or beta blocker&#xD;
        (e.g., prior adverse reaction or chronic obstructive lung disease, including asthma).&#xD;
        Individuals with a resting blood pressure greater than a SBP &gt;180 mmHg and /or a DBP &gt;110&#xD;
        are excluded as are individuals with a prior serious adverse reaction or allergy to beta&#xD;
        blockers or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. We will exclude individuals with&#xD;
        target organ damage (history of myocardial infarction, angioplasty, bypass surgery,&#xD;
        congestive heart failure, stroke, or carotid endarterectomy), angina pectoris (determined&#xD;
        by Rose questionnaire), a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, or chronic renal&#xD;
        insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dl). Secondary hypertension, based upon known or&#xD;
        clinically suspected renal artery stenosis, primary hyperaldosteronism, untreated thyroid&#xD;
        disorder, heavy alcohol consumption (24 or more standard drinks per week), consistent use&#xD;
        of illegal drugs (for example, crack/cocaine used once or more a month) or&#xD;
        pheochromocytoma, will be grounds for exclusion. A standard of no more than 30 g per day&#xD;
        (Klatsky, 2003) seems to have some acceptance for the level of alcohol intake that will not&#xD;
        chronically alter blood pressure levels. Therefore, no more than a case of beer per week,&#xD;
        21 (5 oz.) glasses of wine, or 21 shots (1.5 oz.) of hard liquor will be acceptable.&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria also include neurological disorders (serious head injury, seizures,&#xD;
        presenile or alcoholic dementia, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis). Due to the&#xD;
        MRI examination required, individuals not fitting into the bore of the magnet will be&#xD;
        excluded. Those with known sensitivity to sulfa-containing antibiotics will be included in&#xD;
        the study but will not undergo the acetazolamide portion of the PET scanning sessions:&#xD;
        acetazolamide is a sulfonamide analog. Women with child-bearing potential (i.e., pre- or&#xD;
        peri-menopausal) will be tested within 48 hours prior to the PET examination to ensure the&#xD;
        absence of pregnancy. A urinary pregnancy test (e.g., Sure-Vue Urine hCG) will be&#xD;
        administered to confirm the absence of pregnancy.&#xD;
