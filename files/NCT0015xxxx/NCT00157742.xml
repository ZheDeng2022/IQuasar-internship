      The purpose of this open, parallel, single-center prospective, randomised controlled trial is&#xD;
      to compare two treatments: Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and Percutaneous Myocardial Laser&#xD;
      Revascularisation (PMR) and assess their use and longer term effect in patients with&#xD;
      Refractory Angina Pectoris.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient limiting angina (CCS III or IV) despite maximally tolerated medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented coronary artery disease (within the last 9 months prior baseline), which is&#xD;
             unsuitable for conventional revascularisation techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has documented reversible ischemia on nuclear scan (Tc-99 sestamibi)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is limited in daily activities, primarily exercice capability, by their angina&#xD;
             pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must understand the therapy and give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be available for appropriate follow-up times for length of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non pregnant woman&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not candidate for surgical implantation of SCS and/or not for PMR and/or unable to use&#xD;
             SCS device appropriately for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who has had one or more major cardiac events within 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with myocardial wall thickness&lt; 8 mm in the ischaemic area to be treated as&#xD;
             verified by echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes vascular access&#xD;
             required for PMR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient on intravenous therapy to control their symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who is unlikely to survive for more than 12 months due to non cardiac&#xD;
             condition e.g.malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient who has other diseases that are considered of greater clinical significance&#xD;
             than the angina pectoris that would impact the ability of the clinician to adequately&#xD;
             assess the incremental effects of the trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with ejection fraction of less than 30 % as verified by echocardiography&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient who was previously enrolled in this study, or is currently in another clinical&#xD;
             study, which will interfere with this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who has has SCS , a TMLR or PMR procedure in the past&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
