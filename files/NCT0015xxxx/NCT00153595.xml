      The aim of this double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of EWO1 in patients with moderate to severe perennial allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis (AR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is a very common medical problem affecting adults and children alike. It&#xD;
      has been estimated that 20% to 25% of the world's population suffer from allergic rhinitis,&#xD;
      resulting in considerable morbidity - impaired quality of life. In the U.S., there is an&#xD;
      estimated $2.4 billion annual medical cost associated with allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Taiwan, household dust mites (HDM) are primary allergens causing allergic reactions&#xD;
      including allergic rhinitis. The incidence of HDM in Taiwan can be as high as 100%. Df, Dp&#xD;
      and Blomia tropicalis (Bt) rank among the top 3 most common household dust mites.&#xD;
      Antihistamines remain a major therapy for treatment of allergic rhinitis. Chinese herbs have&#xD;
      long been used to treat different allergic and immunologic diseases. YU-PING-FENG-SAN (YPFS)&#xD;
      with a formulation that contains 3 herbs [Huangqi (HQ), baizhu (BZ), and fangfeng (FF)] has&#xD;
      been reported as one of the effective traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 3 previous non-placebo controlled clinical studies in perennial rhinitis, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that by adding Xingyi(XY) to a YPFS formula with CQ, BZ, and FF, additional&#xD;
      efficacy benefits can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of EWO1 in patients with moderate to severe perennial allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients who satisfy all of the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive either EWO1, or placebo for 28&#xD;
      days. After the treatment-period, patients will be followed for 14 days to see if there is&#xD;
      any rebound in rhinitis symptoms. The Primary efficacy endpoint is weekly combined symptom&#xD;
      scores at the end of treatment. Besides, intent to treat analyses will be carried out for&#xD;
      both efficacy and safety. A minimum of 60 patients will be randomized into this two-treatment&#xD;
      parallel-design study.&#xD;
