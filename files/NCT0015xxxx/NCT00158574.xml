  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria and anaemia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Administration of three courses of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment (IPTi) to infants when they receive EPI vaccines reduced the incidence&#xD;
      of malaria and anaemia in infants in an area with low SP resistance, low transmission&#xD;
      pressure and high bednet use. However, it is not clear whether this observation can be&#xD;
      generalised to areas with high transmission and high SP resistance. The mechanism of the&#xD;
      protective effect of IPTi is unclear. There is an urgent need to identify other anti-malarial&#xD;
      drugs that could be used for IPTi instead of SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of a drug that could be used safely and effectively for IPTi instead of&#xD;
           SP in areas, such as north eastern Tanzania, where there is a high level of resistance&#xD;
           to SP and amodiaquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determination of whether a short acting antimalarial drug (Lapdap) is as effective as a&#xD;
           long acting drug (mefloquine) when used for IPTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigation of the effect of the intensity of transmission on the requirements for a&#xD;
           long or short acting drug for IPTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of the effect of IPTi on the development of clinical immunity in children in&#xD;
           low and high transmission areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised trial with four treatment regimes is proposed which will be conducted in two&#xD;
      different transmission settings. The four treatment regimens are as follows: (1) placebo; (2)&#xD;
      mefloquine; (3) Lapdap; (4) SP. All medications will be given at the time of immunisation&#xD;
      with DPT/polio 2, DPT/polio 3, and measles vaccines. The study will involve 1280 infants in a&#xD;
      high endemic area and 2440 infants in a low endemic area, in Tanzania.The primary outcome is&#xD;
      the incidence of clinical malaria.&#xD;

      1. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall study design is a randomised trial of four treatment regimes in two&#xD;
           different transmission settings. The four treatment regimes are as follows: (1) placebo,&#xD;
           (2) mefloquine; (3) Lapdap; (4) SP. All medications will be given at the time of&#xD;
           immunisation with DPT/polio 2, DPT/polio 3, and measles vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of study infants due for DPT/Polio 2 vaccination in each study EPI clinic on a given&#xD;
      date will be generated from the enrolment database a week prior to the scheduled date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study infants return for DPT&amp; Polio 2 (contact 1) the following procedures will be&#xD;
      carried out: (1) allocation of infants to one the four arms of the study; (2) administration&#xD;
      of the first dose of the study drug and dispensation of the remaining two doses of drug to be&#xD;
      given at home in the presence of a study field worker; (3) collection of blood samples for&#xD;
      Hb, malaria parasite and blood spot for genetic markers of drug resistance parasites and&#xD;
      haemoglobinopathies; (4) advice given to the caretakers to bring their children to the health&#xD;
      facility if the child becomes ill before the next scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study areas, the first 200 children will be followed up on day 7 post-administration&#xD;
      of IPTi first course (contact 1a) and a finger prick blood sample will be collected for&#xD;
      determination of haemoglobin and preparation of blood film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study infants return for DPT&amp; Polio 3 (contact 2) the following procedures will be&#xD;
      carried out: (1) administration of the first dose of the second course of the study drugs and&#xD;
      dispensation of the remaining two doses of drugs to be given at home in the presence of a&#xD;
      study field worker; (2) advice given to the caretakers to bring their children to the health&#xD;
      facility if the child becomes ill before the next scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study infants return for measles (contact 3) the following procedures will be&#xD;
      carried out: (1) administration of the first dose of the third course of the study drugs and&#xD;
      dispensation of the remaining two doses of drugs to be given at home in the presence of a&#xD;
      study field worker; (2) collection of blood samples for measles serology; (3) advice given to&#xD;
      the caretakers to bring their children to the health facility if the child becomes ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study areas, the second 200 children will be followed up on day 7 post-administration&#xD;
      of IPTi third course (contact 3a) and a finger prick blood sample will be collected for&#xD;
      determination of haemoglobin and preparation of blood film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of study infants who are due for blood examination one month after receiving course 3&#xD;
      of the study drugs will be generated from the contact3 database every month. These infants&#xD;
      will be visited at home (contact 4) by a study team and a finger prick blood sample (400 μl)&#xD;
      will be collected for determination of Hb, blood film preparation for malaria parasites and&#xD;
      measuring anti-VSA antibodies. A random sample of 20% of infants will be visited at home at&#xD;
      11 months of age or two months after the 3rd course of the study drug (contact 5) and a&#xD;
      finger prick blood sample will be collected for Hb and blood film preparation. Another random&#xD;
      sample of 20% of children will be visited at home at 12 months of age or 3 months after the&#xD;
      3rd course of the drug (contact 6) and a finger prick blood will be collected for Hb and&#xD;
      blood film preparation. Infant who had a blood sample taken at 11 months of age will be&#xD;
      excluded from the sample of infants selected for collection of blood samples at 12 months of&#xD;
      age. . All study children will be visited at home at the age of approximately 18 months&#xD;
      (contact 7) and a finger prick blood sample (400 μl) will be obtained for determination of&#xD;
      Hb, blood film preparation for malaria parasites and measuring anti-VSA antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be visited at home at the age of approximately 24 months (contact 8) and&#xD;
      finger prick blood sample will be obtained for screening for malaria using Optimal dipsticks&#xD;
      and also for preparation of blood slides, filter paper samples and Hb. If a child is positive&#xD;
      by dipstick test, is currently febrile (Temp &gt;37.5° C) or has a history of fever within the&#xD;
      past 2 days, and/or has a history of taking SP for a febrile illness during the previous&#xD;
      week, the child will be treated with quinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the dipstick test is positive for malaria and there is no history of fever within the past&#xD;
      2 days and no history of use of SP within the past week, the child will be given a full&#xD;
      treatment course of any one of the three antimalarial drug used for IPTi ie SP, Lapdap or&#xD;
      mefloquine, allocated randomly. The randomisation of treatment regime will be done in blocks&#xD;
      of 6. Within each block of six envelopes, two will contain LapDap, two will contain MQ and&#xD;
      Lapdap placebo for day 2 and 3, two will contain SP and Lapdap placebo for day 2 and 3. A&#xD;
      random sample of 10% of children will be visited on day3 to assess whether the drugs were&#xD;
      given to the children and a urine sample will be taken from approximately 200 children&#xD;
      (selected randomly through out the year) for testing for mefloquine, dapsone and&#xD;
      pyrimethamine using high performance liquid chromatography. All children who were treated&#xD;
      with an antimalarial drug will be followed up on post treatment day 14 (contact 9) and on day&#xD;
      28 (contact 10). On these two visits a finger prick blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      examination of malaria parasite and filter paper sample obtained for subsequent determination&#xD;
      of resistance markers to SP and Lapdap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and allocation of study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization will be an individual infant. Infants will be allocated to one of&#xD;
      the study groups by permuted block randomization. Each study drug, including placebo, will be&#xD;
      assigned 4 group codes; there will be 16 study groups in total in each study site and these&#xD;
      will be colour coded. An independent statistician (Dr Tom Smith) will prepare the&#xD;
      randomization scheme during the preparatory phase of the study. 233 blocks of 16 blister&#xD;
      packs of study drugs [80 blocks (1280/16 = 80) for the high transmission area, and 153 blocks&#xD;
      (2448/16 = 153) for the low transmission area] will be prepared and the study drug codes will&#xD;
      be kept by the independent statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tablets will be crushed and mixed with syrup at the time of administration. The first&#xD;
      dose will be administered at the EPI clinic by a designated member of the study team. The&#xD;
      drugs for day 2 and 3 will be dispensed in blister packs and the caretakers will be advised&#xD;
      to administer the drugs at home. The level of compliance and side effects of the drug will be&#xD;
      monitored by the compliance assessment team during home visits made on day 2 and day 3. If&#xD;
      drugs had not been given by the caretakers, the project staff will administer the drugs with&#xD;
      the consent of the caretaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral administration of mefloquine can induce vomiting in children suffering from clinical&#xD;
      malaria. We will observe the incidence of vomiting over an initial period of three months and&#xD;
      report this information to the Data, Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). If the incidence of&#xD;
      vomiting is significant, the DSMB may recommend that the schedule of mefloquine&#xD;
      administration should be changed to a split dose (15 mg /kg on day 1 and 10 mg/kg on day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring compliance and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with the three days of medication will be assessed by field staff during their&#xD;
      visits on days 2 and 3. Urine samples will be collected on a random basis throughout the&#xD;
      course of the trial at the day 3 visit and tested for mefloquine, dapsone and pyrimethamine&#xD;
      using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the safety and acceptability of mefloquine and Lapdap when used for IPTi will be&#xD;
      a major objective of the study. This will be accomplished in three main ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in haemoglobin during the week following treatment will be measured and related&#xD;
           to the presence or absence of parasitaemia and or fever at the time of treatment. Data&#xD;
           for each of the 16 treatment groups will be collated by the investigators and given to&#xD;
           the DSMB which will be asked to break the code for these subjects and to determine if&#xD;
           there is are any concerns over a fall in Hb in the approximately 200 infants who have&#xD;
           received Lapdap. It will be possible to compare findings in these children with those&#xD;
           children who receive mefloquine, SP or placebo. If necessary, the G-6-P-D status will be&#xD;
           determined in any children who show a drop in Hb and in matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . At the time of the day 3 follow-up, a questionnaire will be completed which asks about&#xD;
           the health of the infant since the time of drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . An adverse events reporting system will be established in each of the health centres&#xD;
           participating in the trial. Any severe adverse event will be reported to the chair of&#xD;
           the DSMB and to GSK within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs used for IPTi must not have any suppressive on the immune response to EPI vaccines&#xD;
      given concurrently. An impact on measles vaccination is the issue of most concern. Therefore,&#xD;
      a serum sample will be collected at the age of 9 months before administering measles&#xD;
      vaccination and one month after the administration of the vaccine. Antibody concentrations to&#xD;
      DPT antigens may be measured in these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance of clinical malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study infants will be encouraged to attend the study health facilities for any illness.&#xD;
      At these visits a health questionnaire will be completed and temperature recorded using an&#xD;
      electronic thermometer. A finger prick blood sample will be collected for Hb and malaria&#xD;
      parasite and for detection of molecular markers of resistance from all infants attending the&#xD;
      study health facilities for any illness that is clinically diagnosed as malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with proven or presumptive malaria will be treated with quinine according to the MoH&#xD;
      guidelines for managing treatment failures following first line drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that IPTi with any of the study drugs does not lead to a rebound in the incidence&#xD;
      of severe malaria or anaemia during the second year of life all infants enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be followed until they reach the age of 24 months. During their second year of life, all&#xD;
      episodes of possible malaria or anaemia in infants who present to health centre in the study&#xD;
      area will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted under conditions of good clinical practice (GCP), following as&#xD;
      closely as possible the ICH guidelines. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be&#xD;
      developed for all major operations. A DSMB will be established to look after the trial.&#xD;
      Discussions will be held with the DSMB prior to the start of the trial to identify their&#xD;
      requirements for adverse events reporting and these will be met. The DSMB will also be&#xD;
      consulted about the advisability of an interim analysis, in particular for the SP group as&#xD;
      this drug may prove to be ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study site, a local physician will be assigned to be the local safety monitor. In the&#xD;
      event of a serious adverse event associated with a study drug, the local safety monitor will&#xD;
      be empowered to break the code for that child and, if it is considered necessary to&#xD;
      temporarily suspend the trial, prior to discussion with the DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that a clinical monitor will be appointed by the IPTi consortium to monitor&#xD;
      all the trials conducted under its auspices and it is anticipated that the monitor will visit&#xD;
      the study site on at least one occasion during the trial and provide advice that will help to&#xD;
      ensure that the study is conducted to the highest clinical standard.&#xD;
