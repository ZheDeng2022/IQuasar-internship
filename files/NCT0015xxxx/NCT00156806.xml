  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer treatment often involved radiation to the breast. A side-effect of this&#xD;
      treatment is skin redness, itching and burning. Some patients have quite severe reactions.&#xD;
      Our current treatment for this is to avoid any soaps or other skin irritants and to use a&#xD;
      moisturizing cream once all radiation is finished. Aloe vera is believed by many people to be&#xD;
      useful for treatment of skin burns but this has never been proven in a randomized study. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare aloe vera gel versus plan gel versus the standard treatment&#xD;
      to determine if there is any benefit. If there was a benefit of gel treatment over standard&#xD;
      it could make radiation treatments more tolerable for cancer patients.&#xD;

      BackgroundRadiation therapy is an important component of treatment for breast cancer,&#xD;
      especially in the setting of breast conservation. Even though cancer patients who are&#xD;
      receiving radiation treatments follow established hygiene and skin-care protocols they still&#xD;
      experience differing degrees of cutaneous skin reactions and associated symptoms of dryness,&#xD;
      itchiness, burning sensations, and pain.1-7 For some patients the side-effects associated&#xD;
      with radiation therapy can become so severe serious consideration is given to discontinuing&#xD;
      treatments. The treatments currently used for reducing cutaneous reactions and symptoms are&#xD;
      very limited and often ineffective.5-7 Anti-inflammatories and steroid-based topical&#xD;
      pharmaceutical agents are used sparingly due in part to research findings8 and potential&#xD;
      harmful side-effects.7 This has left physicians and patients using a trial and error approach&#xD;
      in seeking an alternative treatment that will help these patients cope with (and sometimes&#xD;
      endure) the cutaneous radiation side-effects. Ongoing clinical experience and discussions&#xD;
      with present and former radiation patients reveals that skin irritation, breakdown, pain and&#xD;
      associated suffering are common side-effects that patients wish they did not have to&#xD;
      experience. The lack of effective, efficient, non-pharmacological treatments for reducing&#xD;
      symptoms associated with cutaneous skin reactions to radiation cancer therapy is problematic.&#xD;
      Study Objectives the overall aim of the study is to determine if biologically active A.&#xD;
      barbadensis is a therapeutic agent for reduction of cutaneous side effects women experience&#xD;
      as a result of undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer.The primary aim is to determine&#xD;
      if there is a significant reduction or increase of cutaneous skin reactions using A.&#xD;
      barbadensis on the irradiated skin of the breast or chest wall in comparison to following the&#xD;
      standard CCI non-pharmacological treatment protocol and in comparison to using the moist&#xD;
      inert vehicle gel on the irradiated site.The secondary aim is to explore if there is a&#xD;
      reduction or increase in subjective symptoms at the irradiated site with the use of A.&#xD;
      barbadensis in comparison to following the standard CCI 'best care' non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment protocol and in comparison to using the moist inert vehicle gel on the irradiated&#xD;
      site.MethodThis study is a single blind randomized controlled trial using a three Arm design.&#xD;
      Analysis stratification is being conducted according to radiation technique, breast size,&#xD;
      smoker vs. non-smoker, nutrition, protocol adherence, and prior chemotherapy. The control arm&#xD;
      will treat the skin reaction as per standard CCI breast radiation protocol&#xD;
