  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The condition Charcot foot has been known in more than 130 years, and yet there still remains&#xD;
      a large effort to find the cause, diagnostic and medical treatment of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charcot neuroarthropathy is a progressive disease of bone and joints characterized by&#xD;
      often-painless bone and joint destruction in limbs that have lost sensory innervation. The&#xD;
      incidence of acute Charcot among diabetic patients is 0,2 % the prevalence is 7,5 %. In the&#xD;
      group of patients with neuropathy the prevalence is even higher -29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is often made on a clinical basis, particularly in the early stages of the&#xD;
      condition. The aim of this study is to find a method that makes the diagnosis primarily on&#xD;
      the basis of paraclinical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical patients have had diabetes in 10 years and have distal symmetrical neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common lesion is unilateral with an acute phase, which may occur either spontaneously or&#xD;
      be triggered by a minor trauma. The foot becomes swollen, warm, red and oedematous. Some&#xD;
      patients have pain, and the condition could be misdiagnosed as cellulites, acute gout, deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis and osteomyelitis. If the patient has a foot ulcer it is important to rule&#xD;
      out osteomyelitis and cellulites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial phase it is difficult to make the right diagnose because Charcot is a rare&#xD;
      condition. This leads to a delay in the treatment of the Charcot foot, which, for the moment,&#xD;
      is reduction of weight bearing. The patient is equipped with an air cast, and the non&#xD;
      weight-bearing regime is in some cases maintained in 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronic Charcot is characterized by established deformity. The deformity can be in&#xD;
      different sites in the foot, the most common is in the mid foot. Because of the deformity&#xD;
      there is abnormal weight pressure on the weight bearing sites on the foot. This is associated&#xD;
      with callus formation and there is a higher risk for ulceration.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is a case control study where the aim is to test a set off clinical tests&#xD;
      to see if the diagnose Charcot foot can be made paraclinical. The assumption is, that there&#xD;
      are other parameter than the clinical observation that differ between the Charcot patient and&#xD;
      a patient with polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a variety of examinations. All patients will undergo a clinical&#xD;
      examination by the same physician, including a neurological status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paraclinical examinations consist of blood samples, x-ray of the foot (if normal then&#xD;
      MR-scanning of the foot), skeletal Scintigraphy, DEXA scanning, distal blood pressure, beat&#xD;
      to beat examination to decide the autonomous neuropathy. If the patient has a positive&#xD;
      skeletal scintigraphy and ulceration on the foot, or elevated infection parameter in the&#xD;
      blood sample, then a leukocyte scintigraphy will be performed in order to rule out&#xD;
      osteomyelitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population that we will include in the study is divided in 5 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with diabetes and acute Charcot foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with diabetes and chronic Charcot foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with diabetes and amputation of the first toe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with diabetes and polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with diabetes and without polyneuropathy. All patients will undergo the full&#xD;
           examination program, with the exception of the cases mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is need for a better diagnostic of the condition Charcot foot, due to the severe&#xD;
      longtime complication in form of disablement. In some cases even amputation of the foot. If&#xD;
      the diagnosis is made earlier, obviously one can start the intervention earlier, and this&#xD;
      will improve the &quot;survival&quot; of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another advantage is that agreed criteria for the diagnosis of Charcot would help in allowing&#xD;
      comparison of different treatments.&#xD;
