  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a Phase 1B/2A, uncontrolled, open-label, single-center study in individuals&#xD;
      with congenital AAT (alpha 1-antitrypsin) deficiency. A baseline bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 3 to a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
      administration of study drug. Fifteen eligible subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3&#xD;
      dosing regimens of rAAT (100 mg daily, 100 mg twice daily, or 200 mg daily) administered via&#xD;
      nebulization for 7 consecutive days. A post-treatment nadir BAL was obtained on study Day 8&#xD;
      (12 hours after last dose for subjects who receive drug therapy twice daily and 24 hours&#xD;
      after the last dose for subjects who receive study product daily). BALs were conducted in the&#xD;
      same lung lobe/segment. Follow-up visits took place on Day 15 and Day 36.&#xD;

             any prior replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) that is &gt;= 50% of predicted, measured 30&#xD;

             albuterol via metered dose inhaler [MDI]) or inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator&#xD;
             (e.g., ipratropium bromide), or oral PDE (phosphodiesterase) inhibitor, treatment on a&#xD;
             stable dose for at least 14 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For any female of childbearing potential, a negative urine test for pregnancy within 3&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment and agreement to employ adequate birth control measures for&#xD;
             the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant abnormalities detected on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
