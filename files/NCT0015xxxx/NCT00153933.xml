      The purpose if this study is to evaluate the side effects of the combination of bortezomib&#xD;
      and Revlimid (CC-5013) in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      -  Within 21 days of starting treatment the following tests will be performed: physical&#xD;
           exam (including vital signs), ECG, neurological examination, blood tests, urine tests,&#xD;
           bone marrow aspiration, x-rays and MRI or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive bortezomib intravenously on day 1,4,8 and 11 followed by 10 days&#xD;
           of rest. CC-5013 will be given orally on days 1-14 followed by 7-dyas of rest. One cycle&#xD;
           lasts 21 days. This study will evaluate different dose levels of bortezomib and CC-5013&#xD;
           to see which dose level seems to be the best for most people. There will be 8 dose&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assigned to a dose level depending upon when they begin the study and&#xD;
           how other dose levels have been tolerated by patients that are already on the study.&#xD;
           Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level and will be observed for one&#xD;
           full cycle. Depending upon the side effects, the dose level will increase, stay the same&#xD;
           or be decreased by one level for the next group. 10 additional patients will be treated&#xD;
           at the dose that is thought the best.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day four of the treatment cycle blood tests, vital signs and a review of side effects&#xD;
           will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day eight of the the treatment cycle blood tests, vital signs, review of side effects&#xD;
           and an ECG will be performed prior to medication administration. A bortezomib level will&#xD;
           be taken before bortezomib infusion, 15 minutes, 1/2 hour, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours,&#xD;
           4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours and 12 hours after the dose. Additional blood levels will be&#xD;
           collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after the dose. (These blood levels will done during the&#xD;
           first cycle only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 11 and day 14 of the treatment cycle blood tests, vital signs and review of side&#xD;
           effects will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 2 cycles of treatment, the doctor will assess how the patient's disease is&#xD;
           responding to the treatment. Additional tests such as bone marrow biopsy, x-rays or&#xD;
           scans may be performed. If the disease is stable or getting better, patients will&#xD;
           continue to receive repeated cycles of treatment. If the disease is getting worse,&#xD;
           dexamethasone may be added to the treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dexamethasone is added, the dosing will start on days 1,2,4,5,8,9 and 11 of the&#xD;
           21-day cycle. The disease will then be reassessed after 2 additional cycles. If the&#xD;
           disease is getting worse, the patient will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once 8 cycles of treatment have been performed, the disease will be fully assessed again&#xD;
           by blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, x-rays or scans. Again, if it is determined that the&#xD;
           disease is stable of getting better, additional treatment cycles can be performed. If&#xD;
           the disease is getting worse, treatment will be stopped..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit will be scheduled one month after the last dose of the study drug and&#xD;
           will include: physical exam, vital signs, neurological examination, and review of&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will remain on this study as long as the side effects are not too severe and&#xD;
           the disease has not progressed.&#xD;
