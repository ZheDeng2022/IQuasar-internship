      In this, here we want to present a new method for analysis variation in gene copy number for&#xD;
      patients and carriers of SMA. This is a relative quantitation method and, therefore, relies&#xD;
      on the inclusion of one or more internal control or reference sequences; quantitation of DNA&#xD;
      is relative to this reference sequence of known copy number. A peak height from within a&#xD;
      potentially duplicated or deleted target region is amplified simultaneously with a disomic&#xD;
      reference region in a multiplex PCR system.&#xD;

      Proximal spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder with an overall incidence&#xD;
      of 1 in 10000 live births and a carrier frequency of 1 in 50. This severe neuromuscular&#xD;
      disease is characterized by a degeneration and loss of alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord&#xD;
      anterior horn cells, which results in progressive symmetrical weakness, atrophy of the&#xD;
      proximal voluntary muscles, and infant death. Here, we present a new, rapid, simple and high&#xD;
      reliable method to detect the SMN1 deletion and to determine the copy number of the SMN1 and&#xD;
      SMN2 by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). We demonstrate that this&#xD;
      assay is able to accurately distinguish 2 gene copies from 4 gene copies and it can identify&#xD;
      SMA carriers and normal populations by the accurate determination of SMN copy number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal DNA testing is a promising tool for colorectal cancer screening. Researchers have shown&#xD;
      that DNA to be a good marker since it is stable in the stool; it shed continuously; and,&#xD;
      through the use of amplification tests, it can be detected in minute amounts. Many DNA&#xD;
      mutations associated with the process of colon cancer carcinogenesis have been characterized.&#xD;
      K-ras oncogene, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), p53, and microsatellite markers are&#xD;
      examples of genes targeted as DNA markers in stool testing because they are critical to the&#xD;
      control of colorectal cell growth. Early clinical studies have shown that multitarget DNA&#xD;
      testing has a 71% to 91% sensitivity for detection of cancer and a 55% to 82% sensitivity for&#xD;
      detecting adenoma 1cm or larger. We design this study, by using the automated DHPLC analysis&#xD;
      and the microsatellite markers set already at first, to stepwisely set-up a high throughput&#xD;
      but sensitive and specific screen method for colorectal cancer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem and is of concern not only to pediatricians&#xD;
      but also to the parents of neonates. Two key enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 and&#xD;
      heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), that involve bilirubin metabolism are highly noticed. First, UGT1A1&#xD;
      is the key enzyme for bilirubin conjugation and mutations of UGT1A1 cause the unconjugated&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemias known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert's syndrome. The high&#xD;
      allele-frequency of Gly71Arg and promoter polymorphism in UGT1A1 gene was found to be&#xD;
      responsible for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia without obvious cause. Second, HO-1 is a&#xD;
      rate-limiting enzyme in the heme metabolism and allows for the degradation of heme to&#xD;
      biliverdin. Recently, Maruo et al. demonstrated that (16/17) breastfed Japanese infants with&#xD;
      apparent prolonged jaundice had at least one mutation of the UGT1A1. These data suggested&#xD;
      that that defects of UGT1A1 may be an underlying cause of the prolonged unconjugated&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia associated with breast milk. However, to date the association between&#xD;
      breastfed infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia and UGT1A1 gene mutation is still unclear.&#xD;
      In this study, we will analyze the UGT1A1 and HO-1 genes of infants with unconjugated&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia associated with breast milk to ascertain whether genetic factors are&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will contribute to apply DHPLC on establishing various novels, fast, and&#xD;
      reliable applications for diagnosis of SMA and carrier detection of SMN1 and SMN2 genes,&#xD;
      sensitive and specific screen method for colorectal cancer screen, and analyze the UGT1A1 and&#xD;
      HO-1 genes of infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associated with breast milk.&#xD;
