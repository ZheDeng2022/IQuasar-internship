  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal therapy is the standard treatment for prostate cancer which has spread to other&#xD;
      areas of the body. Despite the high initial response rates to hormonal therapy, the vast&#xD;
      majority of men will develop cancer which is no longer responsive to hormone deprivation. The&#xD;
      average time for hormonal therapy to be effective is about 18 months. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      combinations which can treat the disease when it no longer responds to hormonal therapy have&#xD;
      been developed, but these treatments are not curative. One of these combinations is&#xD;
      estramustine, etoposide and paclitaxel. In men with far advanced disease, 60% will have a&#xD;
      decrease in their PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or shrinkage of tumors after treatment with&#xD;
      this chemotherapy. Despite this, these men have all developed further disease progression&#xD;
      requiring additional treatment. One possible way to make chemotherapy more effective is to&#xD;
      give it when the number of tumor cells is smallest, and the number of cells to be killed is&#xD;
      at a low level. One situation in which this is true is when a man has responded to hormonal&#xD;
      therapy any tumors are at their smallest size. This study will test whether the addition of&#xD;
      chemotherapy at that time will prolong the time until the cancer becomes unresponsive to&#xD;
      hormonal therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients must have a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate with&#xD;
        evidence of metastases on bone or CT scan. Patients with regional metastases to pelvic&#xD;
        lymph nodes (D1 disease) as their only site of metastases will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on androgen suppression therapy at the time of registration must have received&#xD;
        less than seven months of therapy (excluding any neoadjuvant hormonal therapy) and must&#xD;
        have a decreasing or stable PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be undergoing concurrent chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation&#xD;
        therapy. Prior to radiation therapy must have completed more than 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
        registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not have evidence of brain metastases or untreated spinal cord compression.&#xD;
