      To investigate the durability of HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus infection (HBV) who have seroconverted while participating in a previous&#xD;
      Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the durability of HBeAg seroconversion&#xD;
      in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) who have seroconverted while&#xD;
      participating in a previous Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the durability of HBeAg loss in&#xD;
      patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) who have experienced durable HBeAg&#xD;
      loss while participating in a previous Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.&#xD;

        Patients who demonstrate HBeAg seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss in one of the previous&#xD;
        Gilead-sponsored studies listed in Section 4.2 of this protocol and meet all inclusion and&#xD;
        none of the exclusion criteria for this study will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and must have&#xD;
             demonstrated HBeAg seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss as defined by the protocol in&#xD;
             one of the following Gilead-sponsored studies: GS-96-412, GS-98-437, GS-00-461 or&#xD;
             ongoing or future Gilead-sponsored studies identified by the Sponsor to be eligible&#xD;
             for this study. Other patients who were enrolled in a now closed Gilead-sponsored&#xD;
             study of ADV (GS-94-404, GS-96-412 Initial Phase or GS-96-413) and had previously&#xD;
             demonstrated seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss during their participation will be&#xD;
             evaluated by the clinical research organization (CRO) medical monitor for&#xD;
             participation in this study on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented negative serum HBeAg with or without positive anti-HBe present at the&#xD;
             two study visits prior to the final visit of the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has documented negative serum HBeAg without positive anti-HBe must also&#xD;
             have undetectable serum HBV DNA (less than 1000 copies/mL using Roche Amplicor PCR&#xD;
             Assay) and normalized ALT (less than ULN) confirmed during these two studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be able to give written informed consent and comply with&#xD;
             requirements of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who seroconvert or experience durable HBeAg loss during their participation&#xD;
             in study GS-00-480 will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would interfere with patient treatment, assessment or compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any of the excluded medications listed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
