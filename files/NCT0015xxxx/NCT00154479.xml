  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most frequent neoplasm of women in Taiwan and in the world. It&#xD;
      influences about 2,700 women with about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year and in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical&#xD;
      cancer especially those high-risk types which have been strongly associated with cervical&#xD;
      cancer. In recent years, there has been compelling evidence that infection with human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in most virus-induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role&#xD;
      in the clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by&#xD;
      both epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune-compromised patients such as&#xD;
      HIV-infected women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering from other forms of&#xD;
      malignancies, are at a higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Moreover, several studies establish the existence of natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in humans. Only a minority of women infected with oncogenic HPV&#xD;
      types develop CIN or cervical cancer. Indeed, the majority of CIN lesions do not progress or&#xD;
      even regress to normal cytology, indicating that other factors such as an inadequate immune&#xD;
      function are necessary for the development of progressive CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the HLA class I and II phenotypes may be correlated with an effective immune&#xD;
      response against HPV-associated cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign&#xD;
      antigens, such as those contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be&#xD;
      proposed to affect the risk of developing cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present proposal, the investigators would like to examine the HLA class I and II&#xD;
      associations among Taiwanese women with cervical neoplasia. The purposes of this proposal&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to address the relationships between the HLA class I and II haplotype, HPV infection,&#xD;
           and cervical cancer; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in different HLA class I and II&#xD;
           haplotypes. It will help the investigators to identify which population of HLA genotypes&#xD;
           is more susceptible to HPV infection and progresses to invasive cervical cancer. The&#xD;
           results of this research will be very useful for the prevention and screening of&#xD;
           cervical cancer in the future.&#xD;

      1. To survey the incidence of HPV infection in CIN and cervical cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using epidemiologic data drawn from a wide range of countries and population groups,&#xD;
           investigators have found evidence of HPV in 90% to 95% of cervical cancers. The&#xD;
           incidence of HPV in cervical cancer was 79% in our own report. Besides, 91% of&#xD;
           high-grade CIN cases and 50% of low-grade CIN cases could be attributed to HPV infection&#xD;
           in Taiwanese women. Because these reports for Taiwanese women were published around 10&#xD;
           years ago, it is important to survey and update the incidence of HPV in CIN and cervical&#xD;
           cancer patients in Taiwanese women. We will survey the incidence of HPV infection in 500&#xD;
           cervical cancer patients, 100 patients of CIN and 100 normal population patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To survey the human leukocyte antigen haplotype in CIN and cervical cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HLA class I and II alleles have been reported to associate with the nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           carcinoma in Taiwan. Besides, human leukocyte antigen class I and II alleles might&#xD;
           interplay in the response to interferon-alpha treatment in Taiwanese patients with&#xD;
           chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We will detect the HLA class I and II haplotype&#xD;
           first and then correlate them with the CIN and cervical cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the correlation between HLA class I and II haplotype and HPV infection and&#xD;
           CIN and cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will further survey the correlation between HLA class I and II and the genotypes of&#xD;
           HPV in CIN and cervical cancer patients. We will identify which HLA class I and II&#xD;
           haplotypes have positive or negative correlation with HPV infection, CIN and cervical&#xD;
           cancer. Then we would determine which specific HLA antigens are important in determining&#xD;
           the risk of HPV infection, CIN and cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in HLA2 with different II&#xD;
           haplotypes and the role of immunogenetics in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV type 16 has been identified to be the highest incidence of malignant HPV genotypes in&#xD;
      cervical cancer. Our laboratory has set up immunologic assays for evaluating the immune&#xD;
      responses to HPV type 16. We will survey the immune response to HPV type 16 in those HLA&#xD;
      class I and II haplotypes which have positive or negative correlation with the HPV infection&#xD;
      and cervical cancer. We would identify which population of HLA genotype are more susceptible&#xD;
      to HPV infection and invasive cervical cancer and elucidate the role of immunogenetics in the&#xD;
      HPV infection and carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.&#xD;
