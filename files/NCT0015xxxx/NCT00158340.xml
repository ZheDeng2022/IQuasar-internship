      This study will determine the effectiveness of guided self-help treatment in treating&#xD;
      individuals with binge eating disorder (BED).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious condition characterized by compulsive overeating and&#xD;
      feelings of powerlessness. The condition often has a negative impact on both physical and&#xD;
      emotional health. This study will examine ways to help people determine whether they have BED&#xD;
      and will test whether guided self-help (GSH) treatment is effective in treating BED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either GSH treatment or usual clinical care&#xD;
      (which may include general support and talk therapy) for 3 months. The GSH treatment is a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy-based program that will be administered over 8 sessions.&#xD;
      Participants receiving GSH will be given a book that focuses on dealing with BED; they will&#xD;
      also meet with a therapist regularly to have their progress monitored. The Eating Disorders&#xD;
      Examination (EDE), self-reports, questionnaires, and surveys will be used to assess&#xD;
      participants. Assessments will be conducted at study entry, at Weeks 2 and 4 of the&#xD;
      treatment, at the end of the treatment, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.&#xD;
