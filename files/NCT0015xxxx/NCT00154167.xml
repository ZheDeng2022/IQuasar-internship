      The purpose of this study was:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if NV-101 accelerates recovery from numbness compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate safety of NV-101&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. One hundred&#xD;
      twenty-two patients aged 10-58 requiring treatment with one of four routine dental procedures&#xD;
      were enrolled. The investigators were licensed dentists in private practice. Each patient&#xD;
      received one or more conventional injections of either articaine with epinephrine, lidocaine&#xD;
      with epinephrine, prilocaine with epinephrine, or mepivacaine with levonordefrin. Local&#xD;
      anesthetics were injected into no more than 2 sites. Injections of local anesthetic placed&#xD;
      within 4mm of each other constituted the same site. The injection(s) of study drug were made&#xD;
      at or near the completion of the dental procedure and were required to be not earlier than 20&#xD;
      minutes after, and not later than 70 minutes after, the most recent injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic. Patients received an injection of study drug (1.8 mL) in each site at which local&#xD;
      anesthetic had been injected (i.e. no more than 2 sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients self-evaluated the return of normal sensation in the lip, tongue, nose, and chin by&#xD;
      palpations at 5-minute intervals beginning 1 minute before the study drug injection and&#xD;
      continuing for a minimum of 3 hours and until they achieved the return of normal sensation in&#xD;
      lip, tongue, nose, and chin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was assessed by the use of a Holter monitor, vital signs, pain ratings, and physical&#xD;
      examinations including oral cavity examinations.&#xD;
