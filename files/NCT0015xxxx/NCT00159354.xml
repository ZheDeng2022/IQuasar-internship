  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophil involvement in the development of COPD by smokers is well recognised. However not&#xD;
      all smokers develop overt lung disease. We have previously shown that uptake of FDG is&#xD;
      related to neutrophil activity and can be measured by PET and that uptake is greater in COPD&#xD;
      patients than normal subjects. We have also shown that FDG-PET shows inflammatory changes in&#xD;
      asymptomatic smokers after cigarette smoking. We plan to investigate the attenuation of this&#xD;
      inflammation by steroid tablets and whether FDG PET can demonstrate this. We also wish to&#xD;
      establish if similar changes are demonstrated after smoking by COPD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic smokers will be recruited by advertisement in newspapers and from posters&#xD;
      displayed in the local community.Patients will be recruited from Hammersmith Hospital NHS&#xD;
      Trust and local GP surgeries, where we shall display posters. We shall also directly ask&#xD;
      patients whom we think may be suitable. This could be at a respiratory clinic, after they&#xD;
      attend the lung function department for routine tests, and at GP and practice nurse&#xD;
      appointments. After discussing the research outline with the subjects, either in person or by&#xD;
      phone, we shall give them the information sheet and ask them to attend for a screening visit.&#xD;
      This will be a chance for them to ask more questions, and for us to obtain informed consent.&#xD;
      We will then carry out a brief medical examination and routine lung function tests. Providing&#xD;
      they fulfil the inclusion criteria we shall then organise the subsequent visits, for 2 scans&#xD;
      if they are patients with COPD or 3 if they are asymptomatic smokers. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo chest X-ray to exclude other lung disease, unless they have had one in the past year.&#xD;
      They must abstain for smoking for at least 12 hours prior to visit, and fast for 4 hours&#xD;
      prior to scan. On the first day of attendance they will have a brief medical to assess&#xD;
      whether they are clinically stable, and have spirometry and CO monitored, to confirm&#xD;
      abstinence. For the scan visits the asymptomatic smokers will take the placebo or&#xD;
      prednisolone the previous evening at 10pm and again the next morning with a light breakfast&#xD;
      by 7:30am. On 2 scan days they will smoke 2 cigarettes 4h later, 60 minutes prior to scan.&#xD;
      The PET scan takes about 90 minutes, and includes blood sampling throughout. They must be&#xD;
      able to lie still in the scanner. We will aim to complete the scans at 1-2 week intervals,&#xD;
      whilst clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COPD patients will not take prednisolone/placebo, but will either smoke 2 real or dummy&#xD;
      cigarettes prior to scan. This protocol is similar to others used previously, which have&#xD;
      proved acceptable to COPD patients and healthy smokers.&#xD;
