  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt depression prevention interventions of proven benefit&#xD;
      to the primary care setting in a manner that would be acceptable and potentially available to&#xD;
      young adults in the community.&#xD;

      Our study goal is to develop a prototype combination primary care-web based depression&#xD;
      intervention for young adults ages 18-24years in urban community and university settings. The&#xD;
      content development will include: (1) two brief (15 minutes) primary care counseling&#xD;
      sessions, (2) one introductory web based module, (3) four web-based cognitive behavior&#xD;
      teaching modules, (4) three web-based modules discussing relationship building skills (IPT),&#xD;
      and (5) a final web module discussing self-recognition, evidence-based treatment, and stigma.&#xD;
      Eight young adult volunteers will evaluate the program in three loops of evaluation and&#xD;
      revision in a modified focus group approach. This protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Joint Committee on Clinical Investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables relate to the functionality and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention. These variables include readability, ease of understanding, acceptability, and&#xD;
      helpfulness of each component of the intervention, and a global rating of each&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process measures (time on site, exercise completion), outcomes (mood and intermediate&#xD;
      outcomes-social adjustment, dysfunctional thinking), and knowledge and opinions of current&#xD;
      treatments for depression. These data will be helpful in planning for a future Focus groups&#xD;
      of 5-10 individuals have been used successfully to provide initial product evaluations or to&#xD;
      develop general themes in attitude research. Summary statistics will be collected.&#xD;
