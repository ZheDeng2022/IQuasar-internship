      We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of prostate cancer patients at NTUH from 1978&#xD;
      to 2002. The initial presentations, systemic diseases, smoking habits, clinical stages,&#xD;
      Gleason scores, pathological stages, treatments, and outcome were recorded. Post-hoc&#xD;
      questionnaires were completed with OPD visits, admission visits, telephone interviews and&#xD;
      mails. The questionnaires included the family histories of prostate cancer, colon cancer,&#xD;
      breast cancer, hepatoma and so on. If patients is passed away, the first degree relatives&#xD;
      will fill the vacant position. The prevalence of family histories of prostate cancers in&#xD;
      these patients was determined. The associations of family histories and clinical&#xD;
      presentations were analyzed. Besides, the characteristics of patients with and without&#xD;
      responses were discussed.&#xD;
