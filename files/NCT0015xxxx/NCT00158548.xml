    <textblock>
      Chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria in Pakistan is prevalent in every malarious area&#xD;
      examined. Resistance to the favoured second-line treatment, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine S/P is&#xD;
      rising fast. To avert a repetition of the resistance catastrophe that occurred in SE Asia it&#xD;
      is critical to preserve the effective life of SP by using it in combination with artesunate.&#xD;
      Efficacy of ACT with artesunate in combination with chloroquine, SP or amodiaquine for&#xD;
      treatment of malaria (falciparum or vivax) will be examined in malaria patients in Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of falciparum malaria in Pakistan has risen 6-fold over the last 15 years and&#xD;
      chloroquine resistance is prevalent in every malarious area examined. Chloroquine's position&#xD;
      as first line treatment must be reconsidered. Resistance to the favoured second-line&#xD;
      treatment, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine SP, is 10% and rising fast. It is critical to preserve&#xD;
      the effective life of SP by using it in combination with a non-related fast-acting&#xD;
      antimalarial such as artesunate (AS). It is conceivable that use of AS in combination with&#xD;
      chloroquine itself might even recover the latter's effectiveness and restrain the selection&#xD;
      of stronger levels of chloroquine resistance. To determine the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      AS combination therapy in the subcontinent, randomized controlled trials will be conducted by&#xD;
      HealthNet International and government staff, with technical support from LSHTM, in Afghan&#xD;
      refugee camps in Pakistan against the current therapies of chloroquine, amodiaquine and SP.&#xD;
      Current policy is to use primaquine(PQ) as the gametocytocidal drug with CQ or SP. It is not&#xD;
      clear whether this has any value in the face of high levels of CQ resistance. The efficacy of&#xD;
      PQ in combination with CQ or SP will be examined in individual randomised trial in comparison&#xD;
      with CQ or SP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, treatment of falciparum and vivax malaria was with chloroquine. With development&#xD;
      of drug resistance treatment of the two species is diverging and this places higher priority&#xD;
      on accurate differential diagnosis which cannot always be met at peripheral health posts.&#xD;
      There may be advantage in harmonising treatment of the two species with ACT. Thus the current&#xD;
      treatment for vivax, chloroquine, shall be compared with that of ACT with artesunate and SP,&#xD;
      the likely ACT to be adopted for falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, single-blind, controlled trials comparing for falciparum malaria (1) artesunate&#xD;
      (AS) and chloroquine (CQ), vs CQ alone, vs CQ and primaquine (PQ); (2) AS and&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), vs SP alone, vs SP and PQ; (3) AS and amodiaquine (AQ), vs&#xD;
      AQ alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, single-blind, controlled trial comparing for vivax malaria: AS and&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), vs CQ alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CQ (day1,2,3) + placebo (day 1, 3) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CQ (day 1,2,3) + PQ (day 1) + placebo (day 3) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CQ (day 1,2,3) + PQ (day 3) + placebo (day 1) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CQ (day 1,2,3) + AS (day 1) + placebo (day 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S/P (day 1) + placebo (day 1) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S/P (day 1) + AS (day 1) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S/P (day 1) + PQ (day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AQ (day 1,2,3) + placebo (day 1,2,3) vs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AQ (day 1,2,3) + AS (day 1,2,3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the viability and transmissibility of any gametocytes (and also to detect&#xD;
      sub-patent gametocytaemias) still present after treatment it is also proposed to carry out&#xD;
      mosquito feeding studies directly on patients on the 7th day after the start of combination&#xD;
      therapy with either CQ, CQ+AS, CQ+PQ., SP, SP+AS, SP+PQ and to incubate any midgut infections&#xD;
      to the oocyst stage. To determine the genetic consequences of any selection from the&#xD;
      different drugs (i.e. CQ, AS, or PQ), the mosquito midgut infections would be preserved for&#xD;
      further genetic studies in UK, as would blood samples taken from initial and recrudescent&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve our understanding of the genetic basis of drug resistance we will genotype&#xD;
      parasites from blood samples of patients with treatment failure in this study. Blood samples&#xD;
      of 20 patients from each arm of the study who had parasitological treatment failure will be&#xD;
      selected randomly, together with midgut infections, and analysed for genetic markers of&#xD;
      resistance to chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine. These will be compared with&#xD;
      genotypes of pre-treatment infections.&#xD;
