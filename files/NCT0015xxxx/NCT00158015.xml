      The purpose of this study is to assess whether tissue doppler imaging is useful in predicting&#xD;
      which patients will respond most to Cardiac Resynchronization therapy ( a type of pacemaker)&#xD;

      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a newly developed therapy designed to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with heart failure(HF). Recent studies have shown significant&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement and a decrease in hospitalization and mortality with CRT. However, up&#xD;
      to 30 % of patients do not experience improvement with this invasive and costly therapy.&#xD;
      Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is emerging as an effective tool for non-invasively assessing&#xD;
      mechanical dyssynchrony of the left ventricle (LV) and may aid in the identification of LV&#xD;
      mechanical dyssynchrony to predict clinical response to CRT. PROMISE-CRT is designed to&#xD;
      address the following hypothesis: Changes in tissue doppler imaging measures of left&#xD;
      ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony from baseline to one week following cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy will correlate with the clinical response at three months. Seventy&#xD;
      HF patients clinically indicated to receive CRT will be enrolled in this six-month&#xD;
      multi-center study conducted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. TDI analyses,&#xD;
      measures of clinical improvement and LV remodeling will be conducted one week, three months,&#xD;
      six months after CRT implementation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moderate or severe heart failure defined as NYHA class III-IV despite optimal&#xD;
        pharmacological heart failure therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stable Heart failure as defined as not hospitalized within the last month. A 12 lead&#xD;
        electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained no more than 90 days prior to enrollment documenting a&#xD;
        sinus rate &gt;50bpm, QRS duration &gt;120ms and PR interval&gt; 150ms Ejection Fraction &lt;35%&#xD;
        documented within the last 6 months by one of the following methods: echo ( standard or&#xD;
        TEE) LV gram, or MUGA Clinically indicated to receive CRT Ability to complete all the study&#xD;
        visits including geographic stability&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum creatinine &gt;3.5 Have or had a Myocardial infarct, unstable angina, percutaneous&#xD;
        coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft during the preceding 30 days prior to&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have had previous cardiac resynchronization therapy, a coronary venous pace/sense lead or&#xD;
        attempted LV lead placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dyspnea believed by the physician to be primarily related to lung disease. Have an atrial&#xD;
        tachyarrhythmia that is permanent ( ie does not terminate spontaneously and cannot be&#xD;
        terminated with medical intervention)or persistent (can be terminated with medical&#xD;
        intervention but does not terminate spontaneously)within 90 days prior to enrollment Poor&#xD;
        sinus node function that MD predicts will require &gt;70% atrial pacing. Inability to perform&#xD;
        the six minute walk. Life expectancy of less than 6 months due to other medical conditions&#xD;
        or expected to undergo heart transplant within the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a mechanical tricuspid heart valve. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patients&#xD;
        with a hypersensitivity to a 0.7mg nominal dose of dexamethasone. Surgically uncorrected&#xD;
        primary valvular heart disease. Patients who are currently enrolled in another&#xD;
        investigational study that would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are younger than 18 years of age, pregnant, or who are mentally incompetent&#xD;
        and cannot sign a patient informed consent.&#xD;
