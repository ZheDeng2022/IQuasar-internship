  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there is an improvement in patient's quality of life,&#xD;
      pain, and fatigue after undergoing a supervised exercise program. If improvement is found,&#xD;
      this will help guide standard of care with lupus patients with a focus on exercise for&#xD;
      improvement of endurance, pain and overall health.&#xD;

      After patients have been selected and consented for this study, they will fill out a series&#xD;
      of questionnaires. These surveys are used to stratify the patient's disease activity, assess&#xD;
      perception of disease limitations including quality of life, fatigue and pain. We intend to&#xD;
      use the Systemic Lupus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) to quantify disease activity and the&#xD;
      SLICC to characterize the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, fatigue and depression will be assessed with the Pain Visual analogue scale, Fatigue&#xD;
      Severity Score (FSS), Patient Global Assessment and BECK depression scale. Other initial data&#xD;
      to be collected include patient's prednisone dose and resting heart rate. No specific&#xD;
      laboratory data will be collected for this study. Patients will continue with standard of&#xD;
      care monitoring based on their disease activity and medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 100 patients will be randomized approximately 50 in the exercise group and 50 in the&#xD;
      relaxation therapy group. The relaxation group will serve as the control arm of the study.&#xD;
      The patients in the relaxation therapy group will then undergo a training session on&#xD;
      biofeedback as well as receive further materials on relaxation techniques and a relaxation&#xD;
      tape. The relaxation tape will request subjects to systematically contract and relax eleven&#xD;
      isolated muscle groups. These muscle groups include; hands and wrists, biceps and triceps,&#xD;
      shoulders alone, neck, tongue and mouth, eyes, nose and forehead, back alone, abdominal area&#xD;
      alone, thighs alone, calves and feet and finally toes alone. This group of subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to perform relaxation exercises at home a minimum of three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the exercise group will have visits about 2 times per week for a total of 8&#xD;
      weeks, for a total of 16 visits. The first visit will include a general evaluation (strength,&#xD;
      range of motion, standing balance, gait assessment, baseline vitals), determination of heart&#xD;
      rate range for exercise and explanation of exercise portion of the study and home exercise&#xD;
      program. Visits 2 through 16 you will participate in simple, supervised exercise at the&#xD;
      physical therapy center at the University of Chicago. Heart rates will be measured several&#xD;
      times throughout your exercise visits. Additionally, subjects will be asked to rate your&#xD;
      level of pain, your blood pressure will be taken before and after and you will be advised&#xD;
      regarding at home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be seen for 16 visits total, unless a he/she stops attending PT sessions on&#xD;
      their own.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of SLE by ACR criteria; Age 16+ -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        patients with an active lupus flare, or patients with physical limitations impairing their&#xD;
        ability to participate in physical therapy. Other groups that will be excluded are those&#xD;
        with limiting pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease. Patients with mechanical or&#xD;
        structural abnormalities that would prohibit exercise (i.e. avascular necrosis of a&#xD;
        weight-bearing joint) will also be excluded. Finally, patients already participating in a&#xD;
        regular exercise program (&gt;1 day per week), or those with other conditions (based on the&#xD;
        physicians discretion) which prohibit participating in physical therapy will not qualify&#xD;
        for this study.&#xD;
