      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a modest reduction in salt intake on&#xD;
      blood pressure in white, black and Asian individuals with hypertension or prehypertension,&#xD;
      and also to determine whether a modest reduction in salt intake has beneficial effects on the&#xD;
      surrogate markers of target organ damage in cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The average salt intake for adults in the UK is approximately 10-12 g/day. The current&#xD;
      recommendations are to reduce salt intake to 5-6 g/day or less. Many randomised trials have&#xD;
      shown that this reduction in salt intake has a significant effect on blood pressure, however,&#xD;
      most previous trials were carried out in white individuals, fewer in blacks, and none in&#xD;
      Asians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in&#xD;
      animals suggest that that our current high salt intake may have other harmful effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health e.g. a direct effect on stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy,&#xD;
      progression of renal disease and proteinuria independent of and additive to salt's effect on&#xD;
      blood pressure. However, no well-controlled trials have studied whether a modest reduction in&#xD;
      salt intake has beneficial effects on the surrogate markers of target organ damage in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to carry out a double-blind randomised trial to study the effects of a modest&#xD;
      reduction in salt intake, as currently recommended, on blood pressure and target organ damage&#xD;
      assessed by the measurements of 24 hour urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular mass,&#xD;
      left ventricular diastolic function, pulse wave velocity and capillary density, in white,&#xD;
      black and Asian individuals with hypertension or prehypertension.&#xD;

      Comparisons: Usual salt intake compared to reduced salt intake.&#xD;
