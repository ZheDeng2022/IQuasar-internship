      Pre-eclampsia is a disorder unique to pregnancy affecting both the mother and the fetus.&#xD;
      Hypertension, proteinuria and edema are the most common and well-known maternal clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. The incidence is approximately 6-8%. Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity associated with pregnancy throughout the world.&#xD;
      The pathophysiology is unknown. At present, the most effective treatment is immediate&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers' studies contributed to the demonstration that the vasodilator nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) is important for correct placentation and that less nitric oxide (NO)- dependent&#xD;
      vasodilation and an excess formation of reactive oxygen species explain poor placenta&#xD;
      perfusion in pre-eclampsia. This reduced NO activity and increased oxidative stress in&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic placenta is related to low bioavailability of L-arginine, the NO precursor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study the researchers want to evaluate whether the administration of L-arginine&#xD;
      to women with a clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia might restore physiological NO production&#xD;
      in the placenta and ameliorate the pregnancy outcome.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years evidence has accumulated strongly suggesting that nitric oxide (NO), a&#xD;
      potent endothelial-derived vasodilator, might be implicated in gestational vasodilatation. NO&#xD;
      is synthesized from the aminoacid L-arginine by a family of enzymes, the NO synthases (NOS).&#xD;
      The endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) has been found in the human placenta&#xD;
      and immunohistochemically localized to the endothelium of the umbilical cord, chorionic plate&#xD;
      and stem villous vessels. Locally formed ecNOS-dependent NO may serve to maintain low&#xD;
      vascular resistance besides attenuating the action of vasoconstrictors. With its unique&#xD;
      angiogenic/vasculogenic properties, NO can be instrumental for promoting cytotrophoblast&#xD;
      endovascular invasion of uterine spiral arteries, an essential feature of normal&#xD;
      placentation. Inadequate production of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) in the placenta has&#xD;
      been recently suggested to explain the high resistance state and the ineffective placentation&#xD;
      of pre-eclampsia, however the results to date are conflicting. We recently found that&#xD;
      placental endothelial NO synthase (ecNOS) expression and activity were comparable in normal&#xD;
      pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia, but in pre-eclamptic placenta NO is degraded to&#xD;
      peroxynitrite, that is good candidate for mediating the oxidative damage of pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
      Concentration of the NO precursor L-arginine was lower in pre-eclampsia, suggesting a defect&#xD;
      in L-arginine bioavailability in the placentas. These results provide a biochemical&#xD;
      explanation for the defective NO synthesis in pre-eclamptic placenta since NO production by&#xD;
      endothelial NO synthase (ecNOS) is strongly dependent on the availability of the substrate&#xD;
      L-arginine so that low L-arginine availability induces NOS to synthesize peroxynitrite at the&#xD;
      expense of NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that, in the normal placenta, adequate concentration of L-arginine&#xD;
      selectively orients ecNOS toward NO, which is vital for a normal placentation.In the&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic placenta, instead, a lower than normal L-arginine concentration re-directs&#xD;
      ecNOS toward peroxynitrite which is generated in exuberant amounts at the expense of NO. This&#xD;
      favors microvascular damage and impairs cytotrophoblast invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, whether increasing L-arginine bioavailability might restore physiological NO production&#xD;
      in pre-eclamptic placenta is worth investigating in a pilot study that might represent the&#xD;
      basis of a large, multicenter trial aimed to explore the impact of the above treatment on&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare L-arginine and NO metabolite (NO2-/NO3-) concentrations in systemic and&#xD;
           umbilical cord blood, and placental ecNOS, nitrotyrosine and HNE-lysine staining and&#xD;
           levels of conjugated dienes in ten pre-eclamptic women given L-Arginine supplementation&#xD;
           and in ten pre-eclamptic women given placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare L-arginine transport activity in normal and pre-eclamptic placenta&#xD;
           syncytiotrophoblasts in vitro. To compare the mRNA expression of cationic aminoacid&#xD;
           systems (Y+ LAT, CAT-2 and CAT-4) in normal and pre-eclamptic placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare in pre-eclamptic women given L-Arginine supplementation and in pre-eclamptic&#xD;
           women given placebo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from pre-eclampsia onset to delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood pressure, albuminuria, proteinuria, complete blood cell count including&#xD;
           platelet count, serum creatinine, uric acid, triglycerides, cholesterol, C3, GOT, GPT,&#xD;
           GammaGT, HDL, LDL and LDH concentration at the time of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structural changes of the placenta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborn weight, height, and Apgar score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age at delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten women with clinical diagnosis of pre-eclampsia given oral L-arginine supplementation from&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis (cases) and ten women with clinical diagnosis of pre-eclampsia on&#xD;
      placebo (controls) matched with cases for age, parity, time of onset of pre-eclampsia and&#xD;
      concomitant risk factors (chronic hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, multiple pregnancy)&#xD;
      will be selected for study participation. Cases and controls will also receive conventional&#xD;
      therapy (antihypertensive drugs: nifedipine, alpha-methyldopa; magnesium for prophylaxis of&#xD;
      eclampsia; betamethasone for fetus maturation) for pre-eclampsia and will be homogenous for&#xD;
      treatment. Ten normotensive pregnant women (normotensive pregnancy) matched for gestational&#xD;
      age and for type of delivery (cesarean or vaginal) will be also studied. All subjects will&#xD;
      provide a written informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki. Patients will&#xD;
      enter the study as soon as diagnosis of pre-eclampsia will be done.&#xD;
