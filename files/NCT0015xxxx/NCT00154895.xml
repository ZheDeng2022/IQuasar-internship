      Patients and Methods Study design This study is a randomized trial of additional minocycline&#xD;
      pleurodesis after VATS for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. It was begun in June 2001 in&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgical Division, National Taiwan University Hospital. After VATS for primary&#xD;
      spontaneous pneumothorax, eligible patients were randomly assigned to additional minocycline&#xD;
      pleurodesis or observation. The primary end point was rate of ipsilateral recurrence after&#xD;
      the operation. Secondary end points included safety, early postoperative results, and&#xD;
      long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis. Consents were obtained from patients after&#xD;
      thorough explanation. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria All patients requiring VATS caused by ipsilateral recurrence, continuous&#xD;
      air leaks for &gt; 3 days, contralateral recurrence, presence of hemopneumothorax, or&#xD;
      uncomplicated first episode with professions at risk were eligible for this study. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were: greater than 50 years of age, underlying pulmonary disease, previous&#xD;
      ipsilateral thoracic operation, allergy to tetracycline or minocycline, and unwillingness to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative technique of VATS After confirmation of patient eligibility, either conventional or&#xD;
      needlescopic VATS was performed for these patients by his or her own choice. The cost of the&#xD;
      operation and cosmetic results were the main points considered by the patients as they made&#xD;
      their choices. The cost of needlescopic VATS is higher than that of conventional VATS because&#xD;
      our National Health Insurance will cover only a part of the disposable equipment. Our&#xD;
      previous study showed that the short-term results and recurrence rates of both techniques&#xD;
      were comparable, although needlescopic VATS provides better cosmetic results and less&#xD;
      residual chest pain.19 Conventional VATS was performed in a standard fashion under general&#xD;
      anesthesia using intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. The patients were placed&#xD;
      in a lateral decubitus position, and the ipsilateral lung was deflated. A 10-mm, 30-degree&#xD;
      telescope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was first inserted to examine the pleural cavity.&#xD;
      Two 15-mm skin incisions were made at the third or fourth intercostal space, anterior and&#xD;
      posterior axillary line. Light pleural adhesions were freed using electrocautery. When blebs&#xD;
      were identified, they were grasped with the ring forceps and excised with a 45-mm endoscopic&#xD;
      stapler. Blind apical stapling was done at the most suspicious area if no bleb could be&#xD;
      identified. The entire parietal surface was abraded by inserting the dissector with a strip&#xD;
      of diathermy scratch pad through the port sites. After postoperative lung reinflation, normal&#xD;
      saline solution was instilled to check for air leaks. A chest tube (28F) was placed in the&#xD;
      apex through one of the insertion wounds. The surgical specimens were routinely sent for&#xD;
      pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia, preparation, and operative procedures of the needlescopic VATS were almost&#xD;
      identical to the conventional VATS. However, two sets of independent video-thoracoscopic&#xD;
      equipment and monitors, one for needlescopic videothoracoscopy and the other for 10-mm&#xD;
      videothoracoscopy, were used simultaneously and placed near the patient's head. Basically, we&#xD;
      used the 10-mm videothoracoscopy for most of the surgical steps. A needlescope was indicated&#xD;
      only when we need the chest tube wound to insert the endoscopic stapler and ring forceps, to&#xD;
      extract the specimen, or to perform pleural abrasion.19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care and minocycline pleurodesis The patients were extubated in the operating&#xD;
      theater and observed for 1 to 2 hours in the recovery room. Postoperative analgesics include&#xD;
      routine oral, non-steroid analgesics and acetaminophen. Intensity of postoperative pain was&#xD;
      evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS; zero represented no pain and 10 represented&#xD;
      intractable pain) on the first, second, and third postoperative days. Intramuscular&#xD;
      meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol®, 50mg/ampule) was administered every 4 to 6 hours&#xD;
      according to the patient's request if the pain became intolerable, could not be relieved by&#xD;
      oral analgesics, and visual analogue scale was greater than 7. Chest radiography was&#xD;
      performed immediate postoperatively or the next morning. The chest tube was connected to a&#xD;
      low-pressure suction system of around -10 to -20 cmH2O if the lung was not fully expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and treatment regimen Patients were randomized to additional minocycline&#xD;
      pleurodesis (minocycline group) or observation (observation group) when the lung was&#xD;
      expanded. Randomization was accomplished according to the chart number, which was randomly&#xD;
      assigned before any kind of workup and management. When the chart number was even, the&#xD;
      patient was allocated in the minocycline group. When the chart number was odd, the patient&#xD;
      was allocated in the observation group. In the minocycline group, 20 mL of 2% lidocaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (400mg) followed by a solution of 20 mL of normal saline containing 300 or 400&#xD;
      mg (7mg/kg) of minocycline (Mirocin®, Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) was&#xD;
      instilled into the pleural cavity through the thoracostomy tube. The rubber tube connecting&#xD;
      the chest tube and chest bottle was raised 40 to 60 cm above the patient to trap the&#xD;
      minocycline but allow air to pass under pressure. Patients were repositioned every 30 minutes&#xD;
      so that the minocycline could contact all pleural surfaces. Side effects and complaints of&#xD;
      the patient were recorded. The rubber tube was lowered 6 to 8 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize the effects of pleural symphysis, minocycline was administered after full&#xD;
      expansion of the lung, which was usually accomplished on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
      However, in those patients who had persistent air leaks and could not fully inflate their&#xD;
      lung, minocycline was still used after 3 to 5 days of waiting. In the observation group,&#xD;
      nothing was instilled. A blinded study conducted by saline instillation was not suitable in&#xD;
      our experiment because the pain associated with minocycline injection would unmask the&#xD;
      blinding; and use of saline injection would place the patient at an unnecessary risk of&#xD;
      contamination of the pleural space. When prolonged air leaks developed in the observation&#xD;
      group, patients can still undergo minocycline instillation although the analysis was based on&#xD;
      an intent-to-treat method. The tube was removed in both groups when the lung was fully&#xD;
      expanded and no air leaks were noted in a 24-hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All complications after the operation were recorded. Prolonged air leaks were defined when&#xD;
      air leaks last for longer than 5 days. Pleural detachment was defined when a pneumothorax&#xD;
      developed right after removal of the chest tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After discharge from the hospital, patients were followed at the outpatient clinics&#xD;
      at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months where chest radiography was performed. Follow-ups&#xD;
      were then conducted every 6 months by a registered nurse who was blinded to the group&#xD;
      allocation by telephone conversation, according to a standard questionnaire that included&#xD;
      when the patient returned to work or school, whether a recurrence occurred, when it happened,&#xD;
      and how it was treated. Residual postoperative chest pain was evaluated on a pain score from&#xD;
      0 to 5, where 0 is pain free; 1 is occasional discomfort; 2 is occasional use of analgesics;&#xD;
      3 is using nonopiate analgesics; 4 is regular pain using opiates; 5 is severe and intractable&#xD;
      pain. All patients were followed for at least 12 months. Patients can come back to the clinic&#xD;
      or visit emergency department whenever they have chest pain, dyspnea, or any signs related to&#xD;
      the recurrence of pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pulmonary function analysis Postoperative pulmonary function tests were&#xD;
      performed for patients able to attend a hospital outpatient appointment at least 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0)&#xD;
      were measured using a spirometer of Microspiro HI-298 (Chest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with&#xD;
      the patients seated. A minimum of three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers were performed&#xD;
      and the best one was selected for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and statistical analysis The clinical data, operative findings, operation&#xD;
      time, durations of postoperative chest drainage, length of hospital stay, complications,&#xD;
      requested doses of meperidine, and data of VAS were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 446 patients (223 in each group) was originally assumed to reach clinical&#xD;
      significance (at the .05 level with a power of 0.8) if minocycline reduced the recurrence&#xD;
      rate from 9.8% to 2.9%.18 A planned interim analysis was conducted in March 2005 after&#xD;
      enrollment of 200 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Statistical analysis was&#xD;
      performed on an intent-to-treat basis rather than in an actual treatment basis. This study&#xD;
      was terminated earlier than expected because the interim analysis showed a significant&#xD;
      reduced rate of recurrence in patients receiving minocycline pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables such as age or weight were expressed as the mean + standard deviation&#xD;
      and analyzed by the two sample t-test. Categorical variables such as gender or smoking status&#xD;
      were presented by frequency (%) and analyzed by the Fisher's exact test. Intensity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain measured by VAS (from 0 to 10) were summarized by mean (95 percent&#xD;
      confidence interval) and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Scores of residual chest pain&#xD;
      were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Freedom from recurrence was analyzed by the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made by the log-rank test. To identify other&#xD;
      factors associated with recurrence of pneumothorax, the Cox regression model analyses for age&#xD;
      (&lt;25 vs ≧25), sex (male vs female), smoking status (yes vs no), operation indication&#xD;
      (ipsilateral recurrence vs others), operation method (needlescopic vs conventional VATS),&#xD;
      number of blebs (1 or 2 vs 0 or ≧3), number of endoscopic stapler cartridge, meperidine usage&#xD;
      (yes vs no), dose of requested meperidine, and the presence of complications (yes vs no) were&#xD;
      performed. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
