    <textblock>
      There is a remarkable lack of randomized trials concerning the potential benefit of using&#xD;
      arterial conduits for coronary bypass surgery. This is the purpose of the present trial.&#xD;
      Exclusive use of arterial conduits might result in improved conduit viability, reduced risk&#xD;
      of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction and other cardiac events, reduced need for&#xD;
      antianginal medication, improved functional status and possibly improved long term survival.&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for ten years after surgery.&#xD;

      I: Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a remarkable lack of randomized studies concerning the potential benefit of using&#xD;
      arterial grafts for coronary revascularization. Numerous observational reports consistently&#xD;
      confirm, that the use of a LIMA-LAD grafts is not associated with increased peroperative&#xD;
      mortality or morbidity and will result in an approximately 10% improved survival at 10 years&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average patency for LIMA-LAD grafts is 80%-85% after 10 years. 50% of the vein grafts are&#xD;
      occluded. LIMA-LAD grafting reduces the risk of of late myocardial infarction, other cardiac&#xD;
      events and reoperation, however the effect on recurrent angina or need of antianginal&#xD;
      medication is less certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question, whether bilateral IMA grafting has long term benefits compared to single IMA&#xD;
      grafts is controversial. Numerous observational retrospective studies fail to demonstrate&#xD;
      convincingly, that bilateral IMA grafting reduces long term mortality and improves the&#xD;
      frequency of late cardiac events and recurrent angina, but these data are difficult to&#xD;
      compare due to selection bias. It is not quite clear, if a minimal benefit represents a true&#xD;
      difference in outcome, or if two different populations are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether an increased degree of arterial revascularization, including radial artery (RA) and&#xD;
      IMA grafts, will result in an improved long term survival, reduced risk for recurrent angina,&#xD;
      reinfarction, antianginal medication and improved quality of life, is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial has not yet been performed and current observational 5 year follow-up data&#xD;
      are promising, but cannot document an anticipated benefit from a more stringent scientific&#xD;
      point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II: Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary bypass grafting with the use of LIMA + RIMA + RA (total arterial revascularization)&#xD;
      vs. LIMA + saphenous vein grafts will result in equal peroperative mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      rates and improve long term outcome in terms of improved patency rates, reduced risk of&#xD;
      recurrent angina, infarction and other cardiac events, reduced need for antianginal&#xD;
      medication, improved functional status and possibly improved long term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III: Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized trial comparing coronary bypass grafting with the use of LIMA + RIMA +&#xD;
      RA vs. LIMA + saphenous vein grafts in patients with 2 or 3 vessel disease (more than 1 graft&#xD;
      anticipated) with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Graft patency rates at 1, 5 and 10 years postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac event free survival 1, 5 and 10 years postoperatively (risk of hospital&#xD;
           readmission due to infarction, suspicion of infarction, unstable angina, arrythmias,&#xD;
           heart insufficiency, need for renewed angiography, angioplasty, redo surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peroperative mortality and morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risk of recurrent angina and need for antianginal medication 1, 5 and 10 years&#xD;
           postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data on functional status and social rehabilitation at clinical controls 3 months, 1, 5&#xD;
           and 10 years postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV: Design &amp; methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective randomized trial. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group A: Arterial revascularization with LIMA + RIMA + RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group B: LIMA and saphenous vein grafts are used as graft material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with 2 or 3 vessel coronary artery disease, where more than 1 coronary&#xD;
                bypass graft is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elective or subacute operation (unstable AP with surgery within a few days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion is independent of ventricular function, recent MI, degree and type of&#xD;
                coronary lesions and secondary risk factors as diabetes, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
                hypertension, lung function, chronic obstructive lung disease, peripheral&#xD;
                atherosclerotic disease, kidney function, earlier cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age: &lt; 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sufficient collateral blood supply to the hand by the ulnar artery, evaluated by&#xD;
                the Allen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients must be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concurrent malignant disease with expected survival of &lt; 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unsuitable saphenous vein grafts evaluated preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unsuitable saphenous vein grafts with a diameter &gt; 6mm evaluated peroperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute operation (unstable hemodynamics in terms of need of inotropic support,&#xD;
                ongoing MI with dynamic ECG changes, cardiogenic shock).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concommitant operation for valve disease or other forms of heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Redo operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Surgery, anaesthesia and postoperative care&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surgery, anaesthesia and postoperative care are performed according to current&#xD;
           guidelines at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endpoints and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is designed with respect to two primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Distal anastomotic patency rates at 1, 5 and 10 years postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cardiac event free survival 1, 5 and 10 years postoperatively (Cardiac event free&#xD;
                survival is defined as survival without readmission due to infarction, suspicion of&#xD;
                infarction, unstable angina, arrythmias, heart insufficiency, need for renewed&#xD;
                angiography, angioplasty, redo surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Peroperative mortality and morbidity (frequency of peroperative/ postoperative&#xD;
                infarction, arrythmias, use of IABP, inotropic support, pulmonary, renal and&#xD;
                cerebral complications, length of stay in the ICU, etc. according to registration&#xD;
                schemes).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Risk of recurrent angina and need for antianginal medication 1, 5 and 10 years&#xD;
                postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Data on functional status and social rehabilitation at clinical controls 3 months,&#xD;
                1, 5 and 10 years postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to these endpoints the follow-up is planned as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 month clinical control at referring hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 year control including angiography, which can be performed on an outpatient&#xD;
                basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5 year control including conventional angiography and computed tomography&#xD;
                angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10 year control including computed tomography angiography, which can be performed&#xD;
                on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated with respect to the primary endpoint graft patency at 1 and 5&#xD;
      years. A difference of 10-15% of patency in favour of the radial artery as bypass graft is&#xD;
      regarded as clinically relevant. Observational data on radial artery patency indicate patency&#xD;
      rates of 90-95% at 1 year and 85% at 5 years, while saphenous vein graft patency is 80-90% at&#xD;
      1 year and 60-70% at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect such a difference (15% improved patency for RA grafts, 85% vs 70%) with a 90%&#xD;
      probability (type 2 error 0.10) and a significance level of 0.05, the sample size for each&#xD;
      group would be n=150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 15% difference in patency rates at 5 years is in our opinion an assumption that probably&#xD;
      overestimates the vein graft patency, which means, that a sample size of 150 patients in each&#xD;
      group should guarantee with a high probability a statistically significant outcome.&#xD;
