      QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is controlled tidal volume delivery during the resuscitation of preterm infants &lt; 28 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation safe and feasible?&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Current resuscitation of preterm neonates follows the Neonatal&#xD;
      Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines. During initial resuscitation, neonates are bagged&#xD;
      with self/flow inflating bags to achieve adequate chest rise, heart rate &gt; 100 per minute and&#xD;
      a pink color. When positive pressure ventilation is delivered with a bag, tidal volume is not&#xD;
      measured. It is likely that high tidal volume is delivered to the neonate in order to achieve&#xD;
      a rapid response. The evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the&#xD;
      initiation of mechanical ventilation and volutrauma associated with continued ventilation,&#xD;
      are associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators in the lungs of the preterm&#xD;
      infants which induce pulmonary injury. This may interfere with the signaling involved in&#xD;
      alveolarization, leading to a decrease in alveolar formation or maldevelopment of the&#xD;
      alveoli, and subsequent evolution to chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of controlling tidal volume delivery (and&#xD;
      limiting manual ventilation), during the resuscitation of preterm infants &lt; 28 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized controlled pilot study of 40 preterm neonates at the&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN: All eligible parents at risk for preterm delivery at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation&#xD;
      will be approached. After obtaining written informed consent, infants will be randomized to&#xD;
      standard resuscitation according to NRP guidelines (control group) or resuscitation using&#xD;
      controlled tidal volume ventilation (5 ml/kg) (study group), if they require resuscitation.&#xD;
      Crossover to the control group will be allowed if there is clinical deterioration or no&#xD;
      clinical improvement after 3 minutes of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary: Apgar scores at 5,10, 15 and 20 minutes and pH, pO2, and pCO2 levels within 1&#xD;
           hour of resuscitation and at 4 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary: Durations of mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
           support, low flow oxygen/air requirement; respiratory status of infant at 28 days&#xD;
           postnatal and 36 weeks' corrected gestational age. Incidences of air leak,&#xD;
           intraventricular haemorrhage and all causes of mortality before discharge from NICU will&#xD;
           be compared.&#xD;

      Design Randomized controlled pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The study will be conducted at the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto which is a&#xD;
      tertiary care teaching hospital in the Greater Toronto Area. Approximately 50-75 neonates &lt;28&#xD;
      weeks' completed gestation are delivered at MSH per year. The institute has expertise in the&#xD;
      resuscitation of such preterm infants. All deliveries of preterm infants are attended by an&#xD;
      experienced respiratory therapist, a resuscitation nurse, a neonatology fellow and a&#xD;
      pediatric resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All neonates born at &lt;28 completed weeks' gestation according to early ultrasonographic&#xD;
      estimation or maternal account of last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Antenatally diagnosed congenital cardio-respiratory anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants with known chromosomal or genetic abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A prior knowledge of significant fetal distress (diagnosed on the basis of cardiographic&#xD;
           monitoring and defined as fetal heart rate &lt;100 beats per minute and/or loss of beat to&#xD;
           beat variability, and/or biophysical profile of &lt;4/8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Attending staff neonatologists, respiratory therapists and nursing staff at the&#xD;
      MSH will be informed of the study. Parents of potentially eligible neonates will be&#xD;
      identified by daily enquiry in the case room and NICU, and approached by one of the&#xD;
      investigators after the NICU team has consulted the parents regarding medical aspects of&#xD;
      preterm birth. The details of the study will be explained to parent(s) and informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. Where one of the investigators is responsible for the immediate&#xD;
      care of the newborn infant, another investigator will obtain informed consent. Recruitment&#xD;
      will continue until 40 subjects have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After obtaining the consent from the parent(s), a previously sealed envelope&#xD;
      will be opened to identify the group to which the subject is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The control group will be resuscitated as per NRP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study group will follow NRP guidelines except that immediately after initial&#xD;
           unresponsiveness to bag and mask ventilation for 30 seconds, the infants will be&#xD;
           intubated and controlled TV breaths will be delivered at 5 ml/kg using volume guarantee&#xD;
           ventilator (Babylog 8000, Drager Inc; Chantilly, US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: All deliveries will be attended as per the current NICU protocol. After the&#xD;
      delivery, the neonate will be transferred to a radiant warmer, dried, suctioned, and&#xD;
      evaluated for respiratory effort, heart rate, and colour. Further management will follow&#xD;
      according to the group of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: The neonates assigned to the control arm of the study will be resuscitated as&#xD;
      per the current NRP algorithm.7,8 The neonate will be intubated, as recommended in the&#xD;
      guidelines, if he/she is apneic or gasping or have a heart rate &lt;100 per minute or centrally&#xD;
      cyanosed after 30 seconds of intermittent positive pressure (IPPV) with a bag and mask and&#xD;
      100% oxygen.7,8 Manual IPPV via neonatal flow-inflating resuscitation bag will continue after&#xD;
      intubation. Correct tube placement will be verified by clinical examination. The recommended&#xD;
      algorithm for heart rate &lt;60 per minute will be followed. Once the infant has been stabilized&#xD;
      (oxygen saturation 86-92%, heart rate maintained at &gt;100 per minute and pink colour), he/she&#xD;
      will be weighed (the resuscitaire has in built scales to obtain the weight without&#xD;
      disconnecting the infants from the respiratory support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surfactant (BLESTM, BLES Biochemicals Inc, London, Ontario, Canada) will be administered&#xD;
      according to the current NICU protocol at MSH. This protocol recommends surfactant&#xD;
      administration within 15 minutes of delivery to all infants &lt;27 weeks' gestation and to&#xD;
      infants &gt;27 weeks' gestation if FiO2 requirements are &gt;35% and mean airway pressure is &gt;7 cm&#xD;
      of H2O. Five ml/kg of surfactant will be instilled via the endotracheal tube into the lungs&#xD;
      in three aliquots using a precut nasogastric tube attached to a syringe. Each aliquot will be&#xD;
      delivered with the infant lying in one of three head positions - supine, left lateral and&#xD;
      right lateral. Between the administration of each aliquot, the neonate will continue to&#xD;
      receive manual IPPV. After the administration of surfactant, the neonate will be attached to&#xD;
      a ventilator. If for any reason the administration of surfactant is delayed, the infant will&#xD;
      be attached to ventilator whenever the attending doctor feels it appropriate. Subsequent&#xD;
      administration of surfactant in this group will follow similar procedural framework as&#xD;
      outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group: In the first minute, neonates in the study group will be resuscitated as per the&#xD;
      current NRP algorithm, that is 30 seconds of IPPV using bag and mask ventilation will be&#xD;
      allowed. Intubation will proceed only for infants who are apneic, gasping, who have heart&#xD;
      rate &lt;100 per minute or centrally cyanosed after 30 seconds of intermittent positive pressure&#xD;
      (IPPV) with a bag and mask and 100% oxygen. Similar to the control group, a neonatal&#xD;
      flow-inflating resuscitation bag will be used to deliver IPPV before intubation. However&#xD;
      immediately post-intubation, infants in the study group will be attached to a ventilator kept&#xD;
      ready with the following preset parameters: PEEP of 4 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure limit&#xD;
      of 25 cm H2O, FiO2 at 100%, rate of 40 breaths per minute, flow rate of 5-10 L/min and&#xD;
      inspiratory time of 0.35 seconds. An assist control volume guarantee mode will be used during&#xD;
      the resuscitation. A volume guarantee ventilator (Babylog 8000, Drager Inc; Chantilly, US)&#xD;
      will be used for the purpose of the study. The TV will be set at 5 ml/kg. An estimated weight&#xD;
      will be used initially (according to either a recent estimated fetal weight on prenatal&#xD;
      ultrasonogram or mean birth weight for the gestational weight [if the infant is assumed to be&#xD;
      not growth restricted] or an estimate according to the attending team). Correct tube&#xD;
      placement will be verified by clinical examination. The recommended algorithm for heart rate&#xD;
      &lt;60 per minute will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an infant is not achieving TV of 5 ml/kg despite reaching upper pressure limit, visual&#xD;
      assessment of chest wall movement will be carried out. If the chest expansion is inadequate,&#xD;
      upper pressure limit will be increased by 5 cm of H2O. If the chest expansion is adequate,&#xD;
      assessment of leakage of volume between inspiration and expiration will be checked on the&#xD;
      display of the ventilator. If the leak is found to be &gt;30%, the infant will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study as he/she would be deemed unfit for the volume controlled ventilation. An adequate&#xD;
      response will be considered when oxygen saturation is between 86-92%, heart rate maintained&#xD;
      &gt;100 per minute and pink color. Once the infant has been stabilized, he/she will be weighed&#xD;
      using similar technique described in the control group without disconnecting from ventilator.&#xD;
      At this time, the TV will be adjusted to reflect correct weight of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar criteria for the administration of surfactant in the control group will be applied to&#xD;
      the study group. However, in order to avoid disconnection from the ventilator and&#xD;
      administration of manual breaths, a closed suctioning adapter with an administration port&#xD;
      (NeolinkTM Viasys MedSystems, Whoellng, IL, US) will be attached to the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
      Five ml/kg of surfactant (BLESTM, BLES Biochemicals Inc, London, Ontario, Canada) will be&#xD;
      delivered to the lungs in similar way while continuing mechanical ventilation at the same&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures common to both groups: An oxygen saturation monitor, cardiac leads and end tidal&#xD;
      CO2 leads will be attached to all infants at the earliest possible time. Continuous&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory monitoring will ensue and at the end of the resuscitation period the data&#xD;
      will be printed out. A naso/orogastric tube will be inserted. Umbilical arterial and&#xD;
      umbilical venous catheters will be inserted as per the routine of the NICU. A chest X-ray&#xD;
      will be done to assess endotracheal tube and catheter placement. Once stable, infants will be&#xD;
      transferred to the NICU. Further respiratory management of all infants will be performed as&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by NICU team and will be similar. (All infants are routinely ventilated&#xD;
      with an aim to achieve 4-6 ml/kg of TV). Furthermore, all infants will receive head&#xD;
      ultrasounds according to the current NICU practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover: Crossover to the control group will be allowed 3 minutes after the onset of the&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If oxygen saturations increase by less than 20% (for starting values of &lt;65%) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If oxygen saturations are &lt;80% (for starting values of &gt;65%) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the heart rate &lt;100 beats per minute or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If there is persistent central cyanosis in spite of resuscitation with 100% oxygen. In&#xD;
           that event, the infant will be deemed a non-responder and manual ventilation will be&#xD;
           allowed. However, the infant would be analyzed in the group of randomization (intention&#xD;
           to treat analysis). The transition period to achieve normoxia and normocapnia may be&#xD;
           longer in the study group patients. Therefore, patients in the intervention group may&#xD;
           have slow but sustained improvement and would not be considered non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY: It is anticipated that there will be concerns that neonates in the study arm are not&#xD;
      responding to resuscitation as rapidly as the neonates in the control arm of the study. By&#xD;
      ensuring that the oxygen saturations are increasing, it is likely that we will avoid hypoxia.&#xD;
      Mild hypercapnia, defined as a PaCO2 45-55 mmHg, provided the arterial pH is &gt;7.25 is&#xD;
      currently practiced in most NICUs and the evidence suggests no adverse effects. Continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of leak will ensure that the lungs are not over distended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety monitoring committee comprised of two neonatologists and a respiratory therapist not&#xD;
      involved in the study will be convened to observe adverse events and provide recommendations&#xD;
      about the study to the investigators. They will also report any concerns about the study to&#xD;
      the Research Ethics Board. The clinical data for each infant requiring crossover to the&#xD;
      control arm will be presented to the safety committee. The safety committee after reviewing&#xD;
      the data will provide comments to the investigators as to whether the study should continue&#xD;
      or not. The safety committee will be authorized to stop the study if it finds that the&#xD;
      standard care of the infants in the study group is being jeopardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data will be analyzed using the statistical package SPSS (version 10,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square test for categorical variables and Student's t test for&#xD;
      continuous variables will be used to compare the demographic characteristics in both groups.&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be performed; that is subjects will be analyzed in the same&#xD;
      group of allocation even if they needed to cross over to control arm. Duration profiles of&#xD;
      ventilatory requirement, CPAP requirement, and oxygen/air requirement in two groups will be&#xD;
      compared using Student's t test. The number of subjects requiring switch over to the control&#xD;
      group due to failure will be recorded. A priori analysis is also planned to compare the Apgar&#xD;
      scores and first blood gas parameters after assessing the distribution and applying&#xD;
      appropriate statistical transformation. A p value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant&#xD;
      for all analysis.&#xD;
