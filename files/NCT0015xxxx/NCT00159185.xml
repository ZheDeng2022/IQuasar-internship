      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a database including a description of the patient population that undergoes total&#xD;
           hip replacement with special emphasis on orthopedic and cardiovascular complications and&#xD;
           the quality of life 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterise the patient at risk for the above mentioned events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create methods for predicting patients at risk for short-term (90 days) and long term (1&#xD;
           year) complications in relation to hip replacement surgery.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total hip replacement surgery is a standard procedure, which has been shown to be both&#xD;
      cost-effective and to give the patient a pain free daily living. Since Sir Charnley made&#xD;
      total hip replacement a standard procedure millions of hips have been implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark about 100 out of 100.000 did get a hip replacement operation in 2001(DHAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient with a painful hip due to arthrosis, arthritis, fracture sequelae and other&#xD;
      reasons, is offered a total hip replacement, several issues are taken into consideration:&#xD;
      concurrent diseases, bone quality, age, life expectancy, prosthesis type, operation methods&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the elderly patient a thorough medical evaluation is performed in order to minimise the&#xD;
      intraoperative risc for cardiopulmonary morbidity. Nearly all patients in Denmark (over 99%)&#xD;
      are getting thromboprophylaxis during the hospital stay to minimise cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery the patients visits the outpatient clinic for routine control after 3 and 12&#xD;
      months. After that time the patient is usually out of orthopedic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of the procedures in Scandinavian countries are collected in databases. These&#xD;
      databases are constructed by national collection of data sheets from each hospital performing&#xD;
      the procedures. The collected data most often only include data as far as the arthroplasty is&#xD;
      concerned. Normally there is no monitoring of the quality of the collected data - a&#xD;
      considerable margin of errors in the results produced from these databases must there for be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of publications concerning total joint replacement is enormous, but most&#xD;
      publications in this field come from clinical trials dealing with new pharmacological&#xD;
      products or new implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few authors have considered the overall patient morbidity and quality of life after the&#xD;
      hip replacement operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this Ph.D. project is planned to get more and newer data of the population that is&#xD;
      offered a total hip replacement. Furthermore, it will be attempted to find prognostic factors&#xD;
      as far as the overall risk for cardiopulmonary complications in the first 1 - 3 years after&#xD;
      the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Create a database including a description of the patient population that undergo total hip&#xD;
      replacement with special emphasis on orthopedic and cardiovascular complications and the&#xD;
      quality of life 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterise the patient at risk for the above mentioned events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Create methods for predicting patients at risk for short-term (90 days) and long term (1&#xD;
      years) complications in relation to hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a well defined small group of high risk patients that gets the serious cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk for cardiovascular complications is increased for a longer period than the&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A not neglectable group of the patients do not get the expected benefit from the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective monocentre, longitudinal cohort study of 500 patients operated in the County of&#xD;
      Frederiksborg from 01.01 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected by interview before the operation, on day 5 and after 3 month and&#xD;
      a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And additional data will be collected from patient files, local hip- and anaesthesia&#xD;
      databases, laboratory system, the Danish Hospital Discharge Register (LPR), autopsy reports&#xD;
      and death register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PhD study is included various courses, including a course on statistical methods.&#xD;
      External statistical aid might be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients to be operated with total hip replacement in Frederiksborg amt from 01.01.2004&#xD;
      until 500 pt. have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refuse of consent and age under 18years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Scientific Ethical Committee and theDanish Dataprotection Agency has to approve the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project follows the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will not imply any discomfort and no risk for the patient.&#xD;
