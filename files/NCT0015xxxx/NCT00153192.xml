  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if Marinol alleviates pain in patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain who are currently taking opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study begins with a 2-hour initial visit followed by three 8-hour appointments at Brigham&#xD;
      and Women's Hospital. At each 8-hour visit, patients receive a dose of medication and&#xD;
      complete surveys relating to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit a brief examination and a few surveys about pain, quality of life, and&#xD;
      medical history are given. The study doctor then determines if the participant continues to&#xD;
      qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If qualified for the study, patients receive a daily diary to record pain levels and pain&#xD;
      medications; this will take about 5 minutes each day. After completion of the diary, patients&#xD;
      begin the 8-hour visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients visit the Pain Trials Center three times to receive study medication. After taking&#xD;
      the study medication, participants remain in the clinic for 8 hours to complete hourly&#xD;
      surveys about pain and pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to these visits, patients may enter a 1-month extension where Marinol is taken at&#xD;
      home, and pain levels are recorded in a diary. Participants can change the dose of study drug&#xD;
      to better control pain and side effects, after speaking with study staff. The study then&#xD;
      concludes with a final 30-minute visit to summarize the participant's experience in the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the informed consent process subjects will be informed that Marinol (Dronabinol) is&#xD;
      generally not used for chronic pain and there will be no provision for extended treatment&#xD;
      with Dronabinol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises two phases, the blinded single-dose phase and the open-label multi-dose&#xD;
      phase. There are five visits in all; one baseline visit, three treatment visits in the&#xD;
      single-dose phase, and then a final end-of-study visit after the multi-dose phase is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be initially screened by telephone, and if eligible will present for a baseline&#xD;
      visit. This visit will verify enrollment criteria, and will include a history and physical&#xD;
      exam, urine pregnancy test if indicated, and baseline assessments. Subjects who meet full&#xD;
      enrollment criteria will be randomly allocated to one of the treatment sequences of the&#xD;
      single-dose phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-Dose Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment sequence will be a randomized 3-treatment, 3-period crossover trial. Each&#xD;
      subject will receive each treatment in a sequence randomly allocated by the Investigational&#xD;
      Drug Services Department at Brigham and Women's Hospital. These visits will be scheduled a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 days apart, and subjects will be instructed to reschedule if their pain is less&#xD;
      than 4/10 on the morning of their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the days of the treatment visits, subjects will arrive in the Clinical Trials Center at&#xD;
      7-8am, without having taken their morning opioid dose. They will also be fasting, except for&#xD;
      clear liquids. They will have a baseline blood sample drawn for level of THC, if any, in&#xD;
      their blood. Patients will receive study drug at 8-9 am, and will be monitored for 8 hours,&#xD;
      and subsequently discharged home. At the 4- and 8-hour mark, two more blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn. Total amount of blood taken for all three samples together will be less than 10 ml.&#xD;
      Subjects who require rescue dosing during the 8-hour study period will take their customary&#xD;
      rescue analgesic, be observed in the study center to ensure that they achieve adequate relief&#xD;
      of their pain, and then discharged home. A &quot;rescue assessment&quot; will be completed at the time&#xD;
      of rescue dosing and will be the final assessment for that treatment session. At the end of&#xD;
      the fourth visit (the final treatment visit), prior to discharge, subjects will be offered&#xD;
      entry into the one-month open-label extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-Dose Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who choose to enter the open-label extension will be provided Marinol tablets which&#xD;
      they will then take according to a prearranged titration table. Subjects may titrate upwards&#xD;
      for inadequate analgesia or downwards for side effects. Subjects must be on a dose for a&#xD;
      minimum of two days prior to upward titration, but may titrate downward at any time due to&#xD;
      side effects. Subjects unable to tolerate any regimens will be dropped from the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to be on a stable dronabinol regimen during the last week of the&#xD;
      study. Subjects who choose to terminate early will be encouraged to present for a termination&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue baseline analgesics, including background and rescue opioids as they&#xD;
      had been prior to the trial. Downward titration of opioids will be allowed if clinically&#xD;
      indicated, per judgment of patient and investigator. Subjects will be contacted weekly at the&#xD;
      end of weeks 1, 2, and 3. Data collected during the telephone contacts will relate to pain,&#xD;
      medication consumption (study and non-study analgesics), and side effects. Subjects will&#xD;
      present for an end-of-study visit at the end of week 4.&#xD;
