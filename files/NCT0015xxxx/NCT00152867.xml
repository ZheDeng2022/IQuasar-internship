    <textblock>
      Background: Dexamethasone is a steroid, which is often given into the vein before&#xD;
      chemotherapy to help control acute nausea and vomiting. It can also be given as an oral&#xD;
      tablet for patients to take for the two days following chemotherapy to help minimise delayed&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting. In chemotherapy regimens that cause high rates of nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      the use of dexamethasone is well proven. However, in chemotherapy regimens that generally&#xD;
      cause only minimal to moderate rates of nausea and vomiting, the value of oral dexamethasone&#xD;
      in the 48-hour period after chemotherapy is not well proven, although it is often prescribed.&#xD;
      While dexamethasone does decrease nausea, it causes additional side-effects such as insomnia,&#xD;
      indigestion, anxiety and mood changes. While patients with less vomiting and nausea are&#xD;
      expected to have better quality of life (QOL), for patients with minimal nausea or vomiting,&#xD;
      their QOL might be more affected by the side effects of the dexamethasone treatment than by&#xD;
      the nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be performed in patients who will be receiving first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment with a moderate risk of nausea/vomiting. Anti-nausea therapy for acute&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting will be standardised and all patients will receive non-steroidal medication&#xD;
      for delayed nausea control. Each patient will be randomly allocated to receive either oral&#xD;
      dexamethasone or an identical appearing placebo tablet for two days after chemotherapy for&#xD;
      the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then crossed over to the other treatment for the second&#xD;
      cycle. Patients will complete QOL assessments, dexamethasone symptom and nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      questionnaires, as well as nausea/vomiting diaries. This will enable the researchers to&#xD;
      determine the effect of dexamethasone on nausea and vomiting and the impact of both the side&#xD;
      effects of dexamethasone, and of nausea and vomiting, on QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine patient preference for dexamethasone or&#xD;
      placebo, and to compare changes in QOL after chemotherapy in patients who receive&#xD;
      dexamethasone with those who receive placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to compare&#xD;
      complete protection from delayed vomiting and severity of nausea; (2) to compare differences&#xD;
      in the impact of nausea and vomiting on QOL, and (3) to compare differences in symptoms that&#xD;
      have been associated with dexamethasone (insomnia, anxiety, agitation, mood, etc.) between&#xD;
      patients receiving dexamethasone and those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study will provide data to evaluate whether the benefits of dexamethasone&#xD;
      for delayed nausea and vomiting outweigh potential side effects in patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy with a moderate risk of causing nausea and vomiting. This addresses a problem&#xD;
      that is important to a majority of patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy. If overall QOL&#xD;
      is improved on dexamethasone, then it should be prescribed more frequently, but if QOL is&#xD;
      reduced on dexamethasone, and patients prefer the placebo, then its use as an anti-nausea&#xD;
      medication for delayed nausea after moderately nauseating chemotherapy should be limited to&#xD;
      patients with poor initial control of nausea/vomiting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Dexamethasone improves control of acute nausea and vomiting when given prior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and continued administration of dexamethasone improves nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      after highly emetogenic chemotherapy. There is no consensus about the optimal regimen for&#xD;
      control of delayed emesis after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy but most patients receive&#xD;
      oral dexamethasone. Many patients complain of insomnia, anxiety/agitation and indigestion&#xD;
      whilst they are on dexamethasone, and fatigue and depressed mood after stopping it. The&#xD;
      impact of these symptoms on patients has not been studied systematically. While patients with&#xD;
      less vomiting and nausea are expected to have better quality of life (QOL), the QOL of&#xD;
      patients with minimal nausea or vomiting might be more affected by the side effects of&#xD;
      antiemetic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Dexamethasone given as an antiemetic for delayed nausea and vomiting after&#xD;
      moderately emetogenic chemotherapy reduces overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Does the use of dexamethasone as a prophylactic antiemetic for delayed&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy decrease overall quality of&#xD;
      life, as evaluated by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C-30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Using a double-blind randomised cross-over design, we will determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (i) the effect of oral dexamethasone (4mg PO bid after chemotherapy) versus an identical&#xD;
           appearing placebo on QOL of patients that receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy,&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (ii) patient preference for dexamethasone or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate control of nausea and vomiting and the impact of both the side effects of&#xD;
      dexamethasone and of nausea and vomiting on QOL. Therapy for acute emesis will be&#xD;
      standardised (single dose intravenous granisetron and dexamethasone) and all patients will&#xD;
      receive granisetron for delayed emetic control. Each patient will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive either dexamethasone or placebo after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and crossed&#xD;
      over to the other arm for the second cycle. Patients will complete questionnaires that&#xD;
      evaluate QOL, symptoms associated with dexamethasone, and nausea and vomiting at baseline and&#xD;
      one week after their intravenous chemotherapy; they will also record symptoms in a daily&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are patient preference and overall QOL. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: (1) to compare complete protection from delayed vomiting and severity of nausea between&#xD;
      those receiving dexamethasone and those receiving placebo; (2) to compare differences in the&#xD;
      impact of nausea and vomiting on QOL in those receiving dexamethasone and those receiving&#xD;
      placebo, and (3) to compare differences in symptoms that have been associated with&#xD;
      dexamethasone (insomnia, anxiety, agitation, mood, etc.) between patients receiving&#xD;
      dexamethasone and those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Our study will evaluate whether the benefits of dexamethasone for delayed&#xD;
      emetic control outweigh potential side effects in patients receiving moderately emetogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It addresses a problem that is important to the majority of patients receiving&#xD;
      anticancer chemotherapy. If overall QOL is improved on dexamethasone, then it should be&#xD;
      prescribed routinely. If QOL is reduced on dexamethasone, and patients prefer the placebo,&#xD;
      then its use as an antiemetic after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy should be limited to&#xD;
      patients who initially have poor control of emesis.&#xD;
