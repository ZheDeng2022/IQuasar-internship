      The objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate&#xD;
      in the prevention of basilar and hemiplegic migraine in children and adolescents.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, open-label study consisting of 3 phases: Blinded Transition Phase,&#xD;
      Open-Label Maintenance Phase, and Taper/Exit Phase. Subjects who have either succesfully&#xD;
      completed the CAPSS-271 protocol or who discontinued the CAPSS-271 study due to lack of&#xD;
      effectiveness after completing at least 2 weeks of maintenance treatment will be eligible to&#xD;
      enroll.&#xD;
