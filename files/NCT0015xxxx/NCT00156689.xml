  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the mechanisms of action which provide efficacy in epilepsy, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that treatment with levetiracetam will reduce the neuronal excitability involved in&#xD;
      neuropathic pain associated with CIAP. Thus, there is a potential for levetiracetam to bring&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit for the subjects because of its specific mechanism of action, its safety&#xD;
      profile and the absence of interaction with other drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on literature and expert opinion, and despite the efforts made to better treat the&#xD;
      spectrum of neuropathic pains, there are still unmet needs. The available treatments are not&#xD;
      effective as monotherapy administration in the vast majority of patients and polypharmacy&#xD;
      with several medications is often necessary. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mainly&#xD;
      amitriptyline, are still a mainstay of treatment for painful peripheral neuropathy, but at&#xD;
      the risk of some dose-limiting adverse events, which may reduce their effectiveness. TCA&#xD;
      treatment effect is inconsistent and limited by side effects. In one clinical trial while&#xD;
      about 50% of patients achieved significant or complete relief of pain 81% experienced side&#xD;
      effects and in 71% the side effects were dose limiting. TCAs can produce sedation, urinary&#xD;
      retention, and orthostatic hypotension that are of particular concern in the elderly and&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease. In the same study desipramine was associated with a&#xD;
      slightly lower rate of side effects it offered only 40% of patients significant or complete&#xD;
      relief of neuropathic pain. Fluoxetine was no more effective than placebo in pain relief.&#xD;
      (Max, 1992). Due to the scarcity of controlled clinical trials and the inconclusive results&#xD;
      of available trials, physicians vary markedly in their suggested regimens for neuropathic&#xD;
      pain management. (Beydoun, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiepileptic drugs are being used more frequently in non-epileptic indications such as&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. One of the mechanisms by which neuropathic pain occurs is related to an&#xD;
      increased excitability of central neurons. Although their precise mechanism of action in&#xD;
      neuropathic pain remains unknown, antiepileptic drugs are believed to exert their&#xD;
      antineuralgic activity by suppressing the neuronal hyperexcitability state that characterizes&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. A small crossover trial of carbamazepine produced clinical benefit is a&#xD;
      significant number of patients but with side effects of somnolence in 50%, dizziness in 40%&#xD;
      and rash in 6% (Rull, 1969). Gabapentin showed benefit over placebo in a 165-subject&#xD;
      randomized study of painful diabetic neuropathy pain; side effects were noted to be mild or&#xD;
      moderate in most but 8% withdrew due to side effects (Backonja, 1998). In a placebo&#xD;
      controlled study of lamotrigine in diabetic neuropathy there was s significant reduction in&#xD;
      daily pain scores compared to placebo; side effects were noted in about half of the treated&#xD;
      group but were minor. (Eisenberg, 2001). Results of treatment trials sing valproate in&#xD;
      painful diabetic neuropathy have been variable with both positive (Kochar, 2004) and negative&#xD;
      trials (Otto, 2004). Treatment of neuropathic pain in chronic idiopathic axonal&#xD;
      polyneuropathy has received limited study. In a single open label study or CIDP pain&#xD;
      tiagabine produced about 30% reduction in pain severity but almost half of the patients&#xD;
      discontinued the trial (Novak, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levetiracetam has been tested in two animal models of neuropathic pain (Ardidd, 2001). In the&#xD;
      streptozocin diabetic rat model, reactivity to a pressure on the paw was assessed and&#xD;
      revealed that the ED50 for levetiracetam was comparable to the one observed in the epilepsy&#xD;
      models. Further, hyperalgesia was dose-dependently decreased by levetiracetam. On the other&#xD;
      hand, in the mononeuropathic sciatic nerve ligature model, hyperalgesia was not significantly&#xD;
      diminished. Carbamazepine is effective in the sciatic nerve ligature model. Animal models of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain are considered suggestive of activity in humans but they are not directly&#xD;
      predictive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data from the animal studies in neuropathic pain models, levetiracetam has been&#xD;
      tested in a limited basis in two human types of neurological pain, painful diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and sural nerve stimulation in healthy volunteers. The diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy study was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flexible dosing with LEV at 500 to 1500 mg bid.&#xD;
      A total of 105 subjects were included in the ITT population, 52 subjects in placebo and 53&#xD;
      subjects in the LEV group. At baseline, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to&#xD;
      demographic and other baseline characteristics. There were no statistically significant or&#xD;
      clinically meaningful treatment differences observed throughout the evaluation period&#xD;
      relative to baseline (personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized, double-blind, crossover, electrical sural nerve stimulation study, pain&#xD;
      was assessed in healthy volunteers before and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after 1500 mg&#xD;
      levetiracetam or placebo was orally administered. Levetiracetam significantly increased the&#xD;
      threshold for pain detection when single electrical sural nerve stimulation was used, but had&#xD;
      no effect on temporal pain summation after repetitive sural nerve stimulation (CDC). It has,&#xD;
      however, been demonstrated that results from one type of neuropathic pain cannot necessarily&#xD;
      be extrapolated to other types, as the negative results of the 1998 study of amitriptyline in&#xD;
      HIV-related painful neuropathy demonstrates (Beydoun, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small, investigator-initiated open label trial using levetiracetam in postherpetic&#xD;
      neuralgia (PHN) was recently completed. The study, published in Neurology, reported 6/10&#xD;
      patients had improvement in PHN symptomatology after a 12-week treatment with levetiracetam.&#xD;
      All 10 patients exposed had received multiple prior treatments for PHN (Rowbotham, 2003).&#xD;
