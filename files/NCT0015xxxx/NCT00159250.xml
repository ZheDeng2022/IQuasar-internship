  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle degenerative disorder, arises from&#xD;
      mutations in the dystrophin gene. Antisense therapy with the use of antisense&#xD;
      oligonucleotides (AON) has the potential to restore effectively the production of dystrophin,&#xD;
      the defective protein, in &gt;70% of DMD. This could result in increased life expectancy through&#xD;
      improved muscle survival and function. Recent scientific research has demonstrated the&#xD;
      potential of this technique to skip mutated dystrophin exons, restore the reading frame and&#xD;
      generate functional dystrophin protein. Having demonstrated proof-of-principle in human cell&#xD;
      culture and animal model studies, we now intend to determine efficacy and safety of this&#xD;
      approach to induce dystrophin exon skipping in children with DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this phase I/II study is to assess efficacy (dystrophin production) and&#xD;
      safety of intramuscular administered morpholino oligomer directed against exon 51 (AVI-4658&#xD;
      PMO). We are performing parallel preclinical studies to develop methods of systemic delivery&#xD;
      that will be necessary for future phase II/III clinical studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting 1&#xD;
      in every 3500 live male births. The disease is characterised by severe muscle wasting and&#xD;
      weakness, which becomes clinically evident between the ages of 3 to 5 years. Affected&#xD;
      individuals stop walking by 12 years of age and usually do not survive beyond the age of 20&#xD;
      unless ventilated. In general DMD is caused by mutations that disrupt the reading frame thus&#xD;
      leading to a failure to express dystrophin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent scientific research has led to the belief that DMD may be treated by correcting the&#xD;
      genetic error in the dystrophin gene which causes DMD. Most children with DMD have a&#xD;
      deletion, i.e., a mutation which removes part of the dystrophin gene. A novel technique using&#xD;
      antisense technology to skip a specific exon and bypass faulty genetic material, thus&#xD;
      allowing production of functional dystrophin to be produced, has been developed.These&#xD;
      antisense oligonucleotides (AON) target and bypass faulty genetic material and allow&#xD;
      production of functional protein.This has been successfully demonstrated in cultured human&#xD;
      DMD cells and in mouse and canine DMD models.The restored production of dystrophin is&#xD;
      predicted to reduce muscle pathology significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early part of the study we compared different antisense oligomers chemical&#xD;
      modification and concluded that the morpholino backbone is significantly superior when&#xD;
      administered to skeletal muscle compared to a number of other types of antisense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase I/II clinical study is to assess efficacy and safety of AVI-4658, a&#xD;
      morpholino antisense directed against exon 51, in DMD individuals with deletions which would&#xD;
      benefit from skipping exon 51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work is presented in 4 sections detailing the main approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dose escalation IM trial will involve of up to 9 subjects, subdivided in three groups,&#xD;
      of three subjects each. Patients in group 1 will be recruited sequentially whilst patients in&#xD;
      groups 2 and 3 will be recruited serially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (3 patients) will receive intramuscular administration of a low concentration of&#xD;
           study drug (extensor digitorum brevis muscle, EDB) and will undergo a muscle biopsy&#xD;
           between days 14 and 28 after intramuscular (IM) administration of the AVI-4658.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (3 patients) will undergo an identical procedure but receiving an intermediate&#xD;
           dose of the AVI-4658.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (3 patients) will be recruited to receive the highest dose of the AVI-4658 but&#xD;
           only if the results in the first 2 cohort of patients show a lack of efficacy of the&#xD;
           lower doses. Up to an additional 3 subjects may be enrolled in cohorts 1 or 2, should&#xD;
           cohort 3 not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination, including body weight, height, arm span, neuromuscular&#xD;
           examination and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychiatric assessment of both subject and the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular genetic on blood sample and dystrophin analysis of original muscle biopsy&#xD;
           obtained at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle MRI scans of lower limbs to assess the preservation of the muscle to be targeted&#xD;
           with the injection of AON.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical (blood) and urine investigation to include standard biochemistry and&#xD;
           haematology (full blood count; coagulation screen; liver function test; serum Ig;&#xD;
           protein electrophoresis; inflammatory markers; creatinine kinase; gamma glutamyl&#xD;
           transferase; urine biochemistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular assessments: ECG and heart echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary assessments: Forced vital capacity, overnight oxygen saturation monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy for MyoD-transfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The muscle to be used is the extensor digitorum brevis, a foot muscle with very little&#xD;
           function in children with mobility difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local injection will be performed directly through the skin using a combined&#xD;
           EMG-delivery needle. While the procedure could be performed under local anaesthetic;&#xD;
           where possible, it will be performed under general anaesthetic in order to reduce&#xD;
           distress to the subject. A skin tattoo featuring a 1 cm x 1 cm grid with 2 lines in&#xD;
           between to divide it in 9 smaller squares will be used to mark the site of the injection&#xD;
           precisely and for a subsequent muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total volume of each injection will be 100 μL containing the AVI-4658. Nine&#xD;
           injections will be performed at 3 mm intervals inside the 1 cm2 grid tattoo. The depth&#xD;
           of the injection will be carefully recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be closely monitored within the clinical research facility by designated&#xD;
           nursing staff educated in the trial protocol and with experience in similar Phase I/II&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical research facility has close access to intensive care unit facilities in the&#xD;
           event of an unforeseen adverse reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Day 2 - Patients will be discharged. Prior to discharge, a brief physical&#xD;
      examination and systems review will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 - A further brief physical examination and systems review including examination of the&#xD;
      injection sites and reporting of any reactions. This examination can be performed at the&#xD;
      local surgery or at the hospital of the referring clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 5, 7 - Contact with the subject and inquire as to current status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 14 to 28 - The subject is admitted to hospital. Perform systems assessment (physical&#xD;
      examination), body weight and vital signs. Blood and urine biochemistry will be repeated then&#xD;
      as well as open biopsies of both injected muscles will be performed under general or local&#xD;
      anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 30 - Contact with the subject and inquiry as to current status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 60 - Contact the subject and inquiry as to current status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 120 - (Final Visit at the hospital where the study drug was administered). A brief&#xD;
      physical examination and systems review will be performed.&#xD;
