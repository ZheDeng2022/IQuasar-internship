    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a multi-centre, community based open label study designed to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of intravesical sodium chrondroitin sulfate (Uracyst®) in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the study product will be evaluated through the incidence of adverse events and&#xD;
      from results of physical examinations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent responders to treatment as indicated by&#xD;
      improvement on a seven-point Patient Global Assessment scale at week 10 (after 6 treatments)&#xD;
      compared to baseline. The patient evaluates the overall change in their condition as markedly&#xD;
      improved, moderately improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, moderately worse&#xD;
      or markedly worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy objectives will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in individual IC symptoms during the treatment period and at week 10 (after&#xD;
           6 treatments) compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain and urgency scores (0-10 cm VAS) will be obtained using patient on-site&#xD;
           questionnaires prior to first treatment (baseline), and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14,&#xD;
           18, 22 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in Patient Symptom/Problem Index scores over the course of the treatment until&#xD;
           the end of study (week 24) compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The validated O'Leary Symptom Problem/Index will be completed prior to first treatment&#xD;
           (baseline) and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The validated PUF questionnaire will be completed prior to first treatment (baseline)&#xD;
           and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in patient condition every month throughout the therapy and treatment follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to measuring the change in patient condition at week 14, the Patient Global&#xD;
      Assessment will be completed at weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.&#xD;
