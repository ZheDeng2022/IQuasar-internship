  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a feasibility, safety, and preliminary benefits study to look at whether&#xD;
      giving the calcium channel blocker amlodipine to people with hereditary pancreatitis as a&#xD;
      prophylactic measure can reduce the inflammatory process in the pancreas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Pancreatitis is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited condition causing mutations&#xD;
      in the cationic trypsinogen gene. These mutations lead to excessive activation of trypsinogen&#xD;
      within the pancreatic acinar cells and subsequent pancreatic inflammation. Clinically, this&#xD;
      may be observed as recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and eventual&#xD;
      complications of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiencies and pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. Currently, there are no specific treatment or prophylactic measures for this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium is the physiologic switch to activate trypsinogen. It has recently been found that&#xD;
      the mutation sites affect how tightly calcium binds to trypsinogen, with mutations leading to&#xD;
      excessive calcium binding and subsequent excessive trypsinogen activation. This study is to&#xD;
      obtain baseline data on whether the prophylactic use of a long-acting calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker, amlodipine, would lead to decrease in the inappropriate activation of trypsinogen,&#xD;
      and thereby decrease the subsequent pancreatic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 subjects, aged 6 years and above, with mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene&#xD;
      (PRSS1) will be recruited and undergo a 16-week trial. This will include a one-month baseline&#xD;
      symptoms assessment (daily symptoms diary) and blood pressure measurements (with an automated&#xD;
      home blood pressure monitor). Subsequently, subjects will be placed on between 2.5 - 10 mg&#xD;
      amlodipine po qd (with a weaning up and weaning down phase) for approximately 10 weeks. They&#xD;
      will continue to fill out daily symptoms diary, blood pressure measurements (to ensure there&#xD;
      are no decreases), fill out periodic quality of life questionnaires, and undergo periodic&#xD;
      blood testing for routine biochemistry as well as more specialized testing for proteomics and&#xD;
      other inflammatory cytokines analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three main purposes: to determine whether the use of amlodipine appears to be&#xD;
      safe in this patient population, to determine how frequently and how best to follow subjects&#xD;
      while they are taking the medication, and to determine whether there are any indications of&#xD;
      potential benefits to the medication (whether by decreased symptoms frequency/ severity or by&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent larger study would be designed based on the above results.&#xD;
