    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Though&#xD;
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin(DCP) are used as the tumor markers for&#xD;
      diagnosis of HCCs. Thus, these two markers are not good enough for the early detection of&#xD;
      small HCCs. To improve the survival, further investigations of the early diagnostic markers&#xD;
      are still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELDI is a proteomic profiling techniques in biomarker discovery. Its approach has been&#xD;
      successfully used to identify biomarkers of various cancers, such as prostate cancer, bladder&#xD;
      cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current project we will apply the SELDI technique to identify the HCC biomarkers.&#xD;
      Sera samples from the HCC patients and relevant controls will be collected. We hope that we&#xD;
      can find the new HCC biomarkers. If biomarkers of HCC are identified, this can be used to&#xD;
      clinical application for the possible early detection of HCCs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Above&#xD;
      6000-8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. Though regular sonographic&#xD;
      examination can early detect small HCC and there are many therapeutic modalities for HCC, the&#xD;
      therapeutic results remains unsatisfactory. Though Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxy&#xD;
      prothrombin(DCP) are used as the tumor markers for diagnosis of HCCs, AFP is normal in around&#xD;
      one third of small(&lt;3cm) HCC patients. Elevated DCP activities were present in 44%-47.6% with&#xD;
      HCCs less than 3cm. Thus, these two markers are not good enough for the early detection of&#xD;
      small HCCs. To improve the survival, further investigations of the early diagnostic markers&#xD;
      are still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global analysis of cellular proteins has recently been termed proteomics and is a key&#xD;
      area if research that is developing in the postgenomic ear. With respect to cancer,&#xD;
      proteomics has the potential to identify novel targets for therapy or markers for diagnosis.&#xD;
      The proteomic profiling techniques in biomarker discovery include (1) 2-D PAGE / MALDI-MS&#xD;
      (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) / matrix assisted&#xD;
      laser desorption / ionization-mass spectrometry), (2) LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography/MS/MS),&#xD;
      (3) SELDI-TOF (surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight). These techniques&#xD;
      have their own advantages and shortcomings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELDI is a recently descried modification of MALDI-TOP in which small amounts of protein are&#xD;
      directly applied to a biochip coated with specific chemical matrices (hydrophobic, cationic,&#xD;
      anionic, normal phase, and so forth) or biochemical molecules such as DNA oligonucleotides or&#xD;
      purified proteins. The bound proteins retained after washing are analyzed by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry to obtain the protein fingerprint of the sample. The detected proteins are&#xD;
      displayed as a series of peaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELDI-TOF MS can offer high-throughput protein profiles. Blood, urine, body fluid, or tissue&#xD;
      specimen are taken from the patients and then are applied onto different ProteinChip Arrays.&#xD;
      The differences in the protein expression profiles of two or more distinct samples are thus&#xD;
      obtained. SELDI approach has been successfully used to identify biomarkers of various&#xD;
      cancers, such as prostate cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer,&#xD;
      breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current project we will apply the SELDI technique to identify the HCC biomarkers.&#xD;
      Sera samples from the HCC patients and relevant controls will be collected. The samples will&#xD;
      then be applied to SELDI analysis. We hope that we can find the new HCC biomarkers. If&#xD;
      biomarkers of HCC are identified, this can be used to clinical application for the possible&#xD;
      early detection of HCCs.&#xD;
