  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional biopsy requires the removal, fixation, and staining of tissues from the human&#xD;
      body. Its procedure is invasive and painful. Non-invasive in vivo optical biopsy is thus&#xD;
      required, which should provide non-invasive, highly penetrative, three-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      imaging with sub-micron spatial resolution. Optical biopsy based on scanning two-photon&#xD;
      fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) is a good method for biopsy of skin due to its high lateral&#xD;
      resolution, low out-of-focus damage, and intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) section capability.&#xD;
      However current technology still presents several limitations including low penetration&#xD;
      depth, in-focus cell damages, and multi-photon phototoxicity due to high optical intensity in&#xD;
      the 800 nm wavelength region, and toxicity if exogenous fluorescence markers were required.&#xD;
      We study the harmonics optical biopsy of a human skin sample using a femtosecond&#xD;
      Cr:forsterite laser centered at 1230 nm. Higher harmonics generation is known to leave no&#xD;
      energy deposition to the interacted matters due to their energy-conservation characteristic.&#xD;
      This energy-conservation characteristic provides the &quot;noninvasive&quot; nature desirable for&#xD;
      clinical imaging. In our study, we will evaluate the clinical applications of optical skin&#xD;
      biopsy using harmonic generation microscopy.&#xD;
