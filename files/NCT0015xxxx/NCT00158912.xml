  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of VAST is to determine whether the Rate Smoothing feature in Guidant's&#xD;
      PRIZM/VITALITY-family ICDs has an effect on the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who receive a commercially available Guidant PRIZM, PRIZM 2, or VITALITY AVT&#xD;
             ICD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of physicians of their implanting center&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have chronic atrial fibrillation. Paroxysms of AF are not an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion, but the patient must be in normal sinus rhythm at the time of&#xD;
             randomization. If history of AF is unknown or uncertain, or the patient was recently&#xD;
             cardioverted, there must be at least 23 hours of normal sinus rhythm within the 24&#xD;
             hour period preceding randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who previously had an ICD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy with&#xD;
             defibrillation (CRT-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose life expectancy is less than 12 months due to other medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are expected to receive a heart transplant during the duration of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have or who are likely to receive a tricuspid or other valve prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study of active medical&#xD;
             therapy. Each instance should be brought to Guidant's Clinical Application Research&#xD;
             Studies (CARS) group to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are younger than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are mentally incompetent and cannot give a Patient Informed Consent or&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
