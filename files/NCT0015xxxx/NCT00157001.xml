      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the difference in 6-month restenosis rates&#xD;
      in coronary artery lesions treated by photopheresis in addition to angioplasty with stent&#xD;
      placement, as opposed to no photopheresis after angioplasty and stent placement. Restenosis&#xD;
      means the closing up again, or narrowing in diameter, of the previously treated artery, which&#xD;
      may cause reduced blood flow and the re-occurrence of symptoms. Photopheresis is a&#xD;
      therapeutic technique in which a portion of your white blood cells is collected by a blood&#xD;
      separation device and exposed to ultraviolet A light, in combination with the drug 8-MOP&#xD;
      (8-methoxypsoralen), then returned to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between the three&#xD;
           treatment groups for 6 months post-angioplasty. MACE events include death (cardiac&#xD;
           related), myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, repeat&#xD;
           angioplasty to the target vessel, hospitalization and clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of the treatment by comparing the incidence of acute and subacute&#xD;
           thrombosis, bleeding and vascular complications and other non-MACE events every 2 weeks&#xD;
           for 6 months post-angioplasty between the three treatment groups.&#xD;

      Atherosclerosis is a condition of the coronary arteries characterized by abnormal lipid and&#xD;
      fibrous tissue accumulation in the vessel wall. This pathologic condition may lead to&#xD;
      stenosis of the artery. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a standard&#xD;
      method of myocardial revascularization in patients with occlusive coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restenosis remains one of the main factors determining the long term success of angioplasty.&#xD;
      The literature still reports a 35% restenosis rate after single vessel angioplasty.l,2,3 This&#xD;
      study will investigate the feasibility of photopheresis therapy as an adjunct to PTCA plus&#xD;
      stent placement as a means to reduce the rate of restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UVAX® XTS™ Photopheresis System is currently marketed for use in the palliative treatment&#xD;
      of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in persons who have not been&#xD;
      responsive to other forms of treatment. For this feasibility study, the XTS System will treat&#xD;
      extracorporeally circulating leukocyte-enriched blood with ultraviolet light-A (UVA) in the&#xD;
      presence of the photoactive drug UVADEX®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UVAR XTS Photopheresis System is used to separate the patient's blood into white blood&#xD;
      cells, red blood cells and plasma. The red blood cells are returned to the patient. A dose of&#xD;
      two hundred micrograms of UVADEX is added to the photoactivating bag. A portion of the plasma&#xD;
      and the white blood cells are exposed to UVA light which causes the methoxsalen in the&#xD;
      nucleated white blood cells to form covalent bonds in the pyrimidine bases of the DNA,&#xD;
      preventing further replication of the cell. After exposure to UVA light, the white blood&#xD;
      cells and plasma are returned to the patient Animal and clinical studies suggest that there&#xD;
      is an immune response initiated by the reinitiation of the treated white blood cells. The&#xD;
      mechanism of the immune response is not clear. It appears that when the lethally injured&#xD;
      white blood cells are reinfused into the patient, surface antigens on the abnormal cells&#xD;
      cause the host immune system to recognize the clones of the untreated malignant cells. This&#xD;
      may result in a true biologic response modification and induction of a favorable immune&#xD;
      response to the underlying malignancy.4 The results of clinical studies of CTCL patients&#xD;
      treated with a similar procedure show a prolonged clinical remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photopheresis has been shown to affect diseases mediated by an aberrance in the immune&#xD;
      system, e.g., scleroderma, HIV infection and CTCL. These diseases involve a variety of&#xD;
      serologic abnormalities and cellular and humoral immune dysfunction. For instance, CTCL&#xD;
      demonstrates an abnormally elevated CD4 count; scleroderma reveals a decrease in peripheral T&#xD;
      cells but an increase in T cells in tissue; and HIV exhibits a falling CD4&#xD;
&#xD;
      percentage. Several of these diseases have been shown to have antibodies against self to DNA&#xD;
      and cellular components.5 Atherosclerosis has recently been shown to have as a constituent&#xD;
      factor an underlying immune mechanism.6 There exists a close functional relationship between&#xD;
      macrophages and T lymphocytes. In fact, lymphocytes have been demonstrated within the plaques&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic vessels.7'8 These lymphocytes have been shown to be activated locally,&#xD;
      presumably by antigens presented in the context of class II MHC. Such activated T cells may,&#xD;
      in turn, modulate the pathogenesis of restenosis post angioplasty.6 Cyclosporin A, a drug&#xD;
      which specifically inhibits T cell activation, has been administered in an animal model and&#xD;
      has resulted in significant reduction in intimal lesions post angioplasty.9 This may be a&#xD;
      reflection of inhibition of T cell activation which results in an inhibition of&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage activation and therefore inhibition of intimal T cell proliferation.&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that UVA Photochemotherapy may represent a novel approach to control&#xD;
      of smooth muscle cell proliferation without producing cytolysis.10,11 Photopheresis has been&#xD;
      postulated to specifically down regulate activated clones to T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All prior clinical studies related to cardiovascular treatment conducted to date have shown&#xD;
      that photopheresis with UVADEX is a safe treatment modality without serious side effects.&#xD;
      Photopheresis has been studied--for the prevention and treatment of acute rejection in heart&#xD;
      transplant recipients.12 As a result of treatment, patients experienced a reduction in the&#xD;
      number and severity of rejection episodes. Photopheresis therapy also allowed the reduction&#xD;
      of daily immunosuppressive therapy. No major side effects were observed. In another study,&#xD;
      the use of monthly photopheresis as an adjunct to standard drug therapy following cardiac&#xD;
      transplant found a significant decrease in coronary artery intimal thickness at up to two&#xD;
      years of follow-up.13 Photopheresis was determined to be safe, well tolerated and did not&#xD;
      increase the morbidity in immunosuppressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study of the benefits of photopheresis following PTCA enrolled 62 patients (29&#xD;
      treated with photopheresis and oral methoxypsoralen and 33 control). At 6 months follow-up,&#xD;
      the patient group treated with photopheresis exhibited fewer clinical signs of restenosis. No&#xD;
      significant side effects were observed.&#xD;
