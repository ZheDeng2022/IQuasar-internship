      This is a clinical research study to assess whether after exhaling a single cigarette smoke&#xD;
      through the nose there are changes in the inflammatory cells and proteins of nasal&#xD;
      secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blood sample from each subject will be stimulated with cigarette smoke in the&#xD;
      laboratory to see the effects on inflammatory blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of findings between smokers with COPD and &quot;Healthy&quot; smokers will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that some subjects have amplified inflammatory response to a single cigarette,&#xD;
      and these will be those subjects who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      after decades of smoking. We hope to develop an acute challenge model that relates to the&#xD;
      causation of COPD. When studying the effects of new drugs, these may be detected in small&#xD;
      numbers of patients in a challenge situation, when we would need to study many more&#xD;
      unchallenged patients to demonstrate drug effects. In clinical research on asthma and&#xD;
      allergy, the nasal allergen challenge has been a very successful model, and we hope to&#xD;
      validate a comparable model for COPD.&#xD;

      Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease&#xD;
      that causes widespread morbidity and mortality, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimating&#xD;
      COPD to be currently the sixth most common cause of death worldwide. Decades of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking is by far the major contributing factor, and this causes a range of respiratory&#xD;
      disorders; including chronic bronchitis, obstructive bronchiolitis, emphysema, and pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular disease. Medical treatment of COPD is largely palliative; involving smoking&#xD;
      cessation, use of inhaled bronchodilators, and long term oxygen therapy for respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Recently, it has been recognised that those smokers who develop COPD have&#xD;
      amplification of inflammation compared with &quot;healthy smokers&quot;, and that there is the urgent&#xD;
      need to develop new challenge models to assess why COPD develops in some heavy smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette Smoke Nasal Challenge Model The nose is an accessible part of the respiratory&#xD;
      system, from which it is possible to obtain tissue exudates and cell brushings in a&#xD;
      non-invasive manner. A comprehensive review of the extensive clinical research experience&#xD;
      with these nasal methodologies has recently been published. There is also the insight that&#xD;
      patients with COPD commonly have inflammation of both the airways and nasal passages, with a&#xD;
      similar type of inflammatory infiltrate in lower and upper airways. In COPD the inflammation&#xD;
      is predominantly involving neutrophils and macrophages, as opposed to the increase in mast&#xD;
      cells and eosinophils characteristic of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been recognised that there is a strong functional and immunological relationship&#xD;
      between the nose and bronchi, especially in terms of infiltrating leukocytes and inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators when comparing allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. The upper and lower airways&#xD;
      have related respiratory epithelium and similar responses to allergen challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasal and bronchial mucosa of smokers with COPD have been demonstrated to be infiltrated&#xD;
      with CD8+ T lymphocytes and neutrophils. This corresponds to the presence of nasal symptoms&#xD;
      during exacerbations of COPD, and sputum and nasal levels of IL-8 are correlated in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to sample nasal exudates for allergic inflammatory mediators, the classical methods&#xD;
      of nasal lavage are those described by Naclerio et al., the nasal pool method of Greiff et&#xD;
      al., and the use of a Foley's catheter by Gr√ºnberg and colleagues. Lavage is performed with&#xD;
      saline at volumes of between 1 and 10ml. The repeatability and validity of different nasal&#xD;
      lavage methods have been compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tommy Sim and colleagues have developed the use of filter paper strips, that are placed on&#xD;
      the turbinates to absorb nasal secretions. The nasal filter paper method has the advantage of&#xD;
      directly sampling nasal secretions which are less diluted and can therefore pick up protein&#xD;
      signals which are below the detection limits of nasal lavage. The matrix or filter paper&#xD;
      method has been used to measure chemokines and cytokines after NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells samples may be obtained from the nasal mucosal using small nylon dental flossing&#xD;
      brushes which are gently rotated over the epithelium, and then the attached cells are&#xD;
      dislodged in balanced salt solution. It has been demonstrated that nasal brushing can be used&#xD;
      as an alternative to nasal biopsy [24], whilst nasal brush supernatants can be analysed for&#xD;
      cytokine release [25]. An alternative method is to employ nasal mucosal scrapings using a&#xD;
      plastic curette (Rhinoprobe, Arlington Scientific, Utah). Nasal brushing and scraping causes&#xD;
      some discomfort but does not require local anaesthesia. Nasal biopsy is generally performed&#xD;
      from the lower edge of the inferior turbinate by a specialist. This is a traumatic procedure&#xD;
      that requires careful local anaesthesia, but a specimen of mucosal epithelium with basement&#xD;
      membrane and submucosal tissue is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal allergen challenge (NAC) is of proven benefit to test novel anti-inflammatory therapy&#xD;
      for allergic rhinitis and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC has advantages over inhaled allergen challenge since it is easier to recruit subjects, it&#xD;
      is less invasive, and repeated tissue samples are readily obtained. Small numbers of patients&#xD;
      can be given even single doses of therapy, and the anti-inflammatory and clinical effects on&#xD;
      NAC responses noted. Using these challenge methods in phase II of drug development for asthma&#xD;
      and allergic rhinitis it is possible to provide an early and reliable &quot;Go/No Go&quot; decision&#xD;
      before embarking on large-scale, long-term and costly phase III studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to develop an analogous challenge model for COPD by assessing effects of nasal&#xD;
      challenge with cigarette smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major challenge is to develop phase IIa clinical pharmacology designs that can be used to&#xD;
      assess anti-inflammatory drugs being developed for COPD. Nasal epithelial and inflammatory&#xD;
      responses to ozone exposure have been much studied [31-39]. Indeed COPD is characterised by&#xD;
      chronic inflammation with an imbalance in oxidant/antioxidant levels, and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation may trigger local exercise-induced oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three year clinical trials involving thousands of patients have found that inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids do not affect the accelerated rate loss of lung function in COPD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, ongoing phase III trials with oral phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4)inhibitors are&#xD;
      also unconvincing, despite the initial smaller studies looking promising. There is clearly&#xD;
      the compelling need to develop non-invasive biomarkers and clinical challenge models for use&#xD;
      in phase II clinical pharmacology studies to enable reliable assessment of the effects of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of nasal challenge models coupled to sensitive biomarkers and clinical endpoints could&#xD;
      perhaps be used to establish clinical efficacy of new drugs for COPD in small scale studies.&#xD;
      Novel therapies have the potential to selectively inhibit various cell types and particular&#xD;
      mediators involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. We believe that nasal allergen challenge&#xD;
      has advantages over inhaled challenge: safety, repeat non-invasive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future this will ensure that nasal challenge will play a growing role in clinical&#xD;
      pharmacology assessment of anti-inflammatory therapy. Major efforts are ongoing to develop&#xD;
      nasal challenge models to mimic the inflammation found in COPD, that can be used in clinical&#xD;
      pharmacology assessment of new anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Blood Challenge in vitro with Cigarette Smoke We shall stimulate blood samples in the&#xD;
      laboratory in an in vitro manner with a cigarette smoke extract. The cigarette smoke extract&#xD;
      is produced in a fume cabinet ensuring the safety of laboratory personnel. Cigarette smoke&#xD;
      contains many toxic compounds including free radicals and oxidants. Cigarette smoke&#xD;
      conditioned medium (CSCM) is made by bubbling the smoke from burning cigarettes through&#xD;
      buffered salt solution, and this can be used to stimulate cells in vitro. Cigarette smoke&#xD;
      extract has been shown to be cytotoxic to an alveolar type II cell-derived line and this&#xD;
      effect can be blocked by N-acetyl cysteine a scavenger of oxidants. {Hoshino, Mio, et al.&#xD;
      2001 7463 /id}. We have developed methods of assessing neutrophil CD11b upregulation in&#xD;
      response to stimulation with cytokines and chemokines. CD11b is a cell surface receptor on&#xD;
      leukocytes that is mobilised from intracellular stores when cells are stimulated. Surface&#xD;
      CD11b can be measured using fluorescent labelled antibodies and flow cytometry. We have&#xD;
      developed a method of stimulating whole blood with CSCM which produces a 200% increase in&#xD;
      CD11b upregulation after incubation for 20 minutes. This effect is further increased if&#xD;
      plasma is removed from the whole blood prior to stimulation, and the effect can be partially&#xD;
      inhibited by the presence of reduced glutathione. COPD patients and smokers have been shown&#xD;
      to have decreased antioxidant capacity in their plasma. We aim to compare neutrophil&#xD;
      responses to CSCM stimulation in whole blood, and washed blood where the plasma has been&#xD;
      removed, to compare neutrophil responsiveness between COPD patients and smokers and possible&#xD;
      anti-oxidant effects of plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of planned research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two characterised matched groups of smokers with COPD and &quot;healthy&quot; smokers that do not have&#xD;
      lung disease will be enrolled for this study. Each group will comprise 8 subjects. Each&#xD;
      subject will be required to make 2 visits to the NHLI Clinical Studies Unit as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 : Screening During screening, candidates for the study will be fully informed about&#xD;
      the nature of the study and possible AEs. Candidates must read the consent form and sign the&#xD;
      document after the investigator has answered all questions to the candidate's satisfaction.&#xD;
      Further procedures can begin only after the consent form has been signed. Two original&#xD;
      informed consent form copies will be signed by the subject. An original signed consent form&#xD;
      will be retained by the investigator and the second original will be given to the candidate&#xD;
      to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be evaluated for entry into the study according to the stated inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The following procedures will be performed to establish each candidate's&#xD;
      general health and qualifications for enrollment into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain signed, written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record medication history over the past 30 days Record medical history, including&#xD;
           smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a physical examination of heart, lung and nose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for female subjects of child bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct spirometry and test reversibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will evaluate the results of all examinations including clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests and will determine each candidate's suitability for the study. When the subject is&#xD;
      suitable for the study, a blood sample (10mls) will be taken for cigarette smoke whole blood&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Nasal smoke challenge Each subject will be allowed to smoke at least 5 cigarettes&#xD;
      between 9am to 9pm the day before attending the unit, and on the previous 7 days. On the&#xD;
      study day, each patient will be asked to smoke a single cigarette but exhaling through the&#xD;
      nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this cigarette challenge, we will carry out the following procedures over a period&#xD;
      of 8 hours (pre(x2), 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h,6h and 8h):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nasal lavage consists of washing the nose of 5ml (a teaspoon) of warm salt solution.&#xD;
           This solution is gently passed from a syringe through a hollow &quot;olive&quot; into the end of&#xD;
           the left nostril. The fluid does not enter the sinuses nor pass down the back of the&#xD;
           nose. A total of 2 flushes will be carried out at each timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nasal filter paper consists of a 7mm x 30mm strips of paper that are gently place inside&#xD;
           the end of the right nostril. They are left there for up to2 minutes until they are&#xD;
           moist with nasal secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A cannula will be inserted to enable blood to be taken at the above time points for&#xD;
           serum analysis of cytokines and chemokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnancy test for female subjects of child bearing age only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study, subjects will be informed of the harmful effects of cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      and advised of the need to stop smoking. Subjects will be offered smoking classes to help&#xD;
      them stop smoking. It is anticipated that the study day will be set as the quit date for&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
