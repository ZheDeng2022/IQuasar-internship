  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that patients with aortic stenosis, including those undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      for this problem, are prone to developing bleeding problems, particularly of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that the shear stress associated with blood flow&#xD;
      through the abnormal aortic valve results in abnormal hemostasis. Abnormalities include&#xD;
      increased proteolysis of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and increased binding of the high&#xD;
      molecular weight multimers of vWF to platelet membranes with subsequent inappropriate&#xD;
      platelet aggregation. Thus, appropriate aggregation of circulating platelets is impaired.&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery is associated with significant alterations in hemostasis. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery consume a significant percent of available blood products throughout the&#xD;
      United States and are subjected to various and numerous risks associated with blood product&#xD;
      transfusion. In addition, excessive postoperative bleeding is a common cause for the need to&#xD;
      surgically re-explore the chest cavity in patients who have just undergone cardiac surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Such additional surgery carries further cost and risk. Following surgical&#xD;
      correction of aortic valve stenotic pathology, associated vWF abnormalities appear to&#xD;
      reverse. However, this process can take several days. Although all cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      are at risk for postoperative bleeding, patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for aortic&#xD;
      stenosis may be particularly at risk for this postoperative complication. In addition,&#xD;
      patients with aortic valve stenosis who undergo noncardiac surgery may have a predisposition&#xD;
      to bleeding because of similar underlying shear stress induced abnormal vWF and platelet&#xD;
      function. The proposed study is a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic drugs in ameliorating the hemostatic defect associated with aortic stenosis.&#xD;
      Aprotonin, an antifibrinolytic agent which also has platelet preserving actions4, will be&#xD;
      compared to the currently used anti-fibrinolytic, epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be competent adult patients who are scheduled to undergo elective aortic&#xD;
      valve surgery for severe aortic stenosis. The process of informed consent will begin prior to&#xD;
      the day of surgery either during a patient's preoperative surgery clinic visit with one of&#xD;
      the cardiac surgeons for any patient having such a clinic visit or during the preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia evaluation prior to the day of surgery. At one or both of these times patients&#xD;
      will be told of the study and given a copy of the informed consent for their reading. An&#xD;
      opportunity for them to discuss the study at this time will be offered. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained on the day of surgery, prior to surgery. Patients must not also&#xD;
      require coronary artery surgery or be taking or receiving drugs that alter platelet function,&#xD;
      including aspirin (within the past 2 weeks) or any of the modern a ADP receptor antagonists&#xD;
      such as Plavix. As per current patient care guidelines at Strong Memorial Hospital, patients&#xD;
      undergoing first-time single valve, non-coronary artery surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) or aprotonin intravenously. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that 1-3 patients will be initially enrolled as pilot subjects to get the&#xD;
      study going smoothly and that 1-3 patients may not be completed or that their testing and/or&#xD;
      data may be inadequate. Therefore, although the analysis will only use 40 subjects the&#xD;
      protocol seeks permission to enroll a maximum of 24 subjects per group for a total of 48&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests to be performed are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the PFA-100, a platelet related hemostasis test which is a high shear system test of&#xD;
           platelet function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the von Willebrand antigen test, an immunoassay&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. factor VIII coagulant activity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ristocetin cofactor activity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. thromboelastography (TEG), a point-of-care test of hemostatic function which includes a&#xD;
           measure of platelet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Reference ranges / coefficient of variation / SD's / for the tests are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      vWF-Ag: 50 - 160% normal activity / 2 - 5% / ~5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      FVIII: 50 - 200% of normal / 4 - 7% / ~5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ristocetin cofactor: 60-200% of normal / ~15% / ~10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFA100 closure time: epinephrine &lt;181 seconds and ADP &lt;112 seconds / ~12% / 20 secs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total blood volume required from each patient for the purposes of doing the research related&#xD;
      tests will be approximately 30 mls (1 fluid ounces or 2 tablespoons). 10 mls will be drawn&#xD;
      from each patient's arterial line, which is routinely placed for cardiac anesthesia &amp; surgery&#xD;
      care, at the following time points in their care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. prior to induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 5 minutes after the loading dose of either EACA or aprotonin has been administered and&#xD;
           prior to the administration of any heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 15 minutes after the administration of protamine following termination of&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, no additional &quot;needle puncture&quot; will be necessary related to the study. Each blood&#xD;
      sample of 10 ml will be divided into one &quot;blue-top&quot; (citrated) tube (3 ml) and kept on ice,&#xD;
      one &quot;blue-top&quot; (citrated) tube (3 ml) and kept at room temperature, and the remainder will be&#xD;
      used to perform the TEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Data Analysis and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using either a 2-sample t-test or the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      Test, as appropriate, to compare the two patient groups at each of the three time points. A&#xD;
      p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant. All tests will be two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a proposed sample size of N = 20 for each of the two groups, the study will have at&#xD;
      least 80% power to yield a statistically significant result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Data Storage and Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be produced within the SMH hematology lab and then stored both on paper and on the&#xD;
      computer in the Department of Anesthesiology and backed up on the network drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will maintain the information in a password protected file on the&#xD;
      computer in his (their) private office.&#xD;
