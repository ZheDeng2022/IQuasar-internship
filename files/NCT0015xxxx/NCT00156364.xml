    <textblock>
      A. To study the effects of pancreas transplantation (PT) on the structural abnormalities of&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (type&#xD;
      1 D). These studies will address the influence of long-term normoglycemia on two stages of&#xD;
      diabetic renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the difficulties encountered for recruitment of patients to agree to undergo a GFR and&#xD;
      a native kidney biopsy in conjunction with their clinical evaluation visit for transplant, we&#xD;
      are now focusing efforts on obtaining skin biopsies previous to transplant, and then at&#xD;
      regular intervals (3, 6, and 9 months, and yearly) following a successful transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreas Transplantation Alone (PTA). To determine, at 5, 10, and 15 years after PTA,&#xD;
           the effects of normoglycemia on the established lesions of DN in the long-term type 1 D&#xD;
           patients' own kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Islet Transplantation Alone (ITA). To determine, at 5 years after ITA, the effects of&#xD;
           normoglycemia on the early lesions of DN in type 1 D patients' own kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreas Transplantation after Kidney Transplantation (PAK). To determine at 5-10 years&#xD;
           the effects of normoglycemia on the early structural lesions of DN in kidneys&#xD;
           transplanted some years earlier into type 1 D recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The benefits of PT on the early glomerular lesions of DN will be demonstrable&#xD;
      after 5 years in kidneys exposed to diabetes for a short duration, while in patients with&#xD;
      long-standing type 1 D and more advanced glomerular DN lesions, longer exposure to euglycemia&#xD;
      is necessary to demonstrate arrest or regression of the lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These continuation studies focus on large pancreas (PTx) and kidney (KTx) transplant&#xD;
      populations of type 1 diabetic (D) patients (pts) in order to better understand diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of renal failure. Objectives are: (a) to determine&#xD;
      whether PTx can more readily arrest or reverse the early vs. the more established lesions of&#xD;
      DN; (b) to continue studies of renal structural-functional relationships in DN, with emphasis&#xD;
      on the multifaceted pathologic DN lesions, including glomerular, vascular, interstitial&#xD;
      lesions and glomerular-tubular connections; (c) to continue studies of DN natural history and&#xD;
      the role of renal biopsy in predicting outcome; (d) to quantitate and understand the basis of&#xD;
      atubular glomeruli (AG) in DN; (e) to elucidate glomerular (glom) epithelial cell&#xD;
      abnormalities in DN; (f) to study the glom extracellular matrix abnormalities of DN; (g) to&#xD;
      study the recurrence of DN in the KTx; (h) to study the molecular/genetic basis of DN and&#xD;
      develop cellular markers of DN risk; (i) to determine the long-term (10-15 yr) structural&#xD;
      consequences of cyclosporine (CSA) on the native kidneys of PTx recipients; and (j) to&#xD;
      determine the shorter-term (5 yr) consequences of Prograf on the native kidneys of PTx&#xD;
      recipients and compare these with those seen after 5 years of CSA treatment. Together, these&#xD;
      studies will help to elucidate the pathogenesis and natural history of DN, unravel some of&#xD;
      the molecular and genetic aspects of this disease, describe the dynamics of DN reversal in&#xD;
      PTx pts, and recurrence in KTx pts and expand our knowledge of the nephrotoxic effects of&#xD;
      calcinosis inhibitors.&#xD;

    <description>To avoid the pitfalls of renal allograft studies, including rejection and disease recurrence, we compared the development of calcineurin lesions in the native kidneys of 14 tacrolimus- and 12 calcineurin-treated pancreas transplant alone recipients cured of type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
Results: The cyclosporine and tacrolimus groups had, respectively, on average, 33% versus 44% decline in GFR (ns), 27% versus 29% increase in cortical interstitial fractional volume (ns), 245% versus 347% increase in the fractional volume of cortical tubules that were atrophic (ns), and 291% versus 392% increase in the percent of globally sclerotic glomeruli (ns). Arteriolar hyalinosis did not change significantly in either group.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pancreas Transplantation. The patients considered for recruitment are those being&#xD;
             evaluated for pancreas transplant alone or pancreas transplant after kidney&#xD;
             transplantation in IDDM patients at the University of Minnesota (U of M). The consent&#xD;
             forms have been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of&#xD;
             Minnesota and the transplant coordinators responsible for interacting with patients&#xD;
             have continuously utilized these consent forms in the recruitment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Long-Term Post Kidney Transplant IDDM Patients. These patients are recruited by a&#xD;
             study coordinator working directly with the PI and also use consent forms approved by&#xD;
             the Institutional Review Board at the University of Minnesota.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pancreas Transplantation Alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl or CCr &lt;50 ml/min/1.73M2, as kidneys in such IDDM patients&#xD;
             are approaching end stage renal disease and are not readily amenable to morphometric&#xD;
             analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Solitary kidneys or evidence of unilateral renal disease, based upon significant&#xD;
             discrepancies in renal size by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of other important kidney disease by history, ultrasound, or baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other chronic diseases or conditions, in addition to IDDM, such as cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
             serious mental illness, severe mental retardation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy. Pregnancy tests will be performed on all eligible females of child-bearing&#xD;
             age, and pregnant women will be excluded. Patients will again be eligible 3 months&#xD;
             after completion of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pancreas Transplantation After Kidney Transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl; a higher value is accepted than for native kidney patients&#xD;
             since patients have a single kidney and are receiving CSA or FK506.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Moderate to severe chronic rejection on baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of other important kidney disease by history, ultrasound, or baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other chronic diseases or conditions, in addition to IDDM, such as cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
             serious mental illness, severe mental retardation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy. Pregnancy tests will be performed on all eligible females of child-bearing&#xD;
             age, and pregnant women will be excluded. Patients will again be eligible 3 months&#xD;
             after completion of pregnancy.&#xD;
