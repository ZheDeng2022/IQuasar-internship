  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax represents a major health problem throughout the tropics. Outside Africa it&#xD;
      accounts for over 50% of cases, affecting an estimated 70-80 million people per year. A&#xD;
      substantial proportion of clinical cases are not caused by infective bites of Anopheles spp,&#xD;
      but by activation of latent hypnozoites in the liver. These relapses may significantly impede&#xD;
      development since each illness may result in 5-15 days of absence from work or school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primaquine(PQ) is the only drug available that eliminates hypnozoites, though its use is&#xD;
      beset by clinical problems; it may precipitate haemolytic anaemia in individuals deficient in&#xD;
      the blood enzyme glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Without affordable G6PD testing,&#xD;
      primaquine use is precluded. Evidence suggests, however, that a course of 8 weekly doses may&#xD;
      be a safe and effective alternative to the traditional 14 day course of the drug. The aim of&#xD;
      the proposed study, therefore, is to test whether 8 weekly doses of primaquine is as&#xD;
      effective as the 14 day course at preventing relapse malaria, without the risk of hemolysis&#xD;
      in G6PD deficient individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Old evidence suggests that successful PQ therapy is not a function of the length of the&#xD;
      course of treatment, nor the circulating concentration of the drug, but of the total dosage&#xD;
      administered. The same dose administered over 7 days, 14 days, and 8 weeks equally prevented&#xD;
      relapse in vivax malaria. The hemolysis seen in shorter courses is often self-limiting,&#xD;
      suggesting that feedback mechanisms up-regulate production of red cells in response to&#xD;
      haemolytic challenge. The proposed extended course is likely to be well tolerated in G6PD&#xD;
      deficient individuals as a result of these safeguards, especially in this population which&#xD;
      has been exposed to the 5 day PQ regimen for a number of years without reported adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study, therefore, is to test whether an 8 week regimen proves effective,&#xD;
      without the associated risk of haemolysis in G6PD deficient individuals. However, operational&#xD;
      concerns remain about adherence to this protracted treatment regimen. Therefore we will&#xD;
      compare the 8 week course in 2 different groups; the first to be directly observed dosing,&#xD;
      the second to be unsupervised dosing using pre-packaged, foil wrapped PQ in appropriately&#xD;
      labelled individual boxes, supplied with strong health education messages. This would be&#xD;
      appropriate for deployment in a resource-poor setting if it proved effective and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether an eight week primaquine regimen, using single weekly doses, can provide&#xD;
      adequate radical cure of vivax malaria under experimental and operational conditions and is&#xD;
      safe in and acceptable to a population with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The&#xD;
      specific objectives of the study are set out below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the efficacy of an eight-week primaquine regime, using single weekly doses, in&#xD;
           preventing relapses of P. vivax infections following supervised versus unsupervised&#xD;
           administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the efficacy and operational aspects (e.g. adherence) between the two week,&#xD;
           eight week supervised and eight week blister package regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitoring of the effect of 8 week PQ on G6PD deficient individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the user acceptability and economic advantages of this course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vivax positive individuals from Adizai and Baghicha refugee camps, Pakistan, and Jalalabad,&#xD;
      Afghanistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All suspected malaria cases attending basic health units will have thick and thin blood films&#xD;
      taken and examined by conventional light microscopy. Cases diagnosed with P. vivax infection&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in the study unless the exclusion criteria are met. All patients&#xD;
      will then be tested for G6PD deficiency by near patient testing. The test is a colorimetric&#xD;
      qualitative test for G6PD in red cells requiring 0.05 ml of blood. In addition, a filter&#xD;
      paper blood spot will be collected to allow molecular typing of the parasite. This will&#xD;
      differentiate between a new and a relapse infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised placebo controlled study comparing the following four study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial 3 day chloroquine with supervised weekly placebo for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial 3 day chloroquine followed by supervised 14 day primaquine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initial 3 day chloroquine followed by supervised 8 week primaquine treatment (45 mg /&#xD;
           week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given health education messages and strongly advised to complete the&#xD;
      course. In addition a safety arm will be used for G6PD deficient patients; this will be used&#xD;
      to compare PCV with group 3 (above). This will be an 8 week regimen, administered by direct&#xD;
      observation, and will receive close monitoring for haemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given a full therapeutic course of chloroquine. Primaquine will be&#xD;
      administered to the study groups according to the respective protocol schedule. All relapses&#xD;
      and new cases will be re-treated using the same regime and procedure as at the time of&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in treatment groups 1, 2, and 3 will be monitored for the initial 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment for adverse events; G6PD deficient patients will be monitored for signs of&#xD;
      hemolysis every other day for the first 2 weeks of treatment and then once per week (prior to&#xD;
      dosing) until completion of the course. Following the treatment period, patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for 1 year for the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Variable: Proportion with relapse(s) of P. vivax in 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Variables: Time to subsequent relapse episode, number of relapse episodes&#xD;
      in 12 months, side effects / adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be advised to return to the BHU in the event of recurrent symptoms within 12&#xD;
      months following enrolment to the study. A patient will be deemed to have completed the study&#xD;
      after 12 months of follow-up. In any event each patient will be contacted once every 2 weeks&#xD;
      during the follow-up period in order to collect relevant information. At each episode, a&#xD;
      sample of blood will allow molecular typing of the parasite and define whether the patient&#xD;
      has a new infection or a relapse.&#xD;
