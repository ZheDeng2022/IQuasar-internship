  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of an HIV prevention behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to reduce sexual risk for HIV infection among non-injection, substance-using men&#xD;
      who have sex with men (SUMSM). The primary goal of the intervention is to reduce HIV&#xD;
      transmission by reducing the incidence of unprotected anal sex while under the influence of&#xD;
      alcohol and other drugs (AOD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the largest risk category for incident and&#xD;
      prevalent cases of HIV and AIDS in the U.S. Studies of MSM have established an association&#xD;
      between alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and risky sexual behaviors. Although studies have&#xD;
      assessed and confirmed the association of AOD use and unsafe sex, few have focused&#xD;
      specifically on reducing sexual risk of SUMSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual risk reduction interventions for MSM identified in the published scientific literature&#xD;
      have demonstrated that they are generally effective at reducing sexual risk behaviors among&#xD;
      MSM. However, none of these interventions specifically targeted non-injecting SUMSM. Thus, a&#xD;
      gap exists in prevention efforts to reduce HIV transmission among SUMSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the Project Mix overall is to develop and evaluate a practical&#xD;
      intervention strategy that is specifically tailored to the needs of non-injecting SUMSM. The&#xD;
      intent of the intervention is to decrease the number of unprotected anal sex partners (and&#xD;
      acts) while under the influence of AOD and in general.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be 18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  self-identify as male;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  understand and read English;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  live within the metropolitan area;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report being drunk or &quot;buzzed&quot; on alcohol 2 or more times or high on non-injection&#xD;
             drugs at least once during (or two hours before) anal sex in the past six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have had at least one unprotected anal sex episode in the past six months with a male&#xD;
             partner of unknown or different HIV-status than their own (i.e., DUA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report only marijuana, only Viagra or only marijuana and Viagra use during anal sex&#xD;
             (current research shows that marijuana use is not associated with sexual risk&#xD;
             behavior);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report injecting drugs (eligible if only methamphetamine, steroids, hormones and/or&#xD;
             prescribed medications) in the past six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have known their HIV-positive status for less than six months (this is done to allow&#xD;
             for psychological and behavioral adjustment following an initial HIV diagnosis and&#xD;
             this time frame coincides with our screening window); these men (if they so desire)&#xD;
             will be put on a wait list and contacted after 6 months have passed since their first&#xD;
             HIV-positive test result;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are currently involved in another HIV behavioral intervention study for MSM [local&#xD;
             study site identifies a list of such studies in their community at the time of the&#xD;
             trial];&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a specific plan to move from the metropolitan area within the next 15 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participated in the pilot phase of the project;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other reasons that the investigators deem would make participation either detrimental&#xD;
             to the participant or to the study.&#xD;
