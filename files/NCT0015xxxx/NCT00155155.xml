  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan is a hyperendemic area of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Previous studies&#xD;
      demonstrated vigorous T cell responses to HBV-encoded antigens developed in patients with&#xD;
      self-limited acute hepatitis B. In contrast, weak or no T cell responses could be detected in&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) patients. However, these immune responses are still not well known&#xD;
      in patients with acute exacerbation (AE) of CH-B and in patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      diseases, such as liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD4+CD25+&#xD;
      regulatory T cells might suppress immune responses against foreign antigens and pathogens.&#xD;
      The roles of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in patients chronically infected with HBV remain to&#xD;
      be clarified. The high percentage of HBV carriers in Taiwan are related to the vertical&#xD;
      transmissions. High maternal HBV viral load may make the newborns tolerant to the HBV.&#xD;
      However, the HBV-specific CD8+ T cells responses in the cord bloods of newborns are still&#xD;
      unknown. Thus, we want to resolve these issues in this study. We will enroll the HBsAg (+)&#xD;
      patients from NTUH. Blood samples will be collected. We will then analyze the HBV-specific&#xD;
      CD8+ T cell responses and the clarify the roles of regulatory T cells.&#xD;

      The HBsAg (+) patients from National Taiwan University Hospital will be included. Screening&#xD;
      for HLA haplotype will be performed by amplification refractory mutation system / PCR method.&#xD;
      The HLA-A2 or HLA-A11 will be enrolled to the study group because these two haplotypes are&#xD;
      the most ones in Taiwan. The other HLA haplotype HBV carriers will be enrolled as&#xD;
      HLA-mismatch control. The disease spectra include inactive HBV carrier, CH-B, CH-B with AE&#xD;
      (defined as ALT &gt;= 5 X UNL), HBV-related LC, HBV-related HCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBsAg, anti-HBs, IgM anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HIV will be&#xD;
      determined by commercial enzyme immunoassay kits. The serum levels of HBV DNA and genotypes&#xD;
      will be done by quantitative real-time PCR. Patients who are also infected with HDV or HCV or&#xD;
      HIV will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBMCs will be isolated from heparinized blood samples by density gradient centrifugation on&#xD;
      Ficoll-Hypaque. The PBMC will be washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended&#xD;
      in T cell medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses will be done by flow cytometry using pentamer&#xD;
      staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze HBV-specific CD8+ T cells responses in patients with chronic HBV infection&#xD;
      (prospective study). This part of the study is to clarify the role of HBV-specific T cell&#xD;
      responses during the course of acute exacerbation of CH-B. Blood will be collected at four&#xD;
      important time points.&#xD;
