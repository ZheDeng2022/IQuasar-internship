      This is an open-label phase II trial designed to test the effect and toxicity profile of&#xD;
      combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine in locally advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death for women in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Despite the advance in multidisciplinary treatment, a significant number of patients&#xD;
      eventually develop metastatic disease, especially those who present with locally advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer (LABC). LABC remains an important and challenging problem in practice. In LABC,&#xD;
      treatment strategies that include neoadjuvant chemotherapy have several potential advantages:&#xD;
      early initiation of systemic therapy, in vivo assessment of response, and downstaging of&#xD;
      primary tumor and regional lymphatic metastases, which makes breast-conserving surgery an&#xD;
      option for many. The potential theoretical shortcomings include delay in local treatment,&#xD;
      introduction of drug resistance, and unreliability of clinical staging. In practice, the&#xD;
      advantages have exceeded the disadvantages. Clinical trial has demonstrated that docetaxel&#xD;
      and capecitabine is highly effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. On the&#xD;
      other hand, our previous study has demonstrated that combination of taxane and cisplatin is&#xD;
      highly effective in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. We design&#xD;
      a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel with cisplatin and capecitabine in the treatment&#xD;
      of locally advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

                  muscles) or skin (ipsilateral cutaneous edema, ulceration, or satellite nodules)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Clinical evident inflammatory carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Ipsilateral fixed axillary adenopathy&#xD;
