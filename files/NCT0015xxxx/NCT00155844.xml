      Bone marrow consists of a complex hematopoietic cellular component.When the blood progenitor&#xD;
      cells differentiate to mature cells, they will exit unassisted to peripheral blood. On the&#xD;
      other hand, the immature cells trapped by marrow-blood barrier. However, malignant&#xD;
      transformation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells in AML and CML results in a blockade of&#xD;
      their ability to terminally differentiate, causing a rapid accumulation of immature&#xD;
      cells.Chemokines have been shown to direct the movement of cells between intravascular and&#xD;
      extravascular compartments.The CXC chemokine CXCL12, the ligand of CXCR4, activates distinct&#xD;
      signaling pathways that may mediate cell migration.In the preliminary research, we analyze&#xD;
      the CXCR4 expression and the chemotactic response of CXCL12 and peripheral plasma in six&#xD;
      leukemia cell lines (HL-60, HL-CZ, K562, U937, Raji and Jurkat) and found that three&#xD;
      categories among them could be suggested: one is CXCR4 (-) and CXCL12 response (-), such as&#xD;
      HL-CZ and K562 cells; the other is CXCR4 (+) and CXCL12 response (-), such as HL-60 and Raji&#xD;
      cells; the rest is CXCR4 (+) and CXCL12 response (+), such as Jurkat and U937 cells. These&#xD;
      results make us wonder that the leukemic cells could egress to PB from BM is due to&#xD;
      destruction of homing process or the activation of mobilization process through CXCR4-CXCL12&#xD;
      axis dysfunction. Therefore,we will focus on evaluating the mechanism of CXCR4-CXCL12 axis&#xD;
      dysfunction in the various leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells.&#xD;

      Bone marrow consists of a complex hematopoietic cellular component that continuously goes&#xD;
      through self-replication and/or differentiation processes. When the blood progenitor cells&#xD;
      differentiate to mature cells, they will exit unassisted to peripheral blood. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the immature cells trapped by marrow-blood barrier. However, malignant transformation&#xD;
      of the hematopoietic progenitor cells in AML and CML results in a blockade of their ability&#xD;
      to terminally differentiate, causing a rapid accumulation of immature cells.Chemokines have&#xD;
      been shown to direct the movement of cells between intravascular and extravascular&#xD;
      compartments.The CXC chemokine CXCL12, the ligand of CXCR4, activates distinct signaling&#xD;
      pathways that may mediate cell migration. Recent reports demonstrated that the migration of&#xD;
      HPC after transplantation from PB to BM via concentration gradients created by CXCL12,&#xD;
      produced by marrow stromal cells, has been proposed as integral to the homing process. The&#xD;
      mirror image of homing is mobilization of HPC from the BM to PB, which in a clinical setting&#xD;
      is induced by administration of various stimuli including hematopoietic growth factors. The&#xD;
      CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is reported to be very important in retaining the immature cells in the&#xD;
      appropriate bone marrow compartment. In the preliminary research, we analyze the CXCR4&#xD;
      expression and the chemotactic response of CXCL12 and peripheral plasma in six leukemia cell&#xD;
      lines (HL-60, HL-CZ, K562, U937, Raji and Jurkat) by flow cytometry and two-chamber migration&#xD;
      assay, respectively. Three categories among them could be suggested: one is CXCR4 (-) and&#xD;
      CXCL12 response (-), such as HL-CZ and K562 cells; the other is CXCR4 (+) and CXCL12 response&#xD;
      (-), such as HL-60 and Raji cells; the rest is CXCR4 (+) and CXCL12 response (+), such as&#xD;
      Jurkat and U937 cells. These results make us wonder that the leukemic cells could egress to&#xD;
      PB from BM is due to destruction of homing process or the activation of mobilization process&#xD;
      through CXCR4-CXCL12 axis dysfunction. Therefore,we will focus on evaluating the mechanism of&#xD;
      CXCR4-CXCL12 axis dysfunction in the various leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells&#xD;
      from several aspects: 1). Evaluate the CXCR4 expression and the CXCL12 response of leukemic&#xD;
      cells from patients with acute leukemia;2). Study on the molecular mechanism for the blockade&#xD;
      of CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling in CXCR4 (+) and SDF response (-) cells;3). Evaluate the marrow&#xD;
      plasma and peripheral plasma to find out plasma factors that interfering the migration&#xD;
      behavior of leukemic CXCR4 (+) but CXCL12 response (-) cells&#xD;
