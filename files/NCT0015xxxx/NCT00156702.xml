      The primary hypothesis of this pilot study is that dependence can be prevented in adolescents&#xD;
      who smoke, but who are not yet dependent. With this study, we seek to develop and test the&#xD;
      feasibility and provide controlled comparisons of two brief smoking dependence-prevention&#xD;
      interventions: motivational interviewing with feedback versus a video control. Forty&#xD;
      adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 will be enrolled. The evaluation and&#xD;
      dependence-prevention phases will occur during a single 3- to 4-hour session, and the 30-45&#xD;
      minute follow-up sessions will take place approximately one month, three months, six months,&#xD;
      and one year after the completion of the evaluation and dependence prevention phases.&#xD;

      III. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis of this pilot study is that dependence can be&#xD;
      prevented in adolescents who smoke, but who are not yet dependent. With this study, we seek&#xD;
      to develop and test the feasibility and provide controlled comparisons of two brief smoking&#xD;
      dependence-prevention interventions. Additional analyses will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      which, if any, demographic, psychological, personality, behavioral, or family characteristics&#xD;
      predict which adolescents respond best to dependence-prevention interventions, though no&#xD;
      clear a priori predictions can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Specific Aims: The primary aim of this pilot study is to prevent dependence in adolescent&#xD;
      smokers, who are at great risk for nicotine dependence and tobacco-related disease. Nicotine&#xD;
      dependence is a disease that begins in children and adolescents: approximately three quarters&#xD;
      of adult tobacco users (i.e., cigarette and cigar smokers and users of smokeless tobacco, or&#xD;
      SLT) report that their first tobacco use occurred when they were 11-17 years old (USDHHS,&#xD;
      1994a; 1994b; Riley et al., 1996). Moreover, the earlier a person starts smoking, the higher&#xD;
      their eventual daily cigarette consumption (Taoli and Wydner, 1991), and the greater their&#xD;
      risk of dying from a smoking-related disease (USDHHS, 1989). Because smoking begins in&#xD;
      adolescents and because young tobacco users are at the greatest risk for progressing to&#xD;
      dependence and dying of smoking-related disease, adolescent smokers would benefit immensely&#xD;
      from effective tobacco dependence prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Preliminary Progress/Data Report: This project involves an evaluation phase, including&#xD;
      laboratory measurement of tobacco's effects, a dependence-prevention phase, and a follow-up&#xD;
      phase. Because the laboratory measurement is critical to the success of all phases (data&#xD;
      generated in the laboratory phase are used in the intervention and thus influence the&#xD;
      follow-up), this preliminary data section will focus on laboratory research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory (CBPL; T. Eissenberg, Director) has been a&#xD;
      site for safe and ethical studies of tobacco use in adults (e.g., Eissenberg et al., 1999;&#xD;
      Buchhalter and Eissenberg, 2000; Buchhalter et al., 2001; Breland et al., in press). In&#xD;
      addition, Dr. Eissenberg initiated a discussion on how to conduct safe and ethical tobacco&#xD;
      research in adolescents: in 2000, he planned and chaired a symposium entitled &quot;Ethical and&#xD;
      Practical Challenges in Tobacco Research with Children&quot; at the 6th Annual Meeting of the&#xD;
      Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (Eissenberg, 2000; see also Eissenberg and&#xD;
      Balster, 2002). He has also been involved in several laboratory studies involving young&#xD;
      adults (e.g., Gire and Eissenberg, 2001) and adolescents (Zack et al., 2001; Corrigall et&#xD;
      al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress on the current project has included the establishment and maintenance of an&#xD;
      adolescent clinical lab facility for direct observation of young smokers and for testing&#xD;
      brief-intervention strategies in a controlled setting; recruitment of scientific and clinical&#xD;
      staff; development of subject recruitment procedures; engagement of local school personnel in&#xD;
      the recruiting process, utilization of advertising on city buses to aid recruitment,&#xD;
      development and pilot testing of the brief interventions; successful completion of 17 subject&#xD;
      baseline lab sessions and 8 telephone follow-at 1 month, 3 at 3 month, 1 visit at 6 months, 1&#xD;
      phone contact at 9 month, and 1 visit at 12 month. Four participants have been lost to&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Research Method and Design: This pilot protocol includes several integrated components:&#xD;
      recruitment, telephone or in-person screening and Parental Information Sheet and assent, a&#xD;
      psychosocial assessment, a laboratory assessment, two different dependence-prevention&#xD;
      interventions, and a follow-up component. The evaluation and dependence-prevention phases&#xD;
      will occur during a single 3- to 4-hour session, and the 30-45 minute follow-up sessions will&#xD;
      take place approximately one month, three months, six months, and one year after the&#xD;
      completion of the evaluation and dependence prevention phases. Each phase is outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment phase. Potential participants will be recruited through print ads, attached to&#xD;
      this protocol for IRB review, some of which may be distributed through schools with school&#xD;
      permission. Along with the ads, each student will receive the parental information and assent&#xD;
      procedures, therefore parents will be informed about the study directly by the adolescent.&#xD;
      The parental information sheet would explain that their teenager is interested in being part&#xD;
      of a study on the prevention of tobacco dependence. It gives a brief description of the&#xD;
      study. Parent signatures indicate they have received the information. For those adolescents&#xD;
      that find out about the study by fliers or word of mouth, the parental information sheet will&#xD;
      be sent by mail. Flyers may also be distributed by willing adolescents. Interested peers may&#xD;
      then call to see if they are eligible, and if they qualify and come to the baseline phase we&#xD;
      will send a referral fee of five dollars to the original participant for each referral that&#xD;
      does so. Even if the original participant receives the referral fee, the name of the other&#xD;
      participant will not be divulged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, consent, and assent phase. Potential participants will be initially screened using&#xD;
      the screening interview. Screenings might occur via telephone or in person, depending upon&#xD;
      individual preference. The sole purpose of the screening interview is to determine if&#xD;
      interested adolescents meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below). The screening&#xD;
      interview collects the minimum amount of information needed to determine eligibility and&#xD;
      maintains the potential participant's anonymity. This same information is collected again (as&#xD;
      background data, below) to determine reliability of reporting. Individuals who are unable to&#xD;
      report their own smoking history reliably are ineligible for further participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial screening process, potential participants will be told that their&#xD;
      parents/legal guardians need to sign and date the parental information and assent procedures.&#xD;
      The parental information and assent procedures will explain that their teenager is interested&#xD;
      in being part of a study looking at the prevention of becoming an addicted smoker and giving&#xD;
      a brief description of the study. Individuals will have as much time as needed to consider&#xD;
      their child's participation. The child will bring the parental signed form with the to the&#xD;
      first laboratory session. If the parent wants they can bring the adolescent and will still be&#xD;
      paid to compensate for their time, however it is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent assent will be done prior to research collection during the initial study session.&#xD;
      A researcher who has completed VCU's Level I IRB training will read the attached assent form&#xD;
      to the adolescent and answer any questions that individual may have. Individuals will have as&#xD;
      much time as needed to consider their participation. Individuals who are interested in&#xD;
      participating will be asked to sign the assent form indicating that they agree to participate&#xD;
      and understand that they may stop participating at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial Assessment. Adolescent participants will be asked to complete demographic,&#xD;
      psychological, personality, behavioral, and family questionnaires. The baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires consist of the Child Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1982), the Revised&#xD;
      Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978), the Leyton Obsessional&#xD;
      Inventory - Child Version (Berg, Rapoport, &amp; Flament, 1987), Barkley's ADHD Scale (Barkely,&#xD;
      1998), the National Youth Survey of Conduct Scale (Elliot, Huizinga, &amp; Morse, 1988), the&#xD;
      Adolescent Life Events Inventory (Compas, et. al., 1987), the Family Assessment Device&#xD;
      (Epstein, Baldwin, &amp; Bishop, 1983), the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (Millon,&#xD;
      Green, &amp; Meagher, 1982), and questions pertaining to body image, substance use, and smoking&#xD;
      behavior and attitudes. Each of the questionnaires was developed specifically for use with&#xD;
      children and/or adolescents, and most have been standardized and widely used in a general&#xD;
      adolescent population. These data will be used to report on participant characteristics and&#xD;
      will be especially useful in identifying factors that predict intervention response. We&#xD;
      recognize that asking personal questions sometimes makes people feel uncomfortable.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed that is any of the questions are upsetting to them, that they&#xD;
      are to tell the researcher. The researcher will then inform a clinician who will evaluate the&#xD;
      participant and determine and recommend necessary services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessment: The laboratory assessment will be virtually identical to that reported&#xD;
      elsewhere (e.g., Corrigall et al., 2001) and will involve an approximately 20 minute rest&#xD;
      period, questionnaires related to tobacco withdrawal and tobacco/nicotine effects, ad lib&#xD;
      smoking using a mouthpiece that measures puff topography (e.g., puff volume, number,&#xD;
      duration, etc), and a variety of physiological measures. Only adolescents who have already&#xD;
      been smoking on their own are eligible; therefore, we believe the smoking of a single&#xD;
      cigarette in the lab confers no additional risk. During the rest period, participants will&#xD;
      complete demographic and background information questionnaires. Participants will then be&#xD;
      asked to smoke as they normally would, with no other constraints. Participants will provide&#xD;
      their own cigarette (if they have one) or a cigarette will be provided for them. Outcome&#xD;
      measures, described below, include physiological data (e.g., heart rate, breath carbon&#xD;
      monoxide level, etc), subjective reports of tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and puff topography.&#xD;
      Saliva sample will be taken before and after smoking for later measurement of salivary&#xD;
      nicotine and cotinine (a nicotine metabolite).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: All questionnaires are computerized. Withdrawal-related questionnaires&#xD;
      include the QSU-Brief (Cox et al., 2001) MNWS (Hughes and Hatsukami, 1986). The Fagerstrom&#xD;
      Test for Nicotine Dependence will assess dependence levels (FTND; Heatherton, Kozlowski,&#xD;
      Frecker, &amp; Fagerstrom, 1991). Subjective effects of smoking will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological Measures. Two physiological measures will be monitored continuously: heart rate&#xD;
      (every 20 seconds) and blood pressure (every 3 minutes; Noninvasive Patient Monitor model&#xD;
      507E, Criticare Systems, Waukesha, WI). Expired CO levels will be measured at screening and&#xD;
      before and after smoking using a BreathCO monitor (Vitalagraph, Lenaxa, KS). This equipment&#xD;
      and these procedures have been used extensively in studies at VCU (e.g., Buchhalter et al.,&#xD;
      2001; Breland et al., in press). In addition, salivary nicotine and cotinine will be&#xD;
      collected before and after smoking. Participants will be asked to chew a roll of cotton&#xD;
      before placing it into a plastic test tube. The test tubes will be stored in a freezer at no&#xD;
      warmer than -32 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topography measures: Puff topography is a sensitive measure of drug self-administration in&#xD;
      cigarette smokers and has been used in previous studies of adolescent smokers (e.g.,&#xD;
      Corrigall et al., 2001). Cigarettes are smoked through a mouthpiece that is connected to a&#xD;
      pressure transducer and inhalation-induced pressure changes are amplified, digitized, and&#xD;
      sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz. Software (Plowshare Technologies, Baltimore, MD) converts&#xD;
      signals to air flow (ml/sec) and integrates this flow data, producing measures of puff&#xD;
      volume, duration, number, and interpuff interval (IPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependence-Prevention Interventions: After the psychosocial and laboratory components,&#xD;
      participants will take a 20-minute break during which snacks and drinks will be provided.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned randomly to one of two possible dependence-prevention groups.&#xD;
      The random assignment will occur after the evaluation phase, so as not to bias the&#xD;
      experimenters during data collection. One dependence-prevention group involves a brief&#xD;
      motivational interview that provides general and personalized feedback about the immediate&#xD;
      and long-term consequences of smoking, including feedback about the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological impact of tobacco as measured in the evaluation phase. Motivational&#xD;
      interviewing is a promising intervention in adolescent smokers (Colby, et. al., 1998;&#xD;
      Lawendowski, 1998). The second group will receive brief education-based dependence-prevention&#xD;
      interventions. Research indicates that high proportions of adolescents, particularly smokers,&#xD;
      are unaware of many of the significant smoking-related health risks, including shortened&#xD;
      lifespan and the likelihood of dying a smoking-related death (Romer &amp; Jamieson, 2000). In&#xD;
      addition, perceived health risks predicted motivation to quit, suggesting that if adolescents&#xD;
      are better informed about smoking-related health problems they may be more motivated to stop&#xD;
      smoking (Romer &amp; Jamieson, 2000). The second group will watch a composite of anti-smoking&#xD;
      videos, which includes education regarding the immediate and long-term effects of smoking and&#xD;
      education regarding tobacco companies and their marketing strategies. All participants will&#xD;
      earn a $40 mall gift certificate after the completion of this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase: Brief telephone follow-up sessions will take place approximately one month,&#xD;
      three months, six months, and nine months after the completion of the dependence-prevention&#xD;
      intervention. The telephone follow-ups will consist of a brief time-line follow-back&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess smoking behavior over the past two weeks. Participants will earn $10&#xD;
      mall gift certificates for completion of these telephone follow-ups that will be mailed to&#xD;
      them after completion of the follow-up session. In addition, short follow-up check-ups will&#xD;
      be performed six months and one year after completion of the dependence-prevention&#xD;
      intervention. During these two follow-up check-ups, participants will again complete the&#xD;
      time-line follow-back questionnaire, in addition to some questions about their current&#xD;
      smoking attitudes. Non-intrusive physiological data will be recorded to validate their&#xD;
      reports. Physiological data collection will consist of obtaining salivary nicotine and&#xD;
      cotinine and expired CO levels, using the procedures described above. Participants will earn&#xD;
      $25 mall gift certificates for completion of each of these follow-up check-up sessions. If&#xD;
      the parent / legal guardian does bring the adolescent in, they will be compensated $30 for&#xD;
      each follow-up check-up sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Data analysis will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics. Means, standard deviations, ranges, skewness, and kurtosis of all our&#xD;
      measures will be examined to determine outliers and normality in our data. In addition,&#xD;
      correlations will be run on all measures to determine what significant relationships exist&#xD;
      between questionnaire and physiological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential Statistics. Regarding data in our evaluation condition, we will examine&#xD;
      relationships between questionnaire data and physiological data. Regarding follow-up data, we&#xD;
      will run two-way mixed ANOVAs to examine the effect of the dependence-prevention&#xD;
      interventions on smoking at follow-ups. In addition, we will run regressions using&#xD;
      questionnaire and physiological data as predictors of smoking behavior at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Human Subjects Instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Description. A total of 40 adolescent smoking volunteers will be needed to complete this&#xD;
      preliminary research protocol. All sessions will take place in the Clinical Behavioral&#xD;
      Pharmacology Laboratory on the Virginia Commonwealth University's medical campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Participants must be healthy, between the ages of 12 and 18&#xD;
      years of age, and be current smokers (defined as at least one cigarette in the last week,&#xD;
      according to participant self-report). In order to ensure that smokers are not yet dependent,&#xD;
      adolescents who have smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day each day of the last week will be&#xD;
      excluded. Other exclusionary criteria include: history of or current specific health&#xD;
      concerns, including cardiovascular disease, pregnancy or current breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Recruitment Plan. Participants will be recruited by print advertisements, some of which&#xD;
      may be distributed through local schools. Parental information forms will be distributed or&#xD;
      mailed upon contact with the adolescent. Participants will then call the CBPL and potential&#xD;
      participants will participate in the telephone screening described above. If the participant&#xD;
      is eligible for participation, a qualified laboratory staff member who has completed VCU's&#xD;
      Level One IRB Training will obtain assent from adolescents at the beginning of the initial&#xD;
      session. Potential participants are given the opportunity to ask questions during the assent&#xD;
      process and are afforded all the time they need to make an informed decision. Assent forms&#xD;
      are attached for IRB review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Compensation Plan. Participants will be compensated for their time with mall gift&#xD;
      certificates. All participants who complete the initial session (including the evaluation and&#xD;
      intervention components) will receive a $40 mall gift certificate. Participants will receive&#xD;
      an additional $20 mall gift certificate each telephone follow-up and $50 for each of the&#xD;
      in-person follow-up sessions they attend, with a chance to earn a total of $200 in mall gift&#xD;
      certificates. If the participant completes ALL assessments, they will receive a $20 bonus at&#xD;
      the 12M follow-up, thereby earning a total of $220 over the year of participation. If the&#xD;
      parent brings the child, but not required to, they will be compensated for their time as&#xD;
      follows: $60 for the initial session, and $30 for the in person visits, totaling up to. In&#xD;
      addition, participants who recruit other adolescents to participate will earn a $5 gift&#xD;
      certificate for each enrolled participant they referred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Consent issues. Screening: As stated above, potential participants will be initially&#xD;
      screened using the screening interview; screenings might occur via telephone or in person,&#xD;
      depending upon individual preference. The sole purpose of the screening interview is to&#xD;
      determine if interested adolescents meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and to&#xD;
      schedule the initial visit. The screening interview collects the minimum amount of&#xD;
      information needed to determine eligibility and this same information is collected again (as&#xD;
      background data, below) to determine reliability of reporting. Individuals who are unable to&#xD;
      report their own smoking history reliably are ineligible for further participation. At the&#xD;
      end of the screening interview, the study procedures are described to potential participants,&#xD;
      who are then asked whether or not they are still interested in participating. If yes, staff&#xD;
      will set up the initial appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental Information Sheet: Before any research data are collected, the signed and dated&#xD;
      parental information sheet and assent will be collected. The signed Parental Information&#xD;
      Sheet indicating that the parent has reviewed information about the study is required for&#xD;
      adolescents to participate . Individuals will have as much time as needed to consider their&#xD;
      participation. The Parental Information Sheet will be disseminated at with recruitment&#xD;
      information or can be mailed if the participant calls in about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent assent: Adolescent assent will be obtained prior to research collection during the&#xD;
      initial study session. A researcher who has completed VCU's Level I IRB training will read&#xD;
      the attached assent form to the adolescent and answer any questions that individual may have.&#xD;
      Individuals will have as much time as needed to consider their participation. Individuals who&#xD;
      are interested in participating will be asked to sign the assent form indicating that they&#xD;
      agree to participate and understand that they may stop participating at any time.&#xD;
