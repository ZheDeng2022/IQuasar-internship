  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is becoming a global epidemic burden. Its chronic cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications, myocardial infarction and stroke, are the main causes of death in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. It was found that low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration is&#xD;
      related to the increased coronary disease risk that could be successfully reduced by&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering therapy. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that ameliorating&#xD;
      dyslipidemia may be renoprotective in diabetic patients with proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe is the first selective inhibitor of cholesterol absorption and it has demonstrated&#xD;
      a high efficacy in lowering cholesterol concentration and an excellent safety profile.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggest that ezetimibe, combined with a drug that blocks the cholesterol&#xD;
      synthesis (statins), could be even more effective in decreasing cholesterol concentration.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether ezetimibe-simvastatin combined therapy is&#xD;
      superior to simvastatin monotherapy in ameliorating the lipid profile and albuminuria in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus contributes substantially to the global burden of disease, with an&#xD;
      estimated 150 million people affected worldwide and its prevalence is expected to double by&#xD;
      2025. Myocardial infarction and stroke are common causes of major morbidity in people with&#xD;
      diabetes, most of whose deaths are attributed to cardiovascular causes. Recent findings&#xD;
      provide definitive evidences that cholesterol-lowering therapy can produce substantial&#xD;
      reductions in the risk of heart attacks, stroke and revascularizations in diabetic patients&#xD;
      even if they do not have high blood cholesterol concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also preliminary evidence is available that ameliorating dyslipidemia may be renoprotective&#xD;
      in diabetic patients with proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe is the first member of a class of highly selective cholesterol absorption&#xD;
      inhibitors that effectively and potently prevents the absorption of cholesterol by inhibiting&#xD;
      the passage of biliary and dietary cholesterol across the wall of the small intestine,&#xD;
      without affecting absorption of other fat-soluble nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many pre-clinical models have demonstrated the lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic&#xD;
      properties of ezetimibe as a single agent, and showed its synergistic effect in combination&#xD;
      with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I/II studies on patients with hypercholesterolemia have explored the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ezetimibe monotherapy and co-administration with simvastatin. In these studies,&#xD;
      combined therapy was safely and invariably more effective than single therapy in ameliorating&#xD;
      the lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe had an excellent safety profile in standard toxicity studies in pre-clinical&#xD;
      models. Clinical studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia have also indicated that&#xD;
      monotherapy with ezetimibe and coadministration with a statin were both well tolerated.&#xD;
      Whether ezetimibe-simvastatin combined therapy more effectively than simvastatin monotherapy&#xD;
      ameliorates the lipid profile and albuminuria in people with diabetes is worth investigating.&#xD;
      Evidence of a superior efficacy of ezetimibe-simvastatin would provide the rationale for a&#xD;
      prospective trial aimed to explore the possibility of a superior cardioprotective and&#xD;
      renoprotective effect of the combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of ezetimibe-simvastatin combination (10-40mg/day) and simvastatin&#xD;
           (40mg/day) alone on LDL-cholesterol concentrations in type 2 diabetic patients with&#xD;
           basal total cholesterol &gt;135mg/dl and/or concomitant lipid lowering therapy with HMGCoA&#xD;
           reductase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of the above treatments on total cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1&#xD;
           and B, lipoprotein (a) and triglyceride concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of these two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explorative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the hypothesis that ameliorating dyslipidemia therapy may also result in a&#xD;
      reduction of urinary albumin excretion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel group study. Following a&#xD;
      4-week wash-out period from previous lipid-lowering therapy (if any) with HMGCoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitors or any other kinds of lipid-lowering drugs, patients will enter a two-month run-in&#xD;
      phase with simvastatin 40mg per day. At completion of the run-in period, patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two double-blind treatment arms, ezetimibe 10mg + simvastatin 40mg&#xD;
      per day or placebo + simvastatin 40mg per day for a two-month treatment period.&#xD;
