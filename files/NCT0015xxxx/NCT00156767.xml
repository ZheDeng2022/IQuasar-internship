  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An appropriate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response is required to survive&#xD;
      critical illness. Primary adrenal insufficiency, relative adrenal insufficiency, tissue&#xD;
      resistance to glucocorticoids, ACTH deficiency and immune-mediated inhibition of the HPA axis&#xD;
      may impair the secretion or action of glucocorticoids in critically ill patients. Adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency is estimated to occur in up to 77% of critically ill patients, but currently,&#xD;
      there is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for adrenal insufficiency in this setting,&#xD;
      and standard testing does not discriminate among the aforementioned factors. We will study&#xD;
      the incidence and natural history of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients to&#xD;
      further define adrenal insufficiency and provide data to develop diagnostic tests. Clinical&#xD;
      features and outcomes will be correlated with laboratory measurements of hormones, cytokines&#xD;
      and glucocorticoid action. Healthy volunteers will undergo cortrosyn tests with measurement&#xD;
      of free cortisol levels to develop a normative range for this endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous glucocorticoid use, if prolonged and supraphysiologic, also inhibits the HPA and can&#xD;
      result in adrenal insufficiency. Patients with short intermittent courses of glucocorticoid&#xD;
      administration have not been studied well, and may also be at risk. To gain further&#xD;
      information about this group, patients receiving pulse glucocorticoid doses as part of bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant regimens at the Clinical Center will also be studied.&#xD;
