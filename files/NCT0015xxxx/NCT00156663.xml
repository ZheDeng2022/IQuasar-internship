      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project was to develop and evaluate a computerized program that&#xD;
      would enhance Veterans Health Administration (VHA) employees� awareness of women veterans and&#xD;
      their health-care needs. The program was designed to challenge negative stereotypes about&#xD;
      female patients (gender-role ideology), increase empathy toward female patients� needs&#xD;
      (gender sensitivity), and enhance knowledge regarding women veterans and aspects of their VHA&#xD;
      care (knowledge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN/METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases I involved generating content for the computerized interactive program. Phase II&#xD;
      involved creating the 30-minute program. The Phase III evaluation of the program involved a&#xD;
      two-group pretest�posttest�follow-up equivalent control group design at two facilities with a&#xD;
      third facility comparison group. At the first two facilities, employees who provide either&#xD;
      direct or ancillary care to patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment or the&#xD;
      control group. Participants in the treatment group completed the program entitled Caring for&#xD;
      Women Veterans. Participants in the control group and those at the third site completed a&#xD;
      30-minute program entitled Managing Stress. The data from the third site were included to&#xD;
      test for infusion of the treatment effect within same-site groups. Gender awareness was&#xD;
      evaluated at three time points using the Gender Awareness Inventory-VA (GAI-VA). Participants&#xD;
      completed the GAI-VA several weeks prior to completing the computerized program (Time 1, n&#xD;
      =339), immediately after completing the program (Time 2, n = 249), and approximately one&#xD;
      month after the program (Time 3, n = 167). Participants also completed a qualitative&#xD;
      evaluation of the program at Time 2.&#xD;
