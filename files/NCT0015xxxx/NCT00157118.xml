      The purpose of this study is to show that Protein C Concentrate is a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for subjects with congenital protein C deficiency. Depending on the type of&#xD;
      treatment required, patients are assigned to one of 3 study parts: Part 1 is for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute episodes, Part 2 is for short-term prophylaxis, and Part 3 is for&#xD;
      long-term prophylaxis in infants aged less than 6 months only.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newborn subjects &lt;= 6 months of age: diagnosis of severe congenital protein C&#xD;
             deficiency, with documented functional protein C level &lt; 20%. If a genetic diagnosis&#xD;
             is not available prior to initiation of Protein C Concentrate treatment, a documented&#xD;
             family history of protein C deficiency is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects &gt; 6 months of age: confirmed diagnosis of severe congenital protein C&#xD;
             deficiency, i.e., by&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a genetic analysis of severe congenital protein C deficiency (i.e., homozygous or&#xD;
             double heterozygous) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a documented family history of protein C deficiency AND a documented functional&#xD;
             protein C level &lt; 20% while the subject is in an asymptomatic state and not receiving&#xD;
             oral anticoagulation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated informed consent from either the subject or the subject's legally&#xD;
             authorized representative prior to enrollment. Informed consent includes consent for&#xD;
             conducting a genetic analysis (if the genetic defect is unknown).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of allergic reactions to Protein C Concentrate. In the case of&#xD;
             allergic reactions occurring at the Protein C Concentrate injection site; exclusion&#xD;
             from the study is at the discretion of the investigator but should be reported as an&#xD;
             AE regardless of the subject's inclusion in or exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any clinical study in which another investigational agent is used&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to enrollment or its use is expected at any time for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation.&#xD;
