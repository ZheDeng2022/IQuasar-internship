  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been commonly accepted that there is considerable geographic variation in the&#xD;
      prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and much less prevalent in Asia.&#xD;
      However, a tendency of increasing the prevalence of GERD has been observed in Taiwan with&#xD;
      four folds of growth (attached 1 &amp; 2), Japan and Singapore. GERD is a chronic, relapsing&#xD;
      disease, causing a poor quality of life lower than that of CAD and a greater burden with&#xD;
      exhausting socioeconomic and medical resource much higher than peptic ulcer disease. Thus,&#xD;
      thoroughly elucidating the mechanisms of GERD, in combination of basic science and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, to well and correctly clarify these diseases will be greatly helpful in&#xD;
      clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflux of duodenal contents is believed to contribute to esophageal injury, Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus and esophageal cancer. HCL and bile acid, particularly conjugated form at low pH,&#xD;
      has now been considered playing a more important pathogenetic role in the reflux esophagitis;&#xD;
      on the contrary, low gastric acid status may increase the risk of dysplasia and&#xD;
      carcinogenesis on Barrett's esophagus due to increased pulse of bile acid. While, only&#xD;
      limited reports focusing immune mechanism in the complex populations of GERD. In few&#xD;
      preliminary literatures showed that cytokine and tumor necrosis factors are associated with&#xD;
      GERD and Barrett's esophagus; it is worthwhile to further investigate. The effect of benefit&#xD;
      or harm of presence of Hp infection in GERD is debated; most are epidemiologic study, lacking&#xD;
      evidence- based data; whether need to eradicate Hp in the patients with reflux disease or not&#xD;
      is difficult to conclude. The current theory of transient relaxation of LES (TLESRs) as the&#xD;
      major pathophysiologic mechanism of GERD has been challenged after pooling mass clinical&#xD;
      experiences. Particularly after recent development of endoscopic therapy of GERD, we found&#xD;
      that current understanding of integration of anatomy and physiology of motility of LES and&#xD;
      related components in GERD is still insufficient. It will be important to integrate evidence-&#xD;
      based basic and clinical data of esophagus, in order to enter new era of the treatment of&#xD;
      GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Fass R et al., proposed a new conceptual framework of GERD; they suggest that it&#xD;
      should be divided into three categories, instead of a linear relation in the same spectrum,&#xD;
      including NERD, reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. In our clinical observation, we&#xD;
      also have got the same concept; TLESR alone cannot fit all of the clinical characteristics&#xD;
      and fails to explain all mechanisms of GERD. Based on currently advanced concepts from the&#xD;
      top of world and our observations, we propose the following hypotheses: (1). LES and cruel&#xD;
      diaphragm are the equally important barriers of lower esophagus in prevention of reflux.&#xD;
      TLESR alone is insufficient to causing these reflux diseases; on the contrary, hiatus hernia&#xD;
      is believed playing an important role in the beginning and late stage of GERD than previously&#xD;
      known; so called small hiatus hernia (&lt; 2 cm) and dynamic abnormality of crual diaphragm with&#xD;
      'physiologic' hernia with transient sac should not be neglected, particularly in the patients&#xD;
      of 'minimal esophagitis' and NERD and maybe also in those of Barrett's esophagus. (2). Once&#xD;
      dysfunction of LES and cruel diaphragm with loss of both intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters,&#xD;
      there should be an indirect or intermediate defense or mediator before resulting in NERD,&#xD;
      reflux esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus; immuno-inflammatory reaction and COX-2 expression&#xD;
      are the firstly candidates. (3) The mechanism of NERD is dysfunction of both sphincters with&#xD;
      a physiologic hernial sac, but without immunological abnormality. (4). NOS is the major&#xD;
      modulator of the LES and cruel diaphragm. (5). Benefit or harm of Hp infected stomach to&#xD;
      esophagus probably depends on the resulting intragastric acid status rather than the&#xD;
      simplified concept of the presence of Hp itself. (6). Via different patterns of expression of&#xD;
      NOS, COX-2 and immuno-inflammatory reaction, the refluxed HCL and bile acid in the lower&#xD;
      esophagus can make lower esophagus expressed as three categories: (a). Symptom -NERD, (b).&#xD;
      Inflammatory necrosis- reflux esophagitis, (3). Cell cycle abnormality with metaplasia-&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus; no linear relationship between these three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above hypotheses are mainly based on the following evidences or speculations:&#xD;
      prostaglandins (PGs) possess dual effects of pain sensation and motility in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that PGE2 release during inflammation initiated by&#xD;
      acid injury is a key component of LES dysfunction and reflux damage. Gastric and duodenal&#xD;
      juice can induce production of ROS, thereby damaging esophageal mucosa, which is strongly&#xD;
      associated with reflux esophagitis. ROS may induce DNA modifications and act as carcinogens.&#xD;
      ROS can induce apoptosis in cultured gastric cells. Apoptosis is believed to occur in these&#xD;
      conditions; and suppression or inhibition of apoptosis contributes to carcinogenesis and its&#xD;
      progression. However, this is still lacking sufficient related data in bile acid related&#xD;
      esophagitis and esophageal carcinogenesis with ROS and apoptosis. Therefore, it will be&#xD;
      valuable to elucidate the role of ROS in the HCL and bile acid related esophagitis and&#xD;
      carcinogenesis with relation to apoptosis. Recently, COX-2 is believed to highly contribute&#xD;
      to esophageal carcinogenesis. And ROS can up-regulate COX-2 in bovine luteal cells.&#xD;
      Therefore, we believe to elucidate the role and mechanism of PGs and COX-2 in the reflux&#xD;
      esophagitis. Additionally, NO produced from nNOS can relax lower esophageal sphincter and&#xD;
      play a role in the NANC modulation in the LES. However, pervious hypothesis &quot;cNOS is&#xD;
      beneficial and iNOS is harmful to gastrointestinal tract&quot; has been highly questioned&#xD;
      recently. While, the interaction of COX-2 and NOS has been known to effect on the modulation&#xD;
      of the function and inflammatory activity in the cardiopulmonary system and kidneys. So, we&#xD;
      can believe that in order to elucidate the mechanisms of esophageal function and esophagitis,&#xD;
      simultaneous investigation of the effects and roles of COX-2 and NOS is necessary and very&#xD;
      import. NO modulating agents and COX-2 inhibitor is believed to of the most promising in the&#xD;
      treatment of reflux esophagitis and its related metaplasic or neoplastic complications in the&#xD;
      future. Unfortunately, there is still lacking sufficient integrated clinical and molecular&#xD;
      biologic data in this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been preliminarily known that IL-8 and IL-1β (TH-1cytokines) play a role in the early&#xD;
      inflammatory stage in reflux esophagitis; IL-4 and L-10 (TH-2cytokines) may play an important&#xD;
      role in the development of Barrett's esophagus; and TNF-αand p53 mutant are closely related&#xD;
      with dysplasia and carcinogenesis of Barrett's esophagus, but its clinical application&#xD;
      remains to be further testified, particularly in correlating with COX-2 and NOS expressions.&#xD;
      It has been known that IL-1β is an extremely potent acid suppressant. Hp- infected stomach&#xD;
      with mucosal inflammation can up-regulate the IL-β expression and result in gastric atrophy&#xD;
      with hypoacidic status and increase in the risk of gastric cancer; we speculate this low acid&#xD;
      status may decrease the acid injury to esophagus with lower risk of NERD and reflux disease;&#xD;
      on the contrary, the risk of Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia and carcinogenesis may increase&#xD;
      by increasing bile acid pulse. This hypothesis is worthwhile to be testified to elucidate&#xD;
      these dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using combination of the expression of COX-2 and NOS and immunologic reaction in the&#xD;
      esophagus with manometry of LES and cruel diaphragm and 24 hr esophageal pH monitoring to&#xD;
      investigate the mechanisms and to make a new and more clinically applicable clarification of&#xD;
      these reflux diseases will be valuable in the clinical management and prevention. We will&#xD;
      perform the following works and complete the objectives: 1) comparing the difference of&#xD;
      immuno-inflammatory reactions among NERD, reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus; 2) the&#xD;
      different expression of PGs &amp; COX-2 in functional heartburn, hiatus hernia, NERD, reflux&#xD;
      disease and Barrett's esophagus; determining the subtype of EP receptor (EP1~4); 3)&#xD;
      determining and comparing the expression of NOS in the esophagus; 4) investigating the role&#xD;
      of ROS in the esophagus; 5) in correlating cytokine, COX-2 and NOS with LESP, TLESR,&#xD;
      diaphragm EMG and 24-hour esophageal pH ; 6) the difference of expression of cytokine,&#xD;
      atrophic gastritis and Hp in gastric mucosa, in correlating with intragastric acid status,&#xD;
      among functional heartburn, hiatus hernia, NERD, erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus;&#xD;
      to determine whether should eradicate Hp in reflux esophageal disease; 7) the effects of&#xD;
      lipid peroxidation related immunologic reaction, with relation to COX-2 and NOS, in the&#xD;
      inflammatory activity and esophageal carcinogenesis of esophagus; 8) the effects of&#xD;
      cytokines, COX-2 and NOS on the apoptosis in these reflux esophageal diseases; 9) integrating&#xD;
      immuno-inflamatory reaction, COX-2, NOS with manometry of LES and diaphragm, and 24-hour pH&#xD;
      monitoring and intragastric pH to newly clarify GERD into evidence based categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Patient selection by GERD symptom questionnaire with score of severity and frequency, and&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Panendoscopic examination: the patients were clarified into NERD, reflux esophagitis or&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus (each n=20), with additional group of hiatus hernia (n=20 for each those&#xD;
      &gt; 2 cm and &lt; 2 cm, respectively; the patients are free of symptom and endoscopically erosive&#xD;
      esophagitis); another group of functional heartburn (%time of pH &lt; 4 less than 4 and&#xD;
      DeMeester score &lt; 14.72; n =50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Endoscopic biopsy: specimens of esophagus, cardia and antrum will be obtained for&#xD;
      histology (H&amp;E stain for inflammatory activity, atrophic gastritis and Hp, and special stain&#xD;
      for Barrett's esophagus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Immunological and molecular study of esophageal and cardia specimens: EIA,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT-PCR of COX-2, NOS and cytokine. EIA for PGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Immunological and molecular study of antral specimens of stomach: EIA,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and Western blotting of IL-1β.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Blood sampling for plasma: EIA for cytokines, PGI, PGII, PGI/II, gastrin and Hp titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Esophageal manometry: LESP will be divided into hypertensive, normotensive and&#xD;
      hypotensive; calculate TLESRs at the same time. VIII. Diaphragm EMG: DEMG will be divided&#xD;
      into hypertensive, normotensive and hypotensive. IX. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring:&#xD;
      recording total numbers of reflux episodes, total duration of pH &lt; 4 and DeMester score;&#xD;
      record intragastric pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. In vitro esophageal tissue culture: endoscopic biopsy specimens of esophagus from the&#xD;
      patients. 1) adding HCL or bile acid into tissue culture to measure the expression of&#xD;
      cytokine, COX-2 and NOS; 2) adding cytokine into tissue culture to measure COX-2 expression;&#xD;
      3) adding PGs, arachidonic acid, L-arginine and ROS, respectively or in combination, into&#xD;
      incubated esophageal specimens to measure cytokine and COX-2 expression ; 4) instill PGs&#xD;
      antagonists, COX inhibitors, NOS inhibitors or ROS scavengers, each alone or in combination,&#xD;
      into incubated esophageal specimens to measure cytokine COX-2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of an integrated clinical anatomy-physiology, immunology and molecular&#xD;
      biology in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Starting from clinic to bench and back from bench&#xD;
      to bedside, detailed mechanisms of GERD will be obtained and a new clarification will be&#xD;
      provided to further clinical application in the treatment and prevention of GERD. The role of&#xD;
      Hp will be elucidated and to determine whether should eradicate Hp in the reflux esophageal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
