  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermic resuscitation is proven to be benefit to the cardiac origin cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients for it improve brain recovery dramatically. However, traditional cooling devices and&#xD;
      methods, most external cooling methods, include ice blanket, cooling helmet, or ice packing&#xD;
      lower the body temperature slowly or inefficiently which make many emergency physicians&#xD;
      hesitate to perform hypothermic resuscitation. To improve and promote the practice of&#xD;
      hypothermia resuscitation, more efficient temperature control method is necessary. We conduct&#xD;
      this clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of internal cooling catheter and&#xD;
      temperature regulatory device, which is approved by FDA in neurologic ICU for temperature&#xD;
      control, in the cardiac arrest patients.&#xD;

      We recruited successful resuscitated nontraumatic cardiac arrest adult patients in the&#xD;
      emergency department to evaluate the safety and feasibility of application those invasive&#xD;
      internal temperature regulator devices. Internal cooling catheter, &quot;ICY&quot; , and thermal&#xD;
      regulator device, &quot;Coolguard 2000&quot; are applied to the patients from femoral vein. WE definite&#xD;
      4 stages according to the temperature during the clinical trial: &quot;The Cooling Phase&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Hypothermia phase&quot;, &quot;Rewarming phase&quot;, and &quot;Postrewarming phase&quot;. The temperature is lowed&#xD;
      or elevated by the rate 0.5C/hr during the Cooling and Rewarming Phase, and it is maintained&#xD;
      33 +/- 1 C during hypothermia phase for 12 hours according to the comment of ACLS. To&#xD;
      understand the safety and feasibility, regular blood sampling, bedside EEG and vital&#xD;
      monitors, and special sheets are designed to document the every reasons, time points or every&#xD;
      clinical events during hypothermia therapy. The patients is observed until rewarming finish&#xD;
      for 48 hours or till death if expired during post-resuscitation hypothermia therapy.&#xD;
