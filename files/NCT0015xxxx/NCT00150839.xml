    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of antidepressant combination for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive disorder is one of the most common human diseases with a high burden for every&#xD;
      patient, her/his family, health care system and society as a whole. Actual treatment concepts&#xD;
      of depressive disorders include pharmacologic, biologic (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy,&#xD;
      light therapy) and psychologic therapy. Even though effective therapeutic options are at&#xD;
      hand, therapy needs time. It is often not possible to reach full remission of the disease and&#xD;
      10-25% of patients suffering from depression are regarded as &quot;treatment-resistant&quot;. In&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression, the use of a combination of antidepressive drugs is&#xD;
      considered safe and effective. However, at present no data exist concerning the use of drug&#xD;
      combination as primary therapeutic option. The aim of the study is to examine the hypothesis,&#xD;
      that significantly more patients achieve full remission of depressive symptoms when treated&#xD;
      with the combination of two antidepressants and as a secondary hypothesis, that patients&#xD;
      receiving a drug combination will achieve remission faster than patients treated with&#xD;
      monotherapy. To test these hypotheses, a two group parallel design is used comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in combination with venlafaxine or placebo.&#xD;

      Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining antidepressants is a well-established medical procedure for the treatment of&#xD;
      therapy refractory depression, that may also be applied successfully under non-refractory&#xD;
      conditions. The goal of the study is to test this hypothesis. All participants are to be&#xD;
      treated with Remergil Soltab®, a sedative antidepressant containing mirtazapine. In a&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel-group design, all participants are treated with either Trevilor®&#xD;
      retard, an antidepressant of the selective-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitor class&#xD;
      containing venlafaxine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in the treatment of therapy-resistant depression augmentation- and combination&#xD;
      strategies are widely used (Demling and Frieling 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only limited data exist on the efficacy and safety of combination of antidepressants:&#xD;
      Carpenter et al. have shown, that adjunctive use of mirtazapine added to the prior used&#xD;
      antidepressant (mostly SSRIs) was more effective than placebo (Carpenter et al 2002).&#xD;
      Devarajan and Dursun report a more effective antidepressive therapy with the combination of&#xD;
      citalopram and reboxetine (Devarajan and Dursun 2000). Rubio et al. found the combination of&#xD;
      reboxetine, SSRI or venlafaxine and mirtazapine effective (Rubio et al 2004). Smith et al.&#xD;
      report less side effects of venlafaxine use when combined with mirtazapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mentioned studies were conducted in treatment-resistant depression. Only the study by&#xD;
      Carpenter et al. was done in a randomized, controlled, double-blind design. No data exist on&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of combined antidepressant use as primary therapy of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pallanti et al. were able to show, that combination of SSRI and mirtazapine leads to an&#xD;
      earlier onset of therapeutic effects in OCD (Pallanti et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists little evidence on the benefits of combined antidepressant use in depression.&#xD;
      However, combination of antidepressants proved to be effective and safe in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression. All used antidepressants have side-effects (see&#xD;
      &quot;Fachinformation&quot; for further details). Drug-drug interactions have not been described for&#xD;
      the drugs used in the trial. A risk-potentiation therefore seems unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route of administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venlafaxine and placebo are administered orally, the usual mode of administration for&#xD;
      antidepressive drugs. Only Remergil Soltab®is administered using an orodispersible tablet.&#xD;
      This way of administering mirtazapine has proven to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are to be treated with Remergil Soltab® 45mg, the highest dosage of its&#xD;
      license in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trevilor® retard will be used 300mg/d. It is licensed for 375mg/d, but for practicability&#xD;
      reasons, especially blinding procedures, the modestly lower dosage will be entertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remergil® medication starts with 15mg for two days after randomization. On day 3 and 4, 30mg&#xD;
      are used. From day 5 on, 45mg are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Trevilor® group, treatment starts with 150mg for the first three days, afterwards&#xD;
      300mg are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with day 4, both groups are treated with two capsules of the blinded study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are treated for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, the guidelines for good&#xD;
      clinical practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) and the applicable regulatory requirements, namely the&#xD;
      German law on drugs (AMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 participants, both female and male are to be recruited when admitted to the open wards of&#xD;
      the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen. Participants&#xD;
      have to suffer from depressive disorder and need to be 18-65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and inclusion into the trial, all prior psychopharmacological medication is&#xD;
      stopped and washed out. How dose reduction and cessation is done will be decided&#xD;
      individually. The wash-out phase should not exceed 5-7 days. The use of irreversible&#xD;
      inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAOI) during 14 days prior to screening is an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion, as a wash-out period of 14 days is not suitable for the trial. After the wash-out,&#xD;
      patients are randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VENLA - Participants receiving Trevilor®retard 150mg in a blinded capsule. For three&#xD;
           days, one capsule is administered, afterwards two capsules are administered,&#xD;
           representing a dosage of 300mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CONT - Participants receiving placebo capsules. For three days, one capsule is&#xD;
           administered, afterwards two capsules are administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are receiving Remergil Soltab® starting with 15mg for two days, 30mg for&#xD;
      days 3 and 4 and 45mg beginning with day 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication permitted during the trial: all non-psychiatric medication, lorazepam and&#xD;
      pipamperon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication not permitted: Antidepressants other than the study medication, neuroleptics other&#xD;
      than pipamperon, sedative other than lorazepam. Medication with known interactions with the&#xD;
      study medication (according to the SPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medication is allowed before the wash-out period of the trial with the exception of&#xD;
      irreversible MAO inhibitors (MAOI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication permitted after the trial: All medication is allowed after the trial. The use of&#xD;
      MAOI and other monoaminergic substances should not be started earlier than 14 days after the&#xD;
      end of intake of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is assessed using different psychometric scales either filled out by the participant&#xD;
      or the investigator. Scales to be used are BDI, BAI, BSI, PSQuI as questionaires filled by&#xD;
      the participant and CGI, MADR-S, HAM-D and HAM-A as rating scales filled out by the&#xD;
      investigator. During the first week and week 13, a cranial magnetic resonance image is&#xD;
      obtained, to assess morphologic changes of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the weekly visits, BDI, BAI, CGI, HAM-D, HAM-A and MADR-S are entertained. BSI and&#xD;
      PSQuI are entertained at screening, visit 4, visit 8, visit 12 and visit 13. (please see also&#xD;
      the attached flow chart and 16 Supplement A for further details).&#xD;
