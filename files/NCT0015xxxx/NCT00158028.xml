  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of risperidone compared to placebo in&#xD;
      the treatment of the psychotic-like and deficit symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder&#xD;
      (SPD). Treatment with risperidone, a 5HT2 and dopamine D2 blocking agent, holds particular&#xD;
      promise in the treatment of SPD. Unlike traditional antipsychotics, risperidone targets the&#xD;
      deficit or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The deficit-like symptoms of SPD are therefore&#xD;
      also likely respond to treatment with risperidone. One common complication in the present&#xD;
      psychopharmacologic treatment of SPD with traditional neuroleptics is the fact that many&#xD;
      patients discontinue treatment due to the medication-induced dysphoria. Given initial reports&#xD;
      and the serotonergic component of the risperidone mechanism, risperidone is anticipated to&#xD;
      produce little or no dysphoria.&#xD;

      All patients receive a comprehensive medical evaluation prior to their participation in any&#xD;
      studies, as part of their normal clinical care. The evaluation includes an extensive medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation including SMA-18, CBC with&#xD;
      differential, TFT's, U/A, stool guaiac, serology, drug screen, chest X-ray (where indicated),&#xD;
      EKG, and, for women, pregnancy test. [Note: Subjects will have consented to these procedures&#xD;
      in a separate consent, &quot;Biological Correlates of Personality Disorder- Information for&#xD;
      Subjects (88244)&quot;, before being invited to join this study.] Patients will be interviewed by&#xD;
      clinical psychology doctoral students trained in the use of structured instruments to assess&#xD;
      Axis I and Axis II pathology. A rater will independently complete either the Schedule for&#xD;
      Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) (Spitzer &amp; Endicott 1978), modified for&#xD;
      evaluation of DSM-IV criteria for Axis 1 disorders, or the Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      DSM-IV Axis I Disorders ( First et al 1996) and the Structured Interview for DSM-III-R&#xD;
      Personality Disorders (SIDP-R) (Pfohl et al 1989) also modified for the evaluation of DSM-IV&#xD;
      criteria. When possible, information will be gathered independently from an informant (first&#xD;
      degree relative or life-long friend) to supplement information obtained from clinical&#xD;
      interviews and review of past records. The use of structured interviews, and questionnaires&#xD;
      are not part of standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1 Part 1 is a single-blind two-week placebo washout. Patients will be seen weekly by a&#xD;
      research psychiatrist. One week of (placebo) medication will be dispensed at a time by a&#xD;
      research program physician under the direct supervision of Dr. Koenigsberg. Patients will be&#xD;
      seen weekly throughout the study. Interviews and assessments are standardized and identical&#xD;
      throughout all phases of the study. They include the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI),&#xD;
      the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Symptom&#xD;
      Scale (PANSS), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), all administered weekly. At&#xD;
      baseline and after 4- and 9-weeks of treatment, subjects will also receive a series of&#xD;
      paper-and-pencil and computer-presented cognitive tests (DOT test, Paced Auditory Serial&#xD;
      Addition Task, Continuous Performance Task-Identical Pairs version, Serial Verbal Learning&#xD;
      Test and the Wechsler memory Scale-Revised Visual Reproduction test). No medications, other&#xD;
      than study drug, are allowed during the protocol. If, during this two-week placebo washout&#xD;
      period, the total SANS score decreases by 35% or greater, patients will not be entered into&#xD;
      Phase 2. Use of a placebo washout is not part of standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2 Part 2 is the double blind, 9-week parallel-arm placebo-controlled portion of the&#xD;
      study. Randomization will be conducted by the Pharmacy. One week of medication (active or&#xD;
      placebo) will be dispensed at a time by a research program physician under the direct&#xD;
      supervision of Dr. Koenigsberg. The patient will receive 1 tablet PO QD every day of the&#xD;
      study. If enrolled in the Active Arm of the study, the patient will receive a .25 mg&#xD;
      risperidone tablet orally once daily for Days 1 to 7; .5 mg risperidone tablet orally once&#xD;
      daily for Days 8 to 21; 1 mg risperidone tablet orally once daily for Days 22-35; 1.5 mg&#xD;
      risperidone tablet orally once daily for days 36-49; and a 2 mgs of risperidone orally once&#xD;
      daily for days 50 to 63. If the treating psychiatrist believes that a higher dose is&#xD;
      clinically indicated, the physician may alter the above by increasing the dose to 2 mg per&#xD;
      day beginning on day 22 and to 4 mg per day beginning on day 50. Weekly visits will include&#xD;
      standard assessment and review of protocol compliance. Treatment with risperidone is not part&#xD;
      of current standard clinical care of schizotypal personality disorder and this study is&#xD;
      designed to establish its usefulness with this population. Similarly use of a double bind&#xD;
      placebo control is not part of standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 3 Patients who were randomized into the placebo arm of Part 2 will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity of participating in an 8 week open label study of risperidone otherwise identical&#xD;
      to Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed by a repeated measures analysis of variance separately for scores on&#xD;
      the CGI, SANS, PANSS, and HDSR comparing placebo and active medication.&#xD;
