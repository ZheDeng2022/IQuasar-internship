      EBV, infection process, immortalization, B lymphocytes, Epithelial cells, co-culture&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) belongs to human γ-herpes viruses. Unlike other human herpes&#xD;
      viruses, EBV can only predominately infect two types of human cells: lymphoid cells and&#xD;
      epithelial cells and its infection is associated with several human malignancies of these two&#xD;
      cell types. The lymphoid cancers associated with EBV infection include Burkitt's lymphoma,&#xD;
      Hodgkin's disease, B lymphoma in immunodeficient patients and T/NK cell lymphoma. The&#xD;
      carcinomas associated with EBV are nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. One unique&#xD;
      biological feature of EBV is that it can infect and immortalize primary B lymphocytes in&#xD;
      vitro into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). So far, limited information is known about the&#xD;
      whole EBV infection process and its regulation mechanism for immortalization. In this&#xD;
      project, three EBV infection models are setting up to reveal the cellular events and signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway possibly involved in EBV infection process and immortalization course of&#xD;
      action.&#xD;

      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a human malignancy derived from the nasopharyngeal epithelial&#xD;
      cells, is occurring highly frequently in Taiwan. Of note, the average ages of NPC individuals&#xD;
      are usually ten years younger than those of patients with other head and neck cancers.&#xD;
      Clinically, this early onset and high incidence of metastasis in NPC may contribute to its&#xD;
      poor prognosis. Fortunately, NPC is usually radio-and chemo-therapy sensitive during the&#xD;
      early stage. So, the more we understand NPC pathogenesis, the more efficient detection&#xD;
      methods would be developed for NPC early diagnosis and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four unique characteristics have been reported for NPC: geographic preference, heavy&#xD;
      infiltration of lymphocytes, high incidence of metastasis and association with Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      virus (EBV). According to our hypothesis that both cellular changes and viral factors are&#xD;
      crucial for NPC development, four major long-term study goals have been carried out in our&#xD;
      lab: (1) identification and characterization of the cellular and viral factors that are&#xD;
      involved in NPC formation, (2) elucidation of potencies of these molecules as clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis markers of NPC, (3) investigation of the molecular and biological&#xD;
      linkage between EBV infection and NPC development and (4) establishment of a drug-screening&#xD;
      system for NPC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our assumption that both cellular genes and viral factors are involved in NPC&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, the following genes are chosen as the major study targets in this five-year&#xD;
      grant. Firstly, to asses the alteration of cellular gene expression, we choose three cytokine&#xD;
      genes 【interleukin (IL)-1, IL-7 and IL-13】, three inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP)&#xD;
      genes (survivin, HIAP-1, and HIAP-2), two specific cellular genes (osteoblast-specific&#xD;
      factor-2 and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor) and one tumor suppressor gene (tumor&#xD;
      susceptibility gene TSG101) in our proposal. All these genes exhibit special expression&#xD;
      profiles in NPC biopsies in our preliminary study. So, the regulation and effect of these&#xD;
      genes in epithelial cells would be the study focus. Secondly, two EBV viral genes, Zta and&#xD;
      LMP2A, the former encoded immediately early lytic product and the later encoded latent&#xD;
      membrane protein, are selected for this study. In our previous grant, we found that Zta can&#xD;
      up-regulate TKT (trk-related tyrosine kinase) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 which is&#xD;
      a down-stream effector of TKT. Therefore we will extend the study on how Zta and LMP2A&#xD;
      regulate and influence anti-apoptotic network and metastasis progression. Based on our&#xD;
      preliminary data, this proposal is highly approachable and the results may provide valuable&#xD;
      information for NPC diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.&#xD;
