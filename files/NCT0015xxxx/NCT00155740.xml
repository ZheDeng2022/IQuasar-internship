      Ovarian cancer became a more and more important disease in recent years due to its first&#xD;
      mortality rate of gynecologic malignancies. The incidence of ovarian cancer also increased in&#xD;
      recent year in Taiwan. The lack of symptoms, difficulties in early diagnosis, insufficient&#xD;
      accurate tumor markers, and lack of information about ovarian tumor biology contribute to the&#xD;
      poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. The prognostic parameters for ovarian carcinomas&#xD;
      are tumor stage, histologic subtype, degree of malignancy, and residual tumor after surgical&#xD;
      treatment. However, these factors present an incomplete picture of the tumor biology of&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and are frequently interrelated. Thus, the identification of new biologic&#xD;
      factors predictive of individual disease course and prognosis would be extremely useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of tumor markers that are released into the circulation can aid in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and/or monitoring of therapeutic responses of patients with various tumors, including&#xD;
      carcinomas of ovary. CA125 is the most commonly used serum marker for patients with ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma. Although it has proven clinically valuable in monitoring the response of patients&#xD;
      to therapy, some ovarian carcinomas do not express CA125, and CA125 often is increased in&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory disease. Thus, there is a need for improvement, either in the form&#xD;
      of a more specific and/or sensitive assay or an assay that uses a different marker and can be&#xD;
      used to complement CA125 toward the goal to improve patient survival by improving diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesothelin is a 40-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein. In normal tissues,&#xD;
      the expression of mesothelin has subsequently been shown to be largely restricted to&#xD;
      mesothelial cells, although immunoreactivity has also been reported in epithelial cells of&#xD;
      the trachea, tonsil, fallopian tube, and kidney. Mesothelin has been shown to be&#xD;
      over-expressed in pancreatic carcinomas, gastric carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma, and it&#xD;
      seems that mesothelin may be utilized as a new tumor marker for ovarian carcinoma. We will&#xD;
      evaluate that if mesothelin can be a new potential tumor marker for ovarian cancer in this&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;

      Incidence of Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the first mortality rate of gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies (1-3) and became a more and more important disease in recent years (4-6). The&#xD;
      incidence of ovarian cancer also increased in recent year in Taiwan (7). Ovarian cancer has&#xD;
      the highest mortality of all gynecological cancers, with an overall 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      only 20-30% (1). The lack of symptoms, difficulties in early diagnosis, insufficient accurate&#xD;
      tumor markers, and lack of information about ovarian tumor biology contribute to the poor&#xD;
      prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (8). The prognostic parameters for ovarian carcinomas&#xD;
      are tumor stage, histologic subtype, degree of malignancy, and residual tumor after surgical&#xD;
      treatment (9-12). However, these factors present an incomplete picture of the tumor biology&#xD;
      of ovarian cancer and are frequently interrelated (13). Thus, the identification of new&#xD;
      biologic factors predictive of individual disease course and prognosis would be extremely&#xD;
      useful. From the above-mentioned data, ovarian cancer indeed is a disease that should be&#xD;
      respected, however, there were only few of research work focusing on it in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor marker for ovarian cancer Detection of tumor markers that are released into the&#xD;
      circulation can aid in the diagnosis and/or monitoring of therapeutic responses of patients&#xD;
      with various tumors, including carcinomas of ovary (14-17), prostate (18), the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract (19, 20), or breast (21). CA125 is the most commonly used serum marker&#xD;
      for patients with ovarian carcinoma (14). Although it has proven clinically valuable in&#xD;
      monitoring the response of patients to therapy, some ovarian carcinomas do not express CA125,&#xD;
      and CA125 often is increased in patients with inflammatory disease. Thus, there is a need for&#xD;
      improvement, either in the form of a more specific and/or sensitive assay or an assay that&#xD;
      uses a different marker and can be used to complement CA125 toward the goal to improve&#xD;
      patient survival by improving diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New potential molecule as tumor marker for ovarian cancer Mesothelin is a 40-kDa&#xD;
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein. It is synthesized as a precursor of&#xD;
      molecular mass 69 kDa, which then is proteolytically processed into an N terminal secreted&#xD;
      form of molecular mass 30 kDa and a membrane-bound form of 40 kDa (22, 23). The 30-kDa&#xD;
      secreted form has been termed megakaryocyte potentiating factor (23). In normal tissues, the&#xD;
      expression of mesothelin has subsequently been shown to be largely restricted to mesothelial&#xD;
      cells, although immunoreactivity has also been reported in epithelial cells of the trachea,&#xD;
      tonsil, fallopian tube, and kidney (24). Mesothelin has been shown to be expressed in&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinomas(25), gastric carcinoma (26) and ovarian carcinoma (27), and it seems&#xD;
      that mesothelin may be utilized as a tumor marker for ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the amount of mesothelin in pre- and post-treatment serum samples of&#xD;
      patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. We will also correlate the clinicopathologic items&#xD;
      and the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients and evaluate whether mesothelin can be a new&#xD;
      rumor marker for ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients with ovarian carcinoma who undergo hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
        salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and appendectomy will be enrolled and the clinical data&#xD;
        will be obtained from our hospital. All of the patients received four to six courses of&#xD;
        adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.Histologic grading was according to International&#xD;
        Union against Cancer criteria (28). The stage of disease was classified according to the&#xD;
        International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO, 1987). Pelvic and paraaortic&#xD;
        lymph node samplings will be performed, if the disease will be confined to within the ovary&#xD;
        or will be without a ruptured capsule. The histopathologic data, including histologic type&#xD;
        and histologic grade, will be evaluated by a certified pathologist. The maximal diameter of&#xD;
        the residual tumor after surgery will be also recorded. All patients will be followed up at&#xD;
        3-month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with ovarian endometrioma, other benign ovarian tumors receiving surgical&#xD;
        intervention, or healthy patients without surgical intervention will be presented as normal&#xD;
        controls.&#xD;
