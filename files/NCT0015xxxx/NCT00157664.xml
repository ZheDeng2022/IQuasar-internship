  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this study is to collect information through diagnostic testing, blood&#xD;
      sample analysis and patient data collection on patients starting hemodialysis to determine&#xD;
      risk and preventative factors of bleeding and clotting events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis patients have a very high rate of heart attacks, strokes and amputation. These&#xD;
      problems are caused by a blood vessel problem called atherosclerosis (hardening of the&#xD;
      arteries), and by clotting. Clotting is also a problem in the access, which is their lifeline&#xD;
      for hemodialysis. We have early results which show that some risk factors for clotting in the&#xD;
      general population are common in dialysis patients. Bleeding is another significant problem&#xD;
      within this population. In this pilot study we will measure bleeding/clotting factors in the&#xD;
      blood of consenting patients who are just starting dialysis. We will also do special tests to&#xD;
      show how much calcium build up and atherosclerotic build up has happened in the arteries and&#xD;
      whether the arteries are becoming stiff. We will then follow patients for up to four years&#xD;
      and record any health problems that might reflect bleeding, clotting or a blood vessel&#xD;
      problem. At the end of the study, we will compare people who have had bleeding, clotting or&#xD;
      blood vessel problem with those who have not, and learn which of the measurements predicted&#xD;
      problems. We will go on to study potential treatments, such as anti-clotting drugs, which&#xD;
      might prevent or delay the occurrence of such problems. This would improve the health of&#xD;
      dialysis patients.&#xD;
