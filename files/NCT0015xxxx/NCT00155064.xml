  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tissue kallikrein-kinin (KKS) and renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAAS) had been&#xD;
      implicated in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Both of the KKS and RAAS&#xD;
      may work coordinately to regulate salt metabolism, local blood flow. Thus, we conducted this&#xD;
      study to elucidate, first, whether some alterations in components of the kallikrein-kinin&#xD;
      system could do effect on aldosterone secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study has shown the post captopril plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC)/ plasma&#xD;
      rennin activity (PRA) ration (ARR) was a reliable method for diagnosis of primary&#xD;
      aldosteronism (PA). The ARR change by angiotensin II receptor blockade was reported to be&#xD;
      significantly higher than that by ACE inhibitor. This study assessed whether angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptor blockade offers any additional advantage in the diagnosis of PA. Clinically we&#xD;
      evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibition) and losartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) test in PA patient. This&#xD;
      interaction mechanism, in term, could further explain the interaction of KKS and RAAS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects 20% to 25% of adult population. Most patients are diagnosed as having&#xD;
      essential or primary hypertension. Up to 10% to 15 % have an identifiable cause and many of&#xD;
      those have an adrenal basis [Miroslava H. et al., 2002]. The tissue kallikrein-kinin (KKS)&#xD;
      and renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAAS) had been implicated in regulating blood&#xD;
      pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Recent studies in humans indicate that the vasodilator&#xD;
      tissue KKS, the counterpart of the tissue RAAS, is also expressed in the adrenal gland. The&#xD;
      adrenal gland regulates sodium and water excretion and reabsorption through the release of&#xD;
      aldosterone and corticosterone. Previous study reveals an anatomical linkage between the&#xD;
      tissue KKS and sodium and water metabolism. Both of the KKS and RAAS may work coordinately to&#xD;
      regulate salt metabolism, local blood flow. In contrast, although many investigators have&#xD;
      supported the notion that Ang II and BK physiologically antagonize each other's effects on&#xD;
      blood pressure, there are many instances where the two peptides exert common actions. For&#xD;
      example, the Bradykinin also stimulates aldosterone release from adrenocortical cells through&#xD;
      B2 receptors. Furthermore, the AT1 receptor and the bradykinin (B2) receptor form stable&#xD;
      heterodimers, the two major signaling proteins triggered by AT1. In vitro studies (Margolius&#xD;
      1995) have shown that kallikrein acts as a prorenin-activating enzyme, and that tissue&#xD;
      kallikrein can generate angiotensin II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the interactions between both systems are complex and not always simply&#xD;
      antagonistic. The interactions of the two systems on aldosterone secretion are not examined&#xD;
      Thus, we conducted this study to elucidate, first, whether some alterations in components of&#xD;
      the kallikrein-kinin system could do effect on aldosterone secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study provides evidence that bradykinin contributes substantially to the aldosterone&#xD;
      secretion with or without the effects of angiotensin. The data also could confirm whether&#xD;
      ATR2-Bradykinin-B2-aldosterone really works. We want to realize the expression of angiotensin&#xD;
      and bradykinin in the adrenal gland and hypertension related to these systems.&#xD;
