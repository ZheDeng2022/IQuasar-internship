  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to deliver primary systemic high-dose methotrexate (MTX) treatment to&#xD;
      PCNSL patients and to define the role of whole brain irradiation (WBI) in primary therapy,&#xD;
      i.e., to analyze whether patients who have undergone primary chemotherapy can postpone&#xD;
      irradiation with its possible late sequelae until recurrence without incurring losses in&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival. This is studied here for the first time worldwide in a&#xD;
      systematic, controlled and randomized manner. In this study, one arm with six cycles of&#xD;
      high-dose MTX and subsequent irradiation (A1), which comes closest to a &quot;standard arm of&#xD;
      primary therapy&quot;, at least according to the majority assessment, is compared to irradiation&#xD;
      at recurrence with regard to time to progression and overall survival (A2). In primary&#xD;
      therapy failure, it will also be analyzed to what extent salvage therapy with AraC is&#xD;
      equivalent to irradiation as the &quot;standard arm&quot; with regard to time to progression and&#xD;
      overall survival (arm B1 and B2).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Six 14-day cycles of high-dose MTX will be given at the beginning of the study. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed centrally at the study headquarters in UKBF Berlin already at study&#xD;
      inclusion. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will receive the first systemic treatment&#xD;
      with 4 g/m2 MTX i.v. over 4 hours within 14 days. Dexamethasone in a dose of 3 x 8 mg/day&#xD;
      orally for 10 days will additionally be given in the first cycle. This dexamethasone dose&#xD;
      will be started 3 days before the first MTX application. Ten to 14 days after the 3rd and 6th&#xD;
      MTX dose, the response to MTX therapy will be evaluated by MRI and a repeated CSF examination&#xD;
      in the case of renewed CSF involvement. Assessment can also be made at any other time point&#xD;
      if there is clinical deterioration. In all cases, the neuroradiological reference center&#xD;
      (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Tübingen) will decide about the response to MTX&#xD;
      therapy. MRI and CT scans should be sent to the neuroradiological reference center after HD&#xD;
      MTX is terminated for central response evaluation. If complete remission is achieved after&#xD;
      completing high-dose MTX therapy, patients will be treated with WBI (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy&#xD;
      fractions) starting a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 weeks after the end of chemotherapy&#xD;
      (arm A1) or WBI at first recurrence (arm A2). If primary therapy is not successful (partial&#xD;
      remission, stable disease after the 6th cycle, progression at any time of MTX therapy),&#xD;
      patients will receive WBI (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions; arm B1) or high-dose AraC chemotherapy&#xD;
      3 g/m2 i.v. over 3 hours every 12 hours for 2 days (arm B2) according to the randomization.&#xD;
      If high-dose MTX therapy leads to termination before the application of 6 cycles of MTX (see&#xD;
      termination criteria) but allows further AraC therapy or WBI, further treatment is given in&#xD;
      the non-CR arm according to the randomization. High-dose AraC therapy will be administered in&#xD;
      four 3-week cycles. If complete remission occurs already after one or two cycles, only one&#xD;
      additional cycle will be applied. Patients will not be crossed over into the B arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a recurrence or progression after finishing a complete treatment arm, the patient&#xD;
      can be treated with chemotherapy according to PCV protocol or WBI in the B2 arm. This&#xD;
      decision is left up to the individual study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G-PCNSL-SG-1 study is a prospective, controlled phase IV study with central&#xD;
      randomization. Patients in both arms will be submitted to stratified randomization according&#xD;
      to age (&lt; 60; &gt; 60) and center to minimize the effect of important therapy-related prognostic&#xD;
      factors. The study is not blinded. Randomization will be performed centrally at study&#xD;
      inclusion at the Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University&#xD;
      Hospital Benjamin Franklin of the Free University of Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study duration is 7 years - 4 years in the recruitment phase with a subsequent&#xD;
      3-year follow-up period and a 6-month evaluation phase. For an individual patient, the&#xD;
      treatment time in arm A1 is 12 weeks for 6 cycles of MTX therapy, followed by a 4-7-week&#xD;
      resting period and then 6 weeks until the completion of WBI (arm A1). In arm A2, the patient&#xD;
      is irradiated (a total of 6 weeks) only in the case of recurrence. Up to that point, the&#xD;
      patient will be followed up in fixed intervals like those patients in A1 after WBI. In arm B,&#xD;
      MTX therapy is immediately followed by 6 weeks of WBI (arm B1) or the maximal 3 months of&#xD;
      AraC therapy. After completing the protocol of the planned therapy, all patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up for at least three years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically/immunocytologically confirmed primary non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
             lymphoma of the CNS. A central reference pathological report will be made on inclusion&#xD;
             into the study (Prof. Dr. Pietsch, Reference Center for Brain Tumors of the German&#xD;
             Society for Neuropathology and Neuroanatomy, Institute of Neuropathology of the Bonn&#xD;
             University Hospital). Histological diagnosis is usually performed by preferential&#xD;
             stereotactic biopsy of suspicious lesions in the brain or spinal cord. The diagnosis&#xD;
             from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) requires the detection of malignant lymphocytes&#xD;
             according to cytological and immunocytological criteria. There should be no more than&#xD;
             2 weeks between establishing the diagnosis and inclusion in the study. The&#xD;
             availability of the reference pathological report is not absolutely necessary for&#xD;
             inclusion in the study and beginning therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve with a peripheral granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500/µl and&#xD;
             thrombocyte count of &gt; 100,000/µl; bilirubin in the normal range; GOT of &lt; three times&#xD;
             the upper normal limit and adequate renal function with a creatinine clearance of &gt; 50&#xD;
             ml/min and serum creatinine in the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifestation of lymphoma outside of the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe diseases in other organs which would make performing intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
             impossible; Karnofsky index &gt; 50% due to previous diseases other than PCNSL. Karnofsky&#xD;
             &gt; 30 will be accepted only due to the PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment of PCNSL other than with corticosteroids, antiepileptics or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concomitant or previous malignant diseases in the last 5 years except for an&#xD;
             adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppression, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, or organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing chemotherapy for another disease&#xD;
