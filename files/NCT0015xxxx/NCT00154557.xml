  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Judo is one of the possible items in our country to win the first prize in Olympics. However,&#xD;
      scientific research in this field is not enough to support the coaches to train the athletes.&#xD;
      Series of research should be planned and executed to help the coaches and to promote the&#xD;
      performance of our athletes. This is the first step of the serial research. The purposes of&#xD;
      this study are: in the first year, to find the correlations between the&#xD;
      physiological/psychological competitive abilities of the second/third year athletes and their&#xD;
      performance/injury status. And, the physiological/ psychological competitive abilities of the&#xD;
      first year athletes will be collected in the beginning of this year. And then, their&#xD;
      performance/injury status will be followed through the whole year and to the end of the&#xD;
      second year monthly. The purposes of this study in the second year are to find the causation&#xD;
      of the physiological/ psychological competitive abilities in the first year with the&#xD;
      performance/injury status in the second year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this study are from 4 senior high schools in the north part of Taiwan which&#xD;
      performed well in national judo competition in senior high schools in the past years. The&#xD;
      study designs are both cross-sectional and prospective. In the part of the second/third year&#xD;
      athletes, it is a cross-sectional design, and in the part of the first year athletes, it is a&#xD;
      prospective design. The physiological status will be assessed with their general fitness and&#xD;
      balance. The fitness test includes body composition, strength, power, endurance, agility,&#xD;
      coordination, balance, flexibility, and cardiopulmonary capacity. The psychological&#xD;
      competitive abilities will be assessed with a questionnaire. Injury and the possible causes&#xD;
      will also be collected with a questionnaire monthly. Finally, the data will be analyzed with&#xD;
      descriptive analysis, chi-square test, t-test and regression analysis to show their&#xD;
      characteristics, correlations and causations.&#xD;
