      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint: to evaluate the clinical responses of vaccinated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoint: to evaluate the safety of this treatment and the immune responses&#xD;
           against CEA before and after the treatment&#xD;

      In this trial, we will immunize metastatic colorectal cancer patients with recombinant&#xD;
      CEA-pulsed DCs mixed with tetanus toxoid by subcutaneous injection. Low dose IL-2 will be&#xD;
      given subcutaneously following DC vaccination to boost the growth of T cells. We will adapt&#xD;
      &quot;Simon's optimal two-stage design&quot; for this study. In the first stage, we will treat 12&#xD;
      patients to evaluate the safety of this new protocol. If there are no severe toxicities/side&#xD;
      effects and there is at least one patient that had stable disease or better clinical&#xD;
      response, then we will proceed to the second stage and treat additional 25 patients. We will&#xD;
      follow the clinical outcome of these 37 patients. The immune responses against CEA before and&#xD;
      after vaccination will be examined.&#xD;
