      Rationale for the Use of ECP with UVADEX in Patients with HIV-1 Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that psoralen and ultraviolet A light inactivate HIV virus in&#xD;
      vitro. Edelson, et al, showed that extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) with psoralen&#xD;
      primarily targets the CD4+ cell, the population predominately affected by HIV-1 infection. It&#xD;
      is postulated that the re-infusion of the ECP treated cell fraction, free virus,&#xD;
      cell-associated virus along with whole cells, cell fragments, and soluble antigens, may serve&#xD;
      to engender a specific HIV immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A twenty-patient study using ECP with psoralen was conducted by Bisaccia, et al. In this&#xD;
      study, patients were HIV positive by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and these positive&#xD;
      results were confirmed by Western blot test. Patients were staged as Walter Reed class WR3 to&#xD;
      WR5. Extracorporeal photoimmune therapy was administered on two consecutive days on a monthly&#xD;
      basis for 6-29 months. This study reported that CD4 counts declined more slowly than&#xD;
      historical controls. Walter Reed classification improved in 55% (11/20), was stable in 35%&#xD;
      (7/20) and declined in 10% (2/20) of the patients treated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One measure in the &quot;in vivo&quot; evaluation of T-cell function is provided by skin reactivity to&#xD;
      recall antigens (DTH). A lack of this response has been associated with progression of HIV&#xD;
      disease. In the Bisaccia study, skin reactivity to recall antigens (DTH) improved in 55%&#xD;
      (11/20) patients, were stable in 35% (7/20), progressed to anergy in 5% (1/20). One patient&#xD;
      was initially anergic and remained anergic post-treatment. Following treatment with ECP, 60%&#xD;
      (9/15), displayed normal skin test responses, whereas the baseline examinations had been&#xD;
      normal in only 5% (1/19). In addition, 21% (4/19) of patients showed a partial skin test&#xD;
      response. Only 10% (2/20) of patients developed a new opportunistic infection. This included&#xD;
      the patient initially anergic and who remained anergic and the patient who progressed to&#xD;
      anergy post-ECP treatment.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION OF THE UVAR® XTSÔ PHOTOPHERESIS SYSTEM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photopheresis (or extracorporeal photoimmune therapy [ECP]) is a process developed by&#xD;
      THERAKOS, Inc., a Johnson and Johnson Company. During the process of ECP, whole blood is&#xD;
      drawn from the patient over several cycles, centrifuged and separated into the components of&#xD;
      plasma, white cells (or buffy coat), and red blood cells. A portion of the white cells and&#xD;
      the plasma are saved in a separate compartment. The remaining plasma and red blood cells are&#xD;
      immediately returned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saved buffy coat (white blood cells) and plasma are inoculated with the photosensitizing&#xD;
      agent UVADEX. Photoactivation begins when the suspension is exposed to a prescribed amount of&#xD;
      ultraviolet-A light. After photoactivation is complete, the treated suspension is returned to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photopheresis performed using the UVAR XTS is a continuous process. During the entire&#xD;
      therapy, the patient remains connected to the photopheresis instrument. The duration of time&#xD;
      between completion of the buffy coat collection and reinfusion of the light-activated buffy&#xD;
      coat is approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
