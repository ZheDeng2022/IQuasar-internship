      This Group of Genomic Research in Psychiatric Disorders (GENOP) located at the Department of&#xD;
      Psychiatry, College of Medicine and National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) had completed&#xD;
      a serial psychopathological study of schizophrenia (SCH) defined by DSM-IV criteria. The&#xD;
      results of this GENOP included: (1) delineating 2 to 3 subtypes of schizophrenia with&#xD;
      prospective follow-up validity; (2) finding a trait marker of impaired attention measured by&#xD;
      continuous performance test (CPT); (3) impaired executive function assess by Wisconsin Card&#xD;
      Sorting Test (WCST) and impaired inhibition of P50 evoked potential; (4) five dinucleotide&#xD;
      repeat polymorphism (DRP) markers in 5 different chromosomes with significant linkage scores,&#xD;
      including D1S251 at 1q42.1, D6S296 at 6p22 , D8S1222 at 8p14, and D15S976 at 15q14, and&#xD;
      D22S278 at 22q12; (5) finding a significant linkage of polymorphism marker located in a&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental gene NOTCH4 ( 6p22); and neurophysiological function related gene CHNRA7&#xD;
      (15q14); (6) successfully collected 700 multiplex families, collected by the collaboration&#xD;
      between of NTUH, Taiwan - NIMH, USA in the Taiwan Schizophrenia Genetic Linkage Study (TSLS)&#xD;
      project, with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia in Taiwan. A genome-wide scan&#xD;
      on this big sample will be completed recently in the laboratory of NIMH, U.S.A.. Around 300&#xD;
      families had also CPT data in the whole family. This is probably the biggest number of&#xD;
      multiplex families of a single ethnicity all over the world; (7) successfully setting up DNA&#xD;
      and cell banks as well as clinical data bank. This substantial long track of this GENOP&#xD;
      provided convincing background for this Positional Cloning Study on Schizophrenia (POCOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the controversial results of current linkage study on SCH world-wide, this&#xD;
      POCOS was designed to make a break through design in the study for locating and identifying&#xD;
      the vulnerability genes of SCH by using (1) phenomenological subtypes; (2) endophenotype&#xD;
      defined by impaired attention (CPT) and/or impaired executive function (WCST); (3) using&#xD;
      large enough size of samples of a single ethnicity of Taiwanese family pedigrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major research tasks include (1) Linkage analysis and quantitative trait loci analysis, in&#xD;
      collaboration with the team of Harvard Medical School, on the endophenotype defined by&#xD;
      impaired attention and impaired executive function in 300 families with at least two siblings&#xD;
      affected with SCH; (2) Two stages of genotyping, using High Throughput technology, of dense&#xD;
      SNP markers, around DRP markers with significant linkage scores in the NTUH and TSLS studies,&#xD;
      with average marker interval of 30kb in 3000 subjects of 700 multiplex families (a total of&#xD;
      300 markers) for linkage and quantitative trait loci analysis; (3) Two stages of study on the&#xD;
      polymorphisms and/or mutations of candidate genes using association study and TDT test. Each&#xD;
      stage with 10 Candidate Genes in the NTUH and TSLS project, respectively. In the first stage,&#xD;
      these are: (a) Neurodevelopmental related genes: DISC1, TRAX (1q42.1), NOTCH4 and TNF(6p21.3)&#xD;
      and NT-3; (b) Neurotransmitter receptor genes of CHNRA7 (15q14) and NMDA related to attention&#xD;
      impairment; (c) Neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme gene COMT (22q11.2) related to impaired&#xD;
      frontal lobe function; and (d) Pharmacology related genes of DRD3 and 5HTA2.&#xD;

      1. Specific Aims This component project of positional cloning study of schizophrenia&#xD;
           (POCOS) has two specific aims: (1) To locate and identify the vulnerability genes of the&#xD;
           phenomenological phenotype as well as the endophenotypes of schizophrenia (SCH) at&#xD;
           specific chromosome regions; (2) To find specific polymorphism of candidate genes&#xD;
           associated with endophenotypes and/or phenomenological phenotypes of schizophrenia.&#xD;
           These results will lead this POCOS team: (1) to develop new clinical diagnostic method&#xD;
           and new prevention program including pharmacological agent in early intervention&#xD;
           treatment of SCH for public health purpose; (2) to do functional genomic study on SCH;&#xD;
           (3) to study the pathogenetic process of abnormal genes in abnormal neuropsychological&#xD;
           and neurobiological functions of SCH; (4) to delineate the nature and the effect of&#xD;
           gene-environmental interaction in the etiology of SCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Up to the present time, all genome-wide scans for localization of vulnerability genes&#xD;
           revealed no consistent results. The difficulty of molecular genetic study on&#xD;
           schizophrenia is not the technology of molecular genetic study; It is the difficulty in&#xD;
           clinical recruitment of adequate samples. Small sample size, diagnostic uncertainty, and&#xD;
           multiple ethnicities of study samples were major reasons for this present unfruitful&#xD;
           condition. This POCOS is designed with a remarkable strength of sample characteristics:&#xD;
           (1) Using enough big sample size with DNA sample of around 700 families with at least&#xD;
           two schizophrenic siblings. This family sample assures adequate power for linkage&#xD;
           analysis and further positional cloning strategy, (2) Using standardized diagnostic&#xD;
           assessment method for diagnosis assessment, including the Diagnostic Interview for&#xD;
           Genetic Study (DIGS) and Medical Chart Records, (3) Using data of impaired attention and&#xD;
           executive function for defining endophenotype of SCH in 300 families with at least two&#xD;
           siblings affected with schizophrenia. These conditions make the design of this POCOS a&#xD;
           break through in current molecular genetic study of SCH nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypotheses to be tested are: (1) There are 3 to 5 vulnerability genes responsible&#xD;
           for phenomenological schizophrenia, defined by DSM-IV criteria, locating in chromosome&#xD;
           1q42, 6p22, 8p14, 15q14, 22q12 near markers DIS251, D6S296, D8S1222, D15S976, D22S278,&#xD;
           respectively; (2) One vulnerability gene is responsible for endophenotype of&#xD;
           schizophrenia, defined by impaired sustained attention assessed by continuous&#xD;
           performance test (CPT); This responsible vulnerability gene may be located at chromosome&#xD;
           15q14 near D15S976; (3) Different phenomenological subtypes of schizophrenia, including&#xD;
           negative subtype, and non-negative subtype may have different lod scores in linkage&#xD;
           analysis with specific genetic markers proposed in this study; (4) There are mutations&#xD;
           and/or polymorphisms in the introns and/or exons of the candidate genes associated with&#xD;
           the occurrence and/or specific subtypes of SCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and Significance. Schizophrenia (SCH) is as devastating and stigmatized&#xD;
           psychiatric disorder with brain pathology and high genetic loading. The patients usually&#xD;
           become dependent on the family with great social cost. To locate and identify the&#xD;
           vulnerability genes, to solve the social stigma, to design genetic counseling can bring&#xD;
           a revolutionary development in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Genomic Study on Schizophrenia（GEMS）comprises of two complimentary component projects to&#xD;
      do the positional cloning study on SCH (POCOS) and to do the psychological and genetic&#xD;
      counseling study (POGES) in the same pool of families recruited for study. This component&#xD;
      project ( NO.1), the POCOS is designed using a breakthrough approach to locate and identify&#xD;
      vulnerability genes. The project of POGES (NO.2) is a humanity study complimentary to&#xD;
      molecular genetic study and it is designed for exploring psychological issues related to&#xD;
      stigma and genetic counseling of this devastating disease of Human Being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Genetic Basis of Schizophrenia Genetic epidemiological studies revealed that SCH is&#xD;
           familial and the risk to first-degree relatives is approximately ten times the risk to&#xD;
           relatives of controls (Tsuang et al., 1980, 1995; Guze et al., 1983; Kendler 1988).&#xD;
           Monozygous twin pairs had concordance rates of 46%~53% and 14%~15% for dizygous twin&#xD;
           pairs (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993). The&#xD;
           heritability was around 0.7. However, the concordance rate in MZ twins is far from 100%,&#xD;
           the environmental factors should also be considered. The evidence of genetic&#xD;
           contribution to the etiology of SCHwas further supported by adoption study (Heston 1966;&#xD;
           Kety et al., 1968,1994; Kendler et al., 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Segregation analyses indicate that the model of multiple genes better fit the observed&#xD;
           patterns of schizophrenia in family studies than do single major locus model (Faraone&#xD;
           and Tsuang, 1985; Risch and Baron, 1984; Vogler et al., 1990). It was suggested that&#xD;
           several genes (3 to 5 in number) in epistasis might responsible for genetic etiology of&#xD;
           schizophrenia (Risch, 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia For linkage analysis, except the sex&#xD;
           chromosomes (Delisi and Crow, 1989), there is no a priori hypothesis to focus on any&#xD;
           given chromosomal region. The whole genome needs to be systemically screened. A few&#xD;
           genome-wide scans of SCH for the decade found that many chromosome regions had&#xD;
           suggestive evidences for linkage, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42, 2p22-q21,&#xD;
           4q24-q32, 6p24-p22, 6q16-q23, 8p24-p21, 10p14-p13, 13q14-q32, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q13 (Coon&#xD;
           et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1998; Levinson et al.1998; Blouin et al., 1998; Kaufmann et&#xD;
           al.1998; Faraone et al., 1998; Rees et al., 1999; Williams et al., 1999; Hovatta et al.,&#xD;
           1999; Brzustowicz et al., 2000). However, only a few chromosome regions were ever&#xD;
           reported to have genome-wide significant linkage evidences, including chromosome&#xD;
           1q21-q22 (Brzustowicz et al.,, 2000), 6p24-p22 (Wang et al., 1995), 8p21 (Blouin et al.,&#xD;
           1998), and 13q32 (Blouin et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another promising chromosome region is chromosome 1q 42. A balance translocation (1;&#xD;
           11)(q42.1; q14.3) was associated with major mental illness including schizophrenia in a&#xD;
           Scottish large family pedigree (St Clair et al., 1990). Two novel genes named DISC1&#xD;
           (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1) and DISC2 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 2) at chromosome&#xD;
           1q42.1 were disrupted at the breakpoint (Millar et al., 2000; 2001). This was confirmed&#xD;
           in a Finnish family sample (Hovatta et al., 1999) and another study (Ekelund et al.,&#xD;
           2001; Hwu et al, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All these studies have shown a replication and non-replication pattern (Riley 2000). For&#xD;
           detection of genes of modest effect in complex disorders, inadequate sample size and&#xD;
           mixed ethnicity were major methodological problems. It is argued at least 600 hundred&#xD;
           affected sib-pairs may be required for adequate power (Hauser et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Candidate genes studies revealed inconsistent results in the past decade.&#xD;
           Neurotransmitter related genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5), serotonin,&#xD;
           r-aminobutyric acid and Glutamate receptor genes had been studied using both association&#xD;
           and linkage studies and no consistent results obtained (Asherson et al., 1995, Breyler&#xD;
           et al, 1995; Hranilovic et al. 2000; Catalano et al., 1993, Serretti et al., 1999; Chen&#xD;
           ACH, 1996,1997). Neuron growth related genes (Margolis et al., 1994), phospholipase&#xD;
           genes (Peet, 1998, Wei 1998), and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3) (Dror et al.,&#xD;
           1999) have been reported association with schizophrenia. In case-control design, many&#xD;
           genes and phenotypes being evaluated and mixture of ethnicity in the sample may inflate&#xD;
           the type I errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategy may resolve the&#xD;
           above two problems raised by the approach of candidate gene association study basing&#xD;
           upon the previous linkage results to increase the prior probability and using&#xD;
           parent-offspring trios as internal control. This approach is more powerful than linkage&#xD;
           study to locate the susceptibility genes of complex disorder as schizophrenia (Risch and&#xD;
           Merikangas, 1996). With the fine mapping linkage evidences, the whole genome sequence&#xD;
           and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map, and the advancing microarray technique&#xD;
           available, this approach is more efficient to locate the susceptibility genes of&#xD;
           schizophrenia, (Owen et al., 2000; Baron 2001). Recently, a study using above strategy&#xD;
           has been reported significant linkage dysequilibrium evidence of schizophrenia to a&#xD;
           microsatellite polymorphism and a SNP of a gene, NOTCH4 gene, at chromosome 6p21 (Wei&#xD;
           and Hemmings, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering the importance of adequate power for linkage analysis and the potentials of&#xD;
           positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategies, we propose&#xD;
           this project to do positional cloning of vulnerability genes of schizophrenia. In this&#xD;
           stage, we have collected the DNA sample of around 700 families with at least two&#xD;
           schizophrenic siblings by our own efforts as well as through collaboration with Harvard&#xD;
           University in these four years, and this family sample assures adequate power for&#xD;
           linkage analysis and further positional cloning strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neuropsychological Deficit in Schizophrenia SCH was fond to have impairment in&#xD;
           neuropsychological functions of executive function, sustained attention and working&#xD;
           memory (Goldberg and Gold, 1995) and was due to frontostriatal dysfunction (Elliot et&#xD;
           al., 1995). Multiple impairment may be best demonstrated by test batteries, rather than&#xD;
           single, isolated test (Kremen et al., 1994) andthe impairments strongly suggested&#xD;
           dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit (Gold and Harvey, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual sustained attention by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and executive&#xD;
           function by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were studied more thoroughly. The&#xD;
           more difficult ones are stable vulnerability indicators, while the simpler ones might be&#xD;
           mediating vulnerability indicators in schizophrenia (Chen and Faraone, 2000). CPT&#xD;
           deficits were associated with negative symptoms (Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Hain et al.,&#xD;
           1993; Johnstone and Frith, 1996; Liu et al., 1997) and with thought disorder&#xD;
           (Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Strauss et al., 1993; Nelson et al., 1998) or disorganized&#xD;
           symptoms (Liu et al., 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Deficits in WCST performance were enduring and predicted long term disability,&#xD;
           independent of other cognitive deficits (Weinberger et al., 1986; Goldberg et al.,&#xD;
           1988). WCST deficits were found to be related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
           (Weinberger et al., 1986; Berman et al., 1995) and that the dopamimetic drugs improves&#xD;
           its performance (Daniel et al., 1991; Mattay et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
           These deficits, being found to be specific to SCH and with genetic risk of SCH, can thus&#xD;
           serve as endophenotypes in genetic analysis on SCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To resolve the&#xD;
           insufficient power of analyses and genetic heterogeneity of SCH, an alternative strategy&#xD;
           was to use of a specific neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an&#xD;
           endophenotype reflecting the effect of a single genetic alteration (Lander, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPT deficit was a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and&#xD;
      Faraone, 2000). It was present not only in SCH patients, but also in their non-psychotic&#xD;
      relatives (Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998). Using data from 148&#xD;
      non-psychotic relatives and 345 community adults, Chen et al. (1998) found that the&#xD;
      recurrence risk ratio λwas greater than 15 for the undegraded CPT and greater than 30 for the&#xD;
      degraded CPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, using CPT deficits as endophenotypes of SCH would provide a valuable measure of genetic&#xD;
      risk, would improve the power of genetic analyses and may help identify susceptibility genes&#xD;
      for schizophrenia. In our sample, around 220 families have received CPT and WCST assessment.&#xD;
      We intent to add 80 families with CPT and WCST data, and to make a 300 of families with&#xD;
      available data for endophenotype study. It is feasible to use these endophenotypes for&#xD;
      further genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological deficit of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14, recently. The&#xD;
      genome-wide linkage analysis of the P50 inhibition deficit in nine multiplex SCH families&#xD;
      found a significant lod score (Z = 5.30,  = 0) at a loci chromosome 15q14. When the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of SCH was used as the affected phenotype, the maximum lod score at the same marker&#xD;
      was not statistically significant (Freedman et al., 1997). The other neurobiological deficit,&#xD;
      eye-tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the&#xD;
      maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02. Again, while the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia&#xD;
      was used as the affected phenotype, the linkage result was non-significant (Arolt et al.,&#xD;
      1996). In summary, with the endophenotype approach using sustained attention deficits and the&#xD;
      adequate power our sample provides, we have confidences in the breakthrough of the searching&#xD;
      for vulnerability genes of SCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Collection of Schizophrenia Co-affected Sibpairs Family The P.I. has been committed&#xD;
      himself in collecting the schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs family since 1990. With the&#xD;
      awareness of the importance and critical necessity of diagnostic assessment, these probands,&#xD;
      co-affected sib and available non-affected sib as well as the parents were assessed with a&#xD;
      semi-structured psychiatrist diagnostic interview (Hwu 1991a) using diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
      DSM-III-R and/or DSM-IV. Besides, under the evolutionary theoretical model of psychopathology&#xD;
      (Hwu 1985, 1992), developmental data were also collected. All these clinical data and&#xD;
      family-tree data were established in the data bank of the molecular genetic laboratory&#xD;
      (DBMGL) in the Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University&#xD;
      under the auspice of the P.I. In total, there are around 120 schizophrenia co-affected&#xD;
      sib-pairs families available for linkage analysis in the DBMGL. As a rule, the DNA samples&#xD;
      were obtained from the peripheral white cells of all available subjects of the family,&#xD;
      especially the co-affected sibs, at least one non-affected sib and the parents. In total,&#xD;
      around 1000 DNA samples were in the DBMGL. Cell-lines of EBV-958 transformed lymphoblast&#xD;
      cells were established too. All these study subjects were well informed for this study and&#xD;
      informed consent obtained. All families participated in this study were invited to join a &quot;&#xD;
      New-Hope Family Club&quot; for periodic meeting and discussion. Around 150 schizophrenia cases who&#xD;
      received detail clinical assessment and regular follow-up and comprehensive&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment, including CPT, WCST, WAIS-R, and WMS, were recruited for&#xD;
      obtaining DNA samples. Around 200 normal control subjects were also recruited for obtaining&#xD;
      DNA samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-year nation-wide collaborative work with Harvard University in Taiwan (Taiwan&#xD;
      Schizophrenia Linkage Study, TSLS), sponsored by the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect families with&#xD;
      co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia has been completed. 560 families have been&#xD;
      recruited. A total of 600 families will be recruited in this year. DNA samples, cell-lines&#xD;
      and clinical data of DIGS, FIGS were collected. Around 220 families received&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation. (CPT and WCST).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia Our molecular genetic studies of&#xD;
           schizophrenia were supported by three consecutive projects: the molecular genetic&#xD;
           project sponsored by the National Science Council (1989-1992), the molecular genetic&#xD;
           project of MPGRP (1993-1998) and the molecular genetic project of MPSS (1998-2001)&#xD;
           sponsored by NHRI. The early phase (1989-1992) of this molecular genetic project focused&#xD;
           on establishing laboratory facilities and collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair&#xD;
           families. The 2nd phase of this molecular genetic project (1993-1998) continued the&#xD;
           collection of families, and the collection was extended to collect the co-affected&#xD;
           bipolar sib-pairs, schizophrenic cases and normal controls. We found the polymorphism of&#xD;
           androgen receptor gene of (CAG)n had a probable association with schizophrenia (Hwu et&#xD;
           al., 1995). This finding supported the finding of DeLisi et al (1994). The molecular&#xD;
           genetic methods of linkage analysis and candidate gene association were promoted, this&#xD;
           laboratory of the P.I. (Dr. Hwu) moved to emphasize in this area too. The results of&#xD;
           this laboratory were: (1) The polymorphism of (48bp) repeats in DRD4 receptor gene was&#xD;
           not significantly linked with schizophrenia (Hong et al., 1998); (2) A single mutation&#xD;
           in DRD2 was found not to be associated with schizophrenia (Chen et al.,1996) (3) The&#xD;
           samples of the data bank of this project had joined three international collaboration&#xD;
           studies using positional cloning approach which need relatively large sample. The one is&#xD;
           organized by Gill et al (1996) entitled as &quot;Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage Group&quot;,&#xD;
           another was led by Dr. Moises (1995) in Kiel University, Germany and the third one is&#xD;
           with Dr. Powell in London (Lin et al., 1995). All these results revealed the possible&#xD;
           markers in chromosomes 6p, 11q, 13q, 19q and 22q. This suggests that Taiwanese patients&#xD;
           may have possible susceptibility genes in these regions, except chromosome 13q (Lin et&#xD;
           al., 1995), fitting an oligogenetic model. (4) The association study on 5-HT2 receptor&#xD;
           gene located on chromosome 13q was found to be negative; (5) Clinical epidemiological&#xD;
           analysis using co-affected sib-pairs demonstrated the tendency of 3 independent symptom&#xD;
           clusters of reality disorganization, disorganization and negative state (Hwu et al.,&#xD;
           1997); (6) Weak linkage evidence to loci at chromosome 6p24-22 (Hwu et al.,2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 3rd phase of the molecular genetic study (1998-2001) continued focusing at&#xD;
           collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair families and linkage analysis on reported&#xD;
           suggestive evidences of chromosome regions, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42,&#xD;
           6p21, 8p24-p21, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q14. The linkage results were (1) suggestive evidence&#xD;
           of linkage for schizophrenia with and without the negative symptoms on chromosome 6p24&#xD;
           and 22q12 (Lin et al., 1999a) (2) no linkage evidence of GABAA receptor α1 (GABRA1), β1&#xD;
           (GABRB1) andβ3 (GABAB3) subunit gene with schizophrenia (Lin et al., 1999b) (3) no&#xD;
           linkage evidence of Glutamate GluR5 and GluR6 receptor gene with schizophrenia (Lin et&#xD;
           al., 1999c) (4) no linkage evidence of SCA1 gene with schizophrenia (Liu et al., 2001a)&#xD;
           (5) suggestive linkage evidence on marker (D8s1222) of chromosome 8p with schizophrenia&#xD;
           (NPL Z score = 2.58, p=0.005) (Hwu et al., 2001a) (6) suggestive linkage evidence of&#xD;
           marker (D1s251) of chromosome 1q31-42 with schizophrenia (NPL Z score = 2.18, p=0.01)&#xD;
           (Hwu et al., 2001b), The marker is located near the DISC1 candidate gene. (7) suggestive&#xD;
           linkage evidence of marker (D15s976) on 15q13-14 with schizophrenia (NPL Z score = 3.33,&#xD;
           p=0.0003) (Liu et al., 2001b). (8) no linkage evidence of schizophrenia to loci at&#xD;
           chromosome 1q21-22 (Liu et al., 2001c). (9) Suggestive linkage to NOTCH4 gene locus at&#xD;
           chromosome 6p21.3 (NPL Z score = 2.79, p=0.002) (Hwu et al. 2001c). The candidate gene&#xD;
           approach has revealed the following results: (1) possible association between Dopamine&#xD;
           D4 receptor (DRD4) gene polymorphism with quick treatment response of schizophrenia (Liu&#xD;
           et al., 2001d). (2) no association between cytosolic phospholipase A2 (c-PLA2) gene&#xD;
           polymorphism and schizophrenia (Liu et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Studies on Neuropsychological Deficits in Schizophrenia We found impaired sustained&#xD;
           attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of schizophrenia.&#xD;
           Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured by the CPT&#xD;
           are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia (Chen and Faraone, 2000). The results are:&#xD;
           (1) a substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands&#xD;
           (19-34%) have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance&#xD;
           (Chen et al., 1998a); (2) subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit&#xD;
           CPT deficits, which are specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy.&#xD;
           (Chen et al., 1998b); (3) CPT deficits are present in schizophrenic patients, are&#xD;
           particularly associated with negative and disorganized symptoms, and those with more&#xD;
           difficult CPT versions are not amenable to neuroleptic treatment (Liu et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specificity of CPT was studied (Liu et al., 2000) in a group of schizophrenia&#xD;
           patients (n=41) in contrast to the group of bipolar patients with psychotic symptoms&#xD;
           (n=46) and the group of bipolar patients without psychotic symptoms (n=22) and a group&#xD;
           of patients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder (n=22). It was found that CPT&#xD;
           deficits are stable vulnerable indicators of schizophrenia, mediating vulnerability&#xD;
           indicators for bipolar disorder, and state-dependent indicator for major depression.&#xD;
           These results demonstrate that CPT deficits are valid trait marker of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Studies on Clinical Heterogeneity of Schizophrenia In the field of psychiatry, clinical&#xD;
           psychopathological background is crucial for molecular genetic studies. The principal&#xD;
           investigator (HGH) had developed an evolutionary psychopathological theoretical model&#xD;
           for descriptive as well as neurobiological studies. The complete work of the descriptive&#xD;
           psychopathological study on schizophrenia was published [Schizophrenia: a descriptive&#xD;
           psychopathology, 1999 ISBN 957-9201-21-8, Taipei, Chu-ching Publishing Company]. The&#xD;
           clinical heterogeneity issue has been approached by a novel statistical method using&#xD;
           graphic plotting technology (Chen, 1999) based on PANSS rating scale. Two (Hwu et al,&#xD;
           2001) or three (Hwu et al, 2001) subtypes of schizophrenia were delineated and validated&#xD;
           by follow-up and neuropsychological data such as attention impairment (CPT). Through&#xD;
           two-year follow-up, the symptom patterns of schizophrenic patients were stable (Hwu et&#xD;
           al, 2001). This confirms the subtyping efforts in schizophrenia using phenomenological&#xD;
           symptom patterns. These data suggest the possible fruitfulness of genetic linkage study&#xD;
           on schizophrenia considering the phenomenological subtypes as well as endophenotypes in&#xD;
           linkage as well as association studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, all these preliminary data reveal that the DNA sample, clinical and&#xD;
      endophenotype data have been well prepared in this POCOS program. The PI and his team are&#xD;
      experienced in performing the laboratory work and further genetic analysis in this project.&#xD;
