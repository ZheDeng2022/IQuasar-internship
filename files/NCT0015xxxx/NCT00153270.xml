      The purpose of this study is to determine whether antiepileptic drug sodium valproate is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of chronic asthma.&#xD;

      Effective therapy of asthma still remains quite serious problem. According GINA definition,&#xD;
      asthma is an inflammatory disorder. Consequently, modern pharmacotherapy of asthma provides&#xD;
      wide use of anti-inflammatory drugs. But asthma also is a paroxysmal disorder: many&#xD;
      specialists and even some guidelines underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. Besides&#xD;
      this, according to some authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma&#xD;
      mechanism. But some other neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal disorders exist, and they are&#xD;
      migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. Some antiepileptic drugs, like carbamazepine and&#xD;
      valproate, are very effective in therapy of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia - more than in&#xD;
      80% of cases. If bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal inflammatory disease, like migraine and&#xD;
      trigeminal neuralgia, it is possible that some antiepileptic drugs also are very effective in&#xD;
      asthma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of sodium&#xD;
      valproate efficacy in therapy of bronchial asthma. Sodium Valproate is antiepileptic drug of&#xD;
      new generation, initially produced by Sanofi Pharma. Comparison: Patients received&#xD;
      investigational drug in addition to their usual routine antiasthmatic treatment, compared to&#xD;
      patients received placebo in addition to their usual routine antiasthmatic treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have given their informed consent before commencing the procedures&#xD;
             specified in the protocol, indicating that they understand the objectives of the study&#xD;
             and are willing to adhere to the procedures described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient aged between 16 and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Out patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non smokers or ex-smokers, having stopped smoking &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an established (i.e. at least one year) clinical history of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of long-term remissions of asthma (lasting more than 1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled asthma, due to various reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% from initial level after 400 mcg&#xD;
             salbutamol inhalation (4 puffs of salbutamol MDI, 100 mcg per puff). Patients whose&#xD;
             FEV1 reversibility was 12% within the past 12 months are acceptable, providing that&#xD;
             the records are available to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to swallow capsules, able to understand and complete diary cards and to&#xD;
             record their PEFR using a peak-flow meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Long-term history of smoking (3 years and more)&#xD;
&#xD;

             immunologic, endocrine, infection or other diseases or dysfunctions if they are&#xD;
             clinically significant. A clinically significant disease is defined as one which in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study&#xD;
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
