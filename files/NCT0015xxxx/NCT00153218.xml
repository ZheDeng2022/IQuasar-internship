  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe clinical outcomes of metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      patients whose tumors overexpress the Her2neu protein and are being treated with trastuzumab&#xD;
      (Herceptin)either alone or combination with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, patients with metastatic breast cancer are being treated either with&#xD;
      trastuzumab alone or trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy as it&#xD;
      has shown to increase survival. There is currently minimal information as to how long&#xD;
      trastuzumab should be given after disease progresses on trastuzumab. This study is a chart&#xD;
      review of the above-mentioned population which will capture information such as;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what chemo or hormonal therapies are chosen by clinicians for Her-2 positive metastatic&#xD;
           patients to combine with trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what the number of treatment regimens are (chemo or hormonal) given with trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what the clinical outcome of patients treated is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what happens to the patients cardiac status with long term administration of trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what treatment patterns exist in the management of central nervous system metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to generate a hypotheses that can be tested from the information collected&#xD;
      after is has been analyzed to give clinicians further meaningful data to guide treatment&#xD;
      decisions beyond treatment progression.&#xD;
