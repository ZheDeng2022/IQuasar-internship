      Based on the neurophysiology, it is well known that sympathetic nerves control the&#xD;
      ejaculatory function and bladder neck closure. In contrast, the parasympathetic nerves&#xD;
      control penile erection and bladder wall contraction. Because of the difference in cultural&#xD;
      background of the patients and training background of the physicians between Western and&#xD;
      Oriental Countries, the Western people did not believe in the efficacy of wide pelvic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy. In the Oriental countries, due to the shortage of standardized facilities,&#xD;
      treatment protocol, and manpower, the concurrent preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CCRT)&#xD;
      of American style is currently not widely accepted. Therefore, the advantage and disadvantage&#xD;
      of these two treatment modalities for advanced rectal cancers need be further clarified. In&#xD;
      this project, we plan to randomly assign the patients into two groups: (1) concurrent&#xD;
      preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) + conventional surgery group; (2) wide pelvic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy group. Thereafter, we plan to evaluate: (1) the anorectal function by&#xD;
      anorectal manometry and colonic transit time using radioopaque markers; (2) the micturition&#xD;
      function using urodynamic study; (3) the penile erection by RigiScan; and (4) the ejaculatory&#xD;
      function by clinical interview of the patients. Moreover, the various clinicopathologic&#xD;
      factors, including the depth of tumor invasion and the status of lymph node invasion, were&#xD;
      recorded in detail according to the guidelines recommended by the Japanese Society of&#xD;
      Coloproctology. Furthermore, we will evaluate the oncological results for these patients.&#xD;

      This project is in continuation of our previous study (NTUH92-S044) and is focused on the&#xD;
      comparison of the advantage and disadvantage of the following two treatment modalities: (1)&#xD;
      preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (CCRT) followed by conventional surgery; (2) the&#xD;
      Japanese-style of wide pelvic lymphadenectomy, for the treatment of potentially operable&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer. It is well-known that the keypoint for the surgical treatment&#xD;
      of rectal cancer is to achieve a balance between 'radical resection of the tumor' and&#xD;
      'functional preservation for the pelvic organs'. Primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum is&#xD;
      generally characterized by localized and comparatively slow-growing, as compared to the&#xD;
      fast-growing tumors of other gastrointestinal malignancies. Thus, extended systemic pelvic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy has been considered the best choice for cure. However, there is major&#xD;
      difference of concept between the Western and Oriental colorectal surgeons regarding the&#xD;
      appropriate extent of lymphadenectomy for the treatment of rectal cancers lying below the&#xD;
      peritoneal reflection. Theoretically, there are two major pathways for the lymphatic drainage&#xD;
      of lower rectal cancers: one is upward to the root of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA); the&#xD;
      other is along the middle hemorrhoidal artery to the obturator fossa. Because the American&#xD;
      people tend to be very fatty and the pelvic lymphadenectomy is difficult to perform, most&#xD;
      rectal cancer patients receive conventional limited resection combined with aggressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy and pelvic irradiation. In contrast, because the Oriental people are thinner and&#xD;
      pelvic lymphadenectomy is easier to perform, and most important of all, the Japanese surgeons&#xD;
      were very meticulous in cancer surgery, the extended pelvic lymphadenectomy has become the&#xD;
      routine procedure for the advanced lower rectal cancer in Japan. However, extended pelvic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy can inevitably cause the autonomic nerve damage, which thereafter result in&#xD;
      the disturbance of micturition and sexual function. To overcome this genitourinary&#xD;
      complication, the Japanese surgeon developed the autonomic nerve-sparing surgery. Generally&#xD;
      speaking, pelvic autonomic nerves consist of sympathetic signals via the paired hypogastric&#xD;
      nerves and paired sacral splanchnic nerves, and the parasympathetic signals via the pelvic&#xD;
      splanchnic nerves. The sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers intermingled with each other to&#xD;
      form the pelvic plexus, which is located at the lateral side of the lateral ligament. Pelvic&#xD;
      plexus then send the composite autonomic signals to innervate distal rectum and genitourinary&#xD;
      organs. Thus, the injury of autonomic nerve can reflect the functional disorder of the&#xD;
      anorectum and genitourinary organs. Based on the neurophysiology, it is well known that&#xD;
      sympathetic nerves control the ejaculatory function and bladder neck closure. In contrast,&#xD;
      the parasympathetic nerves control penile erection and bladder wall contraction. Because of&#xD;
      the difference in cultural background of the patients and training background of the&#xD;
      physicians between Western and Oriental Countries, the Western people did not believe in the&#xD;
      efficacy of wide pelvic lymphadenectomy. In the Oriental countries, due to the shortage of&#xD;
      standardized facilities, treatment protocol, and manpower, the concurrent preoperative&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) of American style is currently not widely accepted. Therefore,&#xD;
      the advantage and disadvantage of these two treatment modalities for advanced rectal cancers&#xD;
      need be further clarified. In this project, we plan to randomly assign the patients into two&#xD;
      groups: (1) concurrent preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) + conventional surgery&#xD;
      group; (2) wide pelvic lymphadenectomy group. Thereafter, we plan to evaluate: (1) the&#xD;
      anorectal function by anorectal manometry and colonic transit time using radioopaque markers;&#xD;
      (2) the micturition function using urodynamic study ; (3) the penile erection by RigiScan;&#xD;
      and (4) the ejaculatory function by clinical interview of the patients. Moreover, the various&#xD;
      clinicopathologic factors, including the depth of tumor invasion and the status of lymph node&#xD;
      invasion, were recorded in detail according to the guidelines recommended by the Japanese&#xD;
      Society of Coloproctology. Furthermore, we will evaluate the oncological results for these&#xD;
      patients. There are 2 characteristics for this project: (1) This is a randomized, prospective&#xD;
      study which has not been conducted in the literature; (2) The functional evaluation is&#xD;
      conducted in an objective way which is different from the reported series based only on the&#xD;
      subjective patient interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the conduction of our precious project (NTU 92-S044), we found that the response rate&#xD;
      of locally advanced rectal cancer after CCRT is satisfactory. The response rate is even more&#xD;
      increased after the addition of oxaliplatin to the traditional regimen of 5-Fu plus&#xD;
      leucovorin. However, there was no significance patients between these 2 allocated groups of&#xD;
      patients in terms of genitourinary dysfunction. These preliminary data need be further&#xD;
      testified by accrual of more patients with longer time of follow-up. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      mandatory for us to further perform this project. We believe that this study will provide a&#xD;
      new balance point between the 'radical resection' and the 'functional preservation' for&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
