  <brief_summary>

      The RENEWAL 3 AVT device is designed to treat patients suffering from HF, with a history of&#xD;
      or at risk of developing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
    </textblock>

      A clinical evaluation to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm that there are no adverse interactions when Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia (ICD),&#xD;
           Heart Failure (HF) and Atrial Tachyarrhythmia (AT) therapies are combined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia (ICD)&#xD;
           therapy is delivered in the presence of atrial therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of atrial therapies in a heart failure&#xD;
           population&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet the following criteria should be given consideration for inclusion in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Meet all device indications and contraindications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and capable of providing informed consent, undergoing a device implant,&#xD;
             participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an&#xD;
             approved clinical investigational center and at the intervals defined by this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prescribed to stable optimal pharmacologic therapy for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL obtained no more than two weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and&#xD;
             national law&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Geographically stable residents who are available for follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide documented evidence of one or more episodes of AF/AT within 12 months&#xD;
             of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Guidant recommends anticoagulation therapy per physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who will be excluded from the investigation are those who meet any one of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;

             transplant within the next six months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an atrial tachyarrhythmia that is permanent (i.e., does not terminate&#xD;
             spontaneously and cannot be terminated with medical intervention) within 180 days&#xD;
