      This project entitled &quot;A Study on Risk Mutations of the Vulnerability Genes of Schizophrenia&quot;&#xD;
      (RIGOS) is a continuous effort following the well founded and arduous work of genetic study&#xD;
      on schizophrenia (SCH) by the Genomic Psychiatry Study Group (GENOP) of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital. So far the GENOP has established several important data banks, including&#xD;
      DNA bank and lymphoblastoid (EVB transformed) cell bank of 725 affected sib-pair SCH&#xD;
      families, 200 Trio SCH families, and 150 normal controls; and the clinical database of serial&#xD;
      follow-ups. An ongoing project, Positional Cloning Study on the Vulnerability Genes of SCH&#xD;
      (POCOS), carried out by the GENOP has found 11 candidate vulnerability genes with identified&#xD;
      expression in the brain. Besides, on the basis of two related projects, the Multiple&#xD;
      Psychopathological Study of SCH (MPSS) and the Etiological Study on SCH (SEFOS), the GENOP&#xD;
      has established endophotype indicators for schizophrenia in neuropsychological and&#xD;
      neurophysiological domains. The GENOP, a multidisciplinary research team, is thus ready to&#xD;
      search for risk mutations of the candidate vulnerability genes for schizophrenia in this new&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic strategy of this RIGOS Project is to search for risk mutations, based on&#xD;
      case-control design with sufficient statistical power, and then to validate these risk&#xD;
      mutations by convergent evidence of genetic epidemiological analyses, functional variation&#xD;
      studies using in vitro cell line experiments, microarray study, and neurophysiological study&#xD;
      (PPI) on mice model. Thus, this RIGOS Project has integrated 5 lines of experimental designs&#xD;
      to achieve 5 specific aims to identify and validate the risk mutations from 11 candidate&#xD;
      vulnerability genes found in the ongoing POCOS project based on Taiwanese Sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are confident to be at the frontier work of searching for the risk mutations, with&#xD;
      functional validity, of SCH. The achievement of the RIGOS will be a mile stone to create new&#xD;
      era of genetic functional study to tackle pathophysiological mechanism of SCH and will be the&#xD;
      basis of developing novel diagnostic method and novel intervention method at the early stage&#xD;
      of SCH in the future.&#xD;

      4a. Specific Aims. In our previous work based on a Taiwanese sample, we have found that&#xD;
      schizophrenia was significantly associated with 11 candidate genes, including GNPAT (1q42.1),&#xD;
      DISC1 (1q42.1), MRDS1 (6p24.3), NOTCH4 (6p21.3), NRG1 (8p21-p12), DAAO (12q22), G72 (13q32),&#xD;
      CHRNA7 (15q14), PRODH (22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12). In this 3-year proposal,&#xD;
      we have 5 specific aims, in which aim 1 is a continuation of our previous study of the&#xD;
      Positional Cloning Study of SCH (POCOS) using family data, while aims 2 to 5 are newly&#xD;
      developed research goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To investigate tighter association of these 11 candidate vulnerability genes&#xD;
      with different subtypes defined by clinical or endophenotype variables. The endophenotype&#xD;
      variables include the neuropsychological functions of sustained attention measured by&#xD;
      continuous performance test (CPT), executive function measured by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test&#xD;
      (WSCT) and the skin physiological function of niacin flushing responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that schizophrenia is genetically heterogeneous and the&#xD;
      specific risk SNP markers or specific risk SNPs haplotypes of different candidate genes will&#xD;
      be associated with specific clinical subtype or specific endophenotype indicators with higher&#xD;
      degree of statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To search for functional risk mutations of these candidate genes using direct&#xD;
      sequencing technique, and to investigate the contributing genetic variance of the specific&#xD;
      risk mutations in specific subtypes of schizophrenia, as mentioned in specific Aim 1, using&#xD;
      case-control study design. The interaction effects of these functional risk mutations will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that there are several specific risk mutations from 11&#xD;
      candidate genes. The contributing variances of these different risk mutations will be&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To find the variation of functional expressions of these identified risk&#xD;
      mutations in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patient&#xD;
      subjects, and neuronal cell-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that these candidate genes have expression discriminations when carrying risk&#xD;
      mutations, which will be able to be detected from EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells of&#xD;
      these patients and neuronal cell-lines or from constructed reporter gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To explore and clarify the candidate genes responsible for the impaired&#xD;
      niacin skin flushing response in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that difference in the skin niacin flushing response will reveals difference&#xD;
      in the gene expression in the lymphocytes using microarray approach based on a matched case-&#xD;
      control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: To establish a procedure to assess the prepulse inhibition function (PPI) in&#xD;
      normal mice as the endophenotype indicator of schizophrenia, and test its validity with acute&#xD;
      or chronic administration of amphetamine. This animal model will serve further functional&#xD;
      study on the knock-out or knock-down mice carrying these identified risk mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that acute or chronic administration of amphetamine will block&#xD;
      PPI in wild-type mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will explore during the conducting of this proposal the following&#xD;
      feasibilities: (1) To obtain human brain tissues for studying the functional expressions of&#xD;
      these vulnerability genes with specific risk mutations; (2) To employ the animal model to&#xD;
      assess neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying the functional risk&#xD;
      mutations; (3) To explore novel treatment for preventing the abnormal neurobiological process&#xD;
      due to the risk mutations; and (4)To develop early detection and early intervention program,&#xD;
      including genetic counseling, based on the data of risk mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Research Plan (continuation) 4b. Background and Significance. Schizophrenia (SCH) is a&#xD;
      devastating and stigmatized psychiatric disorder with high genetic loading. The&#xD;
      identification of vulnerability genes of SCH is at dawn nowadays. As the vulnerability genes&#xD;
      and the specific risk mutations are identified, there will come the revolutionary development&#xD;
      in SCH research and clinical practice, including reliable and valid diagnosis based on&#xD;
      genetic and related neurobiological data, novel treatment and early prevention of&#xD;
      schizophrenia based on the knowledge of abnormal gene function and its interaction with the&#xD;
      environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Genomic Psychiatry Study Group (GENOP), a multidisciplinary team of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital, has been successfully operating in studying genetic factors in the&#xD;
      psychopathology of SCH. This GENOP has carried out the positional cloning study on&#xD;
      vulnerability genes of Schizophrenia (POCOS), supported by NRPGM in these 3 years, and has&#xD;
      found 11 candidates vulnerability genes through dense SNP fine mapping study. This GENOP also&#xD;
      have a thorough neurobiological and clinical psychopathological study (Hwu et al., 2002; Chen&#xD;
      et al., 1998; Chiu et al., 2004; Hsieh et al., 2004; Hwu, 1999; Hwu et al., 2003). Thus, the&#xD;
      GENOP is ready to take a step further to search for risk mutations of SCH as proposed here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conclude that the finding of vulnerability genes for schizophrenia is at dawn based on the&#xD;
      following lines of empirical evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Genetic Epidemiological Study SCH is a highly heritable disease, based on family, twin&#xD;
           (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993) and adoption&#xD;
           (Heston 1966; Kety et al., 1968, 1994; Kendler et al., 1994) studies with an&#xD;
           heritability of 0.70 (Tsuang et al., 1980, 1995; Guze et al., 1983; Kendler, 1988) and a&#xD;
           λ, risk to first-degree relatives versus controls, value of 10 (Kendler KS, 1983;&#xD;
           Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993; Chang et al., 2002). An oligogenetic&#xD;
           model of SCH etiology was commonly accepted (Faraone and Tsuang, 1985; Risch and Baron,&#xD;
           1984; Vogler et al., 1990, Risch, 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia 2-1. Linkage Analyses Genome-wide scans of&#xD;
           SCH for the decade found that many chromosome regions had suggestive evidence for&#xD;
           linkage (Coon et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1998; Levinson et al.1998; Blouin et al., 1998;&#xD;
           Kaufmann et al.1998; Faraone et al., 1998; Rees et al., 1999; Williams et al., 1999;&#xD;
           Hovatta et al., 1999; Brzustowicz et al., 2000), whereas subsequent studies revealed a&#xD;
           replication and non-replication pattern (Riley, 2000). Inadequate sample size and mixed&#xD;
           ethnicity might be the major methodological problems (Altmuller et al., 2001, Hauser et&#xD;
           al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-2. Candidate chromosome region approach A balance translocation (1; 11) (q42.1; q14.3)&#xD;
           was found to be associated with major mental illness including schizophrenia (St Clair&#xD;
           et al., 1990). The novel gene DISC1 at chromosome 1q42.1 was repeatedly found to have&#xD;
           significant association with SCH, including our Taiwanese samples (Millar et al., 2000;&#xD;
           2001; Hovatta et al., 1999; Ekelund et al., 2001; Hwu et al, 2001; Ekelund et al., 2004,&#xD;
           Liu YL et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-3. Candidate gene approach Many candidate genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, and&#xD;
           D5), serotonin, and glutamate receptor genes, based on psychopharmacological hypothesis&#xD;
           (Asherson et al., 1995, Breyler et al, 1995; Hranilovic et al. 2000; Catalano et al.,&#xD;
           1993, Serretti et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1996, 1997), as well as developmental- and&#xD;
           physiological-based genes such as neuron growth related genes (Margolis et al., 1994),&#xD;
           phospholipase genes (Peet, 1998, Wei 1998), and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3)&#xD;
           (Dror et al., 1999), have been reported to have association, though not consistently,&#xD;
           with schizophrenia. The mixture of ethnicity in the sample may inflate the type I&#xD;
           errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-4. Association study using SNP fine mapping and family internal control method By&#xD;
           genetic epidemiological guideline such as using linkage disequilibrium strategy and&#xD;
           parent-offspring trios as internal control to guide the improved method to locate the&#xD;
           susceptibility genes of complex disorder (Risch and Merikangas, 1996; Owen et al., 2000;&#xD;
           Baron 2001), there were about 10 candidate genes found by using this modality of study&#xD;
           approach (Elkin et al., 2004). These candidate genes included RGS4 (1q) (Mirnics et al.,&#xD;
           2001), MRDS1 (6p24.3), DTNBP1 (6p22.3) (Straub et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2003; van Den&#xD;
           Bogaert et al., 2003; van den Oord et al., 2003) , TNFa (6p22) (Boin et al., 2001; Pae&#xD;
           et al., 2003), NOTCH4 (6p21.3) (Wei and Hemmings, 2000; Fan et al., 2002; Sklar et al.,&#xD;
           2001; Skol et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2003), PPP3CC (8p21.3) (Gerber et al., 2003),&#xD;
           NRG1(8p21-p12)( Stefansson et al., 2002; 2003;Yang et al., 2003) , DAAO(12q22) (Chumakov&#xD;
           et al., 2002), G72(13q33) (Chumakov et al., 2002), CHRNA7(15q14) (Leonard S et al.,&#xD;
           2002) , PRODH(22q11.21) (Liu et al., 2002; Jacquet et al., 2002) , COMT(22q11.21)&#xD;
           (Shifman et al., 2002). Nevertheless, all these candidate genes still wait to be&#xD;
           replicated in different study samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The GENOP of NTUH, by using dense SNP fine mapping method, have found that 8 significant&#xD;
           candidate genes of MRDS1(6p24.3), NOTCH4(6p21.3), NRG1(8p21-p12), DAAO(12q22),&#xD;
           G72(13q32), and PRODH(22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12) (Liu et al., 2004).&#xD;
           This research team is thus ready to take a step further to search for the risk mutations&#xD;
           of these candidate genes and the validation study of these risk mutations. Based on the&#xD;
           meta-analysis of published studies, Altmuller et al (2001) and Risch et al.(2000)&#xD;
           suggested that high density SNP association analysis in combination with functional&#xD;
           genomic data may be necessary to detect susceptibility loci (which may be of small&#xD;
           effect) for complex human disease, as shown in a few recent reports (Emamian et al.,&#xD;
           2004; Mukai et al., 2004). This proposed RIGOS will follow this strategy as the main&#xD;
           approach as shown in our specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endophenotype indictors and Issue of Heterogeneity of SCH 3-1. Neurobiological&#xD;
           Impairment in Schizophrenia SCH was found to have impairment in neuropsychological&#xD;
           functions of executive function, sustained attention measured and working memory&#xD;
           (Goldberg et al, 1993) with underlied frontostriatal dysfunction (Elliot et al., 1995),&#xD;
           or dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit (Gold and Harvey, 1993), or&#xD;
           dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Weinberger et al., 1988; Berman et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
           These impaired neurobiological functions had significant association with specific&#xD;
           clinical symptoms (Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Hain et al., 1993; Johnstone and Frith,&#xD;
           1996; Liu et al., 1997; Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Strauss et al., 1993; Nelson et al.,&#xD;
           1998; Liu et al., 1997) and enduring long term disability (Weinberger et al., 1986;&#xD;
           Goldberg et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
           SCH is characterized by core-deficits in information processing and attentional&#xD;
           mechanism (Bleuler, 1911; Kraepelin and Robertson, 1919; McGhie and Chapman, 1961;&#xD;
           Venables, 1964; Braff and Geyer, 1990), which was due to the impairment of &quot;filtering&quot;&#xD;
           or &quot;gating&quot; function of brain (Braff and Geyer 1990). P50 event-related potential&#xD;
           suppression (P50I) [Freedman et al., 1987; Olincy et al., 2000] and prepulse inhibition&#xD;
           of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI) (Braff et al., 2001; Geyer et al., 2001) are&#xD;
           reliable measurements. Both P50I and PPI mechanisms, under different neuronal circuits&#xD;
           (Swerdlow et al., 2001; Adler et al., 1998), are out of subject's will control, and both&#xD;
           are impaired in the patients of SCH (Freedman et al., 1987; Braff et al., 2001), in the&#xD;
           spectrum disorder of schizotypal disorder (Cadenhead et al., 1998; Cadenhead et al.,&#xD;
           2000) and clinically unaffected relatives of SCH patients (Siegel et al., 1984; Waldo et&#xD;
           al., 1988; Waldo et al., 1991; Adler et al., 1992; Clementz et al., 1998; Cadenhead et&#xD;
           al., 2000). Both deficits in P50I and PPI can be as the endophenotype indicators with&#xD;
           different neural substrate processes. In this study, we intend to use P50I and PPI as&#xD;
           specific endophenotype indicator for identifying the possible responsible risk mutations&#xD;
           of the possible candidate vulnerability genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Animal studies have shown that the PPI deficits could be induced pharmacologically by&#xD;
           agents altering systems implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia, such as&#xD;
           dopaminergic or NMDA glutamatergic neurotransmission (Mansbach et al., 1988; Hutchison &amp;&#xD;
           Swift, 1999). This experimentally induced PPI impairment by amphetamine has been&#xD;
           conceived as a putative animal model with face, predictive, and construct validities for&#xD;
           certain schizophrenic symptoms (Koch, 1999; Swerdlow et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Impairment of Niacin Skin Flush Response in Schizophrenia: The niacin induced&#xD;
           vasodilatory response was either absent or impaired in schizophrenic patients (Horrobin,&#xD;
           1980; Wilson and Douglass, 1986; Fielder et al., 1986; Hudson et al., 1997; Rybakowski&#xD;
           and Weterle, 1991; Hudson et al., 1997, 1999; Ward et al., 1998; Puri et al., 2001; Shah&#xD;
           et al., 2000; Maclean et al., 2003). There is no significant relationship between&#xD;
           antipsychotic drug dose and niacin sensitivity (Hundson et al., 1997; Messamore et al.,&#xD;
           2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The niacin sensitivity may be through the nicotinic acid receptor HM74 (low affinity&#xD;
           receptor) and HM74a (high affinity receptor) recently identified (Wise et al., 2003;&#xD;
           Soga et al., 2003), and they are both Gi-G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The two&#xD;
           receptors were expressed in the lymphocytes (Wise et al., 2003). The detail molecules&#xD;
           and signaling pathway involved in niacin skin flush response still remained to be&#xD;
           clarified. In this RIGOS project, it is desirable to explore the possible responsible&#xD;
           genes in this un-studied area using microarray method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3-2. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To face the&#xD;
           genetic heterogeneity of SCH, an alternative strategy was to use specific&#xD;
           neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an endophenotype reflecting the effect&#xD;
           of a single genetic alteration (Lander, 1988). In this respect, deficits on the&#xD;
           Continuous Performance Test (CPT) have been postulated to be a potential endophenotype&#xD;
           of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky&#xD;
           et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           CPT deficit was a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and&#xD;
           Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological&#xD;
           deficit, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14 (Freedman et al.,&#xD;
           1997). The other neurobiological deficit, eye-tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has&#xD;
           been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02 (Arolt&#xD;
           et al., 1996). This RIGOS project will take this endophenotype strategy for validation&#xD;
           of risk mutations, especially by using attention impairment measured by CPT as well as&#xD;
           P50I and PPI indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3-3. Issue of Heterogeneity Genetic and clinical heterogeneity is the main issue in this&#xD;
           area of study. Searching for valid clinical subtype and endophenotype are critical for a&#xD;
           breaking through study. Our GENOP group had substantial psychopathological data in this&#xD;
           area and the RIGOS project will take this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functions of Candidate Vulnerability Genes This RIGOS project will tackle on these 11&#xD;
           candidates vulnerability genes identified by our previous POCOS project. The neuronal&#xD;
           functions of these 11 candidate genes to be studied have not been well characterized.&#xD;
           Current knowledge on the functions of some of these 11 candidate genes are listed as the&#xD;
           following: the GNPAT is a dihydroxyacetonephosphateacyltransferase (DHAPAT, or DAPAT)&#xD;
           participating in the etherphospholipid biosynthesis (Ofman et al., 2001), the NOTCH4 is&#xD;
           a heterodimer receptor involving in the vascular and articular cartilage development&#xD;
           (Hayes et al., 2003; Iso et al., 2003), the NRG1 (neuregulin 1) is a group of isoform&#xD;
           proteins produced from NRG1 gene by alternative splicing, these isomers interact with&#xD;
           ERBB receptor and induce the growth and differentiation of neuronal and glial cells&#xD;
           (Kerber et al., 2003; Fallon et al., 2004). The DAAO (D-amino-acid oxidase) is a&#xD;
           peroxisomal enzyme activated by G72 (D-amino acid oxidase activator) (Chumakov et al.,&#xD;
           2002). The CHRNA7 is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit belonging to the&#xD;
           superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and involving in the development of the central&#xD;
           nervous system (Agulhon et al., 1999; Raux et al., 2002). The PRODH (proline&#xD;
           dehydrogenase) is an enzyme catalyzing proline to Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), the&#xD;
           first step in the conversion of proline to glutamate (Harrison and Owen 2003; Lee et&#xD;
           al., 2003). Deletion of this gene has been associated with hyperprolinemia (Jacquet et&#xD;
           al., 2002). The functional roles of these genes on the neuronal cells warrant further&#xD;
           investigation to predict the possible pathological process for schizophrenia. In this&#xD;
           RIGOS project, we'll use in vitro cell-line to do functional laboratory study to&#xD;
           validate any of these risk mutations identified in this RIGOS project.&#xD;
