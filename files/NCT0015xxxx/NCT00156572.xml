  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone are diuretics that are commonly in preterm infants&#xD;
      with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyponatremia (low blood salt) is a common side effect.&#xD;
      It is uncertain whether the best way to treat the hyponatremia is by oral salt&#xD;
      supplementation or restricting fluid intake. Our hypothesis is that fluid restricted infants&#xD;
      will be better able to preserve the beneficial effects of diuretics on the lungs. The study&#xD;
      will include very low birth weight infants (VLBW) 400-1500g from Hermann Memorial Children's&#xD;
      Hospital NICU or LBJ General Hospital NICU with BPD. They will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the salt supplementation group or the fluid restriction group once they&#xD;
      become hyponatremic (defined as serum Na &lt;130). The study intervention will take place for&#xD;
      four weeks. The primary outcome will be assessed by comparing the patient's initial oxygen&#xD;
      and breathing machine requirements with those at the end of the four-week study period.&#xD;

      Study Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among very low birth weight infants, 400-1500 g, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who develop&#xD;
      hyponatremia while receiving hydrochlorothiazide diuretics: does oral sodium supplementation&#xD;
      compared to fluid restriction affect FiO2 requirements (change in Respiratory Index Score&#xD;
      [RIS] in Ventilated or CPAP babies, or change in FiO2 in spontaneously breathing babies)&#xD;
      after four weeks?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to either the sodium supplementation group or the&#xD;
      fluid restriction group once they become hyponatremic (serum sodium &lt; 130) while taking&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium Supplementation: Patients randomized to the sodium supplementation group will receive&#xD;
      oral NaCl added to their feeds. When the serum sodium is 125-130, they will have 2 meq/kg/day&#xD;
      of NaCl added to their feeds. If the serum sodium is 120-124, they will have 4 meq/kg/day of&#xD;
      NaCl added to their feeds. Na supplementation will continue until the serum Na is &gt;135.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid Restriction: Patients randomized to the fluid restriction group will have fluid intake&#xD;
      decreased by 20cc/kg/day. In order to maintain approximately the same caloric intake, 0.5&#xD;
      cc/kg/dose of corn oil (8.4kcal/cc), will be administered as a bolus every 6 hours. If this&#xD;
      fluid restriction doesn't increase the serum sodium to above 130 within one week or if the&#xD;
      serum Na is 120-124 and if the infant is receiving &gt; 140 cc/kg/d, the fluid intake will be&#xD;
      decreased by an additional 10cc/kg/day for one additional week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessments Primary Outcome - the change in FiO2/RIS between baseline and outcome at&#xD;
      4 weeks after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 24-hour urine sodium, calcium, and creatinine at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mean serum Na+ nadir for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The mean serum K+ nadir for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to extubation for infants ventilated at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Time on CPAP or mechanical ventilation for infants on CPAP at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size for the study will be 58, based on an effect size of 10% if the&#xD;
      mean FiO2 is 40% (0.1 x 40= 4% absolute difference), expected standard deviation of 5% for&#xD;
      FiO2, alpha (two-sided) = 0.05; Beta = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis plan has been designed to allow every randomized infant to be included&#xD;
      in the analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) regardless of whether they are intubated,&#xD;
      extubated, taken off or put onto CPAP, or if they die during the course of the 4-week study&#xD;
      period. All infants (both study groups combined) will be assigned a rank at baseline and at&#xD;
      outcome (4 weeks) within each of the following subgroups: infants on O2 by oxyhood, infants&#xD;
      on nasal cannula, infants on CPAP, infants on the ventilator, infants who die during the&#xD;
      study. For each infant, a change in rank (outcome minus baseline) will be calculated. The&#xD;
      change in rank will be compared between the two study groups using a non-parametric test.&#xD;
