      In this study, we, the investigators at National Taiwan University Hospital, will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of pharmacological therapy targeted to reduce insulin resistance (pioglitazone)&#xD;
      on the progression and compositional change of non-obstructive coronary atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques and coronary calcification by serial intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (IVUS)/multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) follow-up in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes or non-diabetic metabolic syndrome during a 2-year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Type 2 diabetes and its antecedent, metabolic syndrome, are important risk&#xD;
      factors for premature and accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However,&#xD;
      glycemic control by provision of endogenous or exogenous insulin induced only modest and not&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction of the risk of myocardial infarction. We and other&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated that the use of insulin sensitizer, thiazolidinediones,&#xD;
      resulted in favorable antiatherosclerotic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes or&#xD;
      non-diabetic metabolic syndrome. It has become increasingly clear that morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) are often associated with lesions&#xD;
      that are not obstructive but prone to rupture, the so-called vulnerable plaques. Conventional&#xD;
      coronary angiography is not suitable for identifying vulnerable plaques. They may be detected&#xD;
      by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and recently developed high-resolution 16-slice&#xD;
      multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). Nevertheless, whether this modality could be used&#xD;
      as a guide for optimizing medical treatment of CAD has never been explored in the medical&#xD;
      literature. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological therapy targeted&#xD;
      to reduce insulin resistance on the progression and compositional change of non-obstructive&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic plaques and coronary calcification by serial IVUS/MDCT follow-up in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes or non-diabetic metabolic syndrome during a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Expected Results: Patients aged ≥18 years conformed to the diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes or metabolic syndrome criteria in ATP III and with objective evidence of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia will undergo EBCT, MDCT coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary angiography and&#xD;
      intervention if appropriate, and IVUS study if non-obstructive coronary plaques are&#xD;
      identified in the MDCT examination. Patients deemed eligible (with one or more ≥ 20% and &lt;&#xD;
      70% stenosis in at least one coronary artery) will then be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive pioglitazone (30 mg/d) or placebo in an open-label fashion. Patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes assigned to the placebo group are not allowed to be treated with any insulin&#xD;
      sensitizer. The target for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in both groups&#xD;
      is reduction of HbA1c to ≤ 7.0%. A total of 120 patients are planned to be included, and the&#xD;
      follow-up period is 2 years. To assess the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, MDCT&#xD;
      coronary angiography/scanning will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of&#xD;
      follow-up. Follow-up coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound study will be&#xD;
      performed at 6 months if patients agree. Blood samples will also be obtained at baseline and&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up for the measurement of various conventional and novel&#xD;
      coronary risk factors. We also obtain DNA specimen from blood drawn at baseline for&#xD;
      genotyping. The primary end-points include changes from baseline in total plaque volume,&#xD;
      plaque characteristics (as determined by CT-density values and other morphological features),&#xD;
      and total coronary calcium score. The secondary end-points include percent change from&#xD;
      baseline in calcium volume score in each coronary artery, percent change from baseline in&#xD;
      plasma glucose/insulin homeostatic parameters and various risk markers, and the occurrence of&#xD;
      a composite of major cardiovascular events (death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, and target vessel revascularization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance: This is the first human study to assess the antiatherosclerotic&#xD;
      effects of insulin sensitizer by directly visualizing the atherosclerotic plaques of the&#xD;
      whole coronary trees. It will provide us great insights regarding the evolution of coronary&#xD;
      plaques and techniques of measuring the total vulnerability burden of the coronary arteries.&#xD;
