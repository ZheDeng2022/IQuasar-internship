  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although LAAM, a derivative of methadone, has been successfully used as an alternative to&#xD;
      methadone maintenance in opioid addicts, its effect on concurrent opioid and cocaine abuse&#xD;
      has not been ascertained. Thus, this study proposes to examine the clinical efficacy of low-&#xD;
      and high-dose LAAM maintenance on opioid and cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine abusers.&#xD;
      In addition, since contingency management procedures have demonstrated some success in&#xD;
      decreasing cocaine use in cocaine-abusing individuals, this study also proposes to examine&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of the presence or absence of contingency management procedures&#xD;
      targeting illicit drug use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred forty male and female opioid-dependent cocaine abusers will be stratified by sex&#xD;
      and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups according to a 2 x 2 experimental&#xD;
      design: low-dose LAAM (99 mg/wk) with adjunct contingency management procedures; low-dose&#xD;
      LAAM (99 mg/wk) without adjunct contingency management procedures; high-dose LAAM (330 mg/wk)&#xD;
      with adjunct contingency management procedures; and high-dose LAAM (330 mg/wk) without&#xD;
      adjunct contingency management procedures. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, with&#xD;
      LAAM being administered on a thrice-weekly (MWF) basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are inducted onto LAAM during weeks 1-3 and then maintained on their assigned&#xD;
      maintenance dose (99 mg/wk or 330 mg/wk) through week 24. During maintenance, the Friday dose&#xD;
      will be 1.3 times greater than the Monday and Wednesday dose. At the conclusion of the study,&#xD;
      subjects undergo detoxification from LAAM over a 4-week period. For those in the contingency&#xD;
      management procedure group, each drug-free urine submitted will result in a voucher worth a&#xD;
      certain monetary value that increases for consecutively drug-free urines (weeks 1-12) or a&#xD;
      monetary voucher with a fixed value (weeks 13-24). Subjects not assigned to the contingency&#xD;
      management procedure will receive monetary vouchers (weeks 1-24) according to a yoked-control&#xD;
      schedule (that is, not contingent upon illicit drug abstinence). Vouchers can be exchanged&#xD;
      for mutually agreed upon goods and services at any time during the study. Outcome measures&#xD;
      will include: 1) treatment retention, 2) illicit drug use, 3) self-reported adverse and&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, and 4) psychosocial functioning. Follow-up interviews at nine&#xD;
      months and/or one year post-study entry will be conducted to determine status post-treatment.&#xD;
      Prognostic factors (i.e., sex, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression), will also be&#xD;
      examined in relation to treatment outcome and post-treatment status.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One hundred forty male and female cocaine-abusing, opioid-dependent individuals&#xD;
             between the ages 21-55, with at least 40% women and 40% Afro-Americans, who not be&#xD;
             currently enrolled in treatment, will be entered into the study. Subjects must have&#xD;
             current opioid dependence as evidenced by documentation of prior treatment for opioid&#xD;
             dependence or signs of withdrawal upon administration of naloxone (0.8 mg, i.m.), and&#xD;
             opioid-positive urine screen. Subjects also must be current users of cocaine with&#xD;
             self-reported use of &gt; 12 gms during the preceding 12 months, self-reported use of &gt; 1&#xD;
             gm/week in the month preceding study entry, and cocaine-positive urine screen.&#xD;
             Subjects must fulfill DSM-III-R criteria for opioid and cocaine dependence. These&#xD;
             criteria will be ascertained using the substance abuse section of the SCID interview&#xD;
             developed for use with DSM-III-R&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for exclusion include current diagnosis of other drug or alcohol dependence&#xD;
             (other than opiates, cocaine or tobacco); ill health (e.g., major cardiovascular,&#xD;
             renal, endocrine, hepatic disorder); respiratory condition (e.g., asthma); history of&#xD;
             major psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression);&#xD;
             current suicidality; LFT's (i.e., liver enzymes) greater than 3 times normal levels;&#xD;
             and pregnancy.&#xD;
