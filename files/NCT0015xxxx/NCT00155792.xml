    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer the most frequent neoplasm and the third mortality rate of malignancies of&#xD;
      the women in the world. It results in about 200,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year&#xD;
      worldwide. The available forms of treatment-surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are&#xD;
      all cytoreductive treatment modalities, so in addition to killing cancerous cells, healthy&#xD;
      cells are also destroyed in the process. Indeed, there is a need to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      cervical cancer and develop better forms of its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer&#xD;
      especially those high-risk types (HPV 16,18,31,45) have been strongly associated with&#xD;
      cervical cancer. HPV 16 was found in more than 50% of cervical cancer tissues. So the host&#xD;
      immune response plays an important role in determining the regression of cervical abnormality&#xD;
      or persistence and progression to malignancy via targeting HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal cancer treatment should be able to eradicate systemic tumors at multiple sites in&#xD;
      the body while having the specificity to discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic&#xD;
      cells. In this regard, antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy represent an attractive approach&#xD;
      for cancer treatment. It is now clear that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#xD;
      restricted CD8+ T cytotoxic cells are critical to the generation of antitumor immunity.&#xD;
      Cell-mediated responses are critical in anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By cooperating with Dr. TC Wu in Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, we have recently developed&#xD;
      some E7-specific cancer vaccines of different strategies such as DNA, or&#xD;
      replication-defective SINrep5 virus. We found that these E7-chimeric DNA vaccines are capable&#xD;
      of preventing and treating the growth of murine model tumors expressing E7. These positive&#xD;
      results from the preclinical murine models have encouraged us to focus on the development of&#xD;
      cancer vaccine and immunotherapy and apply these vaccines to human subjects. However, it is&#xD;
      very important to set up various E7-specific immunologic assays of human being to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of cancer vaccine or immunotherapy in the future clinical trials. So we would like&#xD;
      to provide this proposal to address on the development of HPV 16 E7-specific immunologic&#xD;
      assays in human being.&#xD;

      HPV and Cervical Cancers Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small, nonenveloped DNA viruses&#xD;
      which induce epithelial tumors of skin or mucosa. The majority of tumors are benign, show&#xD;
      limited growth and usually regress spontaneously. However, a number of human papillomaviruses&#xD;
      induce tumors that may eventually progress to carcinomas. The genital HPV types 16 and 18,&#xD;
      and less frequently, types 31, 33, 35, 45, 51 and 56, have been implicated in the etiology of&#xD;
      cervical and other anogenital cancers. Approximately 500,000 women worldwide develop cervical&#xD;
      cancer yearly and it is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women [1]. In&#xD;
      developed countries, cancer of the cervix ranks behind cancers of the breast, lung, uterus,&#xD;
      and ovaries and accounts for 7% of all female cancers. In the United States, there are about&#xD;
      4,800 deaths annually from cervical cancer [2]. The evidence linking HPVs to anogenital&#xD;
      cancer comes from epidemiologic and laboratory studies. More than 90% of cervical cancers and&#xD;
      their precursors, so-called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), contain human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences [3]. The HPV types found in cancer cells have transforming&#xD;
      activity in in vitro studies [4] and the viral transforming proteins, E6 and E7, are&#xD;
      consistently expressed in cervical cancer cell lines [5] and in HPV-associated cancers of&#xD;
      patients [6]. In HPV-associated malignant transformation, viral DNA may be integrated into&#xD;
      the cellular DNA and integration often results in deletion of large sectors of the viral&#xD;
      genome. Late genes (L1 and L2) and some early genes (E1 and E2) are usually lost, leaving E6&#xD;
      and E7 as the only open reading frames frequently found in carcinomas. Expression of E6 and&#xD;
      E7 is likely to overcome the regulation of cell proliferation normally mediated by proteins&#xD;
      like p53 and Rb, allowing uncontrolled growth and providing the potential for malignant&#xD;
      transformation [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV Oncogenic Proteins, E6 and E7, as Ideal Targets for the Development of Antigen-Specific&#xD;
      Immunotherapies or Vaccines for HPV-Associated Cervical Malignancies E6 and E7 represent&#xD;
      ideal targets for the development of antigen-specific immunotherapies or vaccines for&#xD;
      HPV-associated malignancies. First, more than 90% of cervical cancers have been associated&#xD;
      with HPVs, particularly type 16, and E6 and E7 are consistently expressed in most cervical&#xD;
      cancers. Second, while most tumor specific antigens are derived from normal proteins or&#xD;
      mutated protein, E6 and E7 are completely foreign viral proteins, and potentially may harbor&#xD;
      more antigenic peptides/epitopes than a mutant protein (i.e. p53) or a reactivated embryonic&#xD;
      protein (i.e. MAGE-1). Third, since E6 and E7 are required for the induction and maintenance&#xD;
      of malignant phenotype of cancer cells [8], cells of cervical cancer cannot evade an immune&#xD;
      response through antigen loss. Without functional E6 and E7, these cells would cease to be&#xD;
      tumorigenic. Therefore, E6 and E7 proteins represent ideal targets for developing&#xD;
      antigen-specific immunotherapies or vaccines for cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various forms of vaccines, such as vector-based vaccines, tumor-based vaccines, DNA based&#xD;
      vaccines and protein/peptide-based vaccines have been described in experimental systems&#xD;
      targeting HPV-16 E6 and/or E7 proteins [9, 10]. For example, Meneguzzi et al. reported that&#xD;
      inoculation of rats with vaccinia recombinants expressing HPV-16 E6 or E7 retarded or&#xD;
      prevented tumor development in 25-47% of rats challenged with a tumorigenic rat cell line&#xD;
      co-transfected with HPV-16 and activated ras [9]. In addition, Chen et al. demonstrated that&#xD;
      immunization of mice with syngeneic non-tumorigenic cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 gene&#xD;
      confers protection against transplanted HPV-16 E7 positive syngeneic tumor cells [11].&#xD;
      Feltkamp et al. identified a CTL epitope in HPV-16 E7 using H-2Kb and H-2Db MHC class&#xD;
      I-peptide-binding studies. Immunization with this peptide rendered mice resistant to a&#xD;
      challenge with HPV-16 transformed tumor cells [12]. Furthermore, chimeric papillomavirus-like&#xD;
      particles (CVLPs) consist of HPV-16 L1-E7 (Nieland et al., personal communication) or HPV-16&#xD;
      L1/L2-E7 (Greenstone et al., personal communication) chimeric proteins has been used as&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccines against HPV-16 E7 expressing tumors in murine models. More recently, a&#xD;
      phase I/II clinical trial were performed in eight patients with late stage cervical cancer&#xD;
      using a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and 18&#xD;
      (TA-HPV) [13]. In that study, no significant clinical side-effects or environmental&#xD;
      contamination by live TA-HPV were observed [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Cell Mediated Immune Responses in Controlling both HPV Infections and&#xD;
      HPV-Associated Neoplasms Several lines of evidence suggest that cell mediated immune&#xD;
      responses are important in controlling both HPV infections and HPV-associated neoplasms (for&#xD;
      review, see [14]). First, the prevalence of HPV-related diseases (infections and neoplasms)&#xD;
      is increased in transplant recipients [15] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected&#xD;
      patients [16], both of whom are known to have impaired cell mediated immunity. Second, animal&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that immunized animals are protected from papillomavirus infection&#xD;
      and from the development of neoplasia. Immunization also facilitates the regression of&#xD;
      existing lesions [17-19]. Third, infiltrating CD4+ (T helper cells) and CD8+ (cytotoxic&#xD;
      /suppressor T cells) T cells have been observed in spontaneously regressing warts [20] and&#xD;
      fourth, warts in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy often disappear when this&#xD;
      treatment is discontinued (for review, see [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular Immune Responses to HPV The understanding of T-cell mediated immunity to HPV&#xD;
      infections was facilitated by identification of MHC class I and class II epitopes of HPV&#xD;
      proteins. Several groups have attempted to map murine [22-24] and human [25, 26] T helper&#xD;
      (Th) cell epitopes on HPV proteins. Several groups have also tried to map murine [12, 27-30]&#xD;
      as well as human [31-34] cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes on HPV proteins. Kast et al.&#xD;
      have identified several high affinity binding peptides of HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins for human&#xD;
      HLA-A alleles [32]. Furthermore, HPV-specific CTLs recognizing HPV E6 and E7 proteins have&#xD;
      been demonstrated in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients [13, 35], in healthy donors&#xD;
      [33, 36] and in patients with CIN lesions [34, 37, 38]. Furthermore, infiltration of cervical&#xD;
      cancer tissue with HPV-specific CTLs has been recently described[39].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell-mediated immune responses in HPV-infected lesions can be demonstrated by in vivo skin&#xD;
      tests [40, 41], in vitro CTL assays [35, 37, 39] and in vitro lymphoproliferative response&#xD;
      [25, 26, 42-48]. For instance, Hopfl et al. have used bacterially-expressed HPV-16 proteins&#xD;
      for skin tests in patients with CIN lesions and have found specific skin responses to the&#xD;
      virion protein L1 and not the E4 protein [40]. In patients with CIN lesions, HPV-specific&#xD;
      CTLs have been identified in PBMC [35, 37] and in cervical tissues [39]. The in vitro&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative responses in patients with CIN lesions has been actively investigated.&#xD;
      For example, de Gruijl et al. reported that T cell proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7&#xD;
      oncogenic protein were most prominent in CIN patients with a persistent HPV infection [45].&#xD;
      However, Kadish et al. reported that lymphoproliferative responses to specific HPV-16 E6 and&#xD;
      E7 peptides appeared to be associated with the clearance of HPV infection and the regression&#xD;
      of CIN lesions [46].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Helper T Cell Functions in Generating Effective Antitumor Responses Increasing&#xD;
      evidence has suggested that inadequate antitumor responses can result from a failure of the&#xD;
      helper arm of the immune response. The events leading to the activation of CTL are tightly&#xD;
      regulated in order to protect against the development of inappropriate immune responses to&#xD;
      self antigens or exaggerated responses to foreign antigens. This regulation is mediated by&#xD;
      lymphokines produced by CD4+ T helper cells. CD4+ T helper cells are critical to the&#xD;
      generation of potent antitumor immune responses. CD4+ T cells have been shown to be&#xD;
      instrumental in generating immune responses against several solid malignancies in murine [49,&#xD;
      50] and in human [51, 52]. Several mouse tumors that are transfected with syngeneic MHC class&#xD;
      II genes become very effective vaccines against subsequent challenge with wild type class II&#xD;
      negative tumors [53, 54]. In addition, as crucial memory cells in the T cell arm of the&#xD;
      immune system, CD4+ cells may be able to provide long term immunity against specific antigens&#xD;
      [55, 56].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Cytokines in Cell-Mediated Immunity Cell mediated immunity is regulated by cytokines&#xD;
      which are secreted by T helper cells. In general, T helper cells can be classified as Th1&#xD;
      and/or Th2 cells based on the different types of cytokines they secrete. Th1 cells secrete&#xD;
      interleukin (IL) 2 and interferon gamma (IFN-). Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and&#xD;
      IL-13. The Th1 lymphocytes are the most important effector cells in inflammatory reactions&#xD;
      associated with vigorous delay-type hypersensitivity but low antibody production, as occurs&#xD;
      in contact dermatitis and in viral or intracellular bacterial infections (for review, see&#xD;
      [57, 58]). The functional phenotype of most Th2 cells may account for both the persistent&#xD;
      production of certain antibody isotypes, particularly IgG1 and IgE, and the eosinophilia&#xD;
      observed in human helminthic infections and allergic disorders. Lymphocyte mediated&#xD;
      protection from viral infections as well as control of tumors is thought to be mediated by&#xD;
      Th1 cytokine responses and impaired by Th2 cytokine responses. The IL-2 and IFN- producing&#xD;
      Th1 response is likely to be the major component that contributes to the development of cell&#xD;
      mediated immunity against HPV infections and HPV-associated neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chimeric E7-specific vaccines can control the HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model With&#xD;
      cooperating with Prof. TC Wu in Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, we have successfully&#xD;
      developed several chimeric DNA, RNA, and virus-vector vaccines to prevent and treat HPV16&#xD;
      E7-expressing tumor in the animal model [59-61]. We found that these E7-chimeric DNA vaccines&#xD;
      are capable of preventing and treating the growth of murine model tumors expressing E7. These&#xD;
      positive results from the preclinical murine models have encouraged us to focus on the&#xD;
      development of cancer vaccine and immunotherapy and apply these vaccines to human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is very important to set up various E7-specific immunologic assays of human being&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of cancer vaccine or immunotherapy in the future clinical trials. So&#xD;
      we would like to provide this proposal to address on the development of HPV 16 E7-specific&#xD;
      immunologic assays in human being. There are several aims in this project: 1) to develop and&#xD;
      utilize assays to measure CTLs to HPV 16 E7 proteins, 2) to develop and utilize assays to&#xD;
      measure T helper (Th) responses to HPV 16 E7 antigens.&#xD;
