  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MC-1 is effective and safe in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neurological events in patients undergoing high-risk coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) effectively relieves angina, results in longer&#xD;
      survival, and a better quality of life in specific subgroups of patients with obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. Due to the high incidence of coronary artery disease worldwide, as&#xD;
      well as the effectiveness of the surgical procedure, CABG surgery makes up one of the top ten&#xD;
      most frequently performed procedures in North America and Europe. In the United States it is&#xD;
      estimated that over 700,000 CABG procedures are performed per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefits of CABG surgery, patients undergoing these procedures may also suffer&#xD;
      serious adverse outcomes including operative mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable&#xD;
      angina, ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the proposed causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG include&#xD;
      perioperative ischemia, inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury. The impact&#xD;
      of these serious complications is significant. Incidence rates of death and MI following CABG&#xD;
      surgery range from 5% to 12% depending on risk status. Results from large clinical trials&#xD;
      have recently demonstrated the importance of neurologic deficits as a problematic outcome of&#xD;
      CABG. These deficits include memory impairment, psychomotor, visuospatial, attention and&#xD;
      language abilities as measured by neuropsychological testing as well as sensori-motor&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MC-1 is a naturally occurring small molecule. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies&#xD;
      suggests that MC-1 protects the heart from ischemic damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
      This trial will assess the effects of MC-1 compared to placebo on cardiovascular and&#xD;
      neurological events following CABG surgery.&#xD;
