    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MC-1 alone and in combination with an ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor is effective in reducing blood pressure and metabolic dysfunctions associated with&#xD;
      diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an extremely common co-morbid condition in diabetics, affecting up to 11&#xD;
      million patients, depending on obesity, ethnicity and age. Hypertension substantially&#xD;
      increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications including stroke,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy and possibly&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, adequate data from well-designed randomized clinical trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive treatment of hypertension in reducing diabetic&#xD;
      complications. In the epidemiological UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), each 10 mmHg&#xD;
      decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was associated with reductions in risk of 12% for&#xD;
      any complication related to diabetes, 15% for deaths related to diabetes, 11% for myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and 13% for microvascular complications. Currently the consensus guidelines&#xD;
      recommend a blood pressure target of &lt;130/80 mmHg in diabetic patients with hypertension,&#xD;
      even though they recognize many people will require three or more drugs to reach this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MC-1 is a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin B6, and thus has very low toxicity.&#xD;
      Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that MC-1 has beneficial effects on hypertension&#xD;
      and metabolic dysfunction. This trial will assess the effects of MC-1 alone and MC-1 in&#xD;
      combination with an ACE inhibitor compared to placebo on hypertension and parameters of&#xD;
      metabolic function in type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;
