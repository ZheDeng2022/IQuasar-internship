  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years several novel agents have been defined which are active in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Many of these new agents seemed to have&#xD;
      mechanisms of action that are different from Carboplatin and taxol. This trial looks to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of three sequential chemotherapy doublets in the&#xD;
      treatment of women with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal or tubal carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To evaluate a novel regimen in ovarian carcinoma with an aim of demonstrating a&#xD;
      higher than 50% laparotomy defined response rate. This rate is defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving either a pathologic complete response or a microscopic positive second&#xD;
      look at the conclusion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      · To determine the efficacy of a triple doublet regimen in carefully defined cohorts of&#xD;
      patients as defined by the surgical defined response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate incidence of tubulin mutations in primary and secondary surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and FGF, at primary diagnosis, during and at&#xD;
           the conclusion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe initial IL-6, IL-8, and FGF levels in patients who ultimately achieve&#xD;
           pathologic remission vs those with gross residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will recieve 3 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by 3 cycles of taxol&#xD;
      and carboplatin and then three cycles of adriamycin and topotecan. All patients with a&#xD;
      clinically complete response will then undergo second look operation to determine&#xD;
      pathologically defined response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SLO = Second Look Operation&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial carcinoma of müllerian origin. Specifically,&#xD;
             ovarian, primary peritoneal and tubal carcinoma will be allowed. All histologic&#xD;
             subtypes are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have undergone an attempt at aggressive surgical debulking or&#xD;
                  alternatively be eligible for interim debulking after cycle #3. Patients debulked&#xD;
                  to no evidence of disease, microscopic disease or gross residual disease are&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage II, III or IV disease. Patients with disease outside the abdominal cavity&#xD;
                  are eligible unless presentation includes brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Able and willing to undergo a second look staging laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must give written informed consent.&#xD;

                  carcinoma are eligible if their endometrial carcinoma is superficial or invades&#xD;
                  less than 50% the thickness of the myometrium).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known hypersensitivity to E.coli derived products?&#xD;
