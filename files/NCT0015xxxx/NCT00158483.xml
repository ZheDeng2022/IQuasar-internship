      Herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection - as a cofactor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      transmission - can be targeted by anti-herpetic specific drugs, either as a continuous&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment during its asymptomatic shedding phase, or as an episodic treatment&#xD;
      during clinically-apparent genital ulcerations. The main objective of this trial will be to&#xD;
      demonstrate that acyclovir treatment given during clinical episodes (primary infection or&#xD;
      recurrences) can reduce genital shedding of HIV, thereby contributing to a reduction of HIV&#xD;
      infectiousness of dually infected individuals (HIV+/HSV+).&#xD;

      Objectives. The proposed project is a randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded,&#xD;
      multicentric therapeutic trial evaluating the association of antiherpetic treatment to the&#xD;
      syndromic treatment for the management genital ulcers in Africa, and its impact on the&#xD;
      genital shedding of HIV and of Herpes simplex hominis type 2 (HSV-2) virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that infection with HSV-2 is highly&#xD;
      prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and that HSV-2 seropositivity is a marker of high-risk&#xD;
      sexual behaviour. HSV-2 infection is increasingly being recognised as one of the commonest&#xD;
      causes of genital ulceration in many African countries. HSV-2 infection may act as a major&#xD;
      cofactor for HIV transmission, a fact that has long been underestimated. First, genital&#xD;
      ulcers (caused by HSV-2) are by themselves cofactors of HIV transmission, either by&#xD;
      increasing infectiousness of dually infected individuals (HSV+/HIV+), or by increasing&#xD;
      susceptibility of the seronegative partner. Second, HSV-2 infection may transactivate in vivo&#xD;
      the genital replication of HIV, thereby increasing the infectiousness of dually infected&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and main objective. HSV-2 infection - as a cofactor of HIV transmission - can be&#xD;
      targeted by anti-herpetic specific drugs, either as a continuous prophylactic treatment&#xD;
      during its asymptomatic shedding phase, or as an episodic treatment during&#xD;
      clinically-apparent genital ulcerations. The main objective of this trial will be to&#xD;
      demonstrate that acyclovir treatment given during clinical episodes (primary infection or&#xD;
      recurrences) can reduce genital shedding of free- or cell-associated HIV, thereby&#xD;
      contributing to a reduction of HIV infectiousness of dually infected individuals (HIV+/HSV+).&#xD;
      Given the present state of knowledge and hypotheses formulated around the possible role of&#xD;
      HSV on the HIV epidemic in Africa, the proposed research will contribute to confirm or&#xD;
      invalidate the existence of mutual reinforcement of HSV and HIV replication. This will&#xD;
      represent a study of biological plausibility for such an in vivo interaction. In addition the&#xD;
      chosen intervention strategy has practical and operational implications in that it will allow&#xD;
      the evaluation of a novel approach to syndromic management of genital ulcers in Africa that&#xD;
      could later lead to revisions of management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Approximately 600 women presenting with genital ulcers will be enrolled over two&#xD;
      years and in two sites: Bangui (Central African Republic) and Accra (Ghana). The syndromic&#xD;
      management of patients will include antibiotics to cover the presumptive bacterial causes of&#xD;
      genital ulcerations in these settings (chancroid and syphilis), according to national and&#xD;
      international guidelines (CDC, UK national guidelines, WHO). In addition, women will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive either antiherpetic treatment (acyclovir 400 mg 3 times daily for 5&#xD;
      days, according to UK national guidelines - a shorter regimen than US guidelines) or placebo&#xD;
      (similar frequency and duration). Clinical examination and cervicovaginal samplings will be&#xD;
      carried out at D0 and at each follow up visit at D2, D4, D7, D14 &amp; D28. These samples will be&#xD;
      tested for: etiological diagnosis of ulcers by multiplex PCR; measurement of HIV genital&#xD;
      viral loads (measuring free RNA and cell-associated proviral DNA) and HSV-2 DNA genital load;&#xD;
      and diagnosis of other common STDs (at D0). Blood samples will be collected at D0, D2 and D28&#xD;
      for HIV, syphilis and HSV-2 serological assays, and for HIV plasma loads as well as CD4&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome will be the determination of the impact of anti-herpetic treatment on HIV&#xD;
      genital load (and as a corollary, on HSV2 genital load). It will also be possible to measure&#xD;
      the impact of antibiotic treatment on HIV viral load. The study will allow to evaluate the&#xD;
      validity of novel syndromic treatment approaches for genital ulcer disease, and a long term&#xD;
      outcome may be the necessary revision of syndromic management guidelines for GUD to&#xD;
      potentially include anti-herpetic treatment.&#xD;
