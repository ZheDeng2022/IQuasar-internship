  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A minority of patients with colorectal liver metastases and hepatobiliary cancer (primary&#xD;
      liver cancer) are candidates for surgery, but there are no curative treatment options for&#xD;
      these patients. Their median survival time is 3 to 12 months. Stereotactic radiation (SRT)&#xD;
      (highly conformal radiotherapy (CRT)) is a treatment option for these patients with&#xD;
      unresectable liver cancer, now possible due to improvements in our ability to localize and&#xD;
      immobilize liver tumors and an improved understanding of the partial liver volume tolerance&#xD;
      to radiation. SRT should permit liver tumors to be treated to tumorcidal doses while sparing&#xD;
      the uninvolved liver, decreasing the risk of treatment related normal tissue toxicity. With&#xD;
      such conformal radiation, it is possible to deliver radiation in fewer fractions than&#xD;
      traditionally required, which should be more convenient for patients. In this study, CRT will&#xD;
      be delivered during shallow breathing or breath hold to minimize organ motion due to&#xD;
      breathing, decreasing the volume of normal liver that must be irradiated.&#xD;
