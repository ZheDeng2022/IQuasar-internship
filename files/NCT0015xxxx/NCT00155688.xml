  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study 900 sib-pairs with the disorder. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To clinical&#xD;
      assess a pedigree sample having adequate power to detect genes for schizophrenia. 2) To&#xD;
      conduct a genome scan to find such loci. 3) To transmit all data to the NIMH designated cell&#xD;
      repository and data management centers. We will attain these goals by achieving the&#xD;
      following: 1) From Taiwan and China, we will collect 900 Han Chinese sib-pairs having DSM-IV&#xD;
      schizophrenia. 2) We will examine all family members using the Diagnostic Interview for&#xD;
      Genetic Study and the Family Interviews for Genetic Study. The PI participated in the&#xD;
      development and field testing of these interviews and has an already established training&#xD;
      program for their use. They have been translated into Mandarin by the Taiwanese&#xD;
      investigators, who have used them in prior studies. 3) Blood samples will be sent to the NIMH&#xD;
      designated cell repository for creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines. 4) Clinical Data will&#xD;
      be entered using the database software created for the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative. Data&#xD;
      will be vetted and sent to the NIMH designated data management center. 5) We will complete a&#xD;
      genome scan using 450 markers spaced at an average of 10 cM intervals using markers that have&#xD;
      been optimized for use in the Han Chinese population. The scan will be completed with no cost&#xD;
      to the NIMH through an agreement with Millennim Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnogy company in the&#xD;
      the Boston area that the PI has worked with on a prior genetic linkage study of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. All genetic analyses will be approved by our consultant, Eric Lander, PhD. 6)&#xD;
      All clinical data will be made available to the scientific community by the end of the&#xD;
      funding period. All genotypes wil be available one year after they are created but no later&#xD;
      than a year after the funding period. This project as feasible because 1) The PI has already&#xD;
      coordinated one multi-site genetic linkage study of schizophrenia and has participated in a&#xD;
      second. 2) We have a long-standing relationship with our Taiwanese collaborators and an&#xD;
      effective, albeit, more recent working relationship with our Chinese collaborators. 3) We&#xD;
      have conservatively estimated that each site has access to more than enough available&#xD;
      families having two schizophrenic siblings. 4) The PI's Harvard team has had prior experience&#xD;
      collaborating on genotyping and linkage analysis projects with Millennium Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
      This, and Millennium's prior genotyping experience shows that the genotyping phase of the&#xD;
      work is feasible.&#xD;
