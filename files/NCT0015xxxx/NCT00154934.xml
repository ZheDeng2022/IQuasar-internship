    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a severe complication of human pregnancy. It occurs in 4-5% of all&#xD;
      pregnancies and remains a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of this syndrome is not fully understood. Two theories are proposed to&#xD;
      explain the development of preeclampsia: defective trophoblast invasion in the first&#xD;
      trimester, and poor maternal immunoregulation against the fetus. Pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      are induced in the second mechanism, with a subsequent generalized endothelial dysfunction in&#xD;
      the mother. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a major role in this pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent literature, debates still exist on the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of preeclampsia. IL-10 may increase immunoregulation (seemingly against the development of&#xD;
      preeclampsia), but also prohibit the extravillous trophoblast invasion on the other hand&#xD;
      (seemingly towards the development of preeclampsia). According to recent authoritative&#xD;
      journals, the expression of IL-10 pre-eclamptic placenta is increased; but some other&#xD;
      influential journals have the totally contrary results. We believe this diverse exhibition&#xD;
      may be due to overlook the paracrine effect of decidual cells (representative of maternal&#xD;
      environment), and in vitro cultured condition does not parallel to physiological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our experiment has first obtained the qualification of Ethical Committee of our hospital and&#xD;
      the permission of the examined patients. We first collect the serum sample of preeclampsia&#xD;
      patient and analyze the IL-10 level by ELISA kit, and compared with normal control. Then we&#xD;
      isolate trophoblast from pre-eclamptic women and normal control. These trophoblasts are&#xD;
      further treated with (1) co-cultured with decidual cell line (2) Lipofectamine transfection&#xD;
      with IL-10 (overexpression of IL-10) (3) signal interference ribonucleotide (siRNA) of IL-10&#xD;
      (knockdown IL-10 function). Each groups (including trophoblast alone from patients or normal&#xD;
      control) were subjected to the analysis of IL-10 mRNA amount by RT-PCR. Further experiments&#xD;
      for these treated trophoblast are transwell migration assay and invasion assay, matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase assay to determine the change of invasive capacity; and Fas ligand&#xD;
      expression to determine the change of immunoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our effort is not only to determine the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia,&#xD;
      but also the development of siRNA IL-10 may give a light in the treatment of preeclampsia.&#xD;

      1. Pregnancy, pre-eclampsia and immune regulation The preeclampsia syndrome, which is&#xD;
           characterized by changes in the placenta and uteroplacental vasculature, is a major&#xD;
           concern in impaired human pregnancy. Hypertension, proteinuria and exaggerated edema are&#xD;
           typical clinical symptoms1. Although the etiology of the disease is uncertain, it is&#xD;
           well established that a defect in placental trophoblast invasion during implantation&#xD;
           contributes to inadequate remodeling of uterine spiral arteries, thereby initiating&#xD;
           focal regions of reduced perfusion within the placenta2. It has been suggested that a&#xD;
           consequence of placental ischemia is the generation of cytotoxic factors that may act&#xD;
           systemically to activate or injure the endothelium3. The identity of the factors&#xD;
           elaborated by the placenta, which presumably compromise endothelial function during&#xD;
           preeclampsia, is unknown. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α&#xD;
           (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are known to be potent activators of the vascular&#xD;
           endothelium and have been proposed as mediators of endothelial dysfunction during&#xD;
           preeclampsia4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is well known that the acceptance of the fetoplacental unit in human pregnancy&#xD;
           requires maternal immune tolerance, which is thought to be regulated locally by the&#xD;
           placenta. Therefore an anti-inflammatory cytokine, such as interleukin-10 plays a&#xD;
           critical role in different pregnancy disorders, including preeclampsia5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Placental interleukins have been identified in reproductive tissues, but their roles in&#xD;
           adaptive maternal immunity and determining term pregnancy outcomes have not been fully&#xD;
           clarified. The acceptance of the fetoplacental unit by the maternal uterine surface&#xD;
           requires an element of immunological tolerance. Local antiplacental immunity is modified&#xD;
           by synthesis of uncommon histocompatibility Ags, growth factors, and cytokines by the&#xD;
           placenta. The presence of immune cells in the decidual tissue of the uterus also&#xD;
           presents a potential barrier, both physical and immunological, to the development of the&#xD;
           placenta6. Some characteristics of the fetoplacental unit encourage endometrial and&#xD;
           myometrial invasion7 and others modify the immunological barrier (e.g. HLA-G)8. These&#xD;
           characteristics of placental function may be abnormal at the formative stages of&#xD;
           placental development, and thus the presumptive uterine barriers may be abnormal in&#xD;
           preeclampsia, a complication of human pregnancy related to shallow placental&#xD;
           development9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interleukin-10 Interleukin-10 was originally identified as the product of Th2-type T&#xD;
           lymphocytes that inhibits the synthesis of Th-1 type cytokines such as Interferon-gamma&#xD;
           and IL-210. IL-10 is known to be secreted by Th2-helper T cells, CD4+HT2 cells, and some&#xD;
           B cell lymphoma and mast cell lines. The protein undergoes post-translational&#xD;
           modification that includes N-glycosylation and the formation of critical cysteine bonds.&#xD;
           IL-10 inhibits cytokine synthesis in both T cells and NK cells by controlling&#xD;
           macrophage-monocyte accessory cells. IL-10 elicits responses in granulocytes,&#xD;
           eosinophils, mast cells, B cells, T cells and NK cells11. IL-10 is crucial in limiting&#xD;
           inflammatory responses in some disease states. The ability of IL-10 to inhibit&#xD;
           macrophage activation should allow investigation into &quot;cross-talk&quot; between stimulatory&#xD;
           and inhibitory cytokines. IL-10 is important in understanding autoimmunity and as a&#xD;
           target molecule in the development of anti-rejection therapies12. The Th-like responses&#xD;
           of this cytokine make it a suitable adjuvant for immunization development10.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Human and mouse IL-10 are 73% homologous at the amino acid level. Human IL-10 is active&#xD;
           in mouse cell lines, but human cell lines are not responsive to mouse IL-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintenance of pregnancy and interleukin-10 production Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an&#xD;
           immunosuppressive cytokine expressed throughout pregnancy by epithelial cells and&#xD;
           leukocytes in the endometrium and placenta. The anti-inflammatory and immune deviating&#xD;
           properties of IL-10 are well characterized. Principally these are mediated through&#xD;
           inhibiting proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis in type 1 T helper&#xD;
           (Th1) cells, programming specific phenotypes in macrophages and dendritic cells and&#xD;
           stimulating natural killer (NK) cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IL-10 has been shown in normal placental cells (trophoblast cells) to suppress the mixed&#xD;
           lymphocyte responses in vitro13. Maternal bone marrow-derived cells in the uterine wall&#xD;
           include NK-like cells and T cells14 that may be modified by placental IL-10 production.&#xD;
           Modification of the local maternal antifetal immune response has been shown to be&#xD;
           important in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion15.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IL-10 has been identified as an important cytokine in pregnancy. IL-10 may be involved&#xD;
           in the maintenance of pregnancy by corpus luteum maturation and progesterone&#xD;
           production16. In a well-known mouse cross that is prone to spontaneous abortion a&#xD;
           deficiency of IL-10 has been demonstrated to alter the net fetal number and outcome17.&#xD;
           Longitudinal studies in mice demonstrate a sequential change in the cytokine profile&#xD;
           including IL-10 in peripheral blood and release from spleen elements as pregnancy&#xD;
           advances18,19. IL-10 inhibition in the second half of pregnancy in mice causes fetal&#xD;
           growth retardation20. Besides, progesterone has been shown to increase Th2-type&#xD;
           responses in T cells21. Taken together, these data suggest that early pregnancy is&#xD;
           associated with an increase in circulating Th2 cytokine IL-10 and that fetal and&#xD;
           placental growth and development are depend on adequate IL-10 production. Or in brief,&#xD;
           IL-10 may have a fetal protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In human pregnancy there is a shift of cytokine production from Th1-type inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines to Th2 type cytokines with a predominance of IL-10 and IL-4 over IL-2 and&#xD;
           TNF-α in stimulated PBMC. This balance altered in preeclamptic mononuclear cells with&#xD;
           the alternative result, a relative decrease in IL-10 compared with the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokine production22.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interleukin-10 on trophoblast motility and invasion capacity Interleukin-10, expressed&#xD;
           in the decidua and placenta, is implicated in regulating extravillous cytotrophoblast&#xD;
           invasion through inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase expression and influencing the&#xD;
           quality of the maternal immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cytotrophoblast invasion in vitro requires the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9&#xD;
           (MMP-9). In a recent article, the authors showed that cytotrophoblasts produce&#xD;
           interleukin-10 (IL-10), a potent immunomodulatory cytokine that could have paracrine&#xD;
           effects on the maternal immune system. IL-10 synthesis is dramatically downregulated&#xD;
           after the first 12 h of culture, while MMP-9 secretion is rapidly upregulated and the&#xD;
           cells acquire an invasive phenotype.13 These observations prompted the subsequent&#xD;
           experiments to investigate whether IL-10 is an autocrine regulator of cytotrophoblast&#xD;
           MMP-9 production. Adding recombinant IL-10 to cytotrophoblast cultures significantly&#xD;
           decreased the cells' MMP-9 expression at both protein and mRNA levels, but did not&#xD;
           affect mRNA levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3.23 Thus, IL-10 may&#xD;
           alter the proteinase/inhibitor balance. IL-10 treatment further caused a net decrease in&#xD;
           MMP activity, thereby reducing cytotrophoblast invasiveness. Together, the current data&#xD;
           suggest that IL-10 is an autocrine inhibitor of cytotrophoblast MMP-9 activity and&#xD;
           invasiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Controversies of interleukin-10 and the development of preeclampsia Endothelial cell&#xD;
           dysfunction has been hypothesized to be a major contributor in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
           pre-eclampsia. This hypertensive disease of pregnancy is characterized by changes in the&#xD;
           placenta, uteroplacental vasculature, kidneys, and liver consistent with endothelial&#xD;
           damage. Hypertension and vascular hypersensitivity to pressors, neutrophil activation,&#xD;
           and platelet activation have also been demonstrated in preeclampsia and are consistent&#xD;
           with endothelial dysfunction.24 Inflammatory cytokines are known to be potent activators&#xD;
           of the vascular endothelium and have been proposed as mediators of endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction during preeclampsia.25 Both tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1&#xD;
           β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10) induce functional alterations in endothelial cells.26&#xD;
           Although the association of these inflammatory cytokines with the development of&#xD;
           pre-eclampsia (PE) is generally assumed, the actual mechanism, and modes of&#xD;
           dysregulation are still in strong debate. In two authoritative journal, the authors&#xD;
           described a dysregulation of cytokine expression occurs in the pre-eclamptic placenta,&#xD;
           with overexpression of IL-10 mRNA in placenta tissues and elevated plasma level (Am J&#xD;
           Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:915-20; Obstet Gynecol 2002;100:327-31).27,28 In contrast,&#xD;
           another influential journal describes deficiency in plasma production of IL-10 and&#xD;
           decreasing plasma level of IL-10 (J Immunology, 1999, 163: 3491-5)29. Authors also&#xD;
           measured the IL-10 released by in vitro culture of CTB from PE patients. The results&#xD;
           also shows significantly alternation in IL-10 release by in vitro culture of PE CTB&#xD;
           (Cytokine 23 2003;23:119-25)30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believed that studying the CTB itself is not enough to explain the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      preeclampsia. CTB itself, and also the implantation environment are also expressed IL-10 and&#xD;
      other inflammatory cytokines. We suggest assess the in situ specimen including placenta&#xD;
      tissues and placental bed biopsies may include both the influence of CTB and its implantation&#xD;
      environment. Besides, if IL-10 does play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, altering&#xD;
      the expression IL-10 level may restore the PE phenotype to normal behavior. This is our&#xD;
      purpose of observation in the following study.&#xD;
