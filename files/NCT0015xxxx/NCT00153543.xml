      To test the hypothesis that immune responses to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine&#xD;
      (PPV-23) could be improved in Alaska Native elders by immune priming with 7-valent&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7), we assessed post-vaccination immune responses among&#xD;
      Natives aged 55 years and older who were randomized into three arms: (1) one dose of PPV-23&#xD;
      according to current state and ACIP recommendations; (2) one dose of PCV-7 followed two&#xD;
      months later with a dose of PPV-23; and (3) one dose of PCV-7 followed six months later with&#xD;
      a dose of PPV-23.&#xD;

      Rates of invasive pneumococcal infection (bacteremia and meningitis caused by Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae) for Alaska Natives are among the highest in the United States and are&#xD;
      approximately five-fold higher than rates among non-Natives living in Alaska. Disease is most&#xD;
      common among the very young and the elderly (73 cases/100,000 Natives ≥55 years old)1.&#xD;
      Case-fatality from pneumococcal infection is highest (&gt;15%) among the elderly. A 23-valent&#xD;
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) has been licensed in the United States since&#xD;
      1983. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination with&#xD;
      PPV-23 for all Alaska Natives aged two years and older, however the Alaska Department of&#xD;
      Health and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium only target and fund vaccination for&#xD;
      those aged 55 years and older. Post-licensure epidemiological studies have documented&#xD;
      effectiveness of PPV-23 for prevention of invasive infection (bacteremia and meningitis)&#xD;
      among the elderly and younger adults with certain chronic medical conditions. The overall&#xD;
      effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease among immunocompetent persons age ≥65&#xD;
      years is 75%; however, efficacy may decrease with advancing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPV-23 has several limitations. Efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines against the&#xD;
      most common types of pneumococcal infection in the elderly, bronchitis and pneumonia without&#xD;
      bacteremia, has not been documented in controlled, randomized trials. Additionally,&#xD;
      antibodies against pneumococcal polysaccharides decline after immunization and often return&#xD;
      to pre-vaccination concentrations within 5 years. A case-control study evaluating vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness suggests that the decline in antibody concentration is associated with&#xD;
      declining protection against invasive pneumococcal infection. At present, the Alaska&#xD;
      Department of Health recommends revaccination with PPV-23 every 6 years. This is in contrast&#xD;
      to ACIP recommendations for only one revaccination. A retrospective review found similar&#xD;
      rates of local and systemic reactions among 179 Alaska Native elders who received a third&#xD;
      dose of PPV-23 compared to 180 receiving a first or second dose. Although available data&#xD;
      suggest that revaccination with PPV-23 is safe, clinical benefits of revaccination are&#xD;
      unproven. T-cell independent antigens, such as polysaccharides, do not produce booster&#xD;
      responses to revaccination, and antibody levels after revaccination do not exceed those after&#xD;
      primary immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was licensed in 2000 (Prevnar™, Wyeth&#xD;
      Lederle Vaccines) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young&#xD;
      children. This vaccine was safe and effective for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease&#xD;
      in a large randomized trial conducted among infants aged two months and older enrolled in a&#xD;
      northern California HMO. The role of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among adults has not&#xD;
      been defined. Potential advantages of conjugate vaccines compared to PPV-23 include the&#xD;
      T-cell dependent immune response to conjugate vaccines which lead to immunologic memory and&#xD;
      booster responses characterized by rapid and dramatic increases in antibody after&#xD;
      revaccination. PCV-7 should also overcome the limitations of the poorly immunogenic antigens&#xD;
      in PPV-23, including those resistant to antimicrobial drugs. An additional potential&#xD;
      advantage of PCV-7 is greater mucosal immunity with possible protection against&#xD;
      non-bacteremic pneumococcal respiratory tract infections-a benefit that has never been&#xD;
      confirmed for PPV-23 among the elderly. Potential disadvantages of PCV-7 in adults include&#xD;
      limited serotype coverage. Only 50% of invasive pneumococcal infections in Alaska Natives&#xD;
      aged 55 and older are caused by the seven serotypes included in PCV-7 compared to more than&#xD;
      90% for PPV-23. Preliminary data from studies of healthy persons ≥50 years old and of&#xD;
      patients vaccinated after treatment for Hodgkin's disease indicate that antibody responses to&#xD;
      a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine have not been substantially better than responses to&#xD;
      PPV-23. One approach to the use of conjugate vaccines in adults is to administer conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine to prime the immune system and to subsequently give a dose of PPV-23 to induce a&#xD;
      booster response to the serotypes present in both vaccines as well as primary T-cell&#xD;
      independent responses to the serotypes in PPV-23 only. Immunogenicity studies have documented&#xD;
      boosting with polysaccharide vaccine in children with chronic illnesses and in adults with&#xD;
      Hodgkin's Disease after primary vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. However,&#xD;
      there are no published data evaluating this strategy for preventing pneumococcal disease in&#xD;
      the elderly, and no data are available for Alaska Natives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We studied the immunogenicity of PCV-7 in Alaska Native elders. Participants were randomized&#xD;
      into three arms: (1) one dose of PPV-23 according to current state and ACIP recommendations;&#xD;
      (2) one dose of PCV-7 followed two months later with a dose of PPV-23; and (3) one dose of&#xD;
      PCV-7 followed six months later with a dose of PPV-23. Immune responses for all conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine pneumococcal serotypes will be determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) and antibody affinity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)&#xD;
      Arctic Investigations Program (AIP) laboratory located on the Alaska Native Medical Center&#xD;
      (ANMC) campus.&#xD;
