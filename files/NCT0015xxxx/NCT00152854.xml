  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with cancer pain have pain not fully controlled on opioids (eg. morphine). The&#xD;
      addition of acetaminophen (Tylenol) to opioids in a small study in cancer patients&#xD;
      demonstrated better pain control without an increase in side effects. This study will&#xD;
      determine if regular acetaminophen improves pain control when added to strong opioids in&#xD;
      patients with cancer pain.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether regular oral acetaminophen can reduce pain in cancer patients already on a&#xD;
      strong opioid regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 75% of people with advanced cancer suffer significant pain. Many of&#xD;
      these people continue to have pain despite being on strong opioids. The rationale behind&#xD;
      adding an additional analgesic with a different mechanism of action is to attempt to improve&#xD;
      analgesia without increasing side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind, randomised placebo-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate whether&#xD;
      the addition of regular acetaminophen can reduce pain in cancer patients already on a strong&#xD;
      opioid regimen. The study will be performed in ambulatory cancer patients who have pain that&#xD;
      is believed to be caused by their cancer, and who have already been stabilised on an opioid&#xD;
      regimen of &gt; 60mg/day of morphine equivalents. Each patient will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive either acetaminophen 1g qid or an identical appearing placebo qid for a seven-day&#xD;
      period, and then crossed over to the other arm for a further seven-day period. Patients will&#xD;
      complete daily pain diaries and weekly questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory) and comparison&#xD;
      will be made between the pain scores for the two treatment periods. Patient preference for&#xD;
      the two treatment periods will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial to determine if the addition&#xD;
      of regular acetaminophen (1g PO qid) leads to improved analgesic control in adult cancer&#xD;
      patients at Princess Margaret Hospital, who are already on strong opioids (&gt; 60mg morphine&#xD;
      equivalents/day) as evaluated by daily pain scores measured by Numerical Rating Scales (NRS)&#xD;
      and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular acetaminophen improves pain control in cancer patients who are already on strong&#xD;
      opioid regimens.&#xD;
