      1. This is a phase II study of radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients whose tumor(s) are not suitable for other local treatment, such as surgery,&#xD;
           trans-arterial chemoembolization (TAE), ethanol injection, or radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
           will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radical radiotherapy will be started after pre-treatment evaluation. The total dose of&#xD;
           RT will be 50Gy in 25 fractions to local tumor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI and serum samples will be done at the following time&#xD;
           points to assess the change in tumor perfusion: (1) before the start of thalidomide&#xD;
           treatment; (2) 2weeks after radiotherapy begins; and (3) 1 month after radiotherapy&#xD;
           completes. DCEMRI will then be done every 3 months until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The study was designed to evaluate the response rate and tolerability of radical&#xD;
           radiotherapy for locally advanced HCC. The sample size was determined by the expected&#xD;
           incidence of grade 4 toxicity and response rate of radiotherapy for locally advanced&#xD;
           HCC. Since the grade 4 toxicity of radiotherapy alone is 10%, the response rate is 60%&#xD;
           we need at least 12 patients to evaluate for the treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in Asian countries.&#xD;
      Surgical resection is potentially the only form of curative treatment. However, less than 20%&#xD;
      of patients are surgical candidates at diagnosis. Nonsurgical treatment options include&#xD;
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous acetic acid or ethanol&#xD;
      injection therapy and radio-frequency ablation. They are sometimes unsatisfactory, especially&#xD;
      for patients with portal vein thrombosis or large infiltrative hepatic tumors. Repeated&#xD;
      treatments are often necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of HCC has been attempted for more than 4 decades. Early&#xD;
      trials adopted whole liver irradiation but used an inadequate radiation dose. Because of the&#xD;
      unsatisfactory results obtained with this low-dose whole liver irradiation, RT has not long&#xD;
      been considered for the treatment of HCC. Recently, local, not whole, liver RT has been&#xD;
      attempted by several investigators, who have shown that high doses of radiation can be safely&#xD;
      delivered to a portion of the liver alone or in combination with other nonsurgical&#xD;
      modalities. Their results suggest that local RT can be an effective component of the&#xD;
      treatment regimen for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of surrogate markers to monitor the response of HCC to radiotherapy is important&#xD;
      because of the following reasons. First, the response as evaluated by conventional imaging&#xD;
      studies is usually slow and may be unreliable. The maximal response to radiotherapy is often&#xD;
      achieved 6 months after completion of radiotherapy. The slow response to radiotherapy makes&#xD;
      it difficult to modify an ineffective treatment regimen in a more timely fashion to HCC,&#xD;
      especially for patients with low serum a-fetal protein (AFP). Second, intra-hepatic&#xD;
      recurrence outside RT field is a common cause of RT treatment failure. Nearly half of the&#xD;
      patients recur after RT with lesions outside RT fields. Inflammation and normal liver damage&#xD;
      caused by RT may have deleterious effect on tumor control through the release of cytokines or&#xD;
      angiogenic factors. Therefore, the biological consequence of RT in both the tumors and the&#xD;
      non-tumor liver parenchyma shall be carefully evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCEMRI) may assess hepatic perfusion&#xD;
      parameters which correlate with the severity of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In&#xD;
      cervical cancer, DCEMRI enables us to evaluate the microcirculation of tumors as well as the&#xD;
      blood perfusion of normal parenchyma. Malignancy, stage and prognosis have all been&#xD;
      correlated with the enhancement parameters in cervical, breast cancers.Several studies have&#xD;
      shown that successful therapies also result in changes in DCEMRI parameters, which may prove&#xD;
      to be a more accurate and earlier indication of response. De Vries et al reported, in rectal&#xD;
      carcinoma patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, that perfusion index showed a&#xD;
      significant increase in the 1st and 2nd week of treatment. High perfusion index values&#xD;
      correlated with greater lymph node down-staging. Moffat et al also reported increased&#xD;
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 3 weeks after the initiation of RT in brain cancer&#xD;
      patients who had better local response. Circulating angiogenic factors have been shown to&#xD;
      provide important prognostic information about a variety of cancers (21). Elevated serum&#xD;
      levels of VEGF or bFGF have been associated with increased invasiveness of HCC. Placental&#xD;
      growth factor (PlGF), a homolog of VEGF, has been shown to have a synergistic effect with&#xD;
      VEGF in pathologic angiogenesis, such as angiogenesis induced by cancer or ischemia, but its&#xD;
      prognostic value in human cancers remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to correlate functional image studies of blood flow and serum cytokines during&#xD;
      radiotherapy with treatment outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.&#xD;
