  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the ability of AI-700-enhanced rest-stress&#xD;
      echocardiography to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with suspected ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease who are indicated for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of myocardial perfusion has been demonstrated to provide both diagnostic and&#xD;
      prognostic value to patients with ischemic heart disease by allowing the clinician to assess&#xD;
      the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD). The primary objective of the&#xD;
      clinical development program for AI-700 is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of AI-700&#xD;
      as an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent in patients with suspected myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population is comprised of patients who are being evaluated for inducible&#xD;
      ischemia. The primary study objective was to determine the accuracy, sensitivity, and&#xD;
      specificity of AI-700-enhanced echocardiographic imaging for detecting CAD using coronary&#xD;
      angiography/left ventriculography (ANGIO/LVG) or single-photon emission computed tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT) with clinical outcome as the reference standards.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women with a recent history of typical or atypical&#xD;
        chest pain (angina) who were 18 to 80 years of age and who had been clinically indicated&#xD;
        for SPECT evaluation for the presence of inducible ischemia were to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study candidates who have had any of the following conditions were to be excluded from&#xD;
             the study: any clinically unstable condition or major surgery within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             AI-700 dosing; an acute MI, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to dosing; congestive heart failure graded as New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Grade 4 within 3 months prior to dosing; significant left main CAD;&#xD;
             moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; oxygen saturation &lt; 90% at&#xD;
             rest; or prior CABG (unless &gt;= 6 months prior to AI-700 dosing and patient had typical&#xD;
             angina)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates with significant cardiovascular or pulmonary structural and/or functional&#xD;
             abnormality, or in whom visualization of the left ventricle was not adequate for&#xD;
             evaluation of cardiac function during the Exclusion ECHO, were not eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had a history of MI of non-CAD etiology or who exhibited new or changing&#xD;
             ECG abnormalities at any time between Screening and AI-700 dosing were to be similarly&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other exclusion criteria included: participation in an investigational drug/device&#xD;
             study within 30 days prior to dosing (90 days for UK sites), non-seasonal asthma&#xD;
             within the past 3 years or recent seasonal asthma requiring prescription medication,&#xD;
             organ transplant or end-stage organ failure, and active seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates were to be excluded for uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, frequent&#xD;
             premature ventricular or atrial contractions, history of prolonged QT/QTc, use of&#xD;
             automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator or pacemaker, and any rhythm&#xD;
             abnormality that had not been evaluated and treated by a specialist or for which&#xD;
             current treatment did not ensure patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates who had used methylated xanthines within 24 hours of dosing were also to be&#xD;
             excluded. Patients were also to be excluded if aminophylline, theophylline, or&#xD;
             dipyridamole were contraindicated according to each agent's product labeling.&#xD;
