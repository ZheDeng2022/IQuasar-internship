      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      determine the safety of donor right hepatic lobectomy as a procedure to provide a liver graft&#xD;
      for living donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      study the regeneration of liver tissue by volumetric testing for both donor and recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      assess if graft and patient survival with living donor transplantation is comparable to that&#xD;
      of cadaveric donor transplantation.&#xD;

      Preoperative Evaluation of Recipients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients who consent for living donor liver transplantation will have the following&#xD;
      measurements performed in addition to those normally performed in their pretransplant workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ideal, dry and current body weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An estimation of the recipient's actual liver volume will be determined by linear CT&#xD;
           scanning. Continuous axial-10 mm-thick slices will be obtained following IV contrast.&#xD;
           The area of the liver will be electronically outlined on the CT console and then&#xD;
           multiplied by the slice thickness. This measurement will be used to assess the accuracy&#xD;
           of CT in predicting liver weight and volume by comparing it to the actual volume&#xD;
           displacement and weight following hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The expected ideal volume of the recipient liver will be calculated from the patient's&#xD;
           body weight. Standard liver volume (ml) = 706.2 x (body surface area [m2] + 2.4. Body&#xD;
           surface area is calculated from the following formula: BSA = Square root of (Height&#xD;
           [inches] x Weight [lbs.]/3131). Example: A recipient who is 5'4&quot; and weighs 121 lbs. has&#xD;
           a body surface area of 1.58m2. Thus the estimated ideal liver volume for this recipient&#xD;
           is 1120 cc. In order to provide adequate hepatic parenchyma for function they would&#xD;
           require 35%-40% of this volume = 392 - 447 cc of liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Actual and ideal body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychosocial evaluation of the donor will be performed by a social worker for the kidney&#xD;
           transplant program. Since he is not affiliated with the liver program, he will be able&#xD;
           to objectively assess the potential donor's psychosocial condition. He will continue to&#xD;
           see the patient (donor) after the operation while hospitalized and as an outpatient once&#xD;
           and then on a prn basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluations by a donor advocate physician who is not part of the transplant department.&#xD;
           The potential donor will be interviewed alone by the physician and allowed to express&#xD;
           reservations concerning the procedure in private. The donor advocate physician will&#xD;
           review the donor workup in detail to ensure its appropriateness. Should the donor&#xD;
           advocate physician indicate that the donor is unsuitable, the donor will be excluded&#xD;
           from further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Donor must be in usual state of health, with normal liver function and no major&#xD;
           pre-existing medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Laboratory testing to rule out concomitant disease that would exclude donation would&#xD;
           include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood type and HLA CBC with differential, platelet count Chem 17, SGPT, GGTP, Calcium,&#xD;
           Magnesium PT, PTT Pregnancy test for premenopausal women Hepatitis B surface antibody,&#xD;
           hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C HIV serology CXR, EKG Cardiac stress test and&#xD;
           pulmonary function tests if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. An estimation of the recipient's right and left lobe size will be determined by linear&#xD;
           CT scanning. Continuous axial-10mm-thick slices will be obtained following IV contrast.&#xD;
           The area of the liver will be electronically outlined on the CT console and then&#xD;
           multiplied by the slice thickness. This measurement will be used to assess the accuracy&#xD;
           of CT in predicting liver weight and volume by comparing it to the actual volume&#xD;
           displacement and weight following hepatectomy in the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hepatic arteriogram to evaluate the arterial anatomy of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor consent is a crucial ethical issue. The donor must be exceptionally well informed&#xD;
      concerning the risks of partial hepatectomy. A more difficult element of informed consent,&#xD;
      however, is that the donor must make a voluntary choice without coercion. In order to avoid&#xD;
      coercion, living donor liver transplants will not be performed in emergency situations. By&#xD;
      excluding emergent cases, time to fully consider both the experimental option of living donor&#xD;
      transplantation and the standard option of cadaveric donor transplantation will be afforded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential donor will be medically evaluated by an independent (non-study related)&#xD;
      physician prior to any consideration of hepatectomy. Karen Kim, M.D., and Sunanda Kane, M.D.,&#xD;
      both in the section of gastroenterology, will be the donor physician/advocates. We feel that&#xD;
      their knowledge of gastroenterology is necessary given the nature of the contemplated&#xD;
      surgery, hepatic lobectomy. However, neither of them have affiliations to the liver&#xD;
      transplant team, either clinical or research. These physicians will not know the potential&#xD;
      recipient's status, will be the final arbiter of the donor's suitability, and will serve as&#xD;
      the donor's advocate throughout the transplantation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor and recipient will both undergo psychosocial evaluation prior to the procedure.&#xD;
      This will be to determine psychological suitability for living donor transplantation and to&#xD;
      explore personal and family support resources. These interviews will allow both the potential&#xD;
      donor and recipient an opportunity to express reluctance to proceed with an individual not&#xD;
      directly involved with the transplant procedure. Perhaps the most coercive element for a&#xD;
      potential living donor is the perception that it is the expectation of the recipient's family&#xD;
      that one should volunteer to donate. This element of coercion can be minimized by allowing&#xD;
      the potential donor to discuss any reluctance to donate privately, and apart from their&#xD;
      family. They will be reassured that if at any time they do not wish to donate, the recipient&#xD;
      will be told only that the donor was not acceptable and the exact reason for this will not be&#xD;
      made available. Both the investigators and the donor advocate will perform the process of&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent from the donor on two separate occasions not less than one week&#xD;
      apart. There will be a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of the surgery and data&#xD;
      will be provided from the short- and long-term follow-up of pediatric donors. These&#xD;
      discussions will be with both a transplant hepatologist and surgeon. Once these discussions&#xD;
      have taken place, the donor will be given an informed consent form to sign. In seven to ten&#xD;
      days, the donor will be approached again regarding liver donation and another consent form&#xD;
      will be presented to the donor. After the second consent is signed, it is felt that the donor&#xD;
      has met all the physical and emotional requirements for liver donation. If, at the second&#xD;
      meeting, the donor requests more time to make an informed consent, this shall be granted.&#xD;
      Written consent will also be obtained from the recipient at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The donor liver will be partitioned to provide a full right lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative examination of the liver parenchyma for unsuspected lesions, steatosis&#xD;
           will be performed. Intraoperative cholangiography will also be performed to assess the&#xD;
           appropriate site of parenchymal transection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once suitability is confirmed. The appropriate recipient will be brought into the&#xD;
           operating room and the hepatectomy begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During the hepatectomy both the right and left hepatic arteries will be left as long as&#xD;
           possible. The portal veins shall be dissected to a level above the confluence of the L &amp;&#xD;
           R portal branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The use of either a right or left lobe will mandate a piggyback technique to be used, as&#xD;
           no vena cava will be procured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Arterial anastomosis will be performed with either high-powered loupes or with an&#xD;
           operating microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly, information such as actual GWRLW and actual GRBWR will only be available&#xD;
      retrospectively (after the donor hepatectomy). The decision to use the donor organ for a&#xD;
      living donor liver transplant will be based upon the calculated GWRLW and GRBWR&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
