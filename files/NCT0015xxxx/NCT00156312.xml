  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of the drugs docetaxel and&#xD;
      capecitabine is effective in treating breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some chemotherapy drugs are thought to work in synergy, meaning they work better in&#xD;
      combination, rather than singly because one drug may cause changes in the tumor that will&#xD;
      make the other drug more effective. The drugs docetaxel and capecitabine may work in synergy,&#xD;
      based on laboratory studies in tumors. These laboratory studies show that docetaxel increases&#xD;
      the levels of a critical enzyme, called thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which is necessary to&#xD;
      activate the capecitabine. This study will use this promising chemotherapy combination in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer. Before, during, and after chemotherapy, the participants' breast&#xD;
      tumors will be examined to see if TP increases, as predicted by the laboratory studies. The&#xD;
      study will also look at other factors in tumors and blood that may be able to predict how&#xD;
      effective the chemotherapy will be for each individual, so that in the future we may better&#xD;
      select the best chemotherapy for an individual's cancer.&#xD;

             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Size ≥ 2 cm on mammography, ultrasound, or PE&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. OR &lt;1 cm and documented intact axillary metastasis amenable to serial research&#xD;
                  CORE biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic diagnosis of at least one site of invasive cancer must be by core needle&#xD;
             biopsy or incisional biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and&#xD;
             progesterone receptors, and HER-2 neu receptor should be obtained on the initial&#xD;
             diagnostic sample.&#xD;
&#xD;

             film review prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinical ultrasound performed at the University of Michigan prior&#xD;
             to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients are required to sign an informed consent regarding the experimental&#xD;
             nature of this therapy, including the research biopsies, in accordance with the&#xD;
