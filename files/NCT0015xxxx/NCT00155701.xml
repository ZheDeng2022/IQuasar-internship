  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several chromosomal loci obtained from genetic linkage studies have been reported of relating&#xD;
      to schizophrenia. These areas include of 1q32-41, 6p24-21, 8p22-21, 15q13-14, and 22q11-12.&#xD;
      The names of these genes located in these loci have not been identified, nor have the&#xD;
      function and the relationship to the disease. Our research team using genetic linkage studies&#xD;
      has found a strong linkage (NPL Z score = 2.18, p=0.01) between the D1S251 marker and&#xD;
      schizophrenia disease. This marker is about 4 kb away from DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia&#xD;
      gene 1) gene. In a Scottish family, a balanced translocation [t(1;11) (q42.1;q14.3)] has&#xD;
      cosegregated inside the schizophrenia affected members of the family (LOD score =6.0). The&#xD;
      breakpoint of the translocation is located at the intron area between exon 8 and exon 9 of&#xD;
      DISC1 gene. This translocation disrupted the gene and caused its malfunction. A large&#xD;
      molecular genetic study study recently in Finland has also demonstrated strong linkage&#xD;
      evidence (Zmax=3.21) between the DIS2709 marker, located among exon 4 and exon 5 of DISC1&#xD;
      gene, and schizophrenia in a. All these findings have indicated that DISC1 gene is a&#xD;
      potential positional candidate gene and worth for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purposes of this proposal include: (1) To evaluate the incidence rate of the&#xD;
      balanced translocation between the chromosome 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 in approximately 500&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients in Taiwan. Furthermore, we will compare the clinical symptoms, illness&#xD;
      course, and family genetic model to examine if any particular characters coexist with the&#xD;
      translocation. (2) To search for the genetic polymorphisms in DISC1 gene area, where the&#xD;
      thirteen exons, the promoter regions (1 kb upstream the start codon), and the breakpoint area&#xD;
      (1 kb of both upstream and downstream area) will be analyzed by the method of denaturing high&#xD;
      performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Case-control association study will be performed&#xD;
      further in each 200 schizophrenic patients and normal controls to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between the disease and the clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is quite feasible and prospective with the following reasons. (1) All the DNA&#xD;
      samples and the clinical data have been collected and evaluated completely for further&#xD;
      analysis. (2) Our research team has built up an integrated andreliable molecular genetic&#xD;
      laboratory. All the facilities necessary for this study (DHPLC) had been setup with standard&#xD;
      operating protocols and working routinely. (3) DISC1 gene has strong linkage evidence with&#xD;
      schizophrenia in Taiwanese sample. The high prior probability of DISC1 gene as a positional&#xD;
      candidate gene increases the successfulness of association study. . (4) Once the relationship&#xD;
      among balance translocation, genetic polymorphism and the schizophrenia have established,&#xD;
      further functional study will be evaluated to understand the possible mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;

      The grant proposal has two major research goals. The first goal will be constructing an&#xD;
      E.coli plasmid carried with an approximately 1.4 kb of DNA sequences from each 700 bps of the&#xD;
      chromosome 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 around the breakpoint. The second goal will be establishing the&#xD;
      denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) methods to screen the mutations or&#xD;
      polymorphisms for all the exons of DISC1 gene, the 1 kb at the promoter region, and the&#xD;
      sequences from 1 kb at the upstream and downstream of the breakpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translocation (1q42.1;11q14.3)-Carried Plasmid DNA Construction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human genomic DNA isolation All human genomic DNA will be used from these subjects collected&#xD;
      in the past, or subjects collected specific for the plasmid construction study with informed&#xD;
      consents. For the plasmid construction, mononuclear leukocytes will be isolated by a&#xD;
      modification of the method of Böyum (1968). Whole blood with EDTA as anticoagulant will be&#xD;
      taken by venipuncture from healthy volunteers. The collected blood will be diluted with an&#xD;
      equal volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and layered onto Histopaque-1077. After&#xD;
      separation by centrifugation at 400xg for 40 min, the mononuclear leukocyte layer will be&#xD;
      removed and washed three times with PBS by centrifuging cells at 400xg for 10 min. The&#xD;
      freshly isolated cells will be further applied for genomic DNA isolation according to&#xD;
      standard phenol/chloroform extraction procedures (Sambrook et al. 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR amplification of 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 DNA sequences The amplification will be performed&#xD;
      with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase in a 50 ul reaction volume. The reaction containing 50 ng&#xD;
      DNA , 1 U of enzyme, 300 ng of each primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl and&#xD;
      10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.3. All reaction will be performed with an initial denaturing step of 5&#xD;
      min at 95℃ followed by 35 cycles of a denaturing step at 94℃ for 30 sec, an annealing step of&#xD;
      1 min at a temperature appropriate for the primers used, and a synthesis step at 72℃ for 10&#xD;
      min. The primer sequence for the 738 bps of upstream breakpoint at 1q42.1 will be designed&#xD;
      with an EcoRI cutting site at the breakpoint end. The primer sequence for the 719 bps of&#xD;
      downstream breakpoint at 11q14.3 will also be designed with an EcoRI cutting site at the&#xD;
      breakpoint end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ligating the two PCR DNA fragments and purification by gel electrophoresis The PCR product of&#xD;
      both 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 will be reacted with EcoRI separately to reveal the cohesive ligation&#xD;
      sites. Two of the DNA fragments, around 700 bps each, will be ligated by T4 DNA ligase&#xD;
      following the protocol provided from the InsT/AcloneTM cloning kit (MBI Fermentas, U.S.A.).&#xD;
      The ligated 1.4 kb of DNA fragment will be re-amplified by above PCR procedure, purified and&#xD;
      recovered from agarose gel by electroelution and extraction with organic solvents (Sambrook&#xD;
      et al. 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cloning the isolated DNA fragments into E. Coli plasmid The purified 1.4 kb of DNA fragment&#xD;
      (0.54 pmol ends) will be mixed with plasmid vector pTZ57R/T DNA (0.165 ug, 0.18 pmole ends),&#xD;
      10x ligation buffer, PEG 4000 solution and T4 ligase 5U. The mixture will be incubated at 22℃&#xD;
      for 1 hr. A control ligation reaction will be performed using 4 ul (168 ng, 0.54 pmol ends)&#xD;
      of control PCR fragment provided by the InsT/AcloneTM cloning kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transformation of the plasmids into competent E. Coli The transformation will follow the&#xD;
      protocol provided by the InsT/AcloneTM cloning kit. Competent cells of E.coli bacteria, DH5α&#xD;
      stain, will be inoculate with 2 ml of TransformAid C medium from a frozen stock and incubate&#xD;
      the culture overnight at 37℃ in a shaker. A pre-warm culture tube containing TransformAid C&#xD;
      medium 0.75 ml will be added up with 0.075 ml of overnight cultured E.coli, and shaken at 37℃&#xD;
      for 20 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equal volumes 250 ul of TransformAid T-solution A and B will be mixed and kept on ice. The&#xD;
      0.75 ml of E.coli culture tube will be spun for 1 min at 4℃ and discarded the supernatant.&#xD;
      Adding in 300 ul of TransformAid T-solution mixture, the E.coli will be incubated on ice for&#xD;
      5 min and spun for 1 min. The supernatant will be discarded and 120 ul of TransformAid&#xD;
      T-solution will be added and incubated for another 5 min on ice. The ligation plasmid 2.5 ul&#xD;
      (10-20 ng) and the control ligation mixture 2 ul (10 ng vector DNA) will be prepared and sat&#xD;
      on ice for 2 min. The resuspended on ice of E.coli cells 50 ul will be added to each of the&#xD;
      ligation plasmid and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cells with ligation plasmid will be&#xD;
      plated on a pre-warmed LB-Ampicillin agar plate and incubate overnight at 37℃. The control&#xD;
      ligation plasmid usually generates of about 90% of transformation efficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clone selection and isolation of the E.coli plasmids The recombinant clones of E.coli will be&#xD;
      identified by the white selection, because the vector carried the lacZ gene will be disrupted&#xD;
      by the insertion. The presence of correct plasmid insertion will be further confirmed by PCR&#xD;
      reaction. The plasmid will be isolated from E.coli by the method of alkaline lysis (Liou et&#xD;
      al., 1999) or by commercialized plasmid extraction kit. A single cell colony picked up to a&#xD;
      mixture with 30 ul of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4; 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0) buffer and 60 ul of&#xD;
      SDS-NaOH (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaOH) will be inverted gently and incubated for 5 min at room&#xD;
      temperature. A subsequent of 45 ul of 3M sodium acetate solution (pH5.2) and 130 ul of&#xD;
      chloroform will be added into the cell mixture and microcentrifuged for 5 min. The upper&#xD;
      phase will be collected and added 130 ul of isopropanol, mixed and centrifuge for 10 min. The&#xD;
      plasmid DNA pellet will be washed with 70% ethanol 100 ul and dissolved in 10-20 ul of TE&#xD;
      buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR the breakpoint area of genomic DNA from all patients The isolated plasmid DNA and the&#xD;
      collect schizophrenic patients' genomic DNA will be analyzed by further PCR reaction in the&#xD;
      breakpoint area with the pair of primers coming from both chromosomes 1 and 11. PCR will be&#xD;
      performed in a volume of 50 ul with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase. The reaction containing 50&#xD;
      ng DNA , 1 U of enzyme, 300 ng of each primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl&#xD;
      and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.3. All reaction will be performed with an initial denaturation step&#xD;
      of 5 min at 95℃ followed by 35 cycles of a denaturation step at 94℃ for 30 sec, an annealing&#xD;
      step of 1 min at a temperature appropriate for the primers used, and a synthesis step at 72℃&#xD;
      for 10 min. The primer sequences from both chromosome 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis PCR result with a band at approximately 1.4 kb of patient will be consider as&#xD;
      having a balanced translocation at the chromosome 1q42.1 area. The incidence rate will be&#xD;
      calculated by dividing the numbers of patients with balanced translocation to the total&#xD;
      patients analyzed in this experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Difficulties and Solutions&#xD;
&#xD;
      If balanced translocation did not happen in any schizophrenic patients of Taiwan. The&#xD;
      following inferences will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No balanced translocation at the 1q42.1 and 11q14.3 has occurred in the patients&#xD;
           collected by this laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The balanced translocation rate in the population is quite low, almost zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This result may not rule out the possibility of a relationship between DISC1 gene and&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It indicates that further experiments need to be carried out to evaluate if any mutation&#xD;
           or polymorphisms in this area relating to the disease, because in our previous&#xD;
           experiment we have demonstrate a strong correlation between this chromosome area and the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) DHPLC is a technique with benefits&#xD;
      of fully automated high throughput analysis, accommodated to the primers and the specific&#xD;
      reagent arrays of PCR, and required no sample pretreatment other than PCR (Xiao and Oefner,&#xD;
      2001). Using this technique to screen the breakpoint area of DNA sequence will speed up the&#xD;
      finding in the possibility of having single nucleotide polymorphism or insertions and&#xD;
      deletions relating to schizophrenia disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR the upstream and downstream breakpoint area, exon 8 and exon 9 DNA fragments All the&#xD;
      collected schizophrenic patients' genomic DNA will be analyzed by PCR reaction at the&#xD;
      upstream and downstream 1 kb of the breakpoint, and the exon 8 and the exon 9 covered parts&#xD;
      of introns toward the breakpoint. As the optima DNA fragment length for the DHPLC analysis is&#xD;
      around 500 bps, therefore, seven pairs of primers will be designed for each PCR reaction. PCR&#xD;
      will be performed in a volume of 50 ul with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase. The reaction&#xD;
      containing 50 ng DNA , 1 U of enzyme, 300 ng of each primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM&#xD;
      MgCl2, 50 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.3. All reaction will be performed with an initial&#xD;
      denaturation step of 5 min at 95℃ followed by 35 cycles of a denaturation step at 94℃ for 30&#xD;
      sec, an annealing step of 1 min at a temperature appropriate for the primers used, and a&#xD;
      synthesis step at 72℃ for 10 min. PCR reaction condition will be adjusted according to the Tm&#xD;
      predicted from each primer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denaturing HPLC analysis The DNA fragment of a PCR product will be first screened by the&#xD;
      DHPLC chromatograph to evaluate a pure and concentrated PCR product generated from the PCR&#xD;
      process. Mutation and polymorphism analysis will be performed according to the method on an&#xD;
      analysis system from Transgenomic WAVE HPLC (Transgenomic) (Oefner and Underhill, 1998). The&#xD;
      PCR products of each of the 500 bps will be denatured at 95℃ for 5 min and cooled to 65℃ for&#xD;
      the formation of heteroduplexes. DHPLC will be carried out using a DNASep column&#xD;
      (Transgenomic) as described (Kuklin et al., 1997). The composition of buffer A will be 0.1M&#xD;
      triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) (Transgenomic), and buffer B will contain 0.1 M TEAA, 25%&#xD;
      acetonitrile. Analysis will be carried out at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min and a buffer B&#xD;
      gradient increase of 2% per min for 4 min. Start and end concentrations of buffer B will be&#xD;
      determined empirically for each fragment. Elution of DNA from the column will be detected by&#xD;
      absorbance at 260 nm. The optimum temperature for mutation detection for each fragment will&#xD;
      be approximately 1-2℃ before or after Tm and will be determined empirically for each&#xD;
      fragment. Where the Wavemaker software will be used to indicate that the numbers of melting&#xD;
      domains existed in an amplicon, HPLC will be conducted at that numbers of temperatures. A&#xD;
      Wave Sizing standard and a Wave Mutation standard will evaluate the column resolution and the&#xD;
      column oven efficiency every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RFLP and Direct sequencing of PCR fragments Differences in the elution profiles of DHPLC&#xD;
      chromatograms will be compared between schizophrenic patients and controls. The detail&#xD;
      mutation or polymorphism sequences will be sent out to biotechnology company for further&#xD;
      analysis, or by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to verify certain mutations&#xD;
      or polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis DHPLC data analysis will be based upon a subjective comparison of sample and&#xD;
      reference chromatograms. In the present proposal, we will use controls and diseased patients&#xD;
      to be references and samples. Peak number will be the most important criterion for assigning&#xD;
      the presence of a mutation. In the majority of cases a single peak seen in a control sample&#xD;
      will produce two, three, or four peaks in the presence of a mutation. The shape of the peak&#xD;
      will help to identify mutations. Some mutations will be seen only as changes in the shape of&#xD;
      a single peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be scored based upon the elution profile of the DHPLC chromatogram. Different&#xD;
      profiles will be correlated to the disease symptom or disease status. Highly correlation of&#xD;
      elution profile as the part of mutation or polymorphisms will be sequenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Difficulties and Solutions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Further sequencing and comparing to our previous work will be used to verify the&#xD;
           mutation results of DHPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) will also be used if a specific mutation&#xD;
           has been detected by DHPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DHPLC will be used following the regulations in the common research office.&#xD;
