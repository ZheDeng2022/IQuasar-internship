      STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard surgical intervention for&#xD;
      obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in all but the largest of glands, which are&#xD;
      typically treated with open simple prostatectomy. Recently, new generation lasers (holmium&#xD;
      and potassium titanyl phosphate [KTP]) have been utilized for BPH treatment. Long-term&#xD;
      follow-up of laser prostatectomy outcomes must be documented to fully characterize the degree&#xD;
      of voiding improvement achievable by these new techniques, the durability of these outcomes,&#xD;
      and the safety profiles of these procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects over 40% of men over the age of 60 (Kirby RS,&#xD;
      2000). For patients with significant obstructive symptoms which are not helped by medical&#xD;
      therapy, surgical intervention is instituted. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP),&#xD;
      an endoscopic procedure where prostate tissue is sequentially removed with an electrocautery&#xD;
      loop, remains the gold standard to which other surgical therapies are compared.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, TURP is associated with significant patient morbidity such as blood loss and&#xD;
      dilutional hyponatremia, especially when resection times are prolonged (Mebust WK et al,&#xD;
      1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the long resection times and increased morbidity risks involved in patients with&#xD;
      extremely large prostate glands, open simple prostatectomy was traditionally employed in&#xD;
      place of TURP to remove the obstructing adenoma tissue. However, the patient could still&#xD;
      expect a prolonged hospital stay and a high likelihood of post-operative transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many alternative surgical treatments for BPH have been developed in an attempt to minimize&#xD;
      the morbidity profile of the more traditional surgical approaches. New generation holmium&#xD;
      (2140 nm wavelength) and KTP (532 nm wavelength) lasers now offer a minimally invasive&#xD;
      alternative to BPH treatment broadly termed laser prostatectomy. Within the category of laser&#xD;
      prostatectomy, two distinctly separate techniques have been developed. The first, laser&#xD;
      ablation, involves the vaporization of obstructive prostate tissue. Effective ablation can be&#xD;
      achieved with either the holmium or KTP laser. Previous groups have reported favorable&#xD;
      outcomes with minimal associated morbidity when treating smaller prostates with the laser&#xD;
      ablation technique (Hai MA and Malek RS, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The properties of the holmium laser also enable it to cut soft tissue while maintaining&#xD;
      hemostasis, such that it can be utilized for dissecting entire prostatic lobes away from the&#xD;
      prostatic capsule. This procedure has been termed holmium laser enucleation of the prostate&#xD;
      (HoLEP), and it can be performed on even the largest of glands to duplicate the results of&#xD;
      open simple prostatectomy with much less morbidity (Gilling PJ et al, 2000 and Moody JA and&#xD;
      Lingeman JE, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have performed both holmium and KTP prostate ablations and have had extensive clinical&#xD;
      experience with the HoLEP procedure. Our impressions of the various laser prostatectomy&#xD;
      procedure outcomes appear to substantiate the findings of the aforementioned studies.&#xD;
      However, extended follow-up of patients undergoing laser prostatectomies and documentation of&#xD;
      their outcomes and associated complications must be done in order to support the initial&#xD;
      conclusions of the previous investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To review the outcomes of our population of patients with BPH who have undergone laser&#xD;
      prostatectomy. We hypothesize that the long-term improvements in voiding parameters achieved&#xD;
      by these new laser procedures will compare favorably and perhaps be better than results&#xD;
      previously reported for TURP or, in the case of larger glands, open simple prostatectomy. In&#xD;
      addition, the adverse events/complication profile of the laser procedures should be better&#xD;
      than those of the traditional treatments. Once all retrospective data has been reviewed, we&#xD;
      will continue to collect outcome data on a prospective basis.&#xD;
