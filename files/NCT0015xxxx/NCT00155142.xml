      To address the following issues: (1) the course of small nerve fiber degeneration in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients, especially in asymptomatic patients; (2) the influence of blood sugar&#xD;
      control on development of the small fiber degeneration; (3) the correlation of skin&#xD;
      innervation with sensory thresholds, autonomic tests and parameters of nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies; and (4) the role of neurotrophins in diabetic neuropathy, we will perform skin&#xD;
      biopsy with quantification of IENF in type 2 diabetic patient without neurological symptoms.&#xD;
      The investigations all include clinical evaluation, electrophysiological studies,&#xD;
      quantitative sensory test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay of neurotrophins. The&#xD;
      analysis of skin innervation with diabetic parameters will give important insights into the&#xD;
      mechanism, prevention and management of small fiber neuropathy in neurologically asymptomatic&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic patients, and also therapeutic strategies for diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;

      Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common disorders in general population. The overall&#xD;
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes among people older than 40 years old in Taiwan is about 10 %.&#xD;
      Various complications are associated with diabetes and these complications have become an&#xD;
      important issue in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathy is one of the most frequent symptomatic complications of diabetes and is&#xD;
      potentially devastating. Small-fiber neuropathy is a major component of diabetic neuropathies&#xD;
      and usually causes disabling symptoms like pain and burning. It typically begins at the&#xD;
      distal limbs and progresses to the proximal part with time. Recent studies have indicated&#xD;
      that skin innervation is reduced in neurologically symptomatic type 2 diabetic patients and&#xD;
      the reduction is correlated with the duration of diabetes1. It is not clear whether similar&#xD;
      changes occur in neurologically asymptomatic type 2 diabetes. Neurovascular disturbance (i.e.&#xD;
      decreased skin blood flow) was noted in early and clinically silent diabetic patients and it&#xD;
      might represent the functional and organic abnormalities in small unmyelinated C fibers.&#xD;
      Along the same line it is reasonable to speculate that there might be changes in the skin&#xD;
      innervation in the preclinical phase of diabetic neuropathic patients. No previous studies&#xD;
      have investigated the course of the changes in skin innervation from early or asymptomatic&#xD;
      stage to symptomatic stage in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of diabetes and the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy had been studied by&#xD;
      the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group and the Kumamoto study in type 1&#xD;
      or 2 diabetes respectively. The results showed that intensive control of hyperglycemia could&#xD;
      prevent or delay the development of diabetic neuropathy. However the neuropathies in the&#xD;
      studies were assessed by nerve conduction studies. These examinations are insensitive to the&#xD;
      small fiber degeneration and it is not clear whether small fibers changes during intensive&#xD;
      diabetic control. There is also lack of direct pathogenic evidence regarding the effects of&#xD;
      diabetic control on the development of small fiber degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotrophins are a gene family of structurally related proteins that is released by target&#xD;
      tissues of responsive peripheral nerves, binds to specific receptors, and regulates gene&#xD;
      expression through the actions of second-messenger systems. Each member of the family has its&#xD;
      selectively tropical effects on peripheral nerves and plays a role in promoting neurite&#xD;
      outgrowth, inducing morphological differentiation, stimulating expression and release of&#xD;
      neurotransmitters and promoting nerve regeneration. It is hypothesized that abnormal&#xD;
      availability of neurotrophins is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Studies&#xD;
      have showed reduced seral level of neurotrophins in diabetic patients but it is not clear&#xD;
      whether the impact of this finding on the diabetic neuropathy. There have no studies&#xD;
      demonstrating if nay correlation between abnormal neurotrophins expression and the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of small fiber neuropathy in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy with quantification of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) is a new pathological&#xD;
      approach to study small fiber sensory neuropathy. By applying this technique with enzyme&#xD;
      linked immunosorbent assay, we will clarify the following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in skin innervation of neurologically asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The influence of diabetic control on the development of small fiber neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of neurotrophins on the pathogenesis of small fiber neuropathy.&#xD;
