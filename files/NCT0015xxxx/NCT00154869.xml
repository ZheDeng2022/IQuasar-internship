    <textblock>
      The investigators' pilot study indicates that hepatitis C virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV)-coinfected patients with predominantly active hepatitis C and those with predominantly&#xD;
      active hepatitis B may need different anti-viral regimens. Since in the majority of these&#xD;
      coinfected patients the hepatitis activity is more likely due to HCV than to HBV, the optimal&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen for HCV- and HBV-coinfected patients with predominantly active hepatitis&#xD;
      C will first be investigated. The combination therapy using pegylated interferons (IFNs) such&#xD;
      as PEG-IFN alfa-2a has been shown to have a superior efficacy than that using conventional&#xD;
      IFN in the treatment of monoinfected chronic hepatitis C. This new combination therapy might&#xD;
      also further enhance the treatment efficacy in HCV- and HBV- coinfected patients. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore propose to initiate a trial comparing the efficacy of pegylated IFN&#xD;
      plus ribavirin (RBV) in dual chronic hepatitis B and C versus that in chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      only, for both HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients. The efficacy using a 24-week combination&#xD;
      therapy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA is equivalent to that using a 48-week&#xD;
      combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype non-1 [Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002]. A&#xD;
      48-week course of pegylated IFN and RBV combination therapy, in contrast, has been shown to&#xD;
      yield a better efficacy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA in patients with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1 than a 24-week combination therapy in western countries [Hadziyannis et al, EASL&#xD;
      2002; Poynard et al, 1998]. The primary objective of the current proposal is to investigate&#xD;
      and compare the efficacy of combination therapy using pegylated IFN plus RBV on the clearance&#xD;
      of serum HCV RNA in both dually infected patients with a dominant HCV infection and HCV&#xD;
      monoinfected patients. Therefore, in this proposal, the treatment duration will be 24 weeks&#xD;
      for HCV genotype 2/3 in patients with dual chronic hepatitis C and B and in patients with&#xD;
      monoinfected HCV, and will be 48 weeks for HCV genotype 1 in patients with dual chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C and B and in patients with monoinfected HCV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around the world, the majority of hepatitis C patients suffer a monoinfected chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection. Current regimen on this group of patients received much attention and resulted in&#xD;
      rapid advances [McHutchison et al, 1998]. However, there are certain understudied populations&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis C [Strader DB, 2002]. One important group of them is the patients&#xD;
      co-infected by HBV. In hepatitis B or C endemic areas, the number of subjects with dual&#xD;
      infections of both hepatitis C and B is substantial [Chen et al, 1990; Tsai et al, 1994; Liaw&#xD;
      1995; Pramoolsinsap et al, 1999]. For example, in Taiwan, anti-HCV was present in 11% of&#xD;
      patients with HBV-related chronic liver diseases [Chen et al 1990; Liaw 1995], and HBsAg&#xD;
      positive rate was 12% in anti-HCV-positive patients [Tsai et al, 1994]. In Italy, the&#xD;
      prevalence of anti-HCV positivity can be as high as 40% in patients with chronic active&#xD;
      hepatitis B in some cities [Sagnelli et al, 1997]. Such co-infected patients are rarely&#xD;
      encountered in the developed countries, except in intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs or&#xD;
      those receiving hemodialysis. Alarmingly, the HCV- and HBV- coinfected patients have been&#xD;
      shown to carry a greater risk (1.5~5 folds) of developing LC or HCC than those with HCV or&#xD;
      HBV infection only [Liaw 1995; Donato et al, 1998; Yang et al, 2002; Sun et al, 2003].&#xD;
      Therefore, the HBV and HCV dually infected patients also need active treatments.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current therapeutic targets and ongoing protocols of clinical trials recruit&#xD;
      patients with HCV infection only and invariably exclude those co-infected with HBV. Thus, it&#xD;
      is warranted to address this important issue and an effective treatment for these hepatitis C&#xD;
      and B dually infected patients is desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic studies showed that IFN alone was not effective in clearing HCV or HBV in patients&#xD;
      dually infected with hepatitis B and C [Liaw 1995; Liaw et al, 1997; Weltman et al, 1995;&#xD;
      Mazzella et al, 1999; Guptan et al, 1999]. A recent study reported that dose augmentation of&#xD;
      IFN to 9 MU thrice weekly for 6 months could clear HCV in 31% of the patients [Villa et al,&#xD;
      2001]. Apparently, the efficacy was still not adequate. Because combining IFN with RBV has&#xD;
      been shown to yield much better results in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C than IFN&#xD;
      alone [Poynard et al, 1995; Davis et al, 1998; Reichard et al, 1998; McHutchison et al, 1998;&#xD;
      Lai et al, 1996; Liaw et al, 1997; Schalm et al, 1999], the combination therapy might also be&#xD;
      more effective in treating dual hepatitis B and C patients. To test this, we conducted a&#xD;
      pilot study using conventional IFN alfa plus ribavirin to treat 24 patients coinfected with&#xD;
      HCV and HBV. The 24-week combination regimen with IFN and ribavirin cleared HCV in 43% (9/21)&#xD;
      of the patients dually infected with hepatitis B and C. The result was comparable to that in&#xD;
      patients with monoinfected chronic hepatitis C. Normalization of serum ALT was obtained in&#xD;
      38% of the patients 24 weeks after the end of the treatment. In addition, we found that&#xD;
      although the end-of-treatment clearance rate of HCV RNA was comparable between patients&#xD;
      infected with genotype 1b and those with genotype 2a or 2b, the clearance of HCV RNA&#xD;
      sustained much less commonly in those infected by HCV genotype 1b (21% vs. 86%, P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Actually, two recent studies from southern Taiwan also demonstrated that the efficacy of&#xD;
      combination therapy using interferon plus ribavirin on the clearance of serum HCV RNA was&#xD;
      comparable between HBV and HCV coinfected patients versus HCV monoinfected patients [Wang et&#xD;
      al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003]. Based on these findings, we suggested that comparable efficacy&#xD;
      of combination therapy using interferon plus ribavirin on the clearance of serum HCV RNA can&#xD;
      be achieved in patients with HBV and HCV coinfected patients versus HCV monoinfected&#xD;
      patients. Nevertheless, a more effective regimen is still needed for those dually infected&#xD;
      patients, particularly for those with HCV genotype 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our pilot study, we treated 24 patients coinfected with HCV and HBV as a single group. The&#xD;
      majority of these patients had detectable hepatitis C viremia, but were anti-HBe positive and&#xD;
      with a lower serum HBV titer. Therefore, hepatitic activity was more likely due to HCV than&#xD;
      to HBV. Nevertheless, a few patients were HBeAg positive and had a higher serum HBV titer&#xD;
      (&gt;105 copies/mL) but with a low or undetectable serum HCV RNA. In them, the hepatitis was&#xD;
      likely due to active hepatitis B. Importantly; none of the dually infected patients with&#xD;
      predominantly active hepatitis B had biochemical and HCV virologic response both at the end&#xD;
      of combination therapy and at 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up. These two groups of patients&#xD;
      may need different anti-viral regimens according to the major offending virus in the liver.&#xD;
      To treat dual hepatitis C and B patients with dominantly active hepatitis C, we may use IFN&#xD;
      (conventional or pegylated form) and RBV, and the treatment schedule may be extended to one&#xD;
      year to enhance the efficacy for those with HCV genotype 1. However, to treat dually infected&#xD;
      patients with a dominant HBV infection, the treatment strategy may be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our pilot study indicates that HCV- and HBV-coinfected patients with predominantly active&#xD;
      hepatitis C and those with predominantly active hepatitis B may need different anti-viral&#xD;
      regimens. Since in the majority of these coinfected patients the hepatitis activity is more&#xD;
      likely due to HCV than to HBV, the optimal therapeutic regimen for HCV- and HBV-coinfected&#xD;
      patients with predominantly active hepatitis C will first be investigated. The combination&#xD;
      therapy using pegylated IFNs such as PEG-IFN alfa-2a has been shown to have a superior&#xD;
      efficacy than that using conventional IFN in the treatment of monoinfected chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      C. This new combination therapy might also further enhance the treatment efficacy in HCV- and&#xD;
      HBV- coinfected patients. We therefore propose to initiate a trial comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      pegylated IFN plus RBV in dual chronic hepatitis B and C vs. that in chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      only, for both HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients. The efficacy using a 24-week combination&#xD;
      therapy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA is equivalent to that using a 48-week&#xD;
      combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype non-1 [Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002]. A&#xD;
      48-week course of pegylated IFN and RBV combination therapy, in contrast, has been shown to&#xD;
      yield a better efficacy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA in patients with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1 than a 24-week combination therapy in western countries [Hadziyannis et al, EASL&#xD;
      2002; Poynard et al, 1998]. The primary objective of the current proposal is to investigate&#xD;
      and compare the efficacy of combination therapy using pegylated IFN plus RBV on the clearance&#xD;
      of serum HCV RNA in both dually infected patients with a dominant HCV infection and HCV&#xD;

      for HCV genotype 2/3 in patients with dual chronic hepatitis C and B and in patients with&#xD;
      monoinfected HCV, and will be 48 weeks for HCV genotype 1 in patients with dual chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C and B and in patients with monoinfected HCV.&#xD;
