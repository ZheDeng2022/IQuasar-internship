      One of the consequences of breast cancer treatment for younger women is the abrupt onset of&#xD;
      menopause and its related symptoms. Menopausal symptoms disrupt usual activities, alter sleep&#xD;
      patterns and decrease quality of life. The purpose of this randomized feasibility pilot study&#xD;
      is to examine mindfulness meditation for menopausal symptom management for women who are&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors and for women with naturally occurring menopause. The study is&#xD;
      designed to: 1. establish the feasibility of a mindfulness meditation program for women who&#xD;
      experience menopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flushes). 2. explore the treatment benefit of a&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation program for menopausal symptom relief using changes in frequency and&#xD;
      severity of hot flushes; frequency of sleep disruption, various aspects of quality of life&#xD;
      and physiologic stress response (cortisol) as outcome measures. 3. evaluate whether the&#xD;
      treatment benefits of mindfulness meditation differ in menopausal women with naturally&#xD;
      occurring menopause versus women with menopause secondary to chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the attention control group will be offered meditation training&#xD;
      after completion of the intervention and follow up phases. Participants will attend 8&#xD;
      meditation sessions or 8 attention control sessions. Study variables are Menopausal Hot&#xD;
      Flushes (self report &amp; skin conductance monitoring), Sleep Disruption (Pgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index), Physiologic Stress Response (cortisol), Quality of Life (Menopausal Quality of Life);&#xD;
      and Protocol Design (recruitment &amp; retention rates, exit interviews). A convenience sample of&#xD;
      60 women who experience menopausal symptoms will be recruited.&#xD;

      One of the consequences of breast cancer treatment for younger women is the abrupt onset of&#xD;
      menopause and its related symptoms. Menopausal symptoms disrupt usual activities, alter sleep&#xD;
      patterns and decrease quality of life. In light of the recent findings from the Women's&#xD;
      Health Initiative (re:use of exogenous estrogen), the need to investigate non-hormonal&#xD;
      approaches (meditation) for short-term menopausal symptom discomfort is high. The purpose of&#xD;
      this randomized feasibility pilot study is to examine mindfulness meditation for menopausal&#xD;
      symptom management for women who are breast cancer survivors and for women with naturally&#xD;
      occurring menopause. The study is designed to: 1. establish the feasibility of a mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation program for women who experience menopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flushes). 2.&#xD;
      explore the treatment benefit of a mindfulness meditation program for menopausal symptom&#xD;
      relief using changes in frequency and severity of hot flushes; frequency of sleep disruption,&#xD;
      various aspects of quality of life and physiologic stress response (cortisol) as outcome&#xD;
      measures. 3. evaluate whether the treatment benefits of mindfulness meditation differ in&#xD;
      menopausal women with naturally occurring menopause versus women with menopause secondary to&#xD;
      chemotherapy for breast cancer. A 2x2 factorial repeated design will be used. The four&#xD;
      randomized groups will consist of 1) naturally occurring menopause meditation; 2) naturally&#xD;
      occurring menopause attention control; 3) breast cancer survivors meditation; 4) breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors attention. Participants randomized to the attention control group will be&#xD;
      offered meditation training after completion of the intervention and follow up phases.&#xD;
      Participants will attend 8 meditation sessions or 8 attention control sessions. Study&#xD;
      variables are Menopausal Hot Flushes (self report &amp; skin conductance monitoring), Sleep&#xD;
      Disruption (Pgh Sleep Quality Index), Physiologic Stress Response (cortisol), Quality of Life&#xD;
      (Menopausal Quality of Life); and Protocol Design (recruitment &amp; retention rates, exit&#xD;
      interviews). A convenience sample of 60 women who experience menopausal symptoms will be&#xD;
      recruited. Data analysis includes descriptive statistics, repeated measures content analysis.&#xD;
      Results from this feasibility pilot study will inform the design of a larger randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to test the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation as a self care&#xD;
      intervention for menopausal symptom management and improvement in quality of life.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  . Subjects will be selected based on their self-identification of menopausal hot&#xD;
             flushes. Subjects may identify other menopausal symptoms but must have hot flushes.&#xD;
             Inclusion criteria will include English speaking, self-identification of the&#xD;
             menopausal symptom of hot flushes following treatment for breast cancer (stage I or&#xD;
             II) and amenorrhea secondary to breast cancer treatment or for women with naturally&#xD;
             occurring menopause amenorrhea of greater that one year but less than three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria are, for women with breast cancer, amenorrhea of greater that one&#xD;
             year prior to their diagnosis of breast cancer. Also, excluded is concurrent treatment&#xD;
             of menopausal symptoms with hormonal supplementation, herbal remedies, acupuncture,&#xD;
             acupressure or non-hormonal pharmacologic agents prescribed at doses specifically for&#xD;
             hot flush relief (beta blockers, SSRIs). However, women taking either serotonin&#xD;
             reuptake inhibitors for depression or beta-blockers for hypertension who exhibit hot&#xD;
             flushes sufficient to meet inclusion criteria will be accepted into the study.&#xD;
             Previous treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormones, herbs or acupuncture,&#xD;
             structured meditation and/or regular yoga practice must have ceased at least three&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment in the study to allow for a sufficient wash out period.&#xD;
             Women who are presently in chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer are excluded due&#xD;
             to the potential confounding effect of mindfulness meditation on quality of life due&#xD;
             to chemotherapy symptom relief. Women with a moderate to severe level of depression&#xD;
             (&gt;27), or suicidal thoughts or wishes, as measured by the Beck Depression Index, 2nd&#xD;
             Ed (BDI-II), will be excluded and referred for treatment. However, following treatment&#xD;
             for depression, they may enroll in the study assuming continuation of hot flushes at&#xD;
             inclusion criteria levels.&#xD;
