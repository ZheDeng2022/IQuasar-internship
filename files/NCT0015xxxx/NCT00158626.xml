  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of undertaking a multi-centre&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of a pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)&#xD;
      intervention for women with pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common female condition; it is estimated that 50% of women&#xD;
      experience some degree of prolapse and 30% of attendees at gynaecology clinics present with&#xD;
      this problem. Vaginal delivery is cited as the main cause of prolapse but menopause, heavy&#xD;
      lifting, chronic cough and straining are also important factors. Symptoms associated with&#xD;
      prolapse are backache, pelvic heaviness and bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. Thus, the&#xD;
      condition is debilitating and can greatly affect the sufferer's daily activities and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, treatment of prolapse consists of surgery or conservative treatment. Surgical&#xD;
      procedures to repair the fascia vary and improved techniques are constantly being sought. At&#xD;
      present however the recurrence rate of prolapse after surgery is 25%, with 80% re-occurring&#xD;
      within two years of surgery. Conservative treatment is often considered if the prolapse is&#xD;
      small or the patient is not a good candidate for surgery. There are three types of&#xD;
      conservative treatment: 1) Physical interventions that aim to improve pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      function by using pelvic floor muscle assessment and exercises, neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, 2) Mechanical interventions that aim to manage the prolapse by supporting the&#xD;
      pelvic area (e.g. using vaginal ring pessaries) and, 3) Lifestyle interventions (such as&#xD;
      weight loss and reducing exacerbating activities) that seek to avoid exacerbation of the&#xD;
      prolapse by decreasing intra-abdominal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The promotion of pelvic floor exercises (PFEs) for prolapse varies between hospitals with&#xD;
      some providing only a patient information leaflet and others giving individual instruction&#xD;
      from a physiotherapist. Such a programme is referred to as pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      (PFMT). An ongoing Cochrane review of the literature has, to date, found no evidence for&#xD;
      management of pelvic organ prolapse using PFMT. This proposal addresses a gap in the research&#xD;
      evidence by developing a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of a PFMT intervention for&#xD;
      women with prolapse. The feasibility of all aspects of such a trial will be assessed, and&#xD;
      pilot data will be collected at two Scottish Centres (Glasgow and Aberdeen). Ultimately, a&#xD;
      multi-centre trial would aim to establish if PFMT is better than standardised management for&#xD;
      reducing prolapse specific symptoms, prolapse severity, the need for surgical prolapse repair&#xD;
      and the costs associated with the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 women attending out-patient clinics who are suitable for the study will be randomised to&#xD;
      either the control or intervention arm of the trial. Women in the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive an individualised programme of PFMT delivered by a physiotherapist via 5 sessions of&#xD;
      physiotherapy over a 16 week period. This programme will include pelvic muscle assessment,&#xD;
      teaching and prescription of pelvic floor exercises, and provision of lifestyle advice. Women&#xD;
      in the control arm will only receive, by post, a lifestyle advice leaflet. Type and severity&#xD;
      of prolapse will be quantified according to ICS guidelines (POP-Q method). Data on outcome&#xD;
      measures relating to improvement in prolapse symptoms and associated quality of life will be&#xD;
      obtained via self-completion questionnaires&#xD;
