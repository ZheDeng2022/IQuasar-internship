      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible candidate gene of Primary Angle-Closure&#xD;
      Glaucoma.&#xD;

      Glaucoma has long been recognised as a leading cause of blindness, and that the scale of the&#xD;
      problem will only increase with future population growth and increasing life expectancy (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiological information available in 1993 in the World Health Organization's (WHO)&#xD;
      global data bank on blindness was reviewed by Thylefors and Négrel (1). They developed a&#xD;
      simple model estimating the number of glaucoma blind people in each World Bank region.&#xD;
      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) was judged to be responsible for three million blind,&#xD;
      primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) for two million, and for congenital glaucoma the figure&#xD;
      was 200 000, giving a total of 5.2 million blind. This represents 15% of global blindness.&#xD;
      The number of people affected by glaucoma was estimated to be about 20 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, Quigley used 111 published reports of glaucoma prevalence to construct a statistical&#xD;
      model of the number of people affected by glaucoma worldwide (2). Data were included only if&#xD;
      the study design, methods, and reported results met certain specific criteria. The countries&#xD;
      of the world were arranged in seven groups according to similarities in ethnicity and&#xD;
      presumed characteristics of glaucoma. For each region, the available age specific prevalence&#xD;
      of OAG and ACG were applied to population projections for the year 2000. It was estimated&#xD;
      that 66.8 million people were affected by OAG and ACG, with nearly equal numbers of people&#xD;
      affected by each disease. Few prevalence studies described secondary glaucoma separately, but&#xD;
      an estimate of six million for secondary glaucoma was reached, making a total, without&#xD;
      childhood glaucoma, of around 73 million affected. Of these, 6.7 million were thought to be&#xD;
      blind (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was reliable epidemiologic evidence to suggest that PACG is more common among Eskimos&#xD;
      (3) and Chinese (4). As POAG was common in the western countries, there was a large&#xD;
      population at risk in Asia (5). PACG among Asians was more frequently chronic and has few&#xD;
      symptoms (6). Therefore, persons might not be motivated by symptoms to present to medical&#xD;
      attention until significant visual damage has occurred in this region. A population-based&#xD;
      study of screening techniques for PACG was performed in the township of Jin Shan in rural&#xD;
      Taiwan (7). This joint US-Taiwanese project, published in 1996, identified a target&#xD;
      population of 5441 people aged 40 years and older, of whom 562 were examined. A gonioscopic&#xD;
      examination was carried out on all subjects. PACG was diagnosed in people with a &quot;narrow&quot;&#xD;
      angle and either an IOP &gt;18 mm Hg, an increase in IOP 8 mm Hg on dark prone provocation test,&#xD;
      or a previous &quot;acute&quot; episode of angle closure with an iridectomy. The diagnosis did not&#xD;
      depend on the presence of a visual field defect or structural optic neuropathy. There were 17&#xD;
      people diagnosed as suffering PACG (3.0%). Only 35% of cases gave a history of symptoms&#xD;
      characteristic of &quot;acute&quot; angle closure. Two of these 17 people (12%) were blind in both eyes&#xD;
      (7). As aforementioned, Taiwan has a high prevalence of PACG, which usually leads to&#xD;
      blindness ultimately. There are many reported studies on genes of POAG and normal-tension&#xD;
      glaucoma from Asia, including Japan (14,21,29), China (25), and Korea (24). However, studies&#xD;
      about genetics of PACG were lacking. Hence, in this study, we use the model of genomewide&#xD;
      microsatellite genotyping with method of linkage disequilibrium to study the possible&#xD;
      candidate gene of PACG. Then, we will further sequence the cDNA forPAX6 to find out the&#xD;
      possible mutation in the family with well-defined pedigree.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An occludable angle was defined as one in which less than 90° circumference of the&#xD;
             pigmented trabecular meshwork was visible. Persons in whom primary angle-closure was&#xD;
             suspected (PACS) had an occludable angle and no other abnormality. Primary angle&#xD;
             closure (PAC) was diagnosed in persons with a normal visual field and optic disc but&#xD;
             having an occludable angle and evidence of angle dysfunction. Dysfunctional features&#xD;
             included elevated IOP (&gt;19 mm Hg) or a positive darkroom-prone provocation test,&#xD;
             peripheral anterior synechiae, pigment smearing in superior drainage angle, sequelae&#xD;
             of acute angle closure (iris whorling or glaukomflecken), or a clear history of&#xD;
             symptomatic angle closure with evidence of a peripheral iridectomy. An IOP of 19 mm Hg&#xD;
             was chosen by taking the mean +2 SDs from other data on Sino-Mongoloid people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Primary angle-closure glaucoma was diagnosed in subjects with an occludable drainage angle&#xD;
        and glaucomatous optic neuropathy with compatible visual morbidity. Optic neuropathy was&#xD;
        defined as a CDR of 0.7 or more, or asymmetry of 0.2 or more. In early to moderate cases&#xD;
        (CDR of 0.7 or 0.8 or asymmetry of 0.2), a reproducible visual field defect was required to&#xD;
        confirm the diagnosis. In advanced cases (CDR &gt;=0.9 or CDR asymmetry &gt;0.3), perimetric&#xD;
        evidence of visual loss was not an absolute requirement. Primary angle-closure glaucoma was&#xD;
        diagnosed if the disc was not visible, but iris stromal atrophy and whorling were seen in&#xD;
        conjunction with a visual acuity less than 20/400.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals are excluded if there is known ocular disease or insult that could&#xD;
             predispose to myopia, such as retinopathy of prematurity or early-age media&#xD;
             opacification, or if they had a known genetic disease associated with myopia, such as&#xD;
             Stickler or Marfan syndrome.&#xD;
