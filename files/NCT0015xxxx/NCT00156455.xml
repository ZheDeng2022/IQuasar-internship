      This is an exploratory study designed to evaluate the incidence of, and to quantify sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing following stage I Norwood reconstructive surgery. Sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing will be correlated with:&#xD;

        1. Elevations in pulmonary vasculature resistance at the time of Stage II surgery.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory study designed to evaluate the incidence of, and to quantify sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing following stage I Norwood reconstructive surgery. Sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing will be correlated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elevations in pulmonary vasculature resistance at the time of Stage II surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risks of death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with single ventricle physiology are exquisitely sensitive to alterations in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance. Following their first operative repair (stage I Norwood),&#xD;
      performed in their first week of life, pulmonary and systemic circulations are in parallel&#xD;
      rather than series. As such, elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance can result in severe&#xD;
      arterial desaturation. Additionally, elevated pre-operative pulmonary artery pressure is&#xD;
      directly correlated with poor survival following the third and final operative repair (stage&#xD;
      III Norwood, or Fontan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic breathing is a normal breathing pattern in sleeping infants. At the other end of the&#xD;
      spectrum is sleep apnea. In between lies a continuum of sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea has an incidence of approximately 2% in children, and is associated&#xD;
      with pulmonary and systemic hypertension. Specific studies of the incidence and effects of&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing in congenital heart disease are lacking. Otherwise normal children&#xD;
      have baseline oxygen saturation in the high 90's, thereby placing them on the flat part of&#xD;
      the oxyhemoglobin curve. But children with cyanotic congenital heart disease live with&#xD;
      baseline oxygen saturations in the mid 70's, so that they exist on the steep part of the&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. We hypothesize therefore that these patients are at&#xD;
      increased risk for the hemodynamic variations occurring during apneas/hypopneas even when&#xD;
      they are more subtle, namely during sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that children who have completed stage I Norwood will experience more&#xD;
      significant arterial desaturations during sleep associated apneic events (due to the&#xD;
      concurrent elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure) than their normal counterparts.&#xD;
      Additionally we hypothesize that children who experience more frequent apneic events during&#xD;
      sleep will have elevated pre-operative pulmonary artery pressures and therefore worse outcome&#xD;
      following stage II Norwood. Thus, we speculate that children who have completed stage I&#xD;
      Norwood are more prone to the risks of sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic regulation, mediated in part by aortic arch baroreceptors, is undoubtedly disrupted&#xD;
      by the extensive surgical reconstruction required at the aortic arch during stage I Norwood&#xD;
      palliation. Adults and children with severe sleep disordered breathing (obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea) have impaired cardiac autonomic control, and increased cardiac electrical instability,&#xD;
      with greater occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Apneic events place a hypoxic, mechanical&#xD;
      and adrenergic load on the cardiovascular system thereby directly resulting in ventricular&#xD;
      dysrhythmias. Observed late deaths following stage I Norwood are usually postulated to be&#xD;
      secondary to fatal arrhythmias. Thus, we hypothesize that children who experience more&#xD;
      frequent apneic events during sleep will have an increased risk of interstage mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disordered breathing is a readily treatable condition in the pediatric population.&#xD;
      Non-invasive, continuous positive airway pressure applied via a nasal mask is effective in&#xD;
      treating sleep disordered breathing in infants. Thus, if sleep disordered breathing is&#xD;
      identified, effective treatment is available and may reduce the risk of inter-stage mortality&#xD;
      and adverse hemodynamics in this medically fragile population.&#xD;
