  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly communicable and virulent diseases, the ongoing threat of emerging infectious&#xD;
      diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health&#xD;
      care workers. SARS transmission has occurred despite the use of droplet, contact, and&#xD;
      airborne precautions. Potential explanations for some of the episodes of&#xD;
      &quot;through-precautions&quot; transmission include the possibility of contamination during removal of&#xD;
      protective clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended protective systems (PPS) for aerosol generating procedures set out by the US&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long&#xD;
      Term Care (MOHLTC) differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The failure of a PPS may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if a difference exists between the rate of self-contamination due to deficiencies&#xD;
      in contact precautions for individuals wearing either the CDC or MOHLTC recommended PPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will don one of the two recommended PPS, be &quot;contaminated&quot; with an&#xD;
      indicator that becomes visible under ultraviolet light, and then assessed for contamination&#xD;
      of clothing layers and skin after removal of the PPS. They will then repeat the procedure&#xD;
      using the other PPS.&#xD;

      Background: Highly communicable and virulent diseases such as severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome (SARS) and &quot;avian influenza&quot;, the ongoing threat of other emerging infectious&#xD;
      diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health&#xD;
      care workers (1). Recent experience with SARS has demonstrated that front-line health care&#xD;
      professionals who perform or assist with aerosol generating procedures are at particularly&#xD;
      increased risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, no data exists addressing the question of self-contamination during the removal&#xD;
      of personal protective systems used in a health care setting. The latest suggested donning&#xD;
      and removal procedures have not been validated with respect to the issue of selfcontamination&#xD;
      due to deficiencies in contact precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The failure of a personal protective system or the donning and removal procedures for a&#xD;
      personal protective system may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. It is imperative that the rate of&#xD;
      self-contamination for these two personal protective systems be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists between the rate of&#xD;
      self-contamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions for individuals wearing either&#xD;
      Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or the Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Ethics Committee approval will be obtained for this study. Fifty participants&#xD;
      will be required for the study. Participants will be recruited from the Department of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology attending and resident staff, other physician groups requiring PAPR training,&#xD;
      and the Department of Respiratory Therapy. Recruitment will occur in conjunction with annual&#xD;
      training in the use of the PAPR. Individuals will be informed of the purpose and procedure of&#xD;
      the study and written consent will be obtained. Individuals will be excluded if they refuse&#xD;
      to provide written consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear operating room scrub attire as their base clothing layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be randomized to don either the PAPR or PPE. They will then repeat the process&#xD;
      using the other personal protective system immediately after the study protocol has been&#xD;
      completed using the first personal protective system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPE will consist of an N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid&#xD;
      resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile gloves. Although the CDC has omitted a head&#xD;
      covering as part of their PPE, the MOHLTC directives stipulate that a head covering must be&#xD;
      worn when performing high-risk procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and&#xD;
      contact precautions. A head covering (bouffant hair cover) will therefore form part of the&#xD;
      PPE used in this study. The CDC recommendations state that goggles can be worn for eye&#xD;
      protection. A face shield can be used in addition to the goggles but this is optional. The&#xD;
      MOHLTC directives state that goggles and a face shield must be worn during high-risk&#xD;
      procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and contact precautions. Goggles and&#xD;
      a face shield will therefore form part of the PPE for this study. Therefore the donning and&#xD;
      removal instructions for the PPE that will be used for this study will differ in sequence&#xD;
      from those published by the CDC. The donning and removal procedures that will be used for&#xD;
      this study more closely follow the sequence recommended by the MOHLTC and are indeed an&#xD;
      enhanced version of those directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAPR will consist of a body suit and shoe covers, PAPR hood and power unit, N95 respirator,&#xD;
      goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile&#xD;
      gloves. The MOHLTC has stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches for the PAPR. Neither&#xD;
      the CDC, the MOHLTC, nor our institution have stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches&#xD;
      for the PPE. The intent of this study is to examine the protective systems. The donning and&#xD;
      removal procedures that form part of the protective systems may either contribute to or&#xD;
      minimize self-contamination rates and must be assessed under the actual conditions of use. In&#xD;
      order to best simulate the actual conditions that health care workers will be subjected to&#xD;
      and to best evaluate donning and removal procedures and practices we have also decided not to&#xD;
      employ a donning/removal coach for the PPE. Accordingly, during donning and removal of PPE&#xD;
      participants will be given standardized written instructions outlining the donning and&#xD;
      removal procedure but will not be coached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given standardized written instructions and coached by a respiratory&#xD;
      therapist during donning and removal of the PAPR. The standardized written instructions for&#xD;
      donning and removal of both the PPE and PAPR are attached in Appendices A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be timed and videotaped during the protective system donning procedure.&#xD;
      Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading 3 their written&#xD;
      donning instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says &quot;begin&quot; for the PAPR. Timing&#xD;
      will cease when the participants have completed donning the final item of the protective&#xD;
      system being tested. Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of&#xD;
      any protective system donning procedure violations. A donning procedure violation will be&#xD;
      defined as having occurred if the participants perform a donning maneuver out of sequence or&#xD;
      touch a piece of protective equipment out of sequence. Participants will be &quot;contaminated&quot;&#xD;
      using a solution of fluorescein (1ml of a 25% solution diluted in 100cc sterile water) in a&#xD;
      standardized fashion. A Devilbiss atomizer (Model DV-15-RD, Sunrise Medical Products,&#xD;
      Carlsbad, California, USA) will be used to apply 5ml of fluorescein solution to the their&#xD;
      front face shield and torso. We have chosen these contamination sites in order to simulate&#xD;
      areas that would most likely be contaminated by the large respiratory droplets aerosolized by&#xD;
      a patient that is either coughing or reacting to intubation attempts or any other high-risk&#xD;
      respiratory procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The atomizer nozzle will be held at a distance of 30cm from the participants' face-shield and&#xD;
      will be applied from their shoulder level. The spray stream will be directed at the&#xD;
      participants' nose and then aimed inferiorly towards the their umbilicus in an upwards and&#xD;
      downwards sweeping motion while keeping the atomizer oriented in the participants'&#xD;
      mid-saggital plane. Application will occur until the atomizer reservoir is empty. During this&#xD;
      application the participants' eyes will be closed. &quot;Invisible&quot; Detection Paste (Sirchie, 100&#xD;
      Hunter Place, Youngsville, NC) will be applied to the palmar aspects of the participants'&#xD;
      hands and anterior and posterior forearm to the elbow. Although the paste is labeled&#xD;
      &quot;invisible detection paste&quot; it becomes visible when viewed under ultraviolet (UV) light. 15ml&#xD;
      of paste will be used. We have chosen to use detection paste on the forearms and gloves of&#xD;
      the study participants as these are the areas most likely to come in contact with any patient&#xD;
      requiring enhanced contact and respiratory precautions. Participants will be videotaped,&#xD;
      photographed with a digital camera, and assessed with a UV lamp (Burton Medical Products Inc,&#xD;
      21100 Lassen Street, Chatsworth, CA. 91311 USA) following contamination to ensure that&#xD;
      standardized contamination of their front face shield, torso, forearm, and palmar aspect of&#xD;
      the gloved hands has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then follow the standardized written removal procedures for the protective&#xD;
      system that they are wearing. They will be timed and videotaped during the protective system&#xD;
      removal procedure. Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading&#xD;
      their written removal instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says &quot;begin&quot; for the&#xD;
      PAPR. Timing will be paused during assessments with the UV lamp. Timing will cease when the&#xD;
      participants have completed removing the final item of the protective system being tested.&#xD;
      Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of any protective&#xD;
      system removal procedure violations. A removal procedure violation will be defined as having&#xD;
      occurred if the participants perform a removal maneuver out of sequence, touch a piece of&#xD;
      protective equipment out 4 of sequence, or touch any part of their body other than a piece of&#xD;
      protective equipment prior to performing final hand disinfection. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed with the UV lamp at specific intervals during the removal procedure in order to&#xD;
      detect any visible contamination. Participants in PPE will be assessed with the UV lamp&#xD;
      following removal of the outer PPE protective layer (outer fitted sterile gloves, fluid&#xD;
      resistant surgical gown, and faceshield).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PPE protective layer (N95 mask,&#xD;
      goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner fitted sterile gloves). Participants in PAPR will be&#xD;
      assessed using the UV lamp after removal of the outer PAPR protective layer (PAPR hood and&#xD;
      power unit, outer fluid resistant surgical gown, outer boot covers, outer fitted sterile&#xD;
      gloves). They will then be assessed after removal of the middle PAPR protective layer (body&#xD;
      suit, middle sterile fitted gloves, boot covers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PAPR protective layer (N95 mask,&#xD;
      goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner sterile fitted gloves). An evaluator blinded to the&#xD;
      participants' protective system will perform final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All areas of the participants' base clothing layer and any exposed skin and hair will be&#xD;
      inspected after removal of the final protective layer. This will include the participants'&#xD;
      face. Contamination episodes will be counted and the contamination area will be calculated in&#xD;
      cm2.&#xD;
