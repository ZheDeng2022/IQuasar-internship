      Twelve subjects will be sought for this study. Six subjects will receive the DYNESYS system&#xD;
      and six subjects will receive a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with the Silhouette&#xD;
      device. All subjects will already be participating in the DYNESYS multi-center study (under&#xD;
      IRB #4884) and will have been randomized to either group. Five tantalum beads will be&#xD;
      inserted into each vertebra associated with the DYNESYS or fusion surgery. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed in conjunction with the multi-center follow-up schedule and will have RSA exams at&#xD;
      the following time points after surgery: 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Standing neutral,&#xD;
      flexion, extension, and lateral bending films will be collected at each time point and the&#xD;
      amount of motion in each direction of the &quot;marked&quot; vertebrae will be measured. The time&#xD;
      points have been selected based on their clinical relevance for comparison against the&#xD;
      standard of care, which is the fusion procedure. Depending on the initial tension of the&#xD;
      annular fibers, it is possible the DYNESYS will exhibit more motion with time. The time&#xD;
      points are important to track the potential changes.&#xD;

      The amount of motion of the vertebrae following spinal surgery is important in determining&#xD;
      the success of a procedure. Assessment of spinal motion has been, and continues to be, a&#xD;
      difficult clinical problem. Errors of up to 10 degrees for simple measurements of flexion,&#xD;
      extension, and side bending have been recorded using conventional radiographs. It has&#xD;
      therefore been difficult to accurately measure changes in spinal motion using conventional&#xD;
      radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiostereometric Analysis, or RSA, is an accurate in vivo measurement technique using two&#xD;
      simultaneous radiographs for examining spinal motion. The measurement accuracy offered by&#xD;
      this technique far exceeds the manual techniques currently used. In addition to improved&#xD;
      accuracy, it provides more information on spinal motion in comparison to conventional&#xD;
      radiographs. Utilization of the RSA technology at the IHP and the United States is in its&#xD;
      infancy. The investigators have placed much effort over the past 1-2 years to put the&#xD;
      necessary dedicated resources and personnel in place. This has been a collaborative effort&#xD;
      between the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and the Imaging Core at IHP. Preliminary work on&#xD;
      the accuracy, reliability, and surgical planning for use of RSA has been completed and&#xD;
      presented at national conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion in the lumbar spine in patients&#xD;
      with a dynamic stabilization system, DYNESYS. Currently the DYNESYS is under investigation as&#xD;
      part of a multi-center clinical trial (IRB # 4884). The DYNESYS system is designed to allow&#xD;
      for some motion in the spine while providing the necessary stability to the spinal segment.&#xD;
      The amount and degree of this motion is currently unknown. By using tantalum bead markers&#xD;
      placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can determine the amount of&#xD;
      motion the DYNESYS system provides. Normal spinal motion of the lower spine is approximately&#xD;
      18 and 12 degrees for flexion/extension and lateral bending, respectively. Lumbar interbody&#xD;
      fusion, which is the current standard surgical procedure, results in 5 degrees or less of&#xD;
      spinal motion. Since the DYNESYS provides dynamic stabilization, it is estimated that there&#xD;
      will be a 20% loss of motion with the DYNESYS in comparison to normal motion. Two questions&#xD;
      will be examined in this study: 1) what is the amount of flexion/extension and lateral&#xD;
      bending motion that occurs in the spine with a dynamic stabilization system in relation to a&#xD;
      lumbar interbody fusion procedure? and 2) will the amount of motion change during the time&#xD;
      frame of the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 12 patients (6 with DYNESYS and 6 with posterior lumbar interbody&#xD;
      fusion, PLIF) here at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Any subject who is part of the DYNESYS&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial (IRB # 4884) will be approached to participate in this RSA study.&#xD;
      The subjects will already have been randomly assigned to the fusion group or the DYNESYS&#xD;
      group. The RSA study is a single center, non-randomized design. All 12 subjects will have&#xD;
      10-15 tantalum markers placed in their spine at the time of their DYNESYS or fusion surgery.&#xD;
      After surgery, subjects will have the special x-rays taken and the RSA analysis will be&#xD;
      completed. Subjects will be seen at the following time points after surgery: 3, 6, 12, 18,&#xD;
      and 24 months.&#xD;
