  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a web-based pilot study to evaluate the association between the treatment of anemia&#xD;
      with darbepoetin alfa (aranesp) and the clinical benefits in symptom palliation, improved&#xD;
      functional status and quality of life in patients with cancer. The feasibility of web-based&#xD;
      assessments and data capture will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia associated with lung cancer and chemotherapy is an important factor effecting patient&#xD;
      symptoms, functional status, and overall quality of life (Groopman and Itri 1999; Langer,&#xD;
      Choy et al. 2002). Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) has demonstrated a significant effect upon&#xD;
      ameliorating chemotherapy-induced anemia in lung cancer (Vansteenkiste, Pirker et al. 2002;&#xD;
      Vansteenkiste, Poulsen et al. 2002). This trial is designed to evaluate the association&#xD;
      between the treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa and direct electronic capture of&#xD;
      clinical benefits in cancer-related symptoms, functional status and overall quality of life.&#xD;
      This trial uses a secure web-based design to capture the patient-associated symptoms,&#xD;
      functional status and quality of life. This novel secure web-based system was selected to&#xD;
      improve the efficiency and quality of clinical data capture. If our hypothesis is correct,&#xD;
      treatment with darbepoetin alfa will be associated with improved palliation of cancer-related&#xD;
      symptoms, improved functional status, and result in overall benefits to the patient's&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. The development of a web-based system to directly capture&#xD;
      patient-related symptoms, functional status and quality of life will permit us in the future&#xD;
      to conduct a national or international trial addressing the effects of darbepoetin alfa on&#xD;
      these factors. If our hypothesis is incorrect, it may be that these parameters are not&#xD;
      affected by the correction of anemia with darbepoetin alfa or the measures are not sensitive&#xD;
      enough to detect these differences. A notable finding would be a clearly defined improvement&#xD;
      in symptom palliation, functional status, and quality of life associated with darbepoetin&#xD;
      alfa therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The allocation to the treatment arms will be dependent on the schedule of chemotherapy (i.e. weekly, every 2 week, or every 4 week chemotherapy schedules will receive a starting dose of 200 mcg darbepoetin alfa and every 3 week chemotherapy schedule will receive a starting dose of 300 mcg). Non-responders are defined as patients who experience &lt;1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin concentrations after 6 weeks. Darbepoetin alfa will be held for hemoglobin concentrations &gt;13.0 g/dL.</description>
