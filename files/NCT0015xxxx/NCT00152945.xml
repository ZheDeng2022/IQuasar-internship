  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoproteins are large complexes of molecules that transport lipids (primarily triglycerides&#xD;
      and cholesterol) through the blood. The intestine has traditionally been viewed as a&#xD;
      'passive' organ with respect to lipoprotein production, with intestinal lipoprotein&#xD;
      production rates responding mainly to fat ingestion and absorption. The investigators have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated in animal models that there is an overproduction of intestinal&#xD;
      lipoproteins in both the fasted and the fed state. The investigators have also recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that an elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) stimulates intestinal&#xD;
      lipoprotein in hamsters. It is not known whether intestinal lipoprotein production can be&#xD;
      acutely stimulated by an elevation of plasma FFAs in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Intestinal lipoprotein particle production in humans can be stimulated by an&#xD;
      acute elevation of plasma free fatty acids.&#xD;

      This study proposes to use a published stable isotope method to study the kinetics of apoB48&#xD;
      and apoB100 in the constant fed state in healthy subjects. These studies will be performed in&#xD;
      10 healthy, lean men and women aged 18 to 65 years of age. Each subject will serve as his/her&#xD;
      own control and will undergo 3 separate lipoprotein turnover studies, in random order, 4 to 6&#xD;
      weeks apart. Since the infusion of intralipid (a synthetic triglyceride emulsion that&#xD;
      provides a source of fatty acids) and heparin (to activate lipoprotein lipase) raises both&#xD;
      FFAs and glycerol, two control studies will be performed, one with saline and one with&#xD;
      glycerol infusion. ApoB48-containing lipoprotein particle production will be determined as&#xD;
      outlined above but for this study in the fasted state, in response to the following&#xD;
      interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intralipid (20% solution @ 40 ml/hr) and heparin (250 u/hr) infusion to achieve an&#xD;
           ~2-fold elevation of plasma FFAs (as previously shown), starting 90 minutes prior to and&#xD;
           continuing throughout the lipoprotein turnover experiment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Saline infusion control study, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Glycerol control study in which glycerol will be infused at a rate of 2.25 g/hr to&#xD;
           simulate the infusion of glycerol contained in Intralipid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable isotope infusion protocol. Following a 14-h overnight fast, an IV will be inserted&#xD;
      into a superficial vein in each forearm, one for infusion and one for sampling. At 7 am, a&#xD;
      fasting blood sample will be drawn and the subject will begin to ingest the first of 15&#xD;
      identical small hourly meals, each equivalent to 1/15th of their daily food intake. This will&#xD;
      be achieved by giving the patient the drink BOOST (Mead Johnson Nutritionals, Ottawa, On)&#xD;
      and, using the Harris Benedict Equation (HBE) to determine the number of total energy&#xD;
      requirements. This is based on height, weight, age and activity factors. The subject will&#xD;
      have nothing else to eat until the end of the study. At the same time an IV infusion with&#xD;
      either heparin plus intralipid or saline or glycerol as indicated above will be started. At&#xD;
      10 am (3 hours after starting the ingestion of hourly feeds), a primed-constant infusion of&#xD;
      deuterium-labeled leucine ([D3]L-leucine 98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA) will be&#xD;
      started, as previously described (0.6 mg/kg as an initial injection and then 0.6 mg/kg/hr&#xD;
      thereafter). In addition, an IV bolus of d5-glycerol (100 mmol/kg) will be administered.&#xD;
      These are standard techniques used for the assessment of lipoprotein metabolism in humans.&#xD;
      Leucine, an amino acid and glycerol, an intermediary metabolite, are used by cells in the&#xD;
      body as building blocks for proteins, fats and for energy. The form of leucine that will be&#xD;
      administered is deuterated leucine (chemical formula L-[5,5,5-2H3]) and the form of glycerol&#xD;
      is d5-glycerol, which has been enriched with the naturally occurring isotope (chemical&#xD;
      variant) of hydrogen (2H). Deuterated leucine and glycerol are stable isotopes that occur&#xD;
      naturally in the environment and in the body, and there are no health/safety issues regarding&#xD;
      the infusion of the amounts of deuterated leucine and glycerol indicated above. The solutions&#xD;
      are prepared using sterile techniques and are monitored for contamination prior to&#xD;
      administration. Blood samples will be collected prior to and at the following time points&#xD;
      after administration of the stable isotopes: 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 5hr, 7hr, 9hr, 10hr, 11hr and&#xD;
      12hr. A total of 340 ml of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
