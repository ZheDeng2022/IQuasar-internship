  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are based on marked positive and negative&#xD;
      symptoms. This definition may impede the exploration of basic phenomenological&#xD;
      psychopathology or pathological mechanism of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was found to have&#xD;
      neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and neuropsychological impairment. However, the existence&#xD;
      of these basic pathological states may not manifest as clinical state of schizophrenia, and&#xD;
      it is found in normal relatives of schizophrenia proband. The clinical state of this&#xD;
      underlying pathology may include so-called latent or early, or pseudo-neurotic schizophrenia&#xD;
      or schizotypal disorder. The manifestation of prominent neurotic symptom state may not only&#xD;
      present as an psychopathological issue, but also induce misdiagnosis in clinical practice.&#xD;
      This may interfere early diagnosis of schizophrenia and may delay the chance of early and&#xD;
      appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the fact of this disadvantaged conditions, this research is for exploration of&#xD;
      clinical pathology and neuropsychological functions of latent or pseudo-neurotic&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The strategy ia a natural follow-up study on the clinical cases obtained from&#xD;
      the registration record of the medical charts of the National Taiwan University Hospital from&#xD;
      1970 to 1995. The natural follow-up results till study time (5 yrs to 30 yrs following&#xD;
      period) will be explored. By using neurotic group (50 cases), latent schizophrenia group (50&#xD;
      cases) and schizotypal group (30 cases), the differences in clinical pathology,&#xD;
      neuropsychological functions and family history of schizophrenia will be examined. There are&#xD;
      5 hypotheses to be tested: (1) Schizotaxia may exist as the manifestations of latent&#xD;
      schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder and frank schizophrenia. The severity of pathology&#xD;
      increased step by step; (2) The syndrome may change from the lower order to higher order to&#xD;
      higher order, but not all of them changed to the higher order; (3) The clinical pathology of&#xD;
      latent schizophrenia has both neurotic symptom as well as basic symptoms of schizophrenia;&#xD;
      (4) There is the same kind of neuropsychological impairment of schizophrenia in the group of&#xD;
      latent schizophrenia, and (5) The prevalence of schizophrenia in the first degree relatives&#xD;
      of latent schizophrenia is higher than that of the general population. Finally, this study&#xD;
      results will help the establishment of valid screening and/or diagnostic method (criteria) of&#xD;
      latent schizophrenia for clinical and research usage.&#xD;
