      The goal of this project is to pilot-test an instrument that is designed to assess the&#xD;
      relationship between persons who use controlling behavior with intimate partners, as a risk&#xD;
      factor for perpetrating intimate partner violence, and workplace productivity. The goal is to&#xD;
      validate a survey instrument that can be applied to other workplace settings to measure&#xD;
      productivity losses associated with controlling and aggressive behavior, which will serve to&#xD;
      inform the development of workplace interventions designed to prevent intimate partner&#xD;
      violence (IPV). This pilot-test will include two components of a survey conducted with&#xD;
      employees in a workplace setting: questions to determine one's controlling behavior or&#xD;
      propensity for violence in an intimate relationship, and questions designed to assess levels&#xD;
      of productivity as measured by days missed from work (absenteeism) and days at work with&#xD;
      diminished functional output (presenteeism). We expect productivity to decrease as one's&#xD;
      controlling behavior or propensity for perpetrating IPV increases. This study represents one&#xD;
      of the first workplace surveys designed to measure workplace productivity as a function of&#xD;
      controlling or violent behavior. Successful results would argue for a more wide-scale testing&#xD;
      of the instrument, which could ultimately lead to the development of workplace interventions&#xD;
      designed to prevent IPV.&#xD;

      Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence (IPV), which is most often characterized&#xD;
      as violence against women, is endemic in our society. Recent data from the National Violence&#xD;
      Against Women Survey (NVAWS) suggests that for every 1000 women age 18 and older in the&#xD;
      United States, there are 3.2 rape victimizations, 44.2 physical assaults, and 5 stalkings&#xD;
      annually. The economic burden of IPV is estimated at $5.8 billion annually, which includes&#xD;
      direct medical costs and lost days of work experienced by the victim. A substantial portion&#xD;
      of this toll on the economy, at greater than 50%, is borne by our private-sector partners in&#xD;
      the form of increased healthcare utilization that is covered by employee health benefits,&#xD;
      high employee turnover, decreased productivity, and increased security measures. As&#xD;
      businesses become increasingly aware of this burden, more are instituting policies and&#xD;
      procedures designed to help victims of IPV in a move to ameliorate the destructive effects of&#xD;
      violence on their bottom line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent efforts by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control=s Division of&#xD;
      Violence Prevention have focused prevention efforts targeted towards potential IPV&#xD;
      perpetrators rather than victims. The rationale for this new direction in research is the&#xD;
      idea that primary prevention that targets potential batterers may ultimately affect the&#xD;
      health of women more effectively than targeting secondary/tertiary prevention efforts towards&#xD;
      IPV victims. The idea is to stop potential batterers from ever abusing an intimate partner in&#xD;
      the first place, rather than empowering a victim of abuse to prevent the violence from&#xD;
      continuing. However, there is a paucity of data on the risk and protective factors for IPV&#xD;
      perpetration and the economic impact that IPV perpetrators have on the health care and&#xD;
      business sectors that would warrant such an investment of scarce public health resources.&#xD;
      Until this information is known, developing and evaluating primary prevention programs that&#xD;
      target potential abusers is quite challenging, as is our ability to engage our private-sector&#xD;
      partners to direct their health promotion resources towards these activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workplace Productivity Employers are increasingly interested in identifying and measuring the&#xD;
      relationship between the health issues of their employees and work productivity. Information&#xD;
      about this relationship can help guide employers on what types of prevention interventions&#xD;
      will be most effective and cost-effective. Performance measures to assess productivity must&#xD;
      reflect specific aspects of work output, at a specific point in time, for a specific person.&#xD;
      However, only a few modern jobs (e.g., a factory line worker) require workers to perform&#xD;
      repetitive tasks that can be easily counted or tracked. Even in industries where employee&#xD;
      performance can be tracked objectively, companies often lack reliable systems to capture and&#xD;
      review such data. Proxies such as promotions or pay raises also lack the detail necessary to&#xD;
      connect a health outcome or behavior with a worker's ability to perform. Without defined&#xD;
      business criteria and established metrics to monitor daily output and individual performance,&#xD;
      an obvious alternative is asking employees to self-rate their own performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several self-assessment instruments are currently being used in a research setting to&#xD;
      estimate work performance and detect the effects of health on performance and productivity&#xD;
      (1). Depending upon the health issue(s) under investigation, different instruments may be&#xD;
      more or less helpful. In some cases, e.g., measuring the impact of arthritis on productivity,&#xD;
      the physical aspect of work might be the most important dimension of productivity to measure.&#xD;
      In other cases, questions about &quot;how often&quot; work was affected may be less important than &quot;how&#xD;
      much&quot; work was affected. In general, the most important dimensions of work to capture&#xD;
      include: physical effort, social interactions, memory or concentration. For example, some&#xD;
      jobs involve high risk if a person is fatigued or distracted (bus drivers), others do not.&#xD;
      Some jobs require the use of replacement workers (e.g., police or teachers) when a person&#xD;
      misses work because of a health issue, others do not. Whatever the occupation, certain&#xD;
      aspects of work performance will be affected. Self-assessment tools can be specifically&#xD;
      tailored to measure the work impact of controlling behavior on an employee's productivity -&#xD;
      as measured by days missed from work - also called absenteeism, and reduced on-the-job&#xD;
      productivity - also called presenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for the current study A major challenge in encouraging the private sector to&#xD;
      consider funding workplace promotion and prevention interventions is to provide evidence of&#xD;
      returns on investment. One way to do this is by providing evidence that, if not addressed,&#xD;
      disease and injury can lead to reductions in individual productivity and overall workplace&#xD;
      productivity that can result in substantial losses to the company. To provide this evidence&#xD;
      for IPV prevention, this involves measuring productivity in the baseline population and&#xD;
      comparing those productivity levels with persons with elevated levels of controlling&#xD;
      behavior, violence, or propensity for perpetrating IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantifying this relationship is a first step towards understanding the potentially&#xD;
      devastating effects that IPV has on our society in general and for the business sector in&#xD;
      particular. These data could be instrumental in making the business case for investment in&#xD;
      effective and cost effective workplace health promotion interventions that focus on domestic&#xD;
      violence perpetrators, in addition to victims, with the ultimate goal of reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of IPV in our communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trying to identify people who behave in controlling ways (some of them illegal) towards their&#xD;
      intimate partners through a workplace-based anonymous survey do not have implications for the&#xD;
      employer in terms of &quot;duty to warn&quot; or other reporting requirements. First, no personal&#xD;
      identifiers will be collected through this survey, so it would not be possible to make any&#xD;
      reports. We will not have any names, ID numbers, or any other information that would permit&#xD;
      reporting a person to the police or referring him or her to treatment. Second, the employer&#xD;
      will never see the data. Only the researchers will be able to view the data, which removes&#xD;
      the employer from the information loop entirely, much as school administrators are protected&#xD;
      when students at their high schools report recent marijuana use on the YRBS. Third, &quot;duty to&#xD;
      warn&quot; requirements are applicable when a person has specific knowledge about a crime that is&#xD;
      going to occur-not if they have a generalized sense that a person may at some time have&#xD;
      engaged in any form of abusive behavior, or even less specifically, that a person has a&#xD;
      &quot;propensity for abuse&quot; (which is what this project will collect). This survey will not&#xD;
      collect explicit information about criminal abuse perpetration that has occurred in the&#xD;
      immediate past, present or immediate future. Fourth, it is essential for victim safety that&#xD;
      victims know exactly when they may be at sharply increased risk of harm due to any type of&#xD;
      intervention with the perpetrator. Perpetrators may assume the victim is responsible for the&#xD;
      report, or blame her for the consequences of the report, and thus may be in more danger&#xD;
      because of the third-party report than if no report had been made. Significant work has been&#xD;
      done to discourage third-party IPV reporting in the healthcare community for precisely this&#xD;
      reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 objectives addressed by this proposal include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-32 Reduce the rate of physical assault by current or former intimate partners to 3.6&#xD;
      physical assaults per 1,000 persons aged 12 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-35 Reduce the annual rate of rape or attempted rape to 0.7 rapes or attempted rapes per&#xD;
      1,000 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-36 Reduce sexual assault other than rape to 0.2 sexual assaults other than rape per 1,000&#xD;
      persons aged 12 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-37 Reduce physical assaults to 25.5 physical assaults per 1,000 persons aged 12 years and&#xD;
      older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described previously, violence against women results in substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in our society, with over 50 victimizations occurring annually for every 1000 women&#xD;
      over the age of 18. The economic toll is considerable and the private sector, by virtue of&#xD;
      subsidizing healthcare insurance and providing employee leave benefits, incurs at least half&#xD;
      of the costs associated with IPV. Since employers are in the unique position to offer health&#xD;
      promotion and prevention initiatives that can target potential (and confirmed) perpetrators&#xD;
      and victims of domestic violence, it is critical for CDC to stimulate these initiatives and&#xD;
      to provide evidence-based recommendations where applicable. Stimulating initiatives first&#xD;
      requires evidence that domestic abuse affects the employer. While some information is known&#xD;
      about how a victim of domestic violence affects the workplace, little is known about how the&#xD;
      IPV perpetrator affects the workplace. Targeting research efforts towards the primary&#xD;
      prevention of IPV is a newly developing initiative for NCIPC, as is our interest in&#xD;
      collaborating with the private sector. This research study provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      further both of these priorities and to advance our overall mission to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of violence against women in our society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of the present study The current project involves the pilot testing of an&#xD;
      employer-based self-assessment tool to measure productivity. The goals of this research&#xD;
      project are 1) to identify the relationship between controlling behavior/propensity for&#xD;
      abusiveness and work productivity, 2) to quantify productivity losses for persons with&#xD;
      elevated controlling behaviors, and 3) to provide feedback on the research findings to the&#xD;
      business community.&#xD;
