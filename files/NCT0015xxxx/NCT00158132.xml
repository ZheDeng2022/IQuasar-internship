    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for&#xD;
      preventing relapse. Amantadine, a medication that improves muscle control, and propranolol, a&#xD;
      medication that lowers blood pressure, may be useful in treating cocaine addiction in&#xD;
      individuals with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of amantadine and propranolol in preventing drug relapse among cocaine addicts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine withdrawal symptoms are a major contributing factor for why outpatient cocaine&#xD;
      dependence treatment programs often fail. Individuals with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      often experience anxiety, shaking, and muscle pain. Amantadine is a medication currently used&#xD;
      to improve muscle control, reduce shaking, and lessen stiffness. Therefore, it may help&#xD;
      reduce the muscle pain that some cocaine addicts experience. By enhancing activity of the&#xD;
      brain chemical dopamine, amantadine may also reduce other symptoms associated with cocaine&#xD;
      withdrawal. Propranolol is a medication currently used to treat high blood pressure and&#xD;
      irregular heart rhythms. It may reduce anxiety and lessen cocaine cravings in individuals&#xD;
      addicted to cocaine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of amantadine&#xD;
      and propranolol, alone and in combination, for treating cocaine addicts with severe cocaine&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2-week baseline evaluation period will be followed by an 8-week treatment phase. During the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation, cocaine use will be measured with urine tests, three times each week.&#xD;
      Only participants who are experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and who use cocaine at&#xD;
      least twice during the first 2 weeks will continue in the study. Eligible individuals will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to receive amantadine alone, propranolol alone, a combination of&#xD;
      amantadine and propranolol, or placebo. Treatments will begin at Week 3 and study visits will&#xD;
      occur three times each week. Cocaine levels will be monitored throughout the study with urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
