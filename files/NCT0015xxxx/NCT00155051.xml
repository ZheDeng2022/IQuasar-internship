  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term treatment of progestin has been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on&#xD;
      endometrial angiogenesis and the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells. As a result,&#xD;
      progestin is now widely employed in the treatment of endometrial cancer, endometrial&#xD;
      hyperplasia, and dysfunction uterine bleeding. In the treatment of adenomyosis, however, the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of progestin was limited. It might imply that the behavior of endometrial&#xD;
      cells in women with adenomyosis is different from that in women without adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous study revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK&#xD;
      cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It may be a&#xD;
      compensatory effect in which the NK cytotoxicity is activated in order to wipe out the&#xD;
      abnormal endometrial cells that might go out of the eutopic site of endometrium. It implies&#xD;
      that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to &quot;abnormal&quot; endometrial tissues, but not the&#xD;
      aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. This finding is compatible with&#xD;
      previous reports in which eutopic endometrium obtained from women with endometriosis or&#xD;
      adenomyosis was found to behave differently from endometrium in unaffected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis,&#xD;
      and then purify the endometrial stromal cells from endometrium. The endometrial stromal cells&#xD;
      are cultured for 8 days with the supplement of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol.&#xD;
      Quantification of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in endometrial cells, and the concentrations of IL-6 and&#xD;
      IL-8 in cultured media will be done with real time RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. The&#xD;
      expression of different cytokines of endometrial cells in response to progestin might be&#xD;
      further elucidated after our experiment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in&#xD;
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After becoming pre-confluent (covering 80% of the culture well), ESC was cultured for 8 days&#xD;
      solely or with the addition of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha concentrations of the culture media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha RNA levels in&#xD;
      ESC.&#xD;
