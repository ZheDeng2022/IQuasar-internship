      This research is designed to address the question, &quot;Does the relative deficit in vaccine&#xD;
      immunogenicity in extremely premature infants persist beyond the first 6 months of life?&quot; We&#xD;
      propose to measure the immunogenicity of varicella and mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in&#xD;
      relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29 weeks gestation, when compared to&#xD;
      full-term infants, as measured by the relevant viral serologies.&#xD;

      Title: MMR and Varicella Vaccine Responses in Extremely Premature Infants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 16 generally healthy premature infants born at &lt; 29 weeks' gestation, &lt; 16 months&#xD;
      old from the Rochester area 16 generally healthy full-term infants born at &gt;/= 37 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation, &lt; 16 months old from the Rochester area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: University of Rochester&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 1.5 - 8.5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Agent or Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will make 2 study visits. The first, at 15 months of age, will coincide with a&#xD;
      routine well child visit. Subjects will have 2 mL of blood drawn at the time of their&#xD;
      routine, 15-month MMR, varicella, and pneumococcal conjugate immunizations. At a second study&#xD;
      visit 4-6 weeks later, another 2 mL of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: We propose to measure the immunogenicity of routinely administered varicella and&#xD;
      mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29&#xD;
      weeks gestation (premature), when compared to that in full-term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measles titers will be measured by neutralization assay. Mumps and rubella titers will be&#xD;
      measured by enzyme-linked florescent immunoassay. Varicella titers will be measured by enzyme&#xD;
      linked immunosorbent assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by parental recall of vaccine-related adverse events and by active,&#xD;
      prospective collection of blood-draw-associated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schematic of Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be approached at 9-12 months of age for inclusion, and will consent at this&#xD;
      time or at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (15 mos):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine MMR, varicella vaccines administered by primary pediatrician per standard of care (at&#xD;
      Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (16 mos):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varicella, mumps, measles and rubella vaccine titers measured by ELISA&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Premature infant &lt; 29 weeks' gestation at birth or term infant &gt;/= 37 weeks' gestation&#xD;
             at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Postnatal age &lt; 16 months, 0 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has not yet received MMR or varicella vaccines. (There are no restrictions on the&#xD;
             administration of other vaccines at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parental permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agreement of primary care pediatrician/ health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receives primary pediatric care within an approximate 25-mile radius of the University&#xD;
             of Rochester.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Healthy status at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Systemic corticosteroid therapy at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requiring oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant findings on review of medical history and physical exam&#xD;
             determined by the investigator or sub-investigator to be sufficient for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any condition determined by the investigator that would interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
             of the vaccine or be a potential health risk to the subject.&#xD;
