      The aims of this prospective study are: (1) to prospectively investigate the &quot;true&quot;&#xD;
      prevalence rate, the acquisition and spontaneous clearance of H. pylori infection year by&#xD;
      year in the population whose ages between seven and fifteen. (2) to explore the risk factors&#xD;
      of transmission of H. pylori infection in Taiwan. (This information may be use as the guide&#xD;
      for conduction of the national policy of public health and disease prevention.)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a spiral microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium isolated in&#xD;
      1983, is now known as the most common gastrointestinal bacterial infection worldwide. It is&#xD;
      the principal cause of chronic gastritis and is strongly associated with peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
      as well as gastric cancer, including gastric lymphoma (MALT type). In developed countries,&#xD;
      infection occurs in more than 50% of adults, whereas developing countries have infection&#xD;
      rates reaching 90%. Among those with H. pylori infection, eradication therapy alters the&#xD;
      natural history of recurrences with attendant morbidity and death, which previously required&#xD;
      lifelong maintenance therapy. Perhaps the greatest concern with regard to infection with H.&#xD;
      pylori is the increased risk for the development of gastric cancers in adulthood. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant because infection dating from childhood appears to enhance the risk of&#xD;
      carcinogenesis. Because H. pylori infection is contracted primarily during the childhood&#xD;
      years, additional epidemiological studies among pediatric populations are imperative.&#xD;
      Therefore the validation of an inexpensive, easy-to perform, sensitive, specific, and&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnostic test for H. pylori infection in children and adolescents is of&#xD;
      paramount importance to enhance our presently limited understanding of H. pylori-related&#xD;
      diseases. The optimal noninvasive tests for epidemiological research of H. pylori infection&#xD;
      in children are still not well identified. Serologic immunoassays based on H. pylori antigens&#xD;
      require validation in the pediatric population under evaluation. As the result of our&#xD;
      previous study, the serological test was not sensitive enough as an epidemiology screening&#xD;
      tool for H. pylori infection in children.The aims of this prospective study are: (1) to&#xD;
      prospectively investigate the &quot;true&quot; prevalence rate, the acquisition and spontaneous&#xD;
      clearance of H. pylori infection year by year in the population whose ages between seven and&#xD;
      fifteen. (2) to explore the risk factors of transmission of H. pylori infection in Taiwan.&#xD;
      (This information may be use as the guide for conduction of the national policy of public&#xD;
      health and disease prevention.) The study population will include students of one primary&#xD;
      school and one junior high school in Lo-Tong area. There will be 150-160 cases in each age&#xD;
      group and will be continuously followed-up for 3 years. Blood sample will be collected from&#xD;
      each student for the serological test. 13C-urea breath test will be performed in each&#xD;
      student, too. The parents of students will answer a questionnaire concerning the basic&#xD;
      epidemiological data and possible factors related to the transmission of H. pylori. The&#xD;
      students having new acquisition of H. pylori infection in the 2nd or 3rd years' follow-up&#xD;
      period will be collected for further investigation. These student and their family will be&#xD;
      invited to receive panendoscopy for the evaluation of possible pathology of stomach and the&#xD;
      isolation H. pylori strain. These H. pylori isolates will be identified by molecular&#xD;
      genotyping for the detection of possible source of transmission in the family. All of these&#xD;
      results will be analyzed by a SAS system.&#xD;
