      Background: The use of radioactive iodine (131I) therapy as the definite cure of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism is widespread. According to a survey on the management of Graves' disease,&#xD;
      thirty per cent of physicians prefer to render their patients euthyroid by antithyroid drugs&#xD;
      (ATD) prior to 131I therapy. This strategy is presumably chosen to avoid 131I induced&#xD;
      'thyroid storm', which, however, is rarely encountered. Several studies have consistently&#xD;
      shown that patients who are treated with ATD prior to 131I therapy have an increased risk of&#xD;
      treatment failure. Mostly, patients with Graves' disease have been studied, while other&#xD;
      studies were addressed also toxic nodular goiter. Thus, it is generally accepted that ATD&#xD;
      have 'radioprotective' properties, although this view is almost exclusively based on&#xD;
      retrospective data and is still under debate. Indeed, this dogma was recently challenged by&#xD;
      two randomized trials in Graves' disease, none of which showed such an adverse effect of&#xD;
      methimazole pretreatment. It cannot be excluded that the earlier results may have been under&#xD;
      influence of selection bias, a source of error almost unavoidable in retrospective studies.&#xD;
      Whether ATD is radioprotective also when used in the post 131I period has also been debated.&#xD;
      In the early period 131I therapy following a transient rise in the thyroid hormones is seen&#xD;
      which may give rise to discomfort in some patients. The continuous use of ATD during 131I&#xD;
      therapy, possibly in combination with levothyroxine (BRT: block-replacement therapy), leads&#xD;
      to more stable levels of the thyroid hormones. By resuming ATD following 131I therapy,&#xD;
      euthyroidism can usually be maintained until the destructive effect of 131I ensues.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, many physicians prefer not to resume ATD, probably due to reports supporting&#xD;
      that such a strategy reduces the cure rate. Parallel to the issue of ATD pretreatment, the&#xD;
      evidence is based on retrospective studies and the ideal set-up should be reconsidered. To&#xD;
      underscore the importance of performing randomized trials we showed recently that resumption&#xD;
      of methimazole seven days after 131I therapy had no influence on the final outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:To clarify by a randomized trial whether BRT during radioiodine therapy of hyperthyroid&#xD;
      patients influences the final outcome of this therapy, in a comparison with a regime in which&#xD;
      methimazole as mono-therapy is discontinued 8 days before radioiodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients suffering from recurrent Graves' disease (n=50) or&#xD;
      a toxic nodular goiter (n=50) are included. All patients are rendered euthyroid by&#xD;
      methimazole (MMI) and randomized either to stop MMI eight days before 131I or to be set on&#xD;
      BRT. This latter medication continues until three months after 131I. Calculation of the 131I&#xD;
      activity (max. 600 MBq) includes an assessment of the 131I half-life and the thyroid volume.&#xD;
      Patients are followed for one year with close monitoring of the thyroid function.&#xD;
