  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired ocular blood flow is an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of primary open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma (POAG). A few studies suggest that topical dorzolamide 2% may increase optic&#xD;
      nerve perfusion. The objectives of this study are to learn the effects of dorzolamide on the&#xD;
      retinal and optic nerve blood flow of glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, crossover design study of&#xD;
      newly diagnosed or already treated patients with early glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will check ocular blood flow parameters using the Canon Laser Blood&#xD;
      Flowmeter (CLBF), used to evaluate retinal arteriole blood flow, and the Heidelberg retinal&#xD;
      flowmeter (HRF), which measures blood flow through capillary beds in the retina and optic&#xD;
      nerve head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any demonstrated improvements to retinal and optic nerve blood flow with dorzolamide, will&#xD;
      mean that the drug may protect against ischaemic nerve and retinal damage. Any documented&#xD;
      improvement in flow could lead to a major change in the management of glaucoma patients as&#xD;
      well as other retinal ischemic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor for glaucoma. Lowering intraocular&#xD;
      pressure is still the only accepted form of treatment for glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, epidemiological and experimental evidence suggested that impaired&#xD;
      ocular blood flow is an important risk factor with an important role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Several studies suggest that ischemia-promoting vascular&#xD;
      factors may contribute to glaucomatous damage including vasospasm, impaired ocular perfusion&#xD;
      pressure and general vascular disorders such as low blood pressure, especially dips in blood&#xD;
      pressure at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different techniques are employed to assess vascular dysfunction in the eye. As the&#xD;
      methodology of ocular blood flow assessment is complex and differs in various aspects (e.g.&#xD;
      target tissue and physiological parameters), comparative studies are required in order to&#xD;
      enhance the interpretation of these measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our laboratory has state of the art equipment to assess ocular blood flow. One study done by&#xD;
      us suggested that one drop of Dorzolamide 2% does not improve retinal blood flow in normal&#xD;
      eyes. In the present study we plan to extend this study to 2 weeks of treatment in patients&#xD;
      with POAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dorzolamide hydrochloride 2% is a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which reduces&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing the production of aqueous humour. Pharmacological&#xD;
      studies on volunteers and glaucoma patients, using Color Doppler Imaging (measuring the&#xD;
      retrobulbar blood flow) and Scanning laser Ophthalmoscopy (measuring arteriovenous passage&#xD;
      time), indicate that topically applied Dorzolamide may increase perfusion of the optic nerve&#xD;
      and peripapillary retina.&#xD;
