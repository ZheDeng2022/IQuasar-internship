      Aspirin is commonly used for treatment of painful and inflammatory diseases and in the&#xD;
      prevention of the cardiovascular disease. A major drawback of aspirin treatment is the well&#xD;
      recognized gastrointestinal toxicity. Recent research indicate that coupling a nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO)derivate to the aspirin moiety retains its therapeutic effects while avoiding its&#xD;
      undesirable gastrointestinal side effects. NO has cytoprotective effects, such as blood flow&#xD;
      modulation, mucus release and repair of mucosal injury. NCX4016, a NO-releasing derivative of&#xD;
      acetylsalicilic acid, has been shown to retain the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antithrombotic activity of aspirin, but with less gastrointestinal toxicity. In addition,&#xD;
      preliminary data suggested that NCX4016 may restore insulin sensitivity in eNOS deficient&#xD;
      mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was aimed to evaluate the activity of NCX4016, compared to aspirin, on&#xD;
      albuminuria, insulin sensitivity and cardiac and renal hemodynamic in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. The patients after one month of placebo treatment, entered two 1-month&#xD;
      treatments periods, with equivalent doses (800 mg of NCX4016, 325 mg of aspirin) of NCX4016&#xD;
      or aspirin.&#xD;

      Nitric oxide-releasing, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NO-NSAIDs) are new chemical&#xD;
      entities obtained by adding a nitric oxide-releasing moiety to the parent NSAID via a&#xD;
      short-chain ester linkage. NCX4016 (Nitro-aspirin), a acetoxy-benzoate&#xD;
      2-(2-nitroxymethyl)-phenyl ester of acetylsalicylic acid, is one of these novel compounds&#xD;
      developed with the dual aim to expand the pharmacological properties of the parent drug and&#xD;
      to spare some of its side effects, in particular on the gastrointestinal mucosa. Decreased NO&#xD;
      synthesis may contribute to some of the abnormalities associated with diabetes such as&#xD;
      decreased insulin activity, impaired endothelium-dependent/insulin-induced vasodilatation,&#xD;
      increased sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow and increased platelet activation, that may&#xD;
      result in increased vascular resistance and arterial hypertension and, in the long term, to&#xD;
      an increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose aspirin represents the antiplatelet drug of choice for prevention of vascular&#xD;
      complications in diabetes. Preclinical data on NCX4016 support the possibility that&#xD;
      Nitro-aspirin may shear with aspirin the antithrombotic activity and may offer the additional&#xD;
      benefits related to increased NO bioavailability. Actually NCX4016 inhibits cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      (COX) activity in platelets both in vitro and ex vivo and, similar to aspirin, prevents the&#xD;
      release of thromboxane (TX) A2 and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover&#xD;
      Nitro-aspirin inhibits aspirin-insensitive platelet aggregation and adhesion, possibly by&#xD;
      inhibiting the expression of platelet adhesion molecules by a specific COX-independent&#xD;
      mechanism, probably NO-mediated, that is not show by the parent compound. Therefore&#xD;
      Nitro-aspirin can exceed the cardioprotective action of the parent compound, by adding the&#xD;
      aspirin-like moiety and the NO-releasing moiety, which both contribute to its benefits&#xD;
      effects, such as multiple anti-thrombotic and, possibly, anti-atherosclerotic activities,&#xD;
      restoration of insulin-related metabolic and vascular effect and finally blood pressure&#xD;
      reduction. Moreover, experimental and clinical data suggest that Nitro-aspirin will offer&#xD;
      significant safety advantages by its NO moiety that may limit aspirin gastrotoxicity by&#xD;
      preventing the vasocontriction of the mucosal microvasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present randomised, double-blind, cross-over study, we evaluated the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profile of Nitro-aspirin (800 mg bid), and of an equiactive dose of aspirin (325 mg&#xD;
      od), as compared to placebo, in thirteen patients with type 2 diabetes and micro or&#xD;
      macro-albuminuria (overnight albumin excretion rate &gt; 20 Âµg/min for at least 6 months),&#xD;
      without overt renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration &lt; 2 mg/dl) and no specific&#xD;
      controindication to aspirin therapy. Eligible patients who provided written informed consent,&#xD;
      withdrew any previous treatment with NSAIDs or aspirin and, after a 4-week placebo run-in&#xD;
      period, entered two consecutive 4-week treatment periods with Nitro-aspirin plus aspirin&#xD;
      placebo or Nitro-aspirin placebo plus aspirin in a random order. Primary efficacy variables&#xD;
      were changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and in insulin activity at the end of&#xD;
      Nitro-aspirin treatment as compared to baseline. UAE (mean of three overnight urine&#xD;
      collection), insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate as measured by an hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp), cardiac haemodynamics (evaluated by echocardiography), NO bioavailability&#xD;
      and oxidative stress (measured as nitrite/nitrate plasma levels) and other clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory variables, were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment periods.&#xD;
