      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the intensive insulin therapy on&#xD;
      coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients affected by severe sepsis and septic shock. As a&#xD;
      secondary endpoints the investigators will determine the effect of intensive insulin therapy&#xD;
      on organ dysfunction and mortality of these patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the sepsis can be done at three different level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Etiologic therapy. The eradication of the infectious agent is the primary end-point. An&#xD;
           appropriate surgical treatment and antibiotic therapy are the key of the etiologic&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptomatic therapy. It is the traditional approach in the Intensive Care Unit. It&#xD;
           involves to correct the symptomatic issues that can lead to the death of the patients,&#xD;
           buying the time necessary for the action of the etiologic and the pathogenic therapy.&#xD;
           The key point of the symptomatic therapy are: a) an adequate expansion of the volemia&#xD;
           and the use of cardiovascular-acting drugs, for the maintenance of an adequate&#xD;
           cardiocirculatory homeostasis. Recently it has been demonstrated that an early&#xD;
           aggressive haemodynamic therapy direct to maintain a mixed venous Oxygen Saturation&#xD;
           above 70% improved the mortality compared with a standard approach (3); b) apply a&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation adequate for the maintenance of the respiratory homeostasis. In&#xD;
           fact it has been recently shown an increased survival rate in patients treated with low&#xD;
           tidal volume ventilation strategy compared to standard strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pathogenic therapy. It consists to block the inflammatory and/or coagulation pathway at&#xD;
           different level. In the last 30 years a number of report studied different approach&#xD;
           (anti-endotoxin antibodies, anti-TNF antibodies, anti-IL6 antibodies, treatment with&#xD;
           high doses of corticosteroid, etc.). While all these approaches showed an efficacy in&#xD;
           experimental settings when given preventively, most of them have no effect in phase 3&#xD;
           clinical trial. This discrepancy may be explained considering: 1) the system can be&#xD;
           considered chaotic, with riddance and interdependency of the response; 2) in the&#xD;
           clinical studies the treatment was applied after the development of the sepsis, when the&#xD;
           inflammatory and coagulation systems are still largely activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three study has recently demonstrated a benefit in survival:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The treatment with low-dosage corticosteroids in patients non-responders to ACH&#xD;
           stimulation test (5). This is a substitutive therapy. It is important to note that the&#xD;
           treatment with high dosage corticosteroids to block completely the inflammatory response&#xD;
           is not effective (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The treatment with recombinant activated Protein C (7) did increased the relative&#xD;
           survival rate by 20%. Of note the activated Protein C is the only molecule with three&#xD;
           main mechanisms of action: anticoagulatory, antiinflammatory and profibrinolytic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In a recent study in post-surgical patients it has been shown a significant improvement&#xD;
           in survival in patients treated with a a tight glycemic control within 80 and 110 mg/dL&#xD;
           compared to those in which the glycemia was corrected only when reaching higher level&#xD;
           (&gt;215 mg/dL) (8).We still lack a definitive explanation for these findings, and the&#xD;
           discussion is mainly on the relative roles of glycemia per se versus insulin therapy per&#xD;
           se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, looking at the overall scenario, some issues are of note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We know that a complete block of the inflammatory reaction or a complete block of the&#xD;
           coagulation cascade do not improve outcome in septic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The activated Protein C is the molecule with the highest spectrum of action, in&#xD;
           particular is the only molecule within the numerous molecules tested with&#xD;
           pro-fibrinolytic activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We know that higher glycemia per se does greatly increase the PAI production (the&#xD;
           molecule which inhibits the fibrinolysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The septic patients primarily die because of multiple organ dysfunction which is in part&#xD;
           due to a widespread microthrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible unifying hypothesis is that the improved outcome observed with activate Protein C&#xD;
      and with the tight glycemic control is due to the maintenance of a physiologic fibrinolysis.&#xD;
      This hypothesis has never been tested and if proved could open interesting therapeutical&#xD;
      approaches in the septic patients exposed to the high mortality risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The primary end-point is the evaluation of the activation/deactivation of the&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system in the two-randomization groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, randomized, Phase 2/3 study of adult patients with&#xD;
      severe sepsis and septic shock. We will enroll a total of approximately 80 adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: glycemia will be controlled with insulin administration when higher than 215&#xD;
           mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment: glycemia will be controlled with be controlled with insulin administration&#xD;
           when higher than 110 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION: The patients enrolled will undergo a block-randomization by center in two arms&#xD;
      and stratified according to the clinical decision of the caring physician to use or not use&#xD;
      the activated Protein C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: The clinical variables and the biochemical variables of fibrinolysis,&#xD;
      coagulation, contact phase and pro-inflammatory cytokines will be recorded daily for the&#xD;
      first 7 days, each second day until the 14 days and the each fifth until the end of the study&#xD;
      (28th day, or dimission/death if before).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline:Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 24 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (9). The Simplified Acute Physiology&#xD;
           Score assesses the severity of illness on the basis of 12 physiological variables; age,&#xD;
           the type of admission (urgent or nonurgent) and 3 variables related to the underlying&#xD;
           disease. Scores can range from 0 to 194; higher scores are correlated with a higher risk&#xD;
           of death during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) (10). It is an index of multi-organ&#xD;
           dysfunction (range 0-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ramsey scale (11). It is an index of level of sedation (range 1-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Respiratory, circulatory and biochemical of variables for monitoring the organs&#xD;
           dysfunction (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main biochemical variables collected are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrinolytic system:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. PAI-1 activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PAI- 1 antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. tPA antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. D-Dimer fragment&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Polymorphism 4G/5 of the PAI-1 gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final phase pf the coagulation pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Prothrombin fragment F1 + 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact system&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Activated Factor XII (FXIIa)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Metabolism of endogenous bradykinin&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Polymorphism insertion/deletion of the gene of angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. C reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. C3a&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. SC5b-9&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASPECTS AND SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) REPORTING: GCP rules will be strictly applied,&#xD;
      including timely reporting to the study coordination within 48 hours from their occurrence of&#xD;
      the SAEs not included in the efficacy end-points. Clinical investigators and nurses of each&#xD;
      of the participating centers will be instructed to monitor specifically and to document the&#xD;
      adverse events more likely to be associated with the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ASPECTS: we plan to enroll 80 septic patients in the ICU related with the&#xD;
      participating research units. This size will allow showing an average difference of 30% of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis biochemical parameters (alfa = 0.05, 1-beta = 0.80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL, ETHICAL ISSUES: This study is designed by our collaborative group,&#xD;
      which has been active over the last ten years in conducting clinical trials in intensive&#xD;
      care. The study has been planned and is managed independently, and the clinicians who take&#xD;
      active part in the study do not receive economic incentives. The Ely Lilly Italia Spa will&#xD;
      provide a financial support for performing the laboratory tests required in studying the&#xD;
      fibrinolysis. It is important to emphasize that we are comparing the effects of two different&#xD;
      strategies of glycemic control on the fibrinolysis. The Ely Lilly interest in the study is&#xD;
      only scientific, as, if we could show the importance of the fibrinolysis in sepsis, this&#xD;
      could elucidate one of the putative mechanisms of activated Protein C action. This study is&#xD;
      also partially funded by a grant of the Ministry of University and research (COFIN 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data which are produced belong to the study group, who ensures their publication and&#xD;
      their availability for public authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data related to the patients included in the study are treated in strict compliance with&#xD;
      the Italian Laws related to privacy 675/1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent for the patients will be administered as soon as and every time the&#xD;
      clinical conditions of the same patients are compatible with the procedure, thus following&#xD;
      the provisions set forth by the ICH-GCP guidelines (13), and confirmed by the most recent&#xD;
      European Directive 2001/20/CE Decreto Legislativo 211 24/06/2003. It is worth recalling that&#xD;
      there is no legal basis for requiring the consent to a relative of the patient.&#xD;
