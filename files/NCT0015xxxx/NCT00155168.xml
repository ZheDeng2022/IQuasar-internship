  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we will establish the efficient and accurate gene dose determination system&#xD;
      by combining the heterodulex analysis and gene dose analysis on DHPLC platform based on&#xD;
      various quantitative and multiplex PCR strategies and applying on detecting the carriers- in-&#xD;
      risk and patients with spinal muscular atrophy.This method is, therefore, based on the&#xD;
      observation that the amount of PCR product generated from each site of amplification is&#xD;
      proportional to the amount of starting template. Detection of PCR products is carried out on&#xD;
      DHPLC, which provide the sensitivity required for the detection of the single-copy dosage&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Proximal spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder with an overall incidence&#xD;
      of 1 in 10000 live births and a carrier frequency of 1 in 50. This severe neuromuscular&#xD;
      disease is characterized by a degeneration and loss of alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord&#xD;
      anterior horn cells, which results in progressive symmetrical weakness, atrophy of the&#xD;
      proximal voluntary muscles, and infant death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two most identical copies of SMN gene, telomeric SMN (SMN1) and centromeric SMN (SMN2), have&#xD;
      been identified. These two SMN genes are highly homologous and differing in only five&#xD;
      nucleotide exchanges within their 3' regions. These variations do not alter the encoded amino&#xD;
      acids. These nucleotide differences located in exons 7 and 8, allow SMN1 gene to be&#xD;
      distinguished from SMN2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that more than 95% of SMA patients were homozygous deletion of SMN1&#xD;
      gene. Therefore, the detection of the absence of SMN1 can be a useful tool for SMA diagnosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, because of the high incidence of SMA, the high carrier frequency of at least 1&#xD;
      in 50, the severity of the disease in the patients, and the lack of effective of treatment,&#xD;
      carrier testing for SMN1 deletion is an important question in genetic counseling. However, a&#xD;
      highly homologous SMN2 gene also exits and hampers the detection of the loss of SMN1 which&#xD;
      makes the detection of SMA carrier test difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we present a new, rapid, simple and high reliable method to detect the SMN1 deletion&#xD;
      and to determine the copy number of the SMN1 and SMN2 by denaturing high-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (DHPLC). DHPLC is a novel, simple, fast and non gel-base method that is very&#xD;
      sensitive and specific for detection DNA variations. Furthermore, we describe a multiplex PCR&#xD;
      strategy to determine the SMN1 and SMN2 genes copy number in order to avoid bias due to&#xD;
      fluctuations in the copy number of SMN genes. The assay uses the X-linked CYBB gene and KRIT1&#xD;
      gene as standards to determine the relative gene dosage of SMN1 and SMN2 genes. We&#xD;
      demonstrate that this assay is able to accurately distinguish 2 gene copies from 4 gene&#xD;
      copies and it can identify SMA carriers and normal populations by the accurate determination&#xD;
      of SMN copy number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will contribute to apply this novel, fast, and reliable tool for diagnosis of&#xD;
      SMA and carrier detection of SMN1 and SMN2 genes by using DHPLC system.&#xD;
