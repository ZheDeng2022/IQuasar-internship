      This pilot study will measure the baseline levels and the intra- and inter-subject&#xD;
      variability of exhaled (alveolar and bronchial) and nasal NO in smoking subjects with mild&#xD;
      and moderate COPD on or off steroid treatment, smoking healthy volunteers and non-smoking&#xD;
      mild asthmatics off steroids, using multiple exhalation flow rates.&#xD;

      n addition, exploratory markers of iNOS activity (eg. 3-nitrotyrosine, nitrite, nitrate and&#xD;
      3-nitro-4-hydoxyphenylacetic acid) in blood, sputum, urine and exhaled breath condensate will&#xD;
      be evaluated. We will also evaluate exhaled and nasal NO in a population of mild asthmatics&#xD;
      in order to obtain baseline and variability data for future clinical studies involving&#xD;
      asthmatic subjects.&#xD;
