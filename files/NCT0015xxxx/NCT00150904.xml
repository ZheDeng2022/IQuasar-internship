  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C and HIV infect worldwide millions of people leading to a high rate of coinfected&#xD;
      patient with eventually liver cirrhosis and endstage liver disease. With the currently best&#xD;
      available therapy (peginterferon and ribavirin) only less than 50% of patients with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1 will respond. Unknown is what factors determine this difference in treatment&#xD;
      outcome. Probably virologic and immunologic factors play a major role. By investigating blood&#xD;
      samples of HCV / HIV coinfected patients and HCV mono-infected patients we would like to&#xD;
      examine both virologic and immunologic factors possibly responsible for this difference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      background: each year the Hepatitis C (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infect&#xD;
      worldwide millions of people. In the western world coinfection of HIV with HCV mainly exists&#xD;
      in intravenous drug users. In coinfected patients progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis&#xD;
      and endstage liver disease is much faster than in patients with only a mono-infection of&#xD;
      hepatitis C. With the current treatment regimes response rates differ between HCV genotypes&#xD;
      and between coinfected and mono-infected patients. Reasons for this a yet not well&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virology: In the treatment of HCV genotype 1, after 12 weeks treatment success is evaluated&#xD;
      (EVR) and if the HCV RNA-load is insufficiently dropped the treatment is stopped. There are&#xD;
      indications that this moment of evaluation can be done earlier. Whole blood analysis can be a&#xD;
      more sensitive method to determine an earlier EVR.Furthermore there are a few known HCV&#xD;
      mutations playing a role in the chronicity of HCV. Lack of treatment response can be caused&#xD;
      by other mutations in the HCV genome. Sequencing of the whole HCV genome has not been done&#xD;
      very extensively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology: Proliferation and interferon production by HCV specific CD8 cells is defective.&#xD;
      Not very much is known about the HCV-specific CD8 cells responses during treatment with&#xD;
      peginterferon and ribavirin. Evidence is gathering that regulatory T-cells (CD4+CD25+) are&#xD;
      involved in the process of inhibiting proliferation. Also it is known that the concentration&#xD;
      of HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 cells in the liver is higher than in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
      Certain homing molecules are probably involved in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      virologic: 1) at 4 weeks it is possible to determine an EVR; 2) other than the known&#xD;
      ,mutations are responsible for the chronicity and unresponsiveness of the HCV virus; 3) whole&#xD;
      blood analysis will be able to predict an EVR with more sensitivity than the current HCV-RNA&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      immunologic: 1) the specific relation between HCV specific CD4 and CD8 cells will determine&#xD;
      if proliferation and production of interferon during therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      is successful. 2) regulatory T cells are inhibiting proliferation and production in chronic&#xD;
      HCV infection and the amount of regulatory T cells will diminish during therapy with&#xD;
      peginterferon and ribavirin. 3) wich homing molecules are important in the homing of HCV&#xD;
      specific CD8 cells to the liver.&#xD;
