  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most frequent neoplasm and the third in mortality rate of the&#xD;
      malignancies in women in the world. It results in about 200,000 women dying of cervical&#xD;
      cancer each year worldwide. The available forms of treatment - surgery, radiation therapy,&#xD;
      and chemotherapy - are all cytoreductive treatment modalities, so, in addition to killing&#xD;
      cancerous cells, healthy cells are also destroyed in the process. Indeed, there is a need to&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of cervical cancer and develop better forms for its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer&#xD;
      especially those high-risk types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 45) which have been strongly associated&#xD;
      with cervical cancer. HPV 16 was found in more than 50% of cervical cancer tissues. So, the&#xD;
      host immune response plays an important role in determining the regression of a cervical&#xD;
      abnormality or persistence and progression to a malignancy via targeting HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal cancer treatment should be able to eradicate systemic tumors at multiple sites in&#xD;
      the body while having the specificity to discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic&#xD;
      cells. In this regard, antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy represents an attractive&#xD;
      approach for cancer treatment. By cooperating with Dr. TC Wu at the Johns Hopkins Medical&#xD;
      Institutes, the investigators have recently developed some E7-specific cancer vaccines of&#xD;
      different strategies such as DNA, or replication-defective SINrep5 virus. They found that&#xD;
      these E7-chimeric DNA vaccines are capable of preventing and treating the growth of murine&#xD;
      model tumors expressing E7. These positive results from the preclinical murine models have&#xD;
      encouraged the investigators to focus on the development of a cancer vaccine and&#xD;
      immunotherapy and apply these vaccines to human subjects. However, it is very important to&#xD;
      set up various E7-specific immunologic assays of human beings to evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      cancer vaccine or immunotherapy in future clinical trials. So the investigators would like to&#xD;
      provide this proposal to address the development of HPV 16 E7-specific immunologic assays in&#xD;
      human beings. There are two main goals in this study. First, the investigators would like to&#xD;
      establish and compare the differences of HPV type 16 E7-specific immunologic responses&#xD;
      between the normal population, people with HPV infection, patients with cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplastic (CIN) lesions, and patients with cervical cancer. Second, they&#xD;
      would like to correlate the disease severity of cervical cancer with the immunologic&#xD;
      responses to HPV type 16 E7 antigen.&#xD;

      HPV and Cervical Cancers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small, nonenveloped DNA viruses which induce epithelial&#xD;
      tumors of skin or mucosa. The majority of tumors are benign, show limited growth and usually&#xD;
      regress spontaneously. However, a number of human papillomaviruses induce tumors that may&#xD;
      eventually progress to carcinomas. The genital HPV types 16 and 18, and less frequently,&#xD;
      types 31, 33, 35, 45, 51 and 56, have been implicated in the etiology of cervical and other&#xD;
      anogenital cancers. Approximately 500,000 women worldwide develop cervical cancer yearly and&#xD;
      it is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women. In developed countries, cancer&#xD;
      of the cervix ranks behind cancers of the breast, lung, uterus, and ovaries and accounts for&#xD;
      7% of all female cancers. In the United States, there are about 4,800 deaths annually from&#xD;
      cervical cancer. The evidence linking HPVs to anogenital cancer comes from epidemiologic and&#xD;
      laboratory studies. More than 90% of cervical cancers and their precursors, so-called&#xD;
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), contain human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences.&#xD;
      The HPV types found in cancer cells have transforming activity in in vitro studies and the&#xD;
      viral transforming proteins, E6 and E7, are consistently expressed in cervical cancer cell&#xD;
      lines and in HPV-associated cancers of patients. In HPV-associated malignant transformation,&#xD;
      viral DNA may be integrated into the cellular DNA and integration often results in deletion&#xD;
      of large sectors of the viral genome. Late genes (L1 and L2) and some early genes (E1 and E2)&#xD;
      are usually lost, leaving E6 and E7 as the only open reading frames frequently found in&#xD;
      carcinomas. Expression of E6 and E7 is likely to overcome the regulation of cell&#xD;
      proliferation normally mediated by proteins like p53 and Rb, allowing uncontrolled growth and&#xD;
      providing the potential for malignant transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV Oncogenic Proteins, E6 and E7, as Ideal Targets for the Development of Antigen-Specific&#xD;
      Immunotherapies or Vaccines for HPV-Associated Cervical Malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      E6 and E7 represent ideal targets for the development of antigen-specific immunotherapies or&#xD;
      vaccines for HPV-associated malignancies. First, more than 90% of cervical cancers have been&#xD;
      associated with HPVs, particularly type 16, and E6 and E7 are consistently expressed in most&#xD;
      cervical cancers. Second, while most tumor specific antigens are derived from normal proteins&#xD;
      or mutated proteins, E6 and E7 are completely foreign viral proteins, and potentially may&#xD;
      harbor more antigenic peptides/epitopes than a mutant protein (i.e. p53) or a reactivated&#xD;
      embryonic protein (i.e. MAGE-1). Third, since E6 and E7 are required for the induction and&#xD;
      maintenance of malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, cells of cervical cancer cannot evade an&#xD;
      immune response through antigen loss. Without functional E6 and E7, these cells would cease&#xD;
      to be tumorigenic. Therefore, E6 and E7 proteins represent ideal targets for developing&#xD;
      antigen-specific immunotherapies or vaccines for cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various forms of vaccines, such as vector-based vaccines, tumor-based vaccines, DNA based&#xD;
      vaccines and protein/peptide-based vaccines have been described in experimental systems&#xD;
      targeting HPV-16 E6 and/or E7 proteins. For example, Meneguzzi et al. reported that&#xD;
      inoculation of rats with vaccinia recombinants expressing HPV-16 E6 or E7 retarded or&#xD;
      prevented tumor development in 25-47% of rats challenged with a tumorigenic rat cell line&#xD;
      co-transfected with HPV-16 and activated ras. In addition, Chen et al. demonstrated that&#xD;
      immunization of mice with syngeneic non-tumorigenic cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 gene&#xD;
      confers protection against transplanted HPV-16 E7 positive syngeneic tumor cells. Feltkamp et&#xD;
      al. identified a CTL epitope in HPV-16 E7 using H-2Kb and H-2Db MHC class I-peptide-binding&#xD;
      studies. Immunization with this peptide rendered mice resistant to a challenge with HPV-16&#xD;
      transformed tumor cells. Furthermore, chimeric papillomavirus-like particles (CVLPs) consist&#xD;
      of HPV-16 L1-E7 (Nieland et al., personal communication) or HPV-16 L1/L2-E7 (Greenstone et&#xD;
      al., personal communication) chimeric proteins have been used as therapeutic vaccines against&#xD;
      HPV-16 E7 expressing tumors in murine models. More recently, a phase I/II clinical trial was&#xD;
      performed in eight patients with late stage cervical cancer using a live recombinant vaccinia&#xD;
      virus expressing the E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and 18 (TA-HPV). In that study, no&#xD;
      significant clinical side-effects or environmental contamination by live TA-HPV were&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Cell Mediated Immune Responses in Controlling both HPV Infections and&#xD;
      HPV-Associated Neoplasms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that cell mediated immune responses are important in&#xD;
      controlling both HPV infections and HPV-associated neoplasms. First, the prevalence of&#xD;
      HPV-related diseases (infections and neoplasms) is increased in transplant recipients and&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, both of whom are known to have impaired&#xD;
      cell mediated immunity. Second, animal studies have demonstrated that immunized animals are&#xD;
      protected from papillomavirus infection and from the development of neoplasia. Immunization&#xD;
      also facilitates the regression of existing lesions. Third, infiltrating CD4+ (T helper&#xD;
      cells) and CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor T cells) T cells have been observed in spontaneously&#xD;
      regressing warts and fourth, warts in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy often&#xD;
      disappear when this treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular Immune Responses to HPV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding of T-cell mediated immunity to HPV infections was facilitated by&#xD;
      identification of MHC class I and class II epitopes of HPV proteins. Several groups have&#xD;
      attempted to map murine and human T helper (Th) cell epitopes on HPV proteins. Several groups&#xD;
      have also tried to map murine as well as human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes on HPV&#xD;
      proteins. Kast et al. have identified several high affinity binding peptides of HPV-16 E6 and&#xD;
      E7 proteins for human HLA-A alleles. Furthermore, HPV-specific CTLs recognizing HPV E6 and E7&#xD;
      proteins have been demonstrated in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients, in healthy&#xD;
      donors and in patients with CIN lesions [Nakagawa, 1997 #562]. Furthermore, infiltration of&#xD;
      cervical cancer tissue with HPV-specific CTLs has been recently described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell-mediated immune responses in HPV-infected lesions can be demonstrated by in vivo skin&#xD;
      tests, in vitro CTL assays and in vitro lymphoproliferative responses. For instance, Hopfl et&#xD;
      al. have used bacterially-expressed HPV-16 proteins for skin tests in patients with CIN&#xD;
      lesions and have found specific skin responses to the virion protein L1 and not the E4&#xD;
      protein. In patients with CIN lesions, HPV-specific CTLs have been identified in PBMC and in&#xD;
      cervical tissues. The in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in patients with CIN lesions&#xD;
      have been actively investigated. For example, de Gruijl et al. reported that T cell&#xD;
      proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7 oncogenic protein were most prominent in CIN&#xD;
      patients with a persistent HPV infection. However, Kadish et al. reported that&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative responses to specific HPV-16 E6 and E7 peptides appeared to be associated&#xD;
      with the clearance of HPV infection and the regression of CIN lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Helper T Cell Functions in Generating Effective Antitumor Responses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence has suggested that inadequate antitumor responses can result from a&#xD;
      failure of the helper arm of the immune response. The events leading to the activation of CTL&#xD;
      are tightly regulated in order to protect against the development of inappropriate immune&#xD;
      responses to self antigens or exaggerated responses to foreign antigens. This regulation is&#xD;
      mediated by lymphokines produced by CD4+ T helper cells. CD4+ T helper cells are critical to&#xD;
      the generation of potent antitumor immune responses. CD4+ T cells have been shown to be&#xD;
      instrumental in generating immune responses against several solid malignancies in murine&#xD;
      [Fearon, 1990 #833; Golumbek, 1991 #834] and in human populations [Topalian, 1994 #396;&#xD;
      Topalian, 1994 #397]. Several mouse tumors that are transfected with syngeneic MHC class II&#xD;
      genes become very effective vaccines against subsequent challenge with wild type class II&#xD;
      negative tumors [Ostrand-Rosenberg, 1990 #177; James, 1991 #272; Chen, 1993 #213] In&#xD;
      addition, as crucial memory cells in the T cell arm of the immune system, CD4+ cells may be&#xD;
      able to provide long term immunity against specific antigens [Tew, 1990 #624; Sprent, 1994&#xD;
      #625].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Cytokines in Cell-Mediated Immunity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell mediated immunity is regulated by cytokines which are secreted by T helper cells. In&#xD;
      general, T helper cells can be classified as Th1 and/or Th2 cells based on the different&#xD;
      types of cytokines they secrete. Th1 cells secrete interleukin (IL) 2 and interferon gamma&#xD;
      (IFN-gamma). Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. The Th1 lymphocytes are the most&#xD;
      important effector cells in inflammatory reactions associated with vigorous delay-type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity but low antibody production, as occurs in contact dermatitis and in viral or&#xD;
      intracellular bacterial infections (for review, see [Mosmann, 1989 #168; Romagnani, 1992&#xD;
      #130]). The functional phenotype of most Th2 cells may account for both the persistent&#xD;
      production of certain antibody isotypes, particularly IgG1 and IgE, and the eosinophilia&#xD;
      observed in human helminthic infections and allergic disorders. Lymphocyte mediated&#xD;
      protection from viral infections as well as control of tumors is thought to be mediated by&#xD;
      Th1 cytokine responses and impaired by Th2 cytokine responses. The IL-2 and IFN-gamma&#xD;
      producing Th1 response is likely to be the major component that contributes to the&#xD;
      development of cell mediated immunity against HPV infections and HPV-associated neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chimeric E7-specific vaccines can control the HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model. By cooperating&#xD;
      with Prof. TC Wu at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, we have successfully developed&#xD;
      several chimeric DNA, RNA, and virus-vector vaccines to prevent and treat HPV16 E7-expressing&#xD;
      tumors in animal models. We found that these E7-chimeric DNA vaccines are capable of&#xD;
      preventing and treating the growth of murine model tumors expressing E7. These positive&#xD;
      results from the preclinical murine models have encouraged us to focus on the development of&#xD;
      a cancer vaccine and immunotherapy and apply these vaccines to human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is very important to set up various E7-specific immunologic assays of human&#xD;
      beings to evaluate the effect of a cancer vaccine or immunotherapy in future clinical trials.&#xD;
      So we would like to provide this proposal to address the development of HPV 16 E7-specific&#xD;
      immunologic assays in human beings. There are several aims in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop and utilize assays to measure CTLs to HPV 16 E7 proteins, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to develop and utilize assays to measure T helper (Th) responses to HPV 16 E7 antigens.&#xD;
