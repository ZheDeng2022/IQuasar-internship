      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of Dialectical&#xD;
      Behavior Therapy (DBT) for chronically suicidal behavior in individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder (BPD). Recent investigations of DBT have yielded positive&#xD;
      results and have challenged the widely held opinion that the prognosis for this condition is&#xD;
      poor. This study will consist of a two-arm randomized controlled trial that will compare DBT&#xD;
      with a General Psychiatric Management (GPM) condition consisting of a structured algorithmic&#xD;
      medication intervention plus psychosocial counseling. One-hundred and eighty participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either DBT or to the GPM condition. Clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed by changes in: (1) parasuicidal behaviour; (2) treatment retention; (3) psychiatric&#xD;
      symptomatology; (4) anger expression; (5) social functioning and (6) health status. Cost&#xD;
      outcomes will include an analysis of health service utilization. Clinical and cost&#xD;
      evaluations will occur at 4-month intervals over the course of the one-year treatment and&#xD;
      over a two-year follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide, a major cause of death worldwide, is a serious public health problem. Forty percent&#xD;
      of individuals who commit suicide meet diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder and an&#xD;
      even higher percent of those attempting suicide have a personality disorder . Borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder (BPD) is highly associated with parasuicidal behaviour. Parasuicidal&#xD;
      behaviour refers to suicide attempts or other self-injurious behaviour and is a risk factor&#xD;
      for completed suicide. Approximately 69% - 80% of people diagnosed with BPD have committed at&#xD;
      least one act of self-harm. Estimates of completed suicides in this population are about 9%,&#xD;
      with this rate quadrupling for patients who meet 8 or more of the 9 DSM criteria for BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronically suicidal behaviour in people with BPD is estimated to be among the most expensive&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders to treat. While there is an extensive anecdotal literature on the&#xD;
      treatment of this population, clinical outcomes have been dismal and treatment evidence based&#xD;
      on well-designed trials is sparse. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a broad-based&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), has recently shown promise in the treatment of this&#xD;
      population. DBT is being widely adopted in the treatment of this disorder despite its limited&#xD;
      empirical base. To date, there are few studies on DBT and no replications of the original&#xD;
      research on DBT by researchers independent of the treatment developer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of DBT for the&#xD;
      treatment of parasuicidal individuals with BPD compared to a General Psychiatric Management&#xD;
      (GPM) control condition involving a structured algorithm medication intervention plus&#xD;
      psychosocial support. This study will compare the following outcome measures in participants&#xD;
      who receive Dialectical Behavior Therapy versus General Psychiatric Management, Best&#xD;
      Practices during a one-year treatment interval and two-year follow-up: (1) frequency and&#xD;
      severity of parasuicidal behaviours ; (2) number of self-harm episodes (3) improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life (4) cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:(1) Patients in the DBT condition will show greater reductions in the frequency&#xD;
      and severity of parasuicidal behaviours compared to patients in the GPM condition during a&#xD;
      one-year treatment interval and two-year follow-up; (2) Compared to GPM, DBT will result in a&#xD;
      greater reduction in the number of self-harm episodes and a greater improvement in quality of&#xD;
      life but will have a higher direct cost. However, because DBT will result in significant&#xD;
      offsetting reductions in other health service costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      ratios will fall within the range of many accepted medical interventions.&#xD;
