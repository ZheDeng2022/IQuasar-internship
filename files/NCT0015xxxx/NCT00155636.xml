      This PPG entitled &quot;A Study on Etiological Factors of Schizophrenia&quot; (SEFOS) focuses on&#xD;
      searching for the separate etiological factors under the understanding that schizophrenia is&#xD;
      a complex disorder. Multifactorial model has been most often proposed as the etiological&#xD;
      model. Up to now, fragmented knowledge of etiological factors, including genetic factor and&#xD;
      environmental insults were reported in literature, and a two-strike hypothesis has been&#xD;
      proposed. This PPG of SEFOS formulates a dynamic etiological hypothesis of schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Specific, however heterogeneous, genes are hypothesized to be located in chromosome 1q, 6P,&#xD;
      8P, 15q, and 22q; specific environmental insults or stress are hypothesized to be acting in&#xD;
      the vulnerable brain a long different stages of biological and/or psychological development.&#xD;
      The interaction of specific genes and specific environment insults/stress along different&#xD;
      stages of development will result in specific neurobiological abnormalities as shown in&#xD;
      neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neurochemical/neuroimaging abnormalities. For this&#xD;
      hypothesis testing, this PPG of SEFOS designs 3 projects of: (1) A Study on Neurobiology of&#xD;
      Schizophrenia; (2) A Study on Environmental insults/stress of schizophrenia; and (3)&#xD;
      Molecular Genetics Study of Schizophrenia. Project No.1 aims at finding different levels of&#xD;
      neurobiological and anatomical abnormalities; Project No.2 aims at finding different levels&#xD;
      of environmental insults/ stress; Project No.3 aims at locating vulnerability genes in&#xD;
      different chromosome regions. A core unit for administrative integration, for case/family&#xD;
      recruitment and statistical analysis is also designed. The dynamic etiological complex will&#xD;
      be explored under multivariate statistical analysis. This PPG of SEFOS adopts&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach including clinical psychiatrists, psychopathologists,&#xD;
      neuropsychologist, neurophysiologist, neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging) specialist,&#xD;
      genetic epidemiologist, molecular genetic specialist, genetic statistician, and&#xD;
      biostatisticians. This team has sound mutual trust base on the experience of being working&#xD;
      together and attending regular research meeting for the part several years under the&#xD;
      leadership of the principal investigator of this PPG.&#xD;

      Progress Report Schizophrenia is a chronic and devastating major psychiatric disorder. It&#xD;
      costs a lot of the individual patient, the family as well as the society. Schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients occupy around 80% of the chronic psychiatric beds. About 60 % of the acute&#xD;
      psychiatric beds serve the schizophrenic patients at severe aggravating state of illness. The&#xD;
      majority of the schizophrenic patients need the support of the family for their daily life.&#xD;
      For better service of these patients, their family as well as for reducing social stigma of&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients, more psychopathological understanding is crucial. However,&#xD;
      schizophrenia is a complex disorder. For the past one century, the understanding of&#xD;
      schizophrenia improved much. In Taiwan, the psychopathological study on schizophrenia&#xD;
      deserves basic and systematic approach for clinical and academic purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before it could be possible to understand the essence of the psychopathology of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, the descriptive psychopathology has to be well documented. The heterogeneity&#xD;
      at the level of clinical pathology has to be delineated as the initial step of&#xD;
      psychopathological study of schizophrenia. This is crucial under the consideration of&#xD;
      cross-cultural application of diagnostic criteria in the definition of schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      psychopathology of the disease category of schizophrenia as defined by the DSM-IV system was&#xD;
      documented mainly by the literature based on the descriptive study of the patients of the&#xD;
      Caucasian population and the related culture. Western medicine in Taiwan is totally accepted&#xD;
      in the academic circle. From a cross-cultural point of view, this way of academic operation&#xD;
      has to be reflected methodologically and to be examined empirically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on schizophrenia psychopathology has to be of two kinds of value. The first is to be&#xD;
      of the frontier academic work of the World Psychiatry, and the study results can contribute&#xD;
      to the knowledge of the World Psychiatry Literature. The second is to be of native cultural&#xD;
      value. The results could be of value in reflecting the native cultural reality and could be&#xD;
      of value in application of these study results to clinical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be at the frontier of schizophrenia research, the neuropsychological impairments&#xD;
      underlined the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia is one major area of study. In&#xD;
      contrast to the traditional theory of psychological defense mechanism or the psychosocial&#xD;
      explanation of psychopathology of schizophrenia, the neuropsychological approach could&#xD;
      provide the way to understand the neural mechanism of schizophrenia psychopathology at the&#xD;
      level of psychological function. In the era of neuroscience achievement, this approach is&#xD;
      promising and crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most basic psychopathology of schizophrenia is the genetic factor of etiology. In the era&#xD;
      of molecular medicine, the genetic epidemiological and molecular genetic study on&#xD;
      schizophrenia psychopathology is the most frontier line of schizophrenia research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research team leaded by the Principal Investigator, Hai-Gwo Hwu, of this PPG began this&#xD;
      approach in July 1993. The initial work started with the Multidimensional Psychopathological&#xD;
      Group Research Project: Schizophrenia&quot; (MPGRP). This MPGRP was designed based on the&#xD;
      theoretical evolutionary model (EM) of psychopathology invented by this Principal&#xD;
      Investigator. This EM model included multiple psychopathological factors including genetic&#xD;
      factors, brain insults, chronic developmental life experience, neurobiological&#xD;
      manifestations, personality-adjustment factor, environmental stress of biological and&#xD;
      psychological factors, familial social cultural value factor and the factor of treatment. In&#xD;
      this EM model, the disease course was hypothesized into three phases: initial subclinical&#xD;
      stage, clinical stage, and the outcome stage after treatment. This MPGRP was thus designed&#xD;
      following the guidance of EM psychopathological model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To design the psychopathological study based on this EM of psychopathology, it is necessary&#xD;
      to invent a new methodological approach. This approach included serial multi-dimensional&#xD;
      study design. The first step was to set-up a smooth infrastructure and to collect a cohort of&#xD;
      clinical schizophrenia cases for follow-up study, and also to collect schizophrenia family&#xD;
      with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia for molecular genetic study. This&#xD;
      first step also considered that the descriptive psychopathological study, the study on search&#xD;
      for a biological trait marker and the search for identification of linkage of possible&#xD;
      vulnerability genetic markers of schizophrenia as the major research tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial project started as the MPGRP from July 1993 till June 1998, the subsequent&#xD;
      project following the initial MPGRP, was the Multidimensional Psychopathological Study on&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (MPSS) started in July 1998 till June 2001. The focus of the MPGRP was to study&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia and the family situation in a cohort of&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients. The MPGRP also focused on the phenotype definition of schizophrenia&#xD;
      using CPT manifestation in the schizophrenia family. CPT was done in all of the family of&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients. The family with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia&#xD;
      were collected for molecular genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MPSS project, the focus was on the follow-up neuropsychological evaluation of the&#xD;
      schizophrenia cohort collected in the MPGRP, other than the descriptive follow-up clinical&#xD;
      data collection. Besides, the MPSS also focus on the CPT and WCST studies on the family&#xD;
      members o the family with at last two siblings affected with schizophrenia. These families&#xD;
      are also the sample for molecular genetic study. The collection of the schizophrenia family&#xD;
      of this kind for molecular genetic study is still the work of this MPSS, as the collection of&#xD;
      this kind of family was not an easy task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several important features characterize the uniqueness of this MPGRP and MPSS : (1)&#xD;
      a prospective follow-up design, (2) multidisciplinary approach, (3) multi-center,&#xD;
      multi-hospital approach, (4) operationalized assessment of schizophrenia psychopathology&#xD;
      using the &quot;Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&quot; (PANSS)(4), (5) covering multi-dimensional&#xD;
      psychopathological factors, (6) representing up-to-date psychopathological study of phenotype&#xD;
      definition, molecular genetic study, neuropsychological study, as well as the study on the&#xD;
      expressed emotion of the chief care giver and the family burden and need of care of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This MPGRP and the MPSS were successfully carried out from July 1993 to March 2001(up to the&#xD;
      time of sending this SEFOS proposal as the subsequent study on the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, a further step of psychopathological study on schizophrenia) based on the&#xD;
      following facts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multidisciplinary team to be possible in&#xD;
      psychopathological study in Taiwan. This is not an easy task. Other than the technological&#xD;
      breakthrough in research administration in this manner, the successful element was that this&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach made a smooth working infrastructure for this psychopathological&#xD;
      research for successive research works. Other than research work itself, the attending&#xD;
      members of this research team obtained continuous training and exercise in psychopathological&#xD;
      study. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multi-center, multi-hospital approach came true in Taiwan&#xD;
      in psychopathological study. This institutional infrastructure guarantee that the sampling of&#xD;
      schizophrenic cases to be more representative of patient population for psychopathological&#xD;
      study. Other than research administration breakthrough, this approach provided a great chance&#xD;
      for clinical psychiatrist to participate in training and practice in psychopathological basic&#xD;
      training. Besides, the clinical service team members, other than psychiatrist, including&#xD;
      psychiatric nurse, psychologist, psychiatric social worker can obtain the common sense&#xD;
      understanding of general psychopathological approach in psychiatry. This close team approach&#xD;
      will make the service team to be more cohesive in the care of the patients. The patients&#xD;
      attending this study would obtain more attention from the psychiatric service team leaded by&#xD;
      the research psychiatrist, especially in the successive follow-up study. This is crucial in&#xD;
      elevating the professional activity in a positive sense embedded in this MPGRP and MPSS&#xD;
      research. This is also one achievement of this MPGRP and MPSS in the infrastructure of this&#xD;
      research approach. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication, but&#xD;
      can be demonstrated in daily research and practice activities. It can also be shown in the&#xD;
      subsequent research activities such as this SEFOS project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. This MPRP and MPSS brought the Taiwan Psychiatry to the frontier line of&#xD;
      psychopathological study and contribute new knowledge to schizophrenia literature. Besides,&#xD;
      this MPGRP and MPSS also took care of the standpoint of the native culture background. The&#xD;
      descriptive phenomenological approach is the essence of operationalized psychopathological&#xD;
      study. The cross-cultural modification and justification of the Western rating schedule of&#xD;
      the PANSS has been considered and successfully done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The family of schizophrenic patent was also the major area of study based on the&#xD;
      characteristics of the Taiwan culture. The family took the responsibility of patient care&#xD;
      closely. The burden and the need of patient care are important topic of this study. Besides,&#xD;
      taking the advantage of the culture background of the close family tie of the patient and the&#xD;
      family, genetic study of schizophrenia including genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics&#xD;
      is one major task of this MGRP and the MPSS too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Major academic achievements of the track of this PPG and the MPSS psychopathological study&#xD;
      in these past 7 to 8 years included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The findings of different symptom clusters of schizophrenia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Categorical or dimensional approach of schizophrenia psychopathology is still a current&#xD;
           unsolved issue in schizophrenia research. The MPGRP collected 234 schizophrenia subjects&#xD;
           in the Northern part of Taiwan and designed a cohort follow-up study in 1993. At the end&#xD;
           of this MPGRP, ranged from1998 to 2000 for data analysis, the descriptive&#xD;
           psychopathological PANSS data assessed on admission were analyzed using explorative&#xD;
           factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and a basic 4- dimensional&#xD;
           model of schizophrenia psychopathology was established. These 4 dimensions are:&#xD;
           &quot;Negative and associated Negative symptoms&quot;, &quot;Disorganized thought&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;Hostility/excitement&quot;, and &quot;Delusion/hallucination&quot;. Including the general&#xD;
           psychopathological section of the PANSS, there is an additional dimension of&#xD;
           anxiety/depression was found in the EFA. The CFA cannot found satisfactorily model for&#xD;
           model fitting as the general psychopathology section was included in CFA. This could be&#xD;
           due to the high variability and low base rates of these items of the general&#xD;
           psychopathological section of PANSS. Besides, this could also be due to the peripheral&#xD;
           nature of these symptom items in schizophrenia psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These findings were confirmed by another statistical graphic approach, the color graphic&#xD;
           generalized association plots (GAP) in delineating the heterogeneity of descriptive&#xD;
           symptom pathology of the schizophrenia. In this GAP analysis, again a 4-dimension model&#xD;
           was also found based on the PANSS data assessed on admission. These 4 dimensions were&#xD;
           also arranged according to the proximity matrix and were revealed as the following&#xD;
           order: (1) &quot;Negative symptom&quot;, (2) &quot;Disorganized thought&quot;, (3) &quot;Hostility/Excitement&quot;.&#xD;
           (4) &quot;Delusion/hallucination&quot; dimensions. The possible dimension of &quot;Anxiety/depression&quot;&#xD;
           was also observed near the end of the dimension of &quot;Negative symptom dimension&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The validity of these symptom dimensions was assessed using the impairment of sustained&#xD;
           attention assessed by continuous performance test (CPT). It was found that the negative&#xD;
           symptom dimension was associated with impaired CPT. Furthermore, the severely impaired&#xD;
           (Z&gt;3.0) d' of CPT was found to be associated with persistent negative symptom, the&#xD;
           deficit state of clinical psychopathology, of schizophrenia. The delusion/hallucination&#xD;
           dimension was found to be associated with the impaired neuronal activity of hippocampal&#xD;
           region measured by the neuroimaging technology of Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The GAP analysis based on the successive PANSS data assessed on admission, 6-month,&#xD;
           1-year and 2-year follow-up also showed a stable 5-dimension model of psychopathology.&#xD;
           The component symptom dimensions were the same as that of the data assesses on&#xD;
           admission. These are dimensions of &quot;Negative symptom&quot;, &quot;Disorganized thought&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;Hostility/excitement&quot;, &quot;Delusion/hallucination&quot; and &quot;Anxiety/depression&quot;. This research&#xD;
           team developed the concept of core symptom dimension by selecting the stable symptom&#xD;
           items appeared stably over the all follow up course over 4 successive assessments across&#xD;
           the 2-year follow-up. The validity of these core psychopathological dimensions composed&#xD;
           of core, stable symptom cluster items is still under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The findings of different subgroups of schizophrenia patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the cohort follow-up design, it is possible to search the possibility of the&#xD;
           existence of different subgroups of patients be categorical approach. Matched with the&#xD;
           effort on differentiating the symptom dimensions of psychopathology, it is also possible&#xD;
           to define the different subgroups of patients based on the composition of symptom&#xD;
           dimensions. This research team invented this analytical approach called as the GAP&#xD;
           analysis for this purpose. The results were partly shown in the website:&#xD;
           http://gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw. Based on the admission PANSS data, this GAP found 4&#xD;
           symptom clusters of &quot;Negative symptom&quot;, &quot;Disorganized thought&quot;, &quot;Hostility/excitement&quot;,&#xD;
           and &quot;Delusion/hallucination&quot;, and also two subgroups of patients with (GWNEG) and&#xD;
           without (GONEG) marked negative symptoms. These two groups of patients were found to&#xD;
           have validity from the manifestation of clinical symptom dimensions in the follow-up&#xD;
           course and CPT performance. Besides, these two subgroups also differed in the treatment&#xD;
           response an prognostic outcome as shown in social functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The GAP analysis, based on the follow-up data of PANSS assessment, can also find&#xD;
           consistently a 4 -dimensional model of schizophrenia psychopathology. One additional&#xD;
           dimension of anxiety/depression was also found. The patient subgrouping consistently&#xD;
           found three patient subgroups at 6-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. One is of low&#xD;
           psychopathology group (good treatment response group), the other is of marked blunt&#xD;
           group and the last is of persistent delusion/hallucination group. The concordance of the&#xD;
           GWNEG and GONEG and these three groups are still under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impaired sustained attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We used a CPT machine from Sunrise Systems, version 2.20 (Pembroke, MA, USA). The&#xD;
           procedure has been described in detail I our publications. Briefly, numbers from 0 to 9&#xD;
           were randomly presented for 50 milliseconds each, at a rate of one per second. Each&#xD;
           subject undertook two CPT sessions: the undegraded 1-9 task and the degraded 1-9 task.&#xD;
           The sensitivity index (d) of the CPT performance reflects the subject's sustained&#xD;
           attention. Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured&#xD;
           by the CPT are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. The results are: (1) a&#xD;
           substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands (19-34%)&#xD;
           have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance; (2)&#xD;
           subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit CPT deficits, which are&#xD;
           specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy; (3) CPT deficits are&#xD;
           present in schizophrenic patients, are particularly associated with negative and&#xD;
           disorganized symptoms, and those with more difficult CPT versions are not amenable to&#xD;
           neuroleptic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The familial tendency of schizophrenia in Taiwan schizophrenia proband In this MPGRP and&#xD;
           MPSS stdy, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Genetic Study (DIGS) and schizotypy&#xD;
           interview schedule (SIS) were translated and modified to be useful in Taiwan subjects.&#xD;
           The Perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and Schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ)&#xD;
           were also used in community study on schizophrenia-related personality disorders. The&#xD;
           cross-cultural consideration was employed. In community study, the schizophrenia-related&#xD;
           personality disorders were assessed using the PAS and SPQ initially and then by DIGS and&#xD;
           SIS interview. Including schizophrenia-related personality disorder in the spectrum did&#xD;
           not increase power for linkage analysis o schizophrenia. This is one important&#xD;
           information for our molecular genetic study of this MPGRP and MPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explorative neurobiological study on the schizophrenic samples of this MPGRP and the&#xD;
           MPSS project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The neuropsychological study of the MPSS design and the impact of the concept of&#xD;
           endophenotype of molecular genetic study induce this MPSS research team to explore the&#xD;
           role of the neurophysiological parameter of P50 inhibition and the neurochemical&#xD;
           parameter of neuronal activity shown in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrometry (MRS) of&#xD;
           relative concentrations of various specific biochemical molecules such as choline and&#xD;
           creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The P50 study and the related neurophysiological study provided the chance to study the&#xD;
           implicit and explicit study paradigm of schizophrenia. The implicit learning of color in&#xD;
           schizophrenia was fond to be significantly impaired as compared to the controls. The 3-D&#xD;
           dimension display of brain energy in this P50 study showed that the energy distribution&#xD;
           of the schizophrenic patients was significantly different from that of the controls. The&#xD;
           MRS study showed that the positive symptom cluster was correlated to the decreased&#xD;
           neuronal activity of the hippocampal region. These study results make it possible for&#xD;
           this research tem to design the research on the all family members of the schizophrenia&#xD;
           proband for pathogenesis genetic study on multi-etiological factors and their&#xD;
           interaction by using these neurobiological parameters designed in this SEFOS, an&#xD;
           investigation on the dynamic pathogenetic process of schizophrenia, leaded by this&#xD;
           Principal Investigator with smooth working infrastructure for multidimensional&#xD;
           psychopathological study on schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Molecular genetic study on locating vulnerability gene in different chromosome regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Linkage study and association study were performed in this project for locating the&#xD;
           vulnerability genes of schizophrenia by examining the warm spots of schizophrenia in&#xD;
           some chromosome regions of chromosome 1q, 6p, 8p, and 15q. The study results, so far&#xD;
           obtained in this laboratory using 52 Taiwanese families with at least 2 siblings&#xD;
           affected with schizophrenia, could not exclude the possible existence of the&#xD;
           schizophrenia vulnerability genes locations in these chromosome regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further study of the PPG of SEFOS will focus on these positions of these 5 markers with&#xD;
           potential linkage to find closer genetic markers possibly linked with schizophrenia&#xD;
           using closer genetic markers such as the combination of dinucleotide and SNP markers.&#xD;
           The candidate genes around these genetic markers will also be explored to search for&#xD;
           mutations related to the pathological variation of schizophrenia. This will be the focus&#xD;
           of this PPG of SEFOS too following this MPGRP and MPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This laboratory is exploring for the possibility of the candidate gene approach based on&#xD;
           plausible animal model of schizophrenia and/or pathophysiological process of&#xD;
           schizophrenia. The NMDA subunit R1 receptor gene and nicotinic receptor alpha 7 subtype&#xD;
           genes are two genes under exploration. The skin test of niacin test was also explored in&#xD;
           this laboratory for the possible association with genetic defect in the phospholipid&#xD;
           metabolism related genes. These will be included in this PPG of SEFOS study in the&#xD;
           future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Expressed emotion and burden of the family of schizophrenic patients The family as a&#xD;
           unit of study is also concerned in this MPGRP and the MPSS. The expressed emotion was&#xD;
           once considered to be a stable trait of the family chief caregiver and was hypothesized&#xD;
           to have specific psychopathological meaning in schizophrenia. However, the expressed&#xD;
           emotion of the Taiwanese schizophrenia family was found to be changing according the&#xD;
           course of illness. It was not stable. The family burden was found to be very high and&#xD;
           specific clinical measures for relieving thee family burden has to be designed for&#xD;
           better clinical service of the schizophrenia family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Invention of statistical method for psychopathological study The multivariate nature of&#xD;
           the psychopathological data demands the invention of novel statistical method for data&#xD;
           management. In this MPGRP and the MPSS, the analysis of 33 PANSS symptoms and the&#xD;
           subgrouping of the patients in the study of schizophrenia heterogeneity invite a&#xD;
           development of the new color graphic approach in the exploration of symptom dimensions&#xD;
           and patent subgrouping. This was named as Generalized Association Plots (GAP). This&#xD;
           demonstrates the fruitful approach in the multi-disciplinary team-work in the&#xD;
           psychopathological study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data bank establishment of this MPGRP and the MPSS. In the past 7 to 8 years of the&#xD;
           MPGRP and MPSS work, important data banks of clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia&#xD;
           were established. These data banks will be useful for successive data analysis to test&#xD;
           the various hypotheses related to the issues of heterogeneity of schizophrenia. These&#xD;
           data banks included (1) basic clinical data bank of schizophrenia cohort of 234 cases&#xD;
           and their follow-up clinical data for up to 7 years of follow-up data, (2) data bank of&#xD;
           objective ratings of PANSS, ESRS, and CDRS, and (3) neuropsychological testing data bank&#xD;
           of successive follow-up neuropsychological evaluations. The DNA bank and cell-line bank&#xD;
           of the families of schizophrenia and other related disorders is also very important for&#xD;
           further molecular genetic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than this DNA data bank of this MPGRP and MPSS, this laboratory also performed the&#xD;
      Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study (TSLS) in collaboration with researchers of the Harvard&#xD;
      Medical School under the support of the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect 600 families with at least&#xD;
      two siblings affected with schizophrenia. This data bank included DIGS, DNA and CPT as well&#xD;
      as WCST. This research team will use this data set to replicate the initial findings obtained&#xD;
      in this laboratory originally. This will be one major focus of the subsequent SEFOS of this&#xD;
      PPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these data banks justify the abundant resource of data for continuous data analysis and&#xD;
      paper publication of this SEFOS of the PPG, and this is the reason that this SEFOS has to set&#xD;
      the core containing a statistical sub-core unit for the operation of data analysis. Up to the&#xD;
      present, this research team is mature enough to do continuous data analysis and serial&#xD;
      hypothesis testing. All these data provided the evidence that the grant of this SEFOS will,&#xD;
      apparently, achieve the expected results of this research team with great confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. The progress of the MPSS (July, 1998 - June 2001) till March, 2001 as the PPG of SEFOS was&#xD;
      proposed. Three sub-projects were reported to be as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Phenomenological and neuropsychological manifestations of schizophrenia: a prospective&#xD;
      follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) A family-genetic study of co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia. (3) Molecular genetic&#xD;
      study on schizophrenia using co-affected sib-pair and association strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this MPSS has been going on smoothly in data collection as well as in data&#xD;
      analysis. The paper publication is going on steadily. These three sub-projects were&#xD;
      integrated and coordinated smoothly. Besides, the preliminary works using the neurobiological&#xD;
      technology of neurophysiology and brain Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS) for&#xD;
      measurements of psychopathological related manifestations have been performed. These&#xD;
      technologies were proved to be satisfactorily stable and applicable in psychopathological&#xD;
      study. The preliminary results were obtained and manuscripts were prepared for submission.&#xD;
      Actually, the technology can also be extended to the other brain parts including the frontal&#xD;
      region and the measurement of tractography is also available in the imaging laboratory of the&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The past tract record of the achievement of the smooth working infrastructure of this&#xD;
      research team leaded by the P.I. Hai-Gwo Hwu, including multidisciplinary specialists and&#xD;
      multi-institutes, the achievement of the advanced technologies of neurobiological&#xD;
      measurements related to the study of current psychopathological investigation of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, the previous achievement in psychopathological hypothesis testing and the&#xD;
      academic achievement of this research team, and the abundant data bank, highly justify that&#xD;
      this research team of the SEFOS of this PPG is a well cultivated research tem in&#xD;
      schizophrenia research. This SEFOS of PPG can positively be expected to have successful&#xD;
      results in the future if this team has this SEFOS grant for the coming 5 years of research&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
