  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of JSI-1187 as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced solid tumors with MAPK pathway mutations, including mutations that&#xD;
      cause MAPK pathway hyperactivation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selected subjects will include males and females age ≥18 years; histologically confirmed&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with archived tumor sample from the primary,&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic disease with documented MAPK pathway mutation or pathway&#xD;
      hyperactivating mutations; advanced or recovered from all acute toxicities (≤ Grade 1) due to&#xD;
      prior therapy; adequate renal and hepatic function; and no known history of significant&#xD;
      cardiac or retinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (Monotherapy Dose Escalation): Following screening, a total of up to 42 subjects are&#xD;
      anticipated to establish the MTD of JSI-1187 monotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors with MAPK pathway mutations, including hyperactivating pathway&#xD;
      mutations or gene fusions, refractory to or relapsed on prior therapy. JSI-1187 will be&#xD;
      administered orally twice daily (BID) at doses of 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 mg (total daily&#xD;
      doses of 4, 8, 16, 32, 48 and 64 mg), repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle). Subjects will take&#xD;
      their BID doses in a fasted state, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If 2 of 3 subjects&#xD;
      at a given dose level experience a Grade 2 adverse event, or a single subject experiences a&#xD;
      Grade 3 adverse event, further JSI-1187 dose increases will not exceed 50%. A total of 6&#xD;
      subjects will be treatment at the MTD before starting Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (Combination Dose Escalation): Following screening, a total of up to 24 subjects are&#xD;
      anticipated to establish the MTD of JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Twice daily doses of both drugs will be taken in the&#xD;
      fasted state. A 3+3 dose escalation schema will be followed to establish the MTD of the&#xD;
      JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib combination. A total of 6 subjects will be treated at the JSI-1187&#xD;
      plus dabrafenib combined MTD before beginning Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C (Expansion Cohorts): Following screening, a total of 58 subjects in 3 cohorts are&#xD;
      anticipated to expand the disease treatment settings of JSI-1187 in combination with&#xD;
      dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated advanced solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma after two prior&#xD;
      therapies for metastatic disease, including anti-PD1 therapy, with or without ipilimumab, and&#xD;
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. (n=21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma after adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy for Stage 3 disease followed by therapy for metastatic disease, including anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy, with or without ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. (n=21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib in either BRAF V600E-mutated non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) or BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors after 1 or 2 prior therapies. (n=16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JSI-1187 plus dabrafenib will be administered at the MTDs established for both drugs in Part&#xD;
      B, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) will be allowed to continue therapy&#xD;
      with JSI-1187 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events,&#xD;
      intercurrent illness or changes in the subject's condition that prevents further study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST v.1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for hematology, coagulation parameters and serum chemistry determinations will be&#xD;
      collected, ECGs will be taken and ophthalmologic exams will be conducted during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be taken for PK assessment of JSI-1187 and dabrafenib and PD assessment of&#xD;
      pRSK/RSK ratio determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies will be taken from consenting subjects at Screening and on-study for pRSK&#xD;
      determination. Results will be correlated with clinical outcome.&#xD;
