  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are circulating blood cells. They bind to each other and to the wall of the damaged&#xD;
      vessel to prevent excessive blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets can be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insufficient in number in the case of thrombocytopenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or non-functional in the case of thrombopathy. Constitutional thrombopathies and&#xD;
           thrombopenias are rare diseases. Constitutional thrombopenias cause haemorrhage of&#xD;
           variable intensity and are sometimes a sign of more serious haematological pathologies.&#xD;
           The evolutionary risk of some constitutional thrombopenias is the appearance of&#xD;
           myelofibrosis, dysmyelopoiesis or malignant proliferation. While the evolutionary stakes&#xD;
           of some thrombopenias and especially syndromic thrombopenias will be more likely to&#xD;
           affect other organs (kidney, heart, bones, brain, ...), other constitutional&#xD;
           thrombopenias will have few consequences. Their diagnosis will then have the major&#xD;
           challenge of distinguishing them from immunological thrombopenias and avoiding the use&#xD;
           of inappropriate and sometimes severe treatments (corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulins,&#xD;
           immunosuppressants, splenectomy). Mutations in more than forty genes have been&#xD;
           identified to date and are responsible for thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constitutional thrombopathies are heterogeneous and may involve different platelet&#xD;
      constituents. In short, when platelets are stimulated at a lesion site, various soluble or&#xD;
      matrix agonists bind to platelet receptors to induce calcium flow, secretion and platelet&#xD;
      aggregation at a vascular gap to prevent blood loss. Constitutional thrombopathies are&#xD;
      primarily at risk of spontaneous or induced mucocutaneous bleeding. Some thrombopathies are&#xD;
      also part of more complex syndromic patterns. In recent decades, considerable progress has&#xD;
      been made in the understanding of thrombopathies, enabling them to be better identified.&#xD;
      Details have been provided on platelet dysfunctions linked to abnormalities in the processes&#xD;
      of granule biogenesis and secretion, and to signalling defects (in particular surface&#xD;
      receptor deficiency). Currently, more than thirty genes are the site of autosomal dominant,&#xD;
      recessive or X-linked mutations and can be sequenced.&#xD;

      receptor deficiency). Currently, more than thirty genes are the site of autosomal dominant,&#xD;
      recessive or X-linked mutations and can be sequenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A national organisation has been set up for the molecular diagnosis of these pathologies. DNA&#xD;
      samples from patients meeting strict criteria (familial nature, chronic pathology, associated&#xD;
      signs) are sent to the molecular biology departments. A panel of 80 genes is then sequenced&#xD;
      in order to identify genetic variations potentially responsible for the pathology. In 40% of&#xD;
      cases, a diagnosis of certainty will be made. For the remaining 60%, the analysis will remain&#xD;
      non-informative for several reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either it is a question of revealing a variation in a known gene but not yet described&#xD;
           in the literature, the deleterious nature of which must be confirmed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or no gene has been identified and there will be an indication of a broader sequencing&#xD;
           involving all exons in the genome. This strategy has already enabled the coordinating&#xD;
           site to identify several new genes of particular importance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  either they are individuals for which the constitutional character was not sufficiently&#xD;
           documented, a diagnostic reorientation will then be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will consist of proving the deleterious nature of new genetic variations using&#xD;
      cellular and molecular biology methods. These variations will be either those identified on a&#xD;
      known gene in the context of diagnosis (sequencing of a panel of genes) or those identified&#xD;
      by sequencing exons on a gene not yet known to be involved in constitutional platelet&#xD;
      pathologies. The sequencing of exons is an integral part of the project.&#xD;
