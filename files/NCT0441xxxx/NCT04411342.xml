  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where&#xD;
      about 40% of the diabetics develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) resulting in albuminuria,&#xD;
      reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or both .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albuminuria was widely considered the first clinical sign of DKD, therefore, it has been used&#xD;
      as a screening test for DKD. However, recent studies showed that a significant number of T2DM&#xD;
      patients have a decreased GFR with normoalbuminuria, known as non-albuminuric DKD (NA-DKD) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of albuminuria as an early marker of DKD onset or progression requires a careful&#xD;
      interpretation because in diabetics, albuminuria has a great tendency to return to normal&#xD;
      spontaneously. Evidence based studies reported that about 18-51 percent of T2DM (followed&#xD;
      during 2-10 years) present first with albuminuria turn to normoalbuminurics spontaneously&#xD;
      during the period of follow-up .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) reported that some diabetics pass&#xD;
      directly from a normoalbuminuria to renal insufficiency (0.1% per year) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albuminuria as a marker of glomerular lesion progression has some limitations because of its&#xD;
      intra-patient variability and possibility of spontaneous regress (in &gt;50% of the patients&#xD;
      with low levels of albuminuria), in contrast with GFR that has low variability and infrequent&#xD;
      improvement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few of T2DM patients are presented without significant proteinuria but present with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency and developed DKD (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73 m2), which was defined as normoalbuminuric diabetic kidney disease (NADKD) or&#xD;
      diabetic kidney disease without proteinuria where albuminuria does not associate with&#xD;
      impairment of kidney function .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADA criteria for diagnosis of DKD now involve the presence of eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or&#xD;
      the presence of UAE &gt; 30 mg/24 h. In patients with NADKD, the risk factors include obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, high TG levels, sex, smoking, poor glycemic control, and glomerular&#xD;
      hyperfiltration which play a role in nephrosclerosis. Macroangiopathy is also prevalent in&#xD;
      patients with NADKD .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrarenal arteriosclerosis is the main cause of renal impairment in type 2 diabetic patients&#xD;
      independent of albuminuria, and this partly cause eGFR decline in these patients. Several&#xD;
      studies also suggest that decline in renal function is mainly due to interstitial injury (a&#xD;
      pathological change in DN) as compared with glomerular injury .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normoalbuminuria is associated with Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is the commonest&#xD;
      cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) all over the world. The clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      DKD consist of a progressive increase in albuminuria and a decline in estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Hence, the diagnosis of DKD in patients with&#xD;
      declining renal function without albuminuria is more difficult. The decline of renal function&#xD;
      is slower in normoalbuminuria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tthe majority of patients with DKD had albuminuria, but a significant proportion had the&#xD;
      normoalbuminuric renal impairment (46.6%) . The prevalence of NADKD ranges globally from&#xD;
      14.29 to 56.6% among diabetic patients with different ethnicities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of NADKD is about 23.3% to 56.6% in T2DM patients with a decline in the renal&#xD;
      function presented with normal albuminuria . However, the prevalence at which the patients&#xD;
      develop normoalbuminuric renal impairment in Type 2 diabetes are not completely defined.&#xD;
