  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) for patients with frequent&#xD;
      premature ventricular contractions (FPVCs). Ninety participants will be randomized to TAES&#xD;
      group and sham-TAES group with the ratio of 1:1. They will receive TAES plus usual care or&#xD;
      sham-TAES plus usual care for 6 weeks, and then be followed up for 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with a 50% decrease of the&#xD;
      24 hour (24h) premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) after 6-week treatment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the proportion of participants with a 75% decrease of the 24h-PVCs; the&#xD;
      decrease from baseline of 24h-PVCs, total 24h-heartbeat, and the frequency of&#xD;
      supraventricular arrhythmia; the score change from baseline in PVCs-related symptoms; the&#xD;
      score change from baseline in SAS and SDS. Subgroup analyses will be performed in age,&#xD;
      gender, and the severity of PVCs. Safety assessment will be documented during the whole&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
