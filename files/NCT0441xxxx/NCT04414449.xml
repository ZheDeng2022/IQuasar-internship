  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop adolescents' social-emotional abilities to foster&#xD;
      their personal and social responsibility, as well as their well-being, by means of a&#xD;
      school-based intervention that addresses students, teachers and parents who participate in a&#xD;
      social-emotional program using a technological platform. The program consists of activities&#xD;
      based on solid theoretical frameworks on emotional intelligence, development of&#xD;
      responsibility and meaningful learning.&#xD;

      EmoTIC is an emotional education program focused on the development of social-emotional&#xD;
      competences through an application that can be used in mobile devices and tablets.The program&#xD;
      is based on a space adventure, and provides reinforcement through score points and more time&#xD;
      for the additional games. The duration of the program is 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emoTIC 8 version is designed so that teachers can easily carry it out in their&#xD;
      classrooms. The application consists of application-guided activities that are put into&#xD;
      practice in class, and includes other exercises that are meant to be carried out at home. The&#xD;
      activities that are designed to be carried out during school hours are named &quot;missions&quot;, and&#xD;
      the exercises the students will do at home are called &quot;trainings&quot;. Both are essential to&#xD;
      adequately conduct the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emoTIC SPACE version is designed so that it is carried out autonomously at home, through&#xD;
      application-guided activities. This version includes 8 activities for each of the 4 areas.&#xD;
