  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is caused by an autoimmune process that progressively&#xD;
      destroys the pancreatic β-cells, and leads to dependence on multiple daily insulin&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections according to glucose measurements and dietary restrictions, leading&#xD;
      to short and long term complications. Current data demonstrate that even modest preservation&#xD;
      of β-cell function and endogenous production of insulin (marked by C-peptide) may result in&#xD;
      meaningful clinical benefits including lower rates of complications, improved metabolic&#xD;
      control, reduced insulin injections, and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the efficacy of HBOT on β- cell function in new-onset paediatric T1DM,&#xD;
      compared with sham chamber, including mechanistic inestigation, Study design: A double blind,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study, recruiting patients ages 8-17 years, who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with T1DM within 12 weeks from randomization and express peak C-peptide ≥ 0.2 pmol/ml.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, to hyperbaric chamber (100% oxygen at 2 ATA)&#xD;
      or to sham chamber ( 21% oxygen at 1 ATA) in addition to clinical care guidelines. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive a total of 108 sessions during the 52 weeks study. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures include stimulated peak C-peptide and area under the curve. Study includes also&#xD;
      mechanistic exploratory analysis of proinsulin/insulin ratio, cytokines, Treg, mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells analysis and pancreatic architecture study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected significance: the study suggests a safe modality used clinically among adults and&#xD;
      other paediatric conditions, for the possible solution of an unmet urgent medical need,&#xD;
      studied successfully in an animal model. The study is designed to be powered to answer the&#xD;
      question of efficacy, and in addition, addresses the mechanisms by which it may halt the&#xD;
      progression of β cell destruction in new onset T1DM.&#xD;

      Background and preliminary results: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is caused by an&#xD;
      autoimmune process that progressively destroys the pancreatic β-cells, and leads to&#xD;
      dependence on multiple daily insulin subcutaneous injections according to glucose&#xD;
      measurements and dietary restrictions, leading to short and long term complications. The&#xD;
      autoimmune process is the result of genetic predisposition, immunological defects, and&#xD;
      environmental factors concurring to development of autoreactive T cells (mostly T cytotoxic).&#xD;
      Current data demonstrate that even modest preservation of β-cell function and endogenous&#xD;
      production of insulin (marked by C-peptide) may result in meaningful clinical benefits&#xD;
      including lower rates of complications, improved metabolic control, reduced insulin&#xD;
      injections, and improved quality of life. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a safe&#xD;
      modality, consisting of inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding 1 atmosphere&#xD;
      absolute (ATA) in order to enhance the amount of oxygen dissolved in the body tissues. It has&#xD;
      been demonstrated by our group and others, that the combined action of hyperoxia and&#xD;
      hyperbaric pressure induces proliferation and mobilization of mesenchymal stem cells, and&#xD;
      increment in circulating T regulatory cells (Treg). The effect of HBOT on T1DM&#xD;
      pathophysiology was demonstrated in mouse model, increased number of insulin-positive cells&#xD;
      compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: management with HBOT at T1DM onset will have a beneficial effect on β cell&#xD;
      preservation. The difference will be associated with higher mesenchymal cells production,&#xD;
      increased Treg, and anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. Double blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study of pediatric patients who have been newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      within 12 weeks prior to randomization (6-8 weeks from screening) and express peak C-peptide&#xD;
      ≥ 0.2 pmol/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of HBOT in preservation of β cell function in the pediatric&#xD;
           population with new-onset T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy of HBOT in achieving glycemic control parameters in target range&#xD;
           with lower daily dose of insulin per weight, in the pediatric population with new-onset&#xD;
           T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effect of HBOT on Treg, mesanchymal stem cells, and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines ratio in pediatric population with new-onset T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to hyperbaric oxygen chamber (HBOC) group and to a sham&#xD;
      hyperbaric chamber (SHBC) group. Both groups will be managed similarly by moderate carbs diet&#xD;
      and basal bolus insulin administration, based on their interstitial glucose levels by flash&#xD;
      glucose continuous glucose monitoring system (FG-CGMS) and carbohydrate counting before&#xD;
      meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management protocol is divided to 3 periods: 12 weeks of intensive management, 12 weeks&#xD;
      of maintenance management , and 25 weeks of follow up. Similar in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intensive management period - for 12 weeks, the HBOC group will receive 100%&#xD;
      oxygen at 2 ATA for 90 min with 5 min air breaks every 20 min at each session. Intensive&#xD;
      management period includes 60 daily sessions, 5 days per week within 12 weeks, During the&#xD;
      intensive management period - for 12 weeks, the SHBC group will receive 21% oxygen at 1 ATA&#xD;
      for 90 min with 5 min air breaks every 20 min at each session. In order to endure blinded&#xD;
      sham treatment, in the first 5 minutes of each sessions, atmospheric pressure will increase&#xD;
      to 1.2 ATA and then decompressed to 1 ATA. Intensive management period includes 60 daily&#xD;
      sessions, 5 days per week within 12 weeks, During the maintenance management period, each&#xD;
      group with receive 24 biweekly sessions within 12weeks . Each group will receive similar&#xD;
      percent of oxygen and ATA as during intensive period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the management periods, patients will attend weekly meetings with the diabetes&#xD;
      education team including dialectologist, nurse educator, psychologist and dietician. During&#xD;
      follow-up period they will meet the team once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All will be instructed not to exceed the amount of 80-120 gram of daily carbohydrates and to&#xD;
      inject insulin pre-meals according to carbs-counting, and FG-CGMS. Insulin will be&#xD;
      administered by subcutaneous continuous insulin infusion (SCII) or by InPen only, for&#xD;
      accurate daily dose of insulin recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the 52 weeks of the study several parameters will be assessed at pre-defined time&#xD;
      points .&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pancreatic β cells function will be evaluated by measurements of blood area under the&#xD;
           curve (AUC) C-peptide, peak C-peptide, and basal proinsulin/c-peptide ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. glycemic control parameters will be evaluated by FG-CGMS data regarding time spent in&#xD;
           glycemicrange, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges, total daily dose of&#xD;
           insulinaccording to InPen, and blood tests for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immune system parameters will be assessed by blood levels of T-regulatory cells,&#xD;
           diabetes auto-antibody and inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Microbiome changes will be assessed by stool samples.&#xD;
