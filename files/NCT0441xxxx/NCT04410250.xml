  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral hygiene is one of the most accessible and well-known strategies for the prevention of&#xD;
      dental caries. The benefits of this practice after tooth eruption are well established in the&#xD;
      literature. Oral hygiene in newborns prior to tooth eruption is controversial, since there is&#xD;
      a disagreement between the Dental and Pediatric Associations as to the optimal time to&#xD;
      initiate oral hygiene in children and scientific studies in this regard have not yet been&#xD;
      performed. Some of these associations recommend starting this practice from the eruption of&#xD;
      the child's first tooth. Others recommend beginning the cleansing of the child's oral cavity&#xD;
      from birth by cleaning the baby's gingival rollers and tongue. The aim of the present&#xD;
      investigation will be to evaluate, through a randomized clinical trial, the influence of oral&#xD;
      hygiene in newborns on Candida spp colonization. and on the child's behavior during oral&#xD;
      hygiene after tooth eruption. Will be included in the study, pairs of mothers and babies born&#xD;
      in the maternity of the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Sa√∫de, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a rehearsal Randomized clinical trial in which newborns will be allocated into 2&#xD;
      groups, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborns whose parents will receive guidelines for oral hygiene before tooth eruption&#xD;
           (Group 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newborns whose parents will receive instructions not to perform oral hygiene before&#xD;
           tooth eruption (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial data collection will be performed one month after the child's birth and will&#xD;
      include oral clinical examinations, saliva collection and questionnaires on the&#xD;
      socio-environmental, economic and behavioral aspects of the child and his family. Initial&#xD;
      oral clinical examinations will be performed to assess the presence of Candidiasis, and&#xD;
      saliva collection will be performed to identify and quantification of Candida spp. These&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed again every three months. From the eruption of the first&#xD;
      deciduous tooth, the follow-up included an assessment of the baby's behavior during oral&#xD;
      hygiene performed by the responsible. This evaluation will be made by the examiner using the&#xD;
      Frankl scale and HBCD scale criteria. Statistical analysis will be performed using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Science, version 23.0 and will include descriptive, bivariate&#xD;
      and multivariate analyzes.&#xD;

      Project presentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the influence of oral hygiene of newborns before dental eruption on colonization&#xD;
      by Candida spp. and about the baby's behavior during oral hygiene performed by parents after&#xD;
      tooth eruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the influence of oral hygiene of newborns before tooth eruption on Candida spp&#xD;
      colonization and occurrence of candidiasis during the follow-up period. To evaluate the&#xD;
      influence of oral hygiene of newborns before tooth eruption on the its behavior during oral&#xD;
      hygiene performed by parents after tooth eruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized blinded clinical trial in edentulous newborns who will be screened&#xD;
      in their first two days of life at the Maternity Hospital of Our Lady of Health in&#xD;
      Diamantina, Minas Gerais. If mothers agree to participate with their child in the study,&#xD;
      contact and address will be requested for further data collection that will be performed at&#xD;
      the participants' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. Mothers will be instructed to sanitize the newborn's oral cavity prior to tooth&#xD;
           eruption by massaging the gingival rods with gauze and filtered water once a day at&#xD;
           night. Following the eruption of the child's first tooth, mothers will be instructed to&#xD;
           brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste (1100 ppm fluoride) in a minimum amount,&#xD;
           equivalent to one grain of raw rice, using the Fones technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. Mothers will be advised not to perform any type of oral cavity cleaning of the&#xD;
           newborn before tooth eruption. Following the eruption of the child's first tooth,&#xD;
           mothers will be instructed to brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste (1100 ppm&#xD;
           fluoride) in a minimum amount, equivalent to one grain of raw rice, using the Fones&#xD;
           technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the sample size was obtained from Lee, Laboratory of Epidemiology and&#xD;
      Statistics, using the calculation of estimation of two proportions and adopting the&#xD;
      parameters proportion of cases (positive behavior during hygiene according to the Frankl&#xD;
      Scale) among the exposed (children receiving oral hygiene before tooth eruption): 65%&#xD;
      (unpublished data from a previous study by the research group); Confidence level (1 -) = 95%;&#xD;
      (= 0.05 or 5%); Test power (1-) = 80%; Relative risk: 1.5; Newborns by group: 42; 9 newborns&#xD;
      (20%) will be added to each group to compensate for possible losses. Thus, the sample&#xD;
      required for the development of the study will be 51 newborns and their mothers in each of&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work team will be composed by the Researcher 1, Examiner 1 and Assistants. Prior to the&#xD;
      start of the study, these researchers will undergo a training and calibration process&#xD;
      according to the role of each team. A pilot study will be performed on 10% of the sample, and&#xD;
      if no methodological changes are required, these children will be included in the main study.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by allocating participants in both intervention groups&#xD;
      through a computer-generated random number. Examiner 1 will be blind to the group in which&#xD;
      the examined children were allocated and the mothers will be advised not to disclose the&#xD;
      group in which they were allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Follow-up Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social, Environmental, Behavioral and Health Data Form general of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration form for colonization evaluation of Candida spp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the identification and quantification of Candida spp. using CHROMagar Candida culture&#xD;
      medium. This evaluation will be performed in the first month and at 4 months after the birth&#xD;
      of the child. Form for registration of the child's oral clinical examination to record the&#xD;
      presence and / or absence of Oral Candidiasis, and if present, its location. After the&#xD;
      eruption of the first tooth the examiner will classify the child's behavior according to the&#xD;
      Frankl Scale and HBCD Scale using the child's behavior record form that will be used for the&#xD;
      period. follow-up at 1 month, 4 months, 7 months, 10 months and 13 months. The child's diet&#xD;
      will be assessed through eating habits at all follow-up times through 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      reminders using the multi-pass method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks inherent to the study are related to the awkwardness of the guardian during the&#xD;
      clinical evaluations and / or examinations in the babies, as well as the possible discomfort&#xD;
      of the child during the oral clinical examination. However, examiners will be prepared to&#xD;
      identify any possible discomfort and minimize or disrupt the assessment if necessary. The&#xD;
      application of questionnaires to those responsible will be performed in the presence of the&#xD;
      same, in order to reduce their embarrassment. The information collected will be accessible&#xD;
      only by members of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits to patients will be oral health guidelines, follow-up of children by the&#xD;
      examiner and, if necessary, referral for dental treatment. For health professionals, the&#xD;
      research will provide scientific evidence and support for guidance to the population that&#xD;
      will benefit from such recommendations with better care for children's oral health and&#xD;
      consequent improved oral health-related quality of life.&#xD;
