  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in our region and is the 9th most common cancer in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Traditionally diagnosis has been through a nasoendoscopic examination of the&#xD;
      nasopharynx with white light followed by a biopsy of suspicious lesions for a confirmatory&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, given the geometry of the anatomy of the nasopharynx, with its inherent&#xD;
      crevices and varying amounts of lymphoid tissues, lesions are not always easily identified&#xD;
      leading to potential missed lesions. The non-specific aspect of white light also leads to&#xD;
      excessive biopsies that are not without risk and of some discomfort to patients. Recent&#xD;
      advances in liquid biopsies have also allowed for the detection of earlier and smaller&#xD;
      lesions that are not always easily identified on nasoendoscopy but rather are seen on&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative imaging technique is the use of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) to view the&#xD;
      vasculature of the mucosa to identify suspicious lesions for pre-malignancy and malignancy&#xD;
      that has been popularized in the gastrointestinal tract. In NPC, NBI with the flexible&#xD;
      nasoendoscopes has been used in the diagnosis of NPC with varying success2-5 . Our own&#xD;
      group's research has found that in NPC NBI has limitations arising from a lack of consensus&#xD;
      on vascular findings on NBI that constitute malignancy, lack of magnification and long focal&#xD;
      length of current nasoendoscopes5-8 . Flexible endoscopy using conventional&#xD;
      esophago-gastroscopy endoscope (OGD) with NBI and magnification power up to 80x overcome the&#xD;
      limitations of current nasoendoscopes, however their size precludes the passing of these&#xD;
      endoscopes through the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here in this pilot study we will seek to use an OGD with NBI passed transorally and&#xD;
      retroflexed into the nasopharynx to view the nasopharynx with increased magnification and&#xD;
      clarity to evaluate the feasibility of this study in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it feasible to use an OGD with magnifying NBI for the diagnosis of NPC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there features detected on NBI OGD that are diagnostic of NPC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do histological features correspond with NBI findings?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-control pilot study. We will recruit 40 patients. 20 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed primary NPC will be recruited to the test group. 20 patients undergoing an OGD for&#xD;
      lesions not involving disease of the head and neck region will be recruited to the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NBI OGD and flexible nasoendoscopy will be performed to examine patients' nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NBI OGD: Endoscopic procedures would be performed by our investigators with expertise on&#xD;
      performing upper endoscopy. Endoscopes with magnification and NBI function would be used&#xD;
      (GF-H290Z, Olympus Medical Corporations, Tokyo, Japan). A soft black hood would be attached&#xD;
      to the tip of the endoscope for better focal length adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon insertion through a mouthpiece, the scope will then be retroflexed into the nasopharynx&#xD;
      and the lateral walls into the Fossa of Rosenmuller and the posterior nasopharyngeal wall&#xD;
      will be systematically examined with white light and NBI. Target suspicious areas would be&#xD;
      examined by use of magnification with the power up to 80X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible nasoendoscopy: The nasoendoscope is introduced into the nose, the nasal cavity and&#xD;
      nasopharyngnx. It has a camera and a light at the end and allows our doctor to check for any&#xD;
      abnormal looking areas. Upon identification of suspicious lesion. Biopsies of sites with&#xD;
      different NBI findings will be taken to correlate the NBI findings with histological&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
