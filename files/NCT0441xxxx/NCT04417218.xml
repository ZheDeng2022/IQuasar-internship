      This study aims to assess the effect of controlled dietary lysine intake on plasma and urine&#xD;
      α-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is an important health concern worldwide. It is associated with significantly&#xD;
      increased mortality as well as high incidence of co-morbidities. Unfortunately, treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and successful disease management is highly variable among treated patients, and&#xD;
      this is partly due to the fact that diabetes has multiple underlying causes most of which are&#xD;
      still unknown. A newly identified biomarker, α-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA), has the potential to&#xD;
      successfully predict the development of diabetes in humans, even before the development of&#xD;
      other known risk markers. However, little is known about the function of 2-AAA; it is unclear&#xD;
      whether 2-AAA itself causes the development of diabetes or if it is a biomarker for altered&#xD;
      metabolic processes that then lead to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the first phase of the study was to measure plasma 2-AAA levels from healthy&#xD;
      individuals from the general population to identify subjects with high or low 2-AAA. Now in&#xD;
      the second phase of the study, 80 subjects with high or low 2-AAA will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a dietary lysine modification study to access the effect of controlled lysine&#xD;
      intake on plasma and urine 2AAA. Participants will be asked to complete two one-week dietary&#xD;
      interventions. Subjects will be screened and consented via email, online, or phone. Each&#xD;
      subject will be required to come to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for four study&#xD;
      visits, at which the study team will obtain a blood sample, a urine sample, stool sample,&#xD;
      vital signs, waist and hip circumference, and 1-3 surveys will be completed if the subject&#xD;
      did not complete them prior to the visit. Each subject that completes the entire study visit&#xD;
      will be compensated $250. DNA samples will be obtained to allow for identification of genetic&#xD;
      predictors of 2-AAA levels. Some individuals may be asked to return for a future follow-up&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior participant in 2-AAA screening study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified as eligible due to high or low plasma 2-AAA, in the absence of&#xD;
