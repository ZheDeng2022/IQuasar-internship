  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain management following total shoulder arthroplasty is an important factor in determining&#xD;
      patient outcomes and satisfaction. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade has been used&#xD;
      successfully to minimize pain in the acute post-operative period. While shown to be&#xD;
      effective, interscalene blockade has known complications. In addition, interscalene block has&#xD;
      been shown to be significantly more expensive when compared to local anesthesia infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine have long been used to assist in post-operative&#xD;
      anesthesia. Recent reports have demonstrated local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine to&#xD;
      be similar to interscalene block in regards to patient analgesia even in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      post operatively, with the added benefit of lower complications and costs. While most reports&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of local infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine in the shoulder, other&#xD;
      total joint literature has been positive regarding the use of local infiltration analgesic&#xD;
      mixture for improved post-operative analgesia using a multi-modal approach to infiltrative&#xD;
      analgesia. Despite these reports, the role and efficacy of local infiltration analgesia in&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty is lacking. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of local infiltration analgesia in shoulder arthroplasty in comparison to&#xD;
      interscalene block through a randomized prospective clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      local infiltration analgesia will lead to postoperative pain scores, opiate consumption, and&#xD;
      complication rate that are not significantly different from interscalene block.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. STUDY PROCEDURE • Timeline: 2 weeks of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study subjects: Study candidates will be identified as they present to the clinic at&#xD;
           the Missouri Orthopaedic Institute at the University of Missouri, and will be evaluated&#xD;
           by the principle investigator. Informed consent will be obtained as per IRB protocol.&#xD;
           Enrollees will receive a copy of the study protocol, consent, and HIPAA form. Background&#xD;
           patient information will be collected including age, sex, BMI and co-morbidities.&#xD;
           American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification will be assigned by the&#xD;
           involved anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interscalene regional block is routinely administered at our institution prior to total&#xD;
           shoulder arthroplasty. Patients will be randomized prior to their scheduled surgery date&#xD;
           by our research team using a randomization protocol developed by our department&#xD;
           biostatistics team. The surgeon and surgical assistants will be blinded about the group&#xD;
           assignment until the morning of the surgery day. The group assignment will be sealed in&#xD;
           an envelope and delivered to the surgeon. If randomized to the interscalene block group,&#xD;
           the anesthesia team will administer the block preoperatively in routine fashion. The&#xD;
           standard anesthesia protocol for total shoulder arthroplasty patients is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Preoperative: Acetaminophen 1000mg PO Gabapentin 300mg PO Interscalene block: 3-5mL of&#xD;
           0.5% bupivacaine plus 10mL Exparel (1-2 mg of midazolam and/or 50-100 mcg of fentanyl IV&#xD;
           for sedation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           If randomized to local infiltration analgesia, the patient will receive local&#xD;
           infiltration injection intraoperatively prior to closing during the procedure. A&#xD;
           standardized dose of 100 mL of infiltration will be utilized according to the following&#xD;
           formula. The mixture will be injected into the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles and&#xD;
           fasciae, and subcutaneous tissues using an 18-guage needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total dose 100mL Ropivacaine 0.5% 40mL Epinephrine 1mg/mL 0.1mL Ketorolac 30mg/mL 1mL&#xD;
           Morphine 10mg/mL 0.5mL Normal saline 0.9% 58.4mL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anesthesia protocol All surgery will be performed with standard general anesthesia.&#xD;
                Induction will be achieved and general anesthesia maintained based on the following&#xD;
                protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           (Doses vary based on patient specifics such as age, weight and comorbid disease):&#xD;
           Lidocaine 50 - 100mg Fentanyl 50 - 100mcg Propofol 100 - 200 mg Rocuronium 50 - 100mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sevoflurane 1 - 2% or desflurane 4 - 6% Fentanyl, hydromorphone, ketorolac and / or&#xD;
           ketamine IV as needed on suspicion of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           antibiotics were given intravenously 2g of cefazolin or 900mg of clindamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical procedure All surgery will be performed in beach chair position by a&#xD;
                single shoulder and elbow fellowship trained surgeon. A standard deltopectoral&#xD;
                approach will be used. A subscapularis peel-off will be used for all anatomic total&#xD;
                shoulder arthroplasty cases and repaired back to the lesser tuberosity with&#xD;
                transosseous sutures. For reverse shoulder arthroplasty cases, the subscapularis&#xD;
                will be repaired if there is a reparable subscapularis tendon. Following the&#xD;
                surgery, the shoulder will be immobilized in an abduction pillow-sling. A mixture&#xD;
                of 1g of tranexamic acid and 30mL of normal saline will be poured into the wound&#xD;
                for postoperative bleeding control purposes. Patients will follow the routine&#xD;
                postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Patients will return to the shoulder and&#xD;
                elbow clinic for routine clinical follow-up visits and x-ray exams following their&#xD;
                surgery at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, which is the standard of care.&#xD;
                The study data collection will be completed at 2 week time point when the patient&#xD;
                comes back for their first postoperative appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data collection: Following surgery, the patient's pain level will be recorded in a&#xD;
                visual analog scale (VAS) at 4, 8, 12, 24 hours, once a day for the following 6&#xD;
                days, and at 14 days following surgery. Patient's daily opiate consumption during&#xD;
                the first 7 days and the total cumulative amount of consumption up to 14 days&#xD;
                following surgery will also be recorded, quantified and converted to morphine&#xD;
                equivalents units (MEU) for standardization. Time to discharge from PACU as well as&#xD;
                adverse opioid reactions will be reported (nausea, hypoxia/O2 requirement). The&#xD;
                inpatient portion of the pain VAS and opiate consumption data will be obtained from&#xD;
                the medical record while the post-discharge part of the data will be collected via&#xD;
                a physical log given to patients upon discharge as well as an automated&#xD;
                patient-reported outcome data collection system (PatientIQ®, Chicago, IL, USA). The&#xD;
                research team will contact patients every other day following discharge to ensure&#xD;
                proper documentation of pain VAS and opiate consumption by patients. Additionally,&#xD;
                data regarding the time in the operating room, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
                intraoperative complications (fracture, vascular injury, and anesthesia-related),&#xD;
                acute postoperative complications (medical, nerve injury, dislocation, hematoma,&#xD;
                and wound complications) will be collected. The average costs of LIA and&#xD;
                interscalene regional block will be obtained through our billing department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis The pain score and opiate consumption data at each time point will be&#xD;
           compared between the two groups using either unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
           depending on the data normality. The chronological changes in the pain score and opiate&#xD;
           consumption in each patient will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman&#xD;
           test depending on the data normality. Categorical variables will be compared using&#xD;
           chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test. The data will be analyzed by our biostatistics&#xD;
           team within Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. The primary outcome of the study is the&#xD;
           average pain VAS scores during the first 12 hours following surgery. The secondary&#xD;
           outcome is the opioid consumption during the first 2 days following surgery.&#xD;
           Non-inferiority of the local infiltration group compared to the interscalene block group&#xD;
           in these two outcomes will be tested using a non-inferiority test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Sample size calculation and power: The primary outcome of the study is the average&#xD;
           pain VAS scores during the first 12 hours following surgery. Based on the recent&#xD;
           research finding that a 1.4-point difference in pain VAS scores is a minimally&#xD;
           clinically important difference (MCID) following shoulder arthroplasty, a priori sample&#xD;
           size calculation was performed with a power of 0.8 and a standard deviation of 2.4 at an&#xD;
           alpha of 0.05 to examine the study hypothesis that the average pain VAS score during the&#xD;
           first 12 hours in the local infiltration analgesia group would not be significantly&#xD;
           different than that of the interscalene block group (or the difference between the two&#xD;
           groups would be less than 1.5 points). The result showed a minimum of 37 patients would&#xD;
           be needed in each group (total number of patients =74).&#xD;
