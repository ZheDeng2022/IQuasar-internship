  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of cannabinoid (CBD) patch on reducing&#xD;
      pain and improving functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the use of CBD patch will provide superior pain relief to&#xD;
      placebo patch. This will be a randomized, double-blind 2-arm parallel group study in 74 male&#xD;
      and female subjects with pain from knee osteoarthritis. Site staff will document the&#xD;
      patient's prior treatment for knee osteoarthritis and once the diagnosis has been made, they&#xD;
      will be offered to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients will either be prescribed CBD patch to be used topically for&#xD;
      diagnosed knee osteoarthritis versus placebo patch. It will be performed at one site, the&#xD;
      physician's office. The study coordinator will be in charge of keeping track of the different&#xD;
      patches and all other study personnel and patients will be blinded to the treatment arm. The&#xD;
      statistician will conduct the randomization. He will be unblinded and assign participant&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be diagnosed in an office setting for knee osteoarthritis based on radiographs&#xD;
      using the Kellgren Lawrence classification. It is the standard of care to obtain orthogonal&#xD;
      knee radiographs when evaluating a patient for knee pain. This will be considered when&#xD;
      assessing if the patient is eligible to participate given their pathology. This can be a new&#xD;
      diagnosis or an already established diagnosis. The previous treatments that they have&#xD;
      received will be noted in the patient charts while screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking opioids only recently (less than 3 months) will be required to halt treatment&#xD;
      at the time of study enrollment. Opioids don't have anti inflammatory properties so a washout&#xD;
      period is not necessary. General patient demographics will be collected using the electronic&#xD;
      medical record including: Age, Sex, BMI, Radiographic Osteoarthritis scale (Kellgren&#xD;
      Lawrence), which will be put into database by the study investigators and co investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained by study personnel in the clinical office setting after meeting all&#xD;
      study criteria and diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis based on exam and knee xrays. All&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, and who are enrolled in the study, will be&#xD;
      prescribed physical therapy that focuses on non-operative treatment such as low impact&#xD;
      exercises and activity modification. The patients will not medicate with anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      while enrolled in the study. Administration will follow a model of topical patch application&#xD;
      which will consist of either the formulated CBD patch (35mg) or identical placebo patch. This&#xD;
      patch will be applied to the arthritic knee directly central on the knee. In the event of&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of bilateral knee OA, the patch will be placed on the knee that has&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) &gt;3 but &lt;9. This patch will be placed daily for 24 hours and&#xD;
      replaced each day. Including the initial enrollment visit, the patient will meet with the&#xD;
      diagnosing orthopedic surgeon at various time points, and will also have remote check ins by&#xD;
      study personnel to assess for adverse events and any issues they are having at 2, 4, and 8&#xD;
      weeks. The patient will have the patch for the first 4 weeks of the study followed by 4 weeks&#xD;
      without patch which will conclude their participation at 8 weeks. The patients will all begin&#xD;
      physical therapy as part of their routine clinical care within 1 week of beginning the study.&#xD;
      During this time the patient will be distributed various surveys to measure patient outcomes.&#xD;
      The investigators will be looking at pain as a primary endpoint using visual analogue scale&#xD;
      with a 2 point difference deemed the minimal clinically important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are randomized to either group who have uncontrolled pain will be instructed to&#xD;
      take a rescue medication, acetaminophen over the counter use Q 6 hours as needed will be&#xD;
      allowed and recorded in a daily drug use diary which will be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have contact information of the surgeon and residents to contact if any&#xD;
      side effects are encountered. Compliance with patch use/application, side effects and&#xD;
      adherence to physical therapy will also be recorded. Software with be used for both data&#xD;
      collection and survey administration for confidential participation, which is a user-friendly&#xD;
      HIPAA compliant service utilized by our health system. If the patient is unable to respond to&#xD;
      the surveys via their phone app then hard copies of the survey will be given to them and&#xD;
      collected by the investigator.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of 35mg CBD Patch vs Placebo Patch on treatment of pain for patients with knee osteoarthritis assessed by a visual analogue scale using 0 as no pain and 10 as the worst pain. This will be collect at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, where pain control method (CBD vs Placebo) is the between subjects' effect and week of treatment is the within subjects effect will be used to examine the association between pain control method and that outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 (SF-12) will be used to asses physical functioning, physical health problems, limitations, emotional problems and global mental health. Two summary scores, a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12), are reported as difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations. Each increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average. Increasing scores correspond to positive physical (maximum 56.6)/mental health (maximum 60.8), decreasing scores correspond to negative physical (minimum 24.0)/mental (minimum 19.1) health.</description>

Measures seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme.</description>
