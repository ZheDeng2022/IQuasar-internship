      There is a need to manage dizziness in vestibular dysfunction patients with the vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation to improve the life style of these patients. Vestibular rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises are beneficial for the vestibular dysfunction patients because they decrease&#xD;
      dizziness and visual symptoms, increase walking and balance functions and with this the&#xD;
      general activity level also increases. In my study my goal is to apply two different&#xD;
      vestibular exercise and check their effects on dizziness in hearing impaired children's.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dizziness is not a disease it is one of the most common symptoms of vestibular dysfunction.&#xD;
      There are mainly two types of vestibular dysfunction central and peripheral vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction. Signs of vestibular dysfunction are vertigo, nystagmus, visual instability on&#xD;
      head movement, spinning, double vision, May or may not have hearing loss or tinnitus. Due to&#xD;
      these problem the patient feel difficulty in movements and in other activities, asymmetrical&#xD;
      posture in sitting or standing. patients who experience dizziness report a significant&#xD;
      disability that reduces their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular system is consist of two parts central vestibular system and peripheral vestibular&#xD;
      system. Peripheral part is consist of three semi-circular canals and otolith organs. The&#xD;
      three semi-circular canals horizontal, posterior and anterior respond to angular acceleration&#xD;
      and are right angle to one another. Semi-circular canals are filled with endolymph. Which&#xD;
      move freely within each canal in response to the direction of the angular head rotation. The&#xD;
      saccule and utricle make up the otolith organ which respond to the linear acceleration and&#xD;
      the static head tilt. Three main functions of the peripheral vestibular system is stabilize&#xD;
      visual images during head movement, maintain postural stability during head movement and&#xD;
      providing information about the environment. In the central vestibular system brainstem&#xD;
      processes provide primary control of many vestibular reflex. Connection with the thalamus,&#xD;
      vestibular cortex and reticular system enable the vestibular system to aware of arousal and&#xD;
      conscious awareness of the body and discrimination between the self and environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, vestibular function plays an important role in postural and gross motor&#xD;
      development control. Children with congenitally profound hearing loss suffer vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction in both ears, and loss of postural control. Maintaining and development of&#xD;
      postural stability is a multisystem process it does not only depend on vestibular input.&#xD;
      Maturational changes in proprioceptive and visual, central nervous system processing, and&#xD;
      coordination of motor output are responsible for the changes in postural skills observed&#xD;
      through adolescence. Infants and young children are dependent on the visual system to&#xD;
      maintain balance. As they grow older, begin to use somatosensory and vestibular information&#xD;
      properly. Between the 3 sensory inputs in children, the vestibular system seems to be the&#xD;
      slightest effective in postural control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with early sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral vestibular dysfunction present&#xD;
      with delayed gross motor development. These children stand and walk later than their peers.&#xD;
      Difficulties in maintaining balance can lead to challenges in normal childhood activities&#xD;
      e.g. riding a bicycle or hopping. Reduced ability to participate in normal play with other&#xD;
      children may result in social isolation. In hearing impaired children vestibular dysfunction&#xD;
      is common. It was mentioned in a study held in 2013 that 88% of hearing impaired children&#xD;
      suffer from vestibular dysfunction. This could mainly be due to hearing and vestibular&#xD;
      impulses pass via the vestibule-cochlear nerve. Another study in 2018, found that vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction to be around 50% in hearing impaired children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaze stability and Brandt-Daroff exercises are two different type of exercises which are used&#xD;
      for rehabilitation of dizziness in hearing impaired patients. A type of habituation exercise&#xD;
      is Brandt- Daroff exercises which are easy to perform. Brandt- Daroff exercises cause the&#xD;
      debris to get dislodged from the cupula of the posterior semi-circular canal and will no&#xD;
      longer effect cupula during the head movements. Bandt-Daroff exercises are performed with&#xD;
      quick head rotations while watching a visual target and sustaining focus on the visual target&#xD;
      during head movements. Gaze stability exercises designed to improve the gaze stability. These&#xD;
      exercises require the individual to fixate on a visual target during horizontal or vertical&#xD;
      head movement.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dix Hall Pike Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dizziness and balance to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Dix hall pike test is a diagnostic procedure. When performing the test, patients are lowered quickly to supine position with 30 degrees neck extension below horizontal by the clinician. Positive test is reported when the patients report of a production of vertigo and observation of nystagmus.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fukuda Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dizziness to 2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>A vestibulospinal test, fukuda test is used to measure asymmetrical labyrinthine function. One's ability to step in place with eyes closed without turning depends on normal vestibulospinal and proprioceptive function.</description>

    <measure>Motion Sensitivity Quotient</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dizziness to 2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Motion Sensitivity Quotient: is a clinical protocol designed to measure motion provoked dizziness during a series of quick changes to head or body position. Test is used as a guide for exercise developing for the patients problems with the motion provoked dizziness, also for the effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy</description>

    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dizziness to 2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Dizziness Handicap Inventory: is a self-assessment inventory designed to evaluate the effect of dizziness and unsteadiness. Graded on a scale of 0-100, higher score shows greater perception of handicap due to dizziness</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sharpened Romberg's Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline balance to 2 Week</time_frame>
    <description>: is an appropriate tool to diagnose gait disturbance caused by abnormal proprioception involving information about the joints. Patients is ask to stand quietly with eyes closed. Patients tries to maintain his balance. The score is counted by the time the patients is able to stand with the eyes closed. A positive sign is noted when a sway is noted with the closed eyes.</description>
