    <textblock>
      This study will be a single ascending dose (SAD) study conducted to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). After completion of the SAD portion of the study and acceptable safety&#xD;
      evaluation, a food-interaction, single-dose study under fed and fasted conditions will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
