  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility and its treatments can have a significant impact on women's psychological health.&#xD;
      Anxiety has a negative impact on quality of life during treatment and can lead to withdrawal&#xD;
      of care. the investigators would like to test the effectiveness of an application available&#xD;
      via the Internet that offers daily exercises such as mindfulness meditation. Women in the&#xD;
      &quot;treatment&quot; group will be instructed to practice meditation exercises using the 15-minute&#xD;
      daily application during in vitro fertilization treatment until pregnancy testing. Women in&#xD;
      the control group will have the standard care of the centre. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the intervention on anxiety, depression, quality of life and mindfulness&#xD;
      aspects. The investigators will also assess the impact on the chances of pregnancy and&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is an unexpected and stressful life with emotional, social and sexual&#xD;
      repercussions. Women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART) exhibit high anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression scores during the pre-treatment period, during the course of treatment and&#xD;
      during the 2 weeks waiting-time for the pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of psychological distress on ART outcomes is debated. Several studies report a&#xD;
      negative impact of stress on pregnancy rates after IVF whereas two meta-analyses report&#xD;
      inconclusive results regarding the association between emotional distress and pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes after ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success rates of ART, which are highly dependent on the woman's age, are low in women in&#xD;
      their late reproductive years with the need of several ART treatments to achieve pregnancy.&#xD;
      Moreover, ART is often the last resort treatment in couples that have undergone infertility&#xD;
      investigations and other first-line treatments such as surgery, ovulation induction and/or&#xD;
      stimulation with intra-uterine insemination. Couple need resilience in order to undergo&#xD;
      repeated treatments. Psychological distress therefore has an impact on cumulative pregnancy&#xD;
      rates over several ART treatments because of premature treatment discontinuation. Depressive&#xD;
      symptoms at baseline have been shown to predict treatment &quot;dropout&quot; after only one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that mind-body interventions, including mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions and yoga, may be effective in reducing mental health difficulties such as&#xD;
      anxiety and depression in infertile women undergoing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigators was to develop a psychological self-help tool using modern&#xD;
      technological means in line with the recent Femtech (female technology) developments. The&#xD;
      hypothesis was that an online meditation tool would be more accessible and easier to&#xD;
      integrate into a busy schedule than standard programs that require weekly attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, the investigators created collaboration between experts in reproductive medicine,&#xD;
      experts in mindfulness and a start-up that offers an online platform for meditation programs.&#xD;
      The investigators developed an online program of 15 meditations specifically dedicated to&#xD;
      infertile women. These meditations help women explore certain themes such as &quot;inner&#xD;
      resources&quot;, &quot;social interactions&quot;, &quot;letting go of beliefs&quot; etc. This program has been&#xD;
      available online since December 2017 and has been used by several thousand women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis behind the study is that &quot;mindfulness-based interventions&quot; can be delivered&#xD;
      successfully through modern technologies with a significant impact on psychological outcomes&#xD;
      and well-being. Femtech self-help online tools are used by thousands of women on a daily&#xD;
      basis but studies are lacking on their efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial on the effect of a mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention using the online meditation program versus standard care without intervention on&#xD;
      psychological outcomes in infertile women undergoing ART treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention group will receive an introduction to the concept and philosophy of&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation through an online video and an exercise book. They will receive an&#xD;
      access code to the application and will have access to short guided meditations both general&#xD;
      and specific to their infertility. They will be instructed to follow the &quot;découverte&quot;&#xD;
      (discovery) program of 8 meditations of 10 minutes and then the program &quot;désir de&#xD;
      parentalité&quot; (wish to become a parent) of 15 meditations of 13 minutes each. Patients will be&#xD;
      given access to all other meditations programs on the application and instructed to meditate&#xD;
      with the program for at least 10-15 minutes on a daily basis using the e-tool for 1 month.&#xD;
      The practice of meditation will be monitored by the number of connections to the applications&#xD;
      and the time spent on the exercises. Women in the control group will have the standard care&#xD;
      of the centre. The investigators will measure the effectiveness of the intervention on&#xD;
      anxiety (State trait anxiety index, STAI), depression (Beck depression inventory, BDI),&#xD;
      quality of life during ART treatments (Fertility quality of life tool, Fertiqol) and&#xD;
      mindfulness aspects (Five facet mindfulness questionnaire, FFMQ). The investigators will also&#xD;
      measure the impact of the intervention on biological stress measured by hair cortisol&#xD;
      concentration. Finally, the investigators will assess the impact on the chances of pregnancy&#xD;
      and on treatment discontinuation after 1 month.&#xD;

    <description>The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of an e-tool based intervention versus standard care without intervention on anxiety state measured by the French version of state trait anxiety index in infertile women undergoing ART.&#xD;
State trait anxiety index state scores will be evaluated by completion of a questionnaire at 3 time points: baseline, at the time of the oocyte retrieval, on the day before the pregnancy test (before the results).&#xD;
A score between 31 and 36 is considered as normal score.</description>
