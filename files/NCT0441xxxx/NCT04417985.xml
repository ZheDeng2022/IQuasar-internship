  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) differs from other head and neck malignancies terms of its&#xD;
      epidemiology, pathology, and treatment outcome. Although NPC is a radiosensitive tumor,&#xD;
      distant recurrence remains a clinical challenge. Therefore, the investigators conducted this&#xD;
      study to prospectively investigate the role of imaging and blood biomarkers in predicting the&#xD;
      prognosis of NPC patients.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) differs from other head and neck malignancies terms of&#xD;
           its epidemiology, pathology, and treatment outcome. NPC has a good local tumor control&#xD;
           rate but a higher incidence of distant metastasis compared with squamous cell carcinomas&#xD;
           of other regions of the head and neck. Thus, it's usually considered a distinct study&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A good prognostic model for the development of distant failure for NPC patients is still&#xD;
           lacking. It is well known that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes are present in almost&#xD;
           every NPC tumor cell, irrespective of histologic differentiation and geographic&#xD;
           distribution. Various EBV-derived/related factors, therefore, have been used as NPC&#xD;
           tumor markers, including EBV-specific viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgA and cell-free EBV&#xD;
           DNA. The measurement of cell-free EBV DNA load has already been shown to be a good&#xD;
           pretreatment prognostic indicator. Another important feature of NPC is that the tumors&#xD;
           are characterized by heavy infiltration of nonmalignant lymphocytes and might play an&#xD;
           important role in tumorigenesis; and cytokines and chemokines may represent the key&#xD;
           mediators of this interaction. Compelling evidence has also emerged in recent years&#xD;
           suggesting that cytokines and chemokines play important roles in regulating processes&#xD;
           critical to tumor progression, such as proliferation and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beyond blood biomarkers, standard uptake value (SUV) from FDG PET could predict&#xD;
           treatment failure in NPC patients. On the other hand, apparent diffusion coefficient&#xD;
           (ADC) from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has been shown to be an important prognostic&#xD;
           marker in cancer patients, including head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate the roles of imaging and blood biomarkers in predicting distant failures,&#xD;
           recurrences, and survival in NPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a histological diagnosis of primary M0 NPC were deemed eligible. All study&#xD;
      participants received both 18F-FDG PET/CT and head-neck MRI imaging before treatment, during&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and 3 months after the definitive treatment. The blood sample was collected on&#xD;
      the same day of the PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT: Study participants were instructed to fast for six hours before the PET&#xD;
      study. FDG (370-444 MBq) was administered intravenously. No intravenous contrast material was&#xD;
      administered for CT scans. The participants underwent head to mid-thigh scans. PET and CT&#xD;
      images were acquired consecutively 50 to 70 minutes after the injection of 18F-FDG. Before&#xD;
      PET acquisition, a standard helical CT scan was acquired from the head to the proximal thighs&#xD;
      using the manufacturer's dose reduction software. The PET images were reconstructed using the&#xD;
      CT data for attenuation correction and an ordered subsets expectation maximization iterative&#xD;
      reconstruction algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI :&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI was performed at 3 Tesla (MAGNETOM® Trio with Tim; Siemens Medical Solutions, Bonn,&#xD;
      Germany). Dedicated MRI of the head and neck region was obtained in the axial projection with&#xD;
      T1-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence and subsequently with T2-weighted TSE sequences&#xD;
      with fat saturation. After intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine&#xD;
      (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) at 3 mL/sec with a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, MRI of the&#xD;
      head and neck region was performed using a fat-saturated T1-weighted TSE sequence in the&#xD;
      axial and coronal planes. DWI was acquired using single shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging&#xD;
      with a modified Stejskal-Tanner diffusion gradient pulsing scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and storage of blood plasma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten-milliliter samples of peripheral blood were drawn from subjects using standardized&#xD;
      phlebotomy procedures and collected into an EDTA tube for isolation of plasma. Blood samples&#xD;
      were centrifuged at 2000×g. Plasma was immediately aliquoted, transferred into plain&#xD;
      polypropylene tubes, and was stored in a dedicated freezer at -80°C. No more than one&#xD;
      freeze-thaw cycle was allowed for each plasma sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) served as main outcome measures. RFS&#xD;
      was defined as the time between the end of treatment and the date of recurrence (tumor&#xD;
      relapse or death) or censored at the date of the last follow-up. Distant failure-free&#xD;
      survival was also calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of documented distant&#xD;
      recurrences, or censored at the last follow-up date. OS was calculated from the date of&#xD;
      diagnosis to the date of death or censor at the date of the last follow-up for surviving&#xD;
      study participants. The cutoff values for the clinical variables, blood biomarkers, and&#xD;
      imaging parameters in survival analysis were determined using the log-rank test based on the&#xD;
      RFS and OS rates observed in the entire study cohort. Survival curves were plotted using the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of each individual variable was initially evaluated using&#xD;
      univariate analysis. Cox regression models were used to identify the predictors of survival.&#xD;
      Two-tailed P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
