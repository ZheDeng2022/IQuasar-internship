  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to general medical guidelines, adjuvant chemotherapy is used after curative&#xD;
      resection of high-risk stage II or III primary colon cancer. However, there exist limitations&#xD;
      using clinical trial data acquired from highly selected subjects in a controlled environment.&#xD;
      For example, patients aged over 70 years old were in many cases excluded from clinical trials&#xD;
      resulting in insufficient data on the efficacy of therapies including oxaliplatin in aged&#xD;
      patients, and the source data of the medical guidelines did not fully reflect the conditions&#xD;
      of Korean patients. In addition, suggestions are continuously being submitted for existing&#xD;
      therapies with modified administration periods and methods with the aim to search for the&#xD;
      optimum effect over side effects. Discussions are also held on meta analyses results that&#xD;
      imply the need to apply slightly different approaches through small groups of patient and&#xD;
      disease factors. As there are more diverse adjuvant therapy protocols that can be applied to&#xD;
      post-surgery colon cancer patients, it is necessary to figure out the patterns of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapies actually used in Korean medical practices. Also, in order to complement the&#xD;
      limitation of external validity of the existing base clinical data, a multifaceted&#xD;
      exploratory analysis will be conducted by making follow-up observations on patterns,&#xD;
      prognosis results, quality of life, adverse effects, etc. of post-surgery adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapies actually used in around 30 sites in Korea under the noninterventional&#xD;
      observational study conditions.&#xD;

      [Overview] Investigators will obtain voluntary consent for participation in this study from&#xD;
      patients with high-risk stage II or stage III colon cancer who require or are planning to&#xD;
      receive adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. Patients who provided written consent&#xD;
      for using their personal information and who satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      given a study enrollment number. Among the predefined study-relevant data, available data on&#xD;
      these patients will be collected in the case report forms (CRF) until the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Follow-up observation schedule and the scope of data collection] Since this study is an&#xD;
      observational study, data collection in the CRF will be restricted to the data created only&#xD;
      from usual treatment practices and there will be no separate test or additional drug&#xD;
      administration for the study. However, subjects will be asked to complete questionnaire to&#xD;
      evaluate their quality of life at the following time points: baseline, Month 3 (13 weeks ± 2&#xD;
      weeks), Month 6 (26 weeks ± 2 weeks), Month 12 (52 weeks ± 4 weeks), Month 24 (104 weeks ± 8&#xD;
      weeks), Month 36 (156 weeks ± 8 weeks). For subjects who drop out from the study or in case&#xD;
      of disease event (relapse, metastasis or new primary malignant tumor), the questionnaire will&#xD;
      be conducted at the time of drop-out or disease event. Survival of all subjects (including&#xD;
      those who drop out from the study or whose disease event is confirmed) will be checked every&#xD;
      6 months after adjuvant chemotherapy started. Among the data created from the subjects on&#xD;
      their visits for treatment, the following data will be collected for the purpose of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colon cancer information (diagnosis information, risk factors, surgery information).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether or not neoadjuvant chemotherapy was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other concomitant medication (drugs administered for prevention and treatment of OXLIPN,&#xD;
           drugs administered for treatment of Grade 3-4 adverse drug reactions/serious adverse&#xD;
           drug reactions related to the chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs, height, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance Status evaluation (ECOG PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatric Assessment (KG-7): for subjects ≥ 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life assessment (FACT-C, FACT/GOG-NTX-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor Marker (CEA, CA 19-9) test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular genetic test results (MSI [microsatellite instability] and/or MMR [DNA&#xD;
           mismatch repair gene], immunohistochemistry test for protein, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonoscopy/CT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease event (relapse, metastasis or new primary malignant tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (OXLIPN): Only when oxaliplatin is&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3-4 adverse drug reactions related to chemotherapy (based on CTCAE v.5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
