      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of SAR442720 in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors including NSCLC who progressed on&#xD;
           anti-PD-1/PD L1 containing therapy and advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) after&#xD;
           progression to all standard of care (SOC) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the MTD and RP2D for the combination of SAR442720 and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           patients with solid tumors&#xD;

      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the pharmacokinetic (PK) of SAR442720 in combination with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           to document the PK of pembrolizumab in combination with SAR442720&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label Phase 1 multicenter study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR442720 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with solid tumors in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, in the expansion cohort (Cohort A) we will assess the antitumor activity and&#xD;
      safety of SAR442720 combined with pembrolizumab in participants with metastatic 1L lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression&#xD;
      date; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated to be about 10 months in&#xD;
      Part 1 (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 6 months for treatment, and a median of 3&#xD;
      months for long term follow-up) and in Part 2 16 months (up to 1 month for screening, a&#xD;
      median of 12 months for treatment and a median of 3 months for long term follow up.)&#xD;

    <description>Part 1:&#xD;
SAR442720 (also known as RMC-4630) will be administered orally with pembrolizumab which is given by IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W). The dose of SAR442720 will be escalated or de-escalated depending on the emerging safety data of the combination.&#xD;
Part 2:&#xD;
SAR442720 (also known as RMC-4630) will be administered orally with pembrolizumab which is given by IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W) or once every 6 weeks (Q6W). Part 2 will assess the antitumor efficacy and safety of adding SAR442720 to pembrolizumab as 1L NSCLC therapy.</description>
