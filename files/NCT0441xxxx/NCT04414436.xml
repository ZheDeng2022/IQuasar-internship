  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecological cancers are the sixth most common cancer forms and the number of survivors is&#xD;
      increasing as a consequence of more efficient treatment and longer life span. As part of&#xD;
      regulary care after cancer treatment the women have five years of follow-up with the primary&#xD;
      focus on recurrence, aiming to increase survival. However, several studies have shown that&#xD;
      there is no evidence for this assumption on increased survival (ref). There are now suggested&#xD;
      alternative perspectives in the follow up period targeting late effects, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction with care.The main aim of the current study is&#xD;
      to test the feasibility and acceptability of an internet-based psychosocial intervention for&#xD;
      women treated with curative intent gynecological cancer. Another aim is to test the perceived&#xD;
      effect on gynecological cancer survivors health-related self-care and QoL.&#xD;

      The study's objectives and research questions Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How did the participants use the program?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What are the barriers and facilitators concerning technologies of the&#xD;
                internet-based self -management intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Number of logins&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. How much time did the participants spend on the program (per login )&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Number of modules completed, number of home-work and mindfulness assignment&#xD;
                completed&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Type of errors made â€¦&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the participants' perceived credibility of the program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do the participants experience the guided psychosocial digital intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. How do participants experience the cancer trajectory, their every-day lives and&#xD;
                health-related QoL post-treatment gynaecological cancer (before the intervention)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. How do the participants experience the internet-based intervention regarding&#xD;
                content, the home-work assignments, and the mindfulness assignments, the active&#xD;
                participation?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. How do the participants experience the telephone-contact and follow-ups with the&#xD;
                nurse once a week?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Which factors do they describe as important for their satisfaction and&#xD;
                dissatisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How is the perceived effect on the gynecological cancer survivors' competence, QoL,&#xD;
           self-care and coping?&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that an internet-based psycho-social intervention will support women in&#xD;
      developing self-competence and self-care which could be measured as increased QOL and&#xD;
      secondarily affect the impact of cancer, distress, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and&#xD;
      self-reported ability to monitor and respond to symptoms of recurrence.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Impact of Cancer version 2</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to assess the physical and psychosocial health experience of cancer survivors through its positive and negative impacts. 47-item questionnaire organized into 4 positive (altruism and empathy (AE), health awareness (HA), meaning of cancer (MOC), positive self-evaluation (PSE)) and 4 negative (appearance concerns (AC), body change concerns (BCC), life interference (LI) and worry (W)) impact dimensions [13] corresponding to the first 37 items. The questionnaire also includes 10 additional items constituting conditional dimensions applicable to subsets of survivors assessing employment concerns (EC), relationship concerns for individuals with a partner (P), and relationship concerns for those without a partner (NP). All items are scored on a five-point scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. A higher score on a dimension implies stronger endorsement of that content area</description>
