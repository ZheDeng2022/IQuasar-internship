    <description>Quality of life score assessed by Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 proposed by The European O-rganization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer. EORTC QLQ-C30 contained 30 items. Items 29 and 30 are rated on a scale of 1 to 7. The other items are divided into four grades: totally not, a little bit, a lot and very much, and scored on a scale of 1 to 4. For functional and overall health domain, a higher score refers to a better life quality; for symptom domain, a higher score refers to a worse life quality.</description>

Each item is scored on a scale 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 100 indicates the worst possible symptoms.</description>
