  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a long-standing assumption that physical activity is an effective,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approach to improving sleep quality and quantity. However, objective and&#xD;
      reliable data on this relationship are scarce for children with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent burnout in this population is high and there are many barriers to engagement with such&#xD;
      interventions. This study aims to understand the feasibility of providing an exercise&#xD;
      intervention for this population, and gathering parental views on the impact of such an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the outcome of this feasibilty study, larger scale interventions may be planned&#xD;
      to further examine the impact of such an intervention.&#xD;

      Exercise in this population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of exercise on sleep in children with developmental disabilities is so far&#xD;
      tentative. Small-scale studies suggest increasing physical activity in children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders leads to increased sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations from previous research have included that future studies should assess the&#xD;
      benefit of a longer intervention period, and impact on the wider family. Our study design&#xD;
      aims to address these two factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study using a one sample pre-post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed of the study during the standard clinic assessment run by the&#xD;
      Community Paediatricians (Community Sleep Clinic Lambeth and Southwark). A &quot;consent to be&#xD;
      contacted&quot; letter will be used to facilitate agreement for the research team to contact&#xD;
      families to discuss the study in more detail. Families will then be contacted by a member of&#xD;
      the team not directly linked to their care. Information will be given over the phone and the&#xD;
      family invited to a study information session at which the study will be explained further,&#xD;
      questions answered, and consent taken for those who wish to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after completion of the intervention all participants will continue through the&#xD;
      usual treatment pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure one: participant flow diagram:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment - parent to complete 2 weeks of sleep diaries for child prior to&#xD;
      intervention; child height and weight measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - 1 session of swimming (1.5 hours) and 1 session of trampolining and dry sports&#xD;
      (1.5 hours) per week for 10 weeks, totalling 20 x 1.5 hours. The intervention will be&#xD;
      tailored to the level of ability for each participant (i.e. each exercise will have different&#xD;
      levels of complexity). Details of the specifics of the intervention that will be undertaken&#xD;
      by the participants is as above. The intervention will be provided by the 'London PE and&#xD;
      Schools Sport Network'. This company is a well-known sports company in South London that&#xD;
      specialise in providing sports coaching for children with additional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of intervention assessment - parent to complete 2 weeks of sleep diaries for child for&#xD;
      last 2 weeks of intervention, and to complete Likert-scale and free-text questionnaires as&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of end of trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will end 3 months after the last exercise session, when height and weight are&#xD;
      recorded as the final measure at a face-to-face clinic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number is limited to the number of children the instructor can teach during a course of&#xD;
      the intervention. The instructor has advised he can teach a maximum of 15 students. Data on&#xD;
      age, gender, ethnicity, weight and medical diagnosis will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability of the intervention with respect to accessibility, journey to venue,&#xD;
           appropriateness, likelihood to recommend to others&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Attrition rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep diaries will be completed by parents/carers specifically to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bedtime&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time fell asleep (to then work out sleep latency/time to fall asleep)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of night wakings&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Morning wake-up time&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimated total sleep time per night for 2-weeks pre-intervention, and during the&#xD;
                last 2 weeks of intervention for comparison&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parent reported effects on wellbeing of child and family scored on Likert Scale (see&#xD;
           Parent-reported outcome measures, Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of Body Mass Index pre-intervention and at 3-months post-intervention at&#xD;
           face-to-face clinic appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1: Recruitment Month 2-4: Intervention, 2 sessions weekly for 10 weeks Month 5-7: Data&#xD;
      collection Month 7-9: Data Analysis Month 10-12: Writing up&#xD;
