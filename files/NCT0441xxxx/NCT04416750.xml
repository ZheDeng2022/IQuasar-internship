  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a rare condition in which a narrowing of blood&#xD;
      vessels carrying blood through the lungs puts an increased work load on the heart; it has to&#xD;
      work harder to pump blood through the lungs. While current treatments relieve some of the&#xD;
      symptoms, they do not stop or reverse the disease in the affected blood vessels. Imatinib is&#xD;
      a medicine licensed for some types of cancers. A published study has shown that imatinib can&#xD;
      have beneficial effects on blood flow through the lungs and exercise capacity in patients&#xD;
      with PAH, even when added to existing treatments. However, there have been concerns about its&#xD;
      safety and tolerability. Imatinib continues to be prescribed occasionally on compassionate&#xD;
      grounds, usually when other treatment options have been exhausted, and some patients feel&#xD;
      better on the drug. To improve the investigator's understanding, the investigators of this&#xD;
      study re-visits the use of Imatinib as a potential treatment for patients with PAH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What does the study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves treatment of PAH patients with imatinib (study drug) for up to 24 weeks,&#xD;
      and clinical assessments and tests to assess the drug's safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH patients will be seen at their local hospital by the PAH clinical research team. Before&#xD;
      someone can start study, the study doctor (or clinical study team) will describe the clinical&#xD;
      trial in detail. If a potential subject decides to participate, he/she will be asked to sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form before any study procedures are done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come to their local hospital for clinical appointments. This&#xD;
      includes a screening visit, a baseline visit, three clinical assessments and an end-of-study&#xD;
      visit. In between, and at the very end of these, there will be six tele-visits (assessments&#xD;
      over the phone). Each clinical appointment will be on a weekday morning or afternoon. No&#xD;
      major lifestyle restrictions are required for these appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo clinical examinations and tests to monitor the severity of PAH and&#xD;
      the response to the study drug. Clinical procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about demographics, medical and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and record of vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart and&#xD;
           respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessments of PAH severity (WHO Functional Class, six-minute walk test, and Borg&#xD;
           dyspnoea index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right heart catheterisation to assess response to the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematology and clinical chemistry blood tests to ensure safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum pregnancy test and urine pregnancy tests (if applicable) to exclude pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples to measure the levels of the study drug in the circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples for future research on PAH and/or the mechanism of action of&#xD;
           the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram to assess the size, shape, pumping action&#xD;
           and the extent of any damage to the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI scan (or CT scan if MR is not indicated/tolerated) to exclude bleeding in the&#xD;
           brain&#xD;
