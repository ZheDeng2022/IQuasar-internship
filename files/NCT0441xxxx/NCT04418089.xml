      Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been the standard therapy for treating&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Doxorubicin-based regimen showed a&#xD;
      clinical response for 70-80%. However, the cardiotoxicity from it was not tolerable.&#xD;
      Simvastatin acts synergistically with doxorubicin against MCF-7 cells, through downregulation&#xD;
      of the cell cycle or induction of apoptosis. Also, it alleviates doxorubicin cardiotoxicity&#xD;
      by attenuating ER stress and activating the Akt pathway. Hmgcris a new pathway mediating&#xD;
      doxorubicin-induced cell death, and cholesterol control drugs combined with doxorubicin could&#xD;
      enhance efficacy and reduce side effects. This study is conducted to see the combination&#xD;
      simvastatin and CAF would increase the NACT response and surgical margin of LABC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, conducted in dr.&#xD;
      Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital and Koja General Hospital. A total of 70 LABC patients&#xD;
      were assessed for eligibility. Patients received either a combination of CAF-Simvastatin (40&#xD;
      mg/day) or CAF-Placebo. The biopsy was taken pre-NACT to make the histopathological diagnosis&#xD;
      and examine the expression of HMG-CoA Reductase (Hmgcr) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Patients&#xD;
      were evaluated for the clinical response after 3 cycles. If the response was positive,&#xD;
      patients will proceed to surgery. Then, the post-operative specimen will be reviewed for the&#xD;
      pathological response. However, if it was a negative response, patients will be given 2nd&#xD;
      line NACT.&#xD;

      Backgrounds Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) which is followed by surgery is now a standard&#xD;
      therapy in the local advanced breast cancer (LABC) since it was introduced 50 years ago,&#xD;
      increasingly being used in early-stage LABC patients. Some NACT studies in RSCM use a&#xD;
      doxorubicin-based regimen, giving a 70-80% partial response, but do not require a complete&#xD;
      response both clinically and pathologically. The NACT response was 80% with a complete&#xD;
      clinical response of 36%. The complete pathological response obtained after NACT is the&#xD;
      prognosis of a replacement marker both overall and disease-free survival in the LABC. The&#xD;
      purpose of giving NACTis to increase tumor resectability and de-escalation surgery and kill&#xD;
      micrometastasis which will increase the length of disease-free and life expectancy of the&#xD;
      patient. New tumor margins causing post-NACT tumor shrinkage can be used as surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy is the most commonly given chemotherapy for NACT as well as&#xD;
      entering the first line of the National Formulary. However, side effects are limited from&#xD;
      drug resistance side effects that can cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure. One of the&#xD;
      factors that influence doxorubicin resistance is the presence of efflux pumps such as&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the cell surface. While the effects of toxicity arise due to the&#xD;
      formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the presence of free radicals. Efforts to&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of the combination of chemotherapy currently being used with targeted&#xD;
      therapies such as anti-HER-2 and bevacizumab, but have a high enough toxicity and are&#xD;
      expensive and not included in ForNas. Likewise, some drugs that have been tested in vitro as&#xD;
      P-gp inhibitors/modifiers, but failed in clinical trials because of ineffectiveness and&#xD;
      greater side effects on the kidneys and heart. Some previous studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      simvastatin is a potential ABCB1 / P-gp inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are the most widely used anti-hypercholesterolemia in the world, through inhibition&#xD;
      of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (Hmgcr) which is an enzyme that limits the&#xD;
      use of the mevalonate pathway that can be used as intracellular cholesterol. Besides having&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects, statins also have anti-tumor effects. At this time, statins have&#xD;
      received approval as a potential anti-tumor agent because several epidemiological studies&#xD;
      have agreed on the relationship between statin use and reducing the risk of recurrence of&#xD;
      LABC after adjuvant therapy. Some preclinical studies show that statins can decrease breast&#xD;
      cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in various experimental models. results from&#xD;
      pre-operative &quot;window-of-opportunity&quot; clinical trials on LABC so that statins can reduce&#xD;
      tumor proliferation and induce apoptosis. Reports in the RSCM get simvastatin 40 mg for 4&#xD;
      weeks for neoadjuvant reduce the proliferation index in the LABC by 53.3% and inhibit the&#xD;
      increase in LABC cells through the Rho / Rock pathway. Although several studios of statin&#xD;
      antitumor activity have been carried out, the role of statins in oncology has not yielded&#xD;
      satisfactory results or controversies and provides heterogeneous responses depending on the&#xD;
      molecular identity and tumor type malignancy. The results of a clinical preliminary study&#xD;
      indicate that giving a single statin is not as effective as an anti-cancer because it&#xD;
      requires large effects and large side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several in vitro studies and animal models show that the combination of statins can increase&#xD;
      the accumulation of intra-cell chemotherapy so that the effects of potentiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy arise. The administration of a combination of doxorubicin statins increases the&#xD;
      potential for anti-cancer effects through the accumulation of doxorubicin in cancer cells,&#xD;
      causing the potential for DNA damage, inhibition of proliferation, and induction of&#xD;
      apoptosis. statins can also protect cardiotoxic induced by doxorubicin if it is given&#xD;
      pre-therapy in mice. With a variety of anti-tumor mechanisms as well as the enormous benefits&#xD;
      and potential addition of statins that can be well-tolerated, safe, and inexpensive. However,&#xD;
      until now the effects of antiproliferation synergy and induction of apoptosis combination of&#xD;
      simvastatin and doxorubicin in LABC patients are not well known. This study aims to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of simvastatin combination and CAF chemotherapy as&#xD;
      neo-advanced therapy in LABC patients. The use of this combination is expected to improve&#xD;
      clinical and pathological responses as well as surgical margins while providing&#xD;
      cardioprotection effects, so as to provide the best service with high oncological value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject and study design This research is a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
           trial conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital and Koja General Hospital&#xD;
           from January 2018 to September 2019. Eligible patients are patients with grade IIIA to&#xD;
           IIIC invasive breast cancer that is histologically proven. A total of 60 LABC patients&#xD;
           were included in this study. Participants received a combination of NACT CAF and&#xD;
           Simvastatin (40 mg / day) (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Besides being used to make a&#xD;
           histopathological diagnosis, samples were taken by biopsy before NACT, examined for the&#xD;
           expression of HMG-CoA Reductase (HMGCR) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Participants were&#xD;
           evaluated for the clinical response after 3 NACT cycles. If it gives a complete or&#xD;
           partial response, then the patient will proceed to surgery. Then, the postoperative&#xD;
           specimen will be reviewed for a pathological response. However, if it is stable or&#xD;
           progressive, the patient will be given a 2nd line NACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor assessment The primary outcome was clinical response while the secondary outcome&#xD;
           was the pathological response, incision boundary, P-gp expression, Hmgcr expression and&#xD;
           side effects. The analysis was performed on the population per protocol. Clinical&#xD;
           response assessment uses WHO 1979 criteria. Pathological responses of tumors are&#xD;
           evaluated according to the Miller-Payne scoring system. MPG classification is used to&#xD;
           evaluate the relevance between pathological response and clinical response. The incision&#xD;
           boundary assessment is performed using histopathological tissue incisions depending on&#xD;
           the surgical margins of the tumor on the medial, lateral, cranial, caudal, and baseline&#xD;
           sides of the tumor; based on the size of the new tumor. Histopathological results will&#xD;
           determine whether the level is free from the tumor or not based on the size of the new&#xD;
           tumor. Disease assessment is carried out by investigation after 3 NACT cycles. Side&#xD;
           effects were assessed during treatment and for 7 days after the last treatment dose and&#xD;
           assessed using CTCAE 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biomarker assessment Estimation of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and Hmgcr expression was seen&#xD;
           under a microscope from a sample after a core biopsy was performed before starting&#xD;
           chemotherapy. P-gp expression was interpreted based on the percentage of p-glycoprotein&#xD;
           positive cells in the total cell population (low = 0%, 1+ = 1-19%, and 2 + = 20-100%&#xD;
           positive cells). Hmgcr expression is interpreted based on the percentage of Hmgcr&#xD;
           positive cells in the total cell population (negative = 0%, 1+ = 1-10%, 2+ = 11-50%, 3+&#xD;
           =&gt; 51-100% positive cells)..&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis The main results in this study were clinical responses based on WHO&#xD;
           1970 criteria. ORR values in this study were calculated from the ratio of the number of&#xD;
           patients who showed a response (complete and partial) to the total number of patients&#xD;
           and were analyzed using the Pearson Chi-Square Test. Secondary outcomes in the form of&#xD;
           pathological responses based on GMP and incision boundaries were analyzed using Fisher's&#xD;
           Exact Test. Bivariate analysis of clinicopathological variables and molecular biology&#xD;
           with the therapeutic response using the Continuity Correction Test and the Fischer's&#xD;
           Exact Test. The results of the bivariate analysis with p&gt; 0.25 were performed&#xD;
           multivariate analysis using the Logistic Regression Test. The analysis was performed&#xD;
           with the help of a computer using the SPSS 23 program. Differences were stated to be&#xD;
           meaningful and obtained p values &lt;0.05.&#xD;
