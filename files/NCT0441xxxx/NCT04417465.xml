  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective ABBV-CLS-579 is when used alone or&#xD;
      in combination with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in treating solid&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABBV-CLS-579 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of solid tumors.&#xD;
      The study has two arms - Monotherapy and Combination Therapy. In the monotherapy arm,&#xD;
      participants will receive ABBV-CLS-579 alone, in increasing doses. In the combination therapy&#xD;
      arm, escalating doses of ABBV-CLS-579 will be given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.&#xD;
      Adult participants with a diagnosis of some solid tumors for which no effective standard&#xD;
      therapy exists, or has failed will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral ABBV-CLS-579 capsule alone or in combination with intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) PD-1 inhibitor. Participants will receive study drug treatment until disease progresses&#xD;
      or discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a&#xD;
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood&#xD;
      tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.&#xD;
