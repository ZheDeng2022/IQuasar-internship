    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if, controlling for eating and sleep timing,&#xD;
      caloric intake, and exercise, daytime vs. delayed eating affects body mass, adiposity, and&#xD;
      energy metabolism in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 4 phases - screening &amp; baseline assessment, eating condition 1,&#xD;
      wash-out period, and eating condition 2. Before and after each phase participants will&#xD;
      complete a 28-hour inpatient assessment at the Clinical and Translational Research Center&#xD;
      (CTRC) of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania to study the impact of one's eating&#xD;
      on body weight and fat content, metabolism, and certain markers of metabolism in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening In order to participate in this study the participants must undergo a complete&#xD;
      physical examination and tests of blood and urine. These tests will determine if participants&#xD;
      have any conditions that would prevent them from participating in the study, including&#xD;
      diabetes or any serious uncontrolled medical condition that may interfere with their&#xD;
      participation in the study. Other conditions that would prevent them from taking part are&#xD;
      pregnancy or nursing, a sleep disorder, the use of certain medications, or night-shift work.&#xD;
      A urine pregnancy test will be given to women at this screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete several surveys of a psychological nature and participate in&#xD;
      a clinical interview. Sleep and exercise schedules are important and will be reviewed during&#xD;
      their visits to see if they match with the study requirements. During the 10 days of the&#xD;
      screening assessment, participants will keep a log in which they will record all food and&#xD;
      beverages that they consume. They will also use these logs to record when they sleep and&#xD;
      exercise. Their activity will be measured by a small electronic wrist activity recorder,&#xD;
      called an Actigraph (about the size of a wrist watch), during this time. This recorder,&#xD;
      similar to a pedometer, records all activity from the arm, and is very useful in determining&#xD;
      if and when they get up at night. Study staff will explain how to keep this information&#xD;
      during the baseline visit. They will return the activity recorder and log to Dr. Allison for&#xD;
      analysis at the end of the 10-days. They are expected to return all study materials,&#xD;
      including the Actigraph, log, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Following successful completion of the screening period, they will complete the&#xD;
      first of four assessment visits. This visit will include 28 hours (overnight) spent at the&#xD;
      CTRC, where their meals and snacks will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will arrive at the CTRC at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania at 7 AM.&#xD;
      Starting at 8 AM, their blood will be drawn every four hours. A thin needle (an introducer)&#xD;
      will be inserted into a vein in their forearm, much like an IV line. Very small blood&#xD;
      samples, 10mL (2 teaspoonfuls), will be collected every four hours from 8:00 AM on Day 1&#xD;
      through 8:00 AM on Day 2. From this blood study staff will measure hormones related to&#xD;
      metabolism, sleep, and stress. They will be provided meals and snacks during this time, and&#xD;
      they are free to watch television or use their computer or participate in other sedentary&#xD;
      pastimes while they are there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood draws end at 8 AM on the second morning, their metabolic rate will be&#xD;
      measured. Participants will be asked to fast for 10 hours overnight (they will not be able to&#xD;
      eat or drink anything except water for 10 hours starting at 10 PM the night before). Then&#xD;
      study staff will measure their resting metabolic rate for 20 minutes. During the&#xD;
      measurements, they will lay on their back in bed with a plastic hood/canopy over their head&#xD;
      and neck. They will lay still and breathe normally while the air they inhale and exhale is&#xD;
      collected in the canopy/hood and analyzed using a machine that is connected to the&#xD;
      canopy/hood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged from the hospital, and research staff will escort them to the&#xD;
      Center for Weight and Eating Disorders where their body composition will be measured using&#xD;
      dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). During this test, X-ray pictures of their body will&#xD;
      measure how much fat and muscle are present. They will lie flat on a table and a machine will&#xD;
      take pictures of different areas of the body. This test will last about 30 minutes. This will&#xD;
      conclude the assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating Conditions &amp; Assessments Upon completion of the baseline assessment, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to start with one of two eating conditions: 1) Daytime or 2) Delayed,&#xD;
      and then they will switch and eat on the other schedule for the final part of the study. If&#xD;
      they are assigned to the Daytime eating condition first, they will be asked to consume all of&#xD;
      their meals and snacks each day between 8 AM and 7 PM. If they are assigned to the Delayed&#xD;
      eating condition first, they will be asked to consume all of their meals and snacks between&#xD;
      12 PM and 11 PM each day. They will eat on these schedules for 8 weeks each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the two 8-week eating condition periods, all of their meals and snacks will be&#xD;
      provided by the research kitchen and will be delivered to themby a member of the research&#xD;
      staff twice per week. They will be provided a personalized menu and asked to track each food&#xD;
      item they consume. They will also be asked to record any beverages they consume on this menu&#xD;
      (beverages will not be provided). If occasionally they do not eat the meals provided, they&#xD;
      will be asked to use their smart phone or electronic device to send a picture of their food&#xD;
      to the study team before they eat it, and again if any food is not eaten when they have&#xD;
      finished their meal. They will be asked to wear an Actigraph for the duration of the study,&#xD;
      and study staff will deliver new devices and collect used devices one time per week. They&#xD;
      will be sent and asked to respond to daily queries by text message or email regarding their&#xD;
      eating, sleeping, and exercise. At the end of the 8 weeks, they will complete the second&#xD;
      overnight assessment visit (as described above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For two weeks following this second assessment, they will be asked to eat as they normally&#xD;
      would. During this &quot;wash-out&quot; period they will eat what and when then would like. They will&#xD;
      then complete the third overnight assessment visit before starting the second eating&#xD;
      condition (Delayed for those initially assigned to the Daytime schedule; Daytime for those&#xD;
      initially assigned to the Delayed schedule). They will be asked to eat on this new schedule&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. They will then complete the fourth and final overnight assessment. After this&#xD;
      final assessment visit, their participation in the study will be complete.&#xD;
