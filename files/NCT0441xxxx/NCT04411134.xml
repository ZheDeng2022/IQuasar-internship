      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to High-Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN&#xD;
      2,3). This type of lesion has a high risk of becoming cancer. T cells are part of the immune&#xD;
      system. A new type of treatment involves modifying these cells and injecting them into the&#xD;
      lesions to shrink them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if injecting a type of treatment directly into cervical lesions can be safely given&#xD;
      as therapy for high-grade CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 21 and older with CIN 2,3 caused by HPV-16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened over at least 2 visits with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic exam and colposcopy to look at the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. They may be admitted to the hospital. They may&#xD;
      receive a large catheter inserted into a vein. They will have a vein assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they receive treatment, participants will have a biopsy of the cervix. They will have&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the arm, circulated through a&#xD;
      machine that takes out the while blood cells, then returned through a needle in the other&#xD;
      arm. A central catheter may also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the modified cells injected directly into their cervical lesions. They&#xD;
      will recover in the hospital for 1-2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 2 weeks, 31 days, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment. They may receive a second injection at the 31-day visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted once a year for 5 years after treatment. They will be followed&#xD;
      for up to 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is caused by persistent infection with the&#xD;
           Human Papillomavirus (HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-grade lesions are common, affecting 5% of the female population in the United&#xD;
           States, and are more likely to progress to cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical and ablative therapies are effective but can lead to long-term morbidity. New&#xD;
           treatment modalities are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E7 TCR T cells have demonstrated safety and clinical activity in treatment-refractory&#xD;
           metastatic HPV+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety of intralesional injection of E7 TCR T cells as therapy for high-&#xD;
      grade CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients greater than or equal to 21 years of age with HPV16-associated, high-grade CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I clinical trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive intralesional injections of E7 TCR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will not receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen or systemic aldesleukin.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
             neoplasia (CIN 2,3). Confirmation of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
             (pathology report from outside institution is sufficient). Pathology confirming&#xD;
             high-grade CIN must be within 3 months prior to initiation of study therapy. If&#xD;
             needed, confirmatory biopsy of lesion(s) may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV16+ CIN 2,3 and HLA-A*02:01 HLA type&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be treatment-naive or have received previous treatment for high-grade&#xD;
             CIN. Patients who have received previous treatment are eligible if prior treatment was&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 3 months before first dose of E7 TCR T cells and there is&#xD;
             pathological confirmation of recurrent or persistent disease. If needed, confirmatory&#xD;
             biopsy of lesion(s) may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can have either one lesion or multiple lesions with at least one lesion being&#xD;
             visible on colposcopy to help facilitate intralesional administration of E7 TCR T&#xD;
             cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 21 years. Because treatment for this disease is not&#xD;
             recommended in patients &lt;21 years of age, children and adolescents &lt;21 years old are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status greater than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within 1.5X normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;50mL/min/1.73m^2 for&#xD;
                  patient with creatinine levels above institutional normal (by the Chronic Kidney&#xD;
                  Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because E7 TCR T&#xD;
             cells have unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who&#xD;
             have not had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age of&#xD;
             55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of E7 TCR T cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence, tubal&#xD;
             ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for up to 4 months after treatment.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by&#xD;
             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Follow up Protocol, which&#xD;
             will follow patients for up to 15 years per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR T cells. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency&#xD;
             such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
             be less responsive to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on immunosuppressive drugs including systemic corticosteroids (inhaled or&#xD;
             intranasal corticosteroids are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a second active invasive cancer are not eligible.&#xD;
