  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have the greatest burden of hypertension. Recently, the short-chain fatty&#xD;
      acid, butyrate, has been reported to have some effect on blood pressure. Butyrate is not&#xD;
      normally ingested since it is made by bacteria in the gut as a byproduct of fiber&#xD;
      fermentation. In this proof of concept study, the investigators will investigate the effect&#xD;
      of butyrate absorbed in the gut (via the participant self-administering an enema with&#xD;
      butyrate) has on blood pressure.&#xD;

      Description: African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of hypertension. Recently, gut&#xD;
      microbial dysbiosis (a term that describes a poorly diverse gut microbial profile and lower&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production) has been linked to hypertension and may be involved&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans. African Americans have been&#xD;
      reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure. This is a proof of&#xD;
      concept pilot study to determine the relationship between gut SCFA and blood pressure (BP).&#xD;
      Delivery of butyrate to the gut will be via enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this research are to 1. Identify gut microbial taxa (SCFA&#xD;
      butyrate-producing microbes) and circulating butyrate levels associated with hypertension via&#xD;
      a cross-sectional design in AA without and with hypertension. 2. Quantify the relationship&#xD;
      between SCFA (butyrate) absorption into the bloodstream and subsequent changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure in a 24-hour period after delivering butyrate into the gut via enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: African Americans males and females ages of 30-50 without hypertension (normal&#xD;
      BP/healthy control; systolic BP: 90-129/ diastolic BP: 60-89mmHg) and with hypertension&#xD;
      (systolic BP: 130-159 mmHg/ diastolic BP: 80-99 mmHg) that do not take anti-hypertension&#xD;
      medication will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study: There are 2 groups; control (without hypertension; BP:&#xD;
      90-129/60-89mmHg; 5 male/5 female, n=10) and experimental (with hypertension; BP&#xD;
      130-159/80-99 mmHg; 5 male/5 female, n=10). Normotensive participants (control group) will be&#xD;
      age (±1 year) and sex-matched to hypertensive group participants. All participants (control&#xD;
      and experimental groups; 5 male/5 female) will provide stool and blood samples, and complete&#xD;
      24-hour (hr) ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring to compare the abundance of fecal&#xD;
      butyrate-producing microbes, circulating (blood) butyrate concentrations, and average blood&#xD;
      pressure responses during the day and overnight. Individuals in the control group will only&#xD;
      participate in donating stool (1-time) and a blood sample (1-time) and wearing a 24-hr ABP&#xD;
      monitor (1-day). In a crossover blinded randomized controlled pilot study, the 10&#xD;
      hypertensive AA subjects (5 male/5 female) will be randomized to self-administer a sodium&#xD;
      butyrate (80mmol butyrate in 0.9% saline, 60 ml total) or control (low dose) butyrate (5mmol&#xD;
      butyrate 0.9%, 60 ml total) enema 1 week apart (7 days). Subjects will provide a stool sample&#xD;
      before each study day (2 total), have their BP measured via ABP monitor, submit to a blood&#xD;
      draws (pre-enema-baseline), self-administer the randomized enema, submit to a 30 min &amp; 60 min&#xD;
      post-enema blood draw, and wear the 24-hour ABP monitor for the remainder of that day.&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with written and verbal instructions on how to self-administer the&#xD;
      enema. The dietary supplement (sodium butyrate) will be compounded by a local pharmacy&#xD;
      (Custom Care Pharmacy - 109 Pisgah Church Rd. Greensboro, NC) into an enema at the&#xD;
      concentrations listed above.&#xD;

Randomization will be performed by 1 member of the research team at the beginning of the study who is also not involved in any informed consent process.
