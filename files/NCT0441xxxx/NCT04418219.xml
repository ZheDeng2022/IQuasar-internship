  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of a breast cancer vaccine (SV-BR-1-GM) and&#xD;
      how well it works in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of breast cancer that&#xD;
      is persistent, has come back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Breast cancer vaccine SV-BR-1-GM is a human breast cancer cell line that has&#xD;
      been genetically engineered to produce a substance called &quot;GM-CSF&quot; (granulocyte-macrophage&#xD;
      colony stimulating factor) which occurs naturally in the body. GM-CSF is normally produced by&#xD;
      white blood cells and helps the body develop immunity to disease-causing germs. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs such as cyclophosphamide may help boost the immune response. Interferon alpha 2b may&#xD;
      help stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. This trial may help doctors see whether&#xD;
      SV-BR-1-GM injections help boost the immune system and/or help control or help shrink breast&#xD;
      cancer along with the other drugs that also boost the immune system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of the allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine SV-BR-1-GM&#xD;
      (SV-BR-1-GM) regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the overall response rate of&#xD;
      the SV-BR1-GM regimen in combination with pembrolizumab. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the non-progressive rate of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the duration of response of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate immune responses elicited by the SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that may be predictive of responses to the&#xD;
      SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) in patients administered the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1, SV-BR-1-GM&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) on day 3, pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and&#xD;
      interferon-alpha-2b ID on days 5 and 7. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;

             detected) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require systemic steroids at doses &gt; 10 mg daily of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent or any immunosuppressive drugs. Beta-blocker therapy, while not&#xD;
             exclusionary, is discouraged and alternatives should be sought if possible. The&#xD;
             beta-blocker might compromise use of epinephrine for the rare possibility of&#xD;
             anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, or borderline&#xD;
             personality disorder) or other clinically progressive major medical problems, unless&#xD;
             approved by the principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be on a concurrent treatment clinical trial, unless approved by&#xD;
             principal investigator&#xD;
