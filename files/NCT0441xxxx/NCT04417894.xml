    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of dupilumab on skin lesions in&#xD;
      patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of dupilumab on various other domains (pruritus, pain, sleep&#xD;
           loss, health related QoL, work life impairment) in patients with atopic hand and foot&#xD;
           dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab administered to patients with&#xD;
           atopic hand and foot dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate systemic exposure and immunogenicity of dupilumab in patients with atopic&#xD;

    <description>WPAI + CIQ is a self-administered instrument used to capture the impairment to work productivity/classroom impairment and activity due to atopic hand and foot dermatitis.
