      A mixed methods proof of concept study to ascertain the effectiveness of a home-based&#xD;
      self-administered neurofeedback intervention to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to address the growing problem of chronic pain management in the UK, a proof of&#xD;
      concept/feasibility open label study has been devised to test a home-based self-administered&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment utilising neurofeedback training with a headset and&#xD;
      tablet-based software application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include individuals suffering from various types of chronic pain, measuring&#xD;
      changes in pain intensity alongside associated symptoms (depression, anxiety, sleep, and&#xD;
      quality of life) by utilising a purpose-built software application and headset that is easy&#xD;
      to use and structurally robust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants will take part in pre-intervention quantitative assessments measuring the&#xD;
      primary and secondary symptoms of chronic pain. This will be followed by one-to-one remote&#xD;
      training where they will be provided with detailed instructions on how to self-administer the&#xD;
      neurofeedback training in the comfort of their own homes. They will then take part in 4-6&#xD;
      training sessions per week over an 8-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post- intervention quantitative assessments will be conducted alongside a qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of the experience of doing neurofeedback training for chronic pain. Participant&#xD;
      feedback on how the protocol, equipment and research could be improved will also be recorded&#xD;
      to inform further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also take part in online follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      the intervention. Any adjustments to pain medication will also be recorded over this period.&#xD;
      It is anticipated this study will provide initial evidence of the safety, efficacy,&#xD;
      reliability and validity of a low-cost non-pharmacological solution to the physical,&#xD;
      psychological and social difficulties experienced by individuals with chronic pain, with a&#xD;
      view to a larger subsequent multisite trial.&#xD;
