      This study examines the safety and efficacy of using the Imvamune smallpox vaccine in the&#xD;
      treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main ways cancer is able to develop is by hiding or evading our immune system&#xD;
      which usually detects and kills potential tumor cells. Once cancer has developed the ability&#xD;
      to evade the immune system it can continue to grow and become a tumor. One potential strategy&#xD;
      currently being researched, called immunotherapy, uses viruses to stimulate an immune&#xD;
      response which attacks the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imvamune is a live, non-replicating virus used in Canada to vaccinate adults and children&#xD;
      against smallpox. It is safe to use in immunosuppressed patients because the virus is unable&#xD;
      to replicate and spread past the first infected cell. This makes the Imvamune vaccine a&#xD;
      viable candidate for immunotherapy in immunosuppressed patients who are at a much higher (up&#xD;
      to 60x) risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed, BCC and/or SCC tumors located on the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically documented disease. Skin tumor should measure at least 10 mm in&#xD;
             size and should be no larger than 5 cm in any axes. There should be no clinical&#xD;
             suspicion of metastasis (i.e. no lymphadenopaties and no systemic symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a documented ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects could be treatment naive or could have had previous surgery or radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have had prior radiation therapy. A minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) must&#xD;
             have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration (14 days for&#xD;
