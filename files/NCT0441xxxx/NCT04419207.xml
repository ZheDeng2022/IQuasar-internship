  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection is critical to improve the overall survival of lung cancer. Endogenous&#xD;
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be derived from many different metabolic pathways. On&#xD;
      the other hand, cancer cells have different metabolism patterns compared with normal cells.&#xD;
      Thus, detecting VOCs in exhaled breath using highly sensitive mass spectrometry would be a&#xD;
      promising approach for lung cancer detection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be derived from many different metabolic&#xD;
      pathways. VOCs can be transported to the alveoli through the blood circulation and expelled&#xD;
      by exhalation. Changes in VOCs production, clearance, and alterations in lung air-blood&#xD;
      exchange functions can lead to aberrant VOCs profiles in the exhaled breath. Testing exhaled&#xD;
      breath has the advantages of being completely non-invasive and easy to collect, and has been&#xD;
      considered as a perfect approach for disease diagnoses and therapeutic monitoring. Many&#xD;
      clinical studies have found that VOCs in exhaled breath are closely related to disease&#xD;
      status. Specific VOCs alterations have been identified in many tumors, especially lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we use a highly sensitive mass spectrometry to detect exhaled VOCs of lung&#xD;
      cancer patients and healthy people. A lung cancer diagnosis model based on mass spectrometry&#xD;
      data and support vector machine will be initially established and validated.&#xD;
