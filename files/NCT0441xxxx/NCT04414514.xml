  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream is an effective therapy for HS&#xD;
      participants through inhibition of inflammatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the clinical efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in decreasing the clinical&#xD;
           disease activity after 16 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the impact of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream on skin inflammation through&#xD;
           translational analyses of skin biopsy samples.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy measure is the proportion of participants that achieve HiSCR at Week 16&#xD;
      with topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream as compared to Week 0. The HiSCR is defined as an at&#xD;
      least a 50% reduction in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count (AN count) for all&#xD;
      study body sites with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count&#xD;
      relative to Baseline. The primary efficacy analysis will be carried out on all participants&#xD;
      who complete 16 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study consists of an 8 week screening with 16 weeks open-label portion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects who had surgery in the treatment area, should be at least 3 months status&#xD;
             post the procedure (this applies to deroofing/marsupialization or excision, not&#xD;
             incision &amp; drainage)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a negative TB screening assessment (including a PPD test and/or&#xD;
             Quantiferon-TB Gold test equivalent) OR for patients with treated latent TB or&#xD;
             negative chest x-ray (CXR posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral view within prior 90&#xD;
             days) at Screening with documentation of treated latent tuberculosis (90 days of&#xD;
