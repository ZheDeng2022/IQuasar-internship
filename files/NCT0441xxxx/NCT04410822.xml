  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urge faecal incontinence (FI) and passive FI are the two subgroups of FI described by the&#xD;
      International Continence Society. Urge FI is described as &quot;the inability to defer defecation&#xD;
      once the urge is perceived for long enough to reach a toilet&quot; and passive FI as &quot;the&#xD;
      involuntary leakage of faeces without forewarning&quot;. If several validated questionnaires are&#xD;
      available for FI, all of these questionnaires were developed to assess FI severity. In&#xD;
      literature, there is only a small number of studies that investigated clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical characteristics of the different phenotype of FI. Moreover, there is an&#xD;
      heterogenicity in the definitions used for both urge and passive FI among these studies.&#xD;
      Lastly, patients with mixed FI were commonly excluded from these studies. It can be&#xD;
      established that there is a lack of validate tools to distinguish patients between subgroups&#xD;
      of FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to develop and to validate a new tool in order to&#xD;
      investigate and classify patients among the different subgroups of FI (active, passive and&#xD;
      mixed) defined by Rome IV criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monocentric prospective study was conducted in the Neuro-urology Department of a University&#xD;
      Hospital. All consecutive patients presenting in the Department with FI between December 2019&#xD;
      and June 2020 were screened for inclusion in the present study. Criteria of inclusion were an&#xD;
      age older than 18 years old and symptoms of FI according to Rome IV criteria. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were anorectal fistula, active inflammatory bowel disease, anorectal malignant tumor&#xD;
      not treated, rectal or hemorrhoidal prolapses and specific inability regarding the&#xD;
      questionnaire (i.e. cognitive disorders, inability to read and to understand questions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: review of literature and qualitative interviews: To determine the dimensions of the&#xD;
      different subgroups of faecal incontinence, a literature review was performed using Pubmed&#xD;
      without date limitation until February 2020. The key words used were &quot;active faecal&#xD;
      incontinence&quot;, &quot;active fecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;passive faecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;passive fecal&#xD;
      incontinence&quot;, &quot;urge faecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;urge fecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;questionnaire&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;score&quot; and &quot;tool&quot;. In parallel to this literature review, semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews were performed on 20 patients from December 2019 to February 2020. During this&#xD;
      phase, a panel expert of 9 neuro-urologists and gastroenterologists was composed. At the term&#xD;
      of all interviews, dimensions that were both the most used by patients and the most&#xD;
      discriminative among subgroups of FI were included in the questionnaire. Redaction of&#xD;
      questions was then performed by the panel expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: feasibility study: The feasibility study was conducted from February to April 2020&#xD;
      on 30 patients. Each patient was asked to rate each version of the 2 questions with a&#xD;
      four-point Likert scale (A: very good, B: good, C: difficult, D: very difficult) regarding&#xD;
      acceptance and comprehension of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: validation study: To investigate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, a&#xD;
      validation study was performed from April to June 2020 on 100 consecutive patients. In order&#xD;
      to evaluate the FITAS' test reproducibility, patients were asked to answer a second time the&#xD;
      questionnaire by mail with a second evaluation from 7 days to 10 days after the first one.&#xD;
      The &quot;intra-class correlation coefficient&quot; (ICC) was used to determine if these evaluations&#xD;
      could lead to similar results for each question. An ICC &gt; 0.70 was necessary to define&#xD;
      reproducibility.&#xD;
