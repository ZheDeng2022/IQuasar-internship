  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical trial will assess whether continuation of home oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to&#xD;
      insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in the hospital. The primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study is to determine differences in glycemic control as measured by mean daily blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration between oral antidiabetic medications and basal bolus therapy in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia in the hospital is common and has been associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      complications, length of stay, and mortality. Improving glycemic control has been shown to&#xD;
      improve length of stay, multi-organ failure, systemic infections, as well as short- and&#xD;
      long-term mortality. Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend the use of&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical&#xD;
      and surgical patients with T2D. This approach, however, is labor intensive requiring multiple&#xD;
      daily insulin injections, costly, and associated with significant risk of iatrogenic&#xD;
      hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 75% of patients with T2D are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) but due to the&#xD;
      lack of safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines&#xD;
      recommend stopping OADs during hospitalization. The current clinical guidelines have raised&#xD;
      concerns with the use of OADs including risk of hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas, fluid&#xD;
      retention and worsening of heart failure with thiazolidinediones, and risk of&#xD;
      metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with severe renal impairment. However,&#xD;
      several observational studies have reported that the use of OADs results in similar glycemic&#xD;
      control without increased risk of complications compared to insulin regimens. A recent&#xD;
      observational study that included 17,325 hospitalized patients with T2D, found that patients&#xD;
      treated with OADs had similar glycemic control without differences in complications and no&#xD;
      increase in rates of hypoglycemia compared to those treated with insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess whether continuation of home oral antidiabetic agents during&#xD;
      hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy in the&#xD;
      management of diabetes in hospital patients with T2D. For a subset of participants (50&#xD;
      patients per group), a CGM devise will be placed for the duration of the study to assess&#xD;
      parameters of glycemic control and hypoglycemia.&#xD;

The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device. It has three main parts: a handheld reader, a disposable sensor, and FreeStyle Libre Pro software. The sensor has a small,flexible tip that is inserted just under the skin on the back of the patient's upper arm. The sensor can be worn for up to 14 days.</description>
