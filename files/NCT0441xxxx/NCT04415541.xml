  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goals of our pilot study are to (1) determine whether psychodynamic psychotherapy&#xD;
      for psychosis (PPfP), relative to treatment as usual (TaU), can maintain or augment clinical&#xD;
      and functional benefits for patients who have achieved initial recovery in our coordinated&#xD;
      specialty care (CSC) early psychosis treatment program; (2) to conduct novel empirical study&#xD;
      of how various psychodynamic factors may inform candidate selection, mediate therapeutic&#xD;
      effects, and influence relational aspects of the therapy; and (3) to conduct a detailed study&#xD;
      of how features of therapist and patient speech and behavior influence therapeutic outcomes,&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance alliance, and relational process. This registration focuses on the first&#xD;
      goal.&#xD;
