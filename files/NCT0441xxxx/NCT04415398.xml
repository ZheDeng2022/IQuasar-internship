  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time to defibrillation is the most important predictor of survival in cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      Traditional emergency medical system response is often to slow. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of drone systems that delivers Automated External Defibrillators&#xD;
      (AED) to the scene of suspected Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the feasibility of real-life flights with drones carrying automated&#xD;
      external defibrillators (AEDs) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) as a complement to&#xD;
      standard care i.e EMS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test the feasibility of dispatching an out of sight AED-drone system to real-life&#xD;
      OHCA in parallel with standard EMS dispatch. The study period is 5 months between May to&#xD;
      September 2020. The study area will be covered by three individual drone systems covering&#xD;
      some 80,000 inhabitants within the controlled airspace of Säve airport in Göteborg Sweden.&#xD;
      Each drone system will have a flight range of six km.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first month of the study period will be used as run-in period and the drone systems are&#xD;
      dispatched for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights in a simulated fashion and&#xD;
      optimized to decrease delays and to log pre-specified system variables, adherence to&#xD;
      protocol, time delays, technological functionality, weather conditions, conflict in the&#xD;
      airspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following 4 months June-September 2020, drones will dispatched to real-life&#xD;
      suspected OHCA during daytime 08:00-22:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EMS communication radio-unit is placed at the drone control center. In case of a suspected&#xD;
      OHCA in the service area and will be alerted by the dispatch centre (SOS alarm) when a&#xD;
      suspected OHCA is recognized during the 112-call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dispatcher identifies a cardiac arrest in the service areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pilot (from Everdrone) immediately initiates deployment protocol for the drone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parallel communication is made with the air traffic control (ATC) centre in order to&#xD;
           grant permit to deploy the drone with regards to the current weather and aviation&#xD;
           situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drone then flies to the coordinates of the OHCA and delivers an AED at the scene&#xD;
           using a winch system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The AED may be attached to the patient by the bystander on scene&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the technology is made by Everdrone AB Göteborg and SOS Alarm AB (national&#xD;
      dispatch organisation) and parallel applications for certificates for the individual aircraft&#xD;
      and permits for beyond visual line of sight flights (BVLOS-flights) was granted by the&#xD;
      Swedish Transportation board on 27 April 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drone system is operated only during daytime 08:00-22:00 when the Airport Air traffic&#xD;
      control is open. Likewise deployment of the drone will not be made if there is a conflict in&#xD;
      the airspace with manned aircrafts. Rainy weather or winds exceeding 8 m/s prohibits flights&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility is evaluated and measured from the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Operational factors Weather: a) rain, b) wind c) other. Conflict in airspace: a) manned&#xD;
           aircraft b) unmanned aircraft. Obstacles prohibiting flight or delivery: a) constructed&#xD;
           b) natural Time from dispatch to to take- off (min:sec). Time from dispatch to arrival&#xD;
           (min:sec). Proportions are measured out of cases with a) Take-off b) no take-off c)&#xD;
           aborted missions (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Human resources Adherence to protocol by: a) Dispatcher b) Drone pilot c) Air traffic&#xD;
           leader. Proportions are measured out of cases with neglected protocol prohibiting&#xD;
           mission completion, a) no alerts b) no take off c) aborted missions (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Technological functionality Drone, winch, Network, AED, Hangar, navigational software,&#xD;
           global positioning system precision, Dispatch centre system (CoordCOM -Dispatch centre&#xD;
           automated alert).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportions are measured out of cases where technological functionality prohibited mission&#xD;
      completion a) no take-off b) aborted missions. (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse advents (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) in relation to AED-drone mission /use&#xD;
      will be logged continuously. An adverse event may be caused by drone crash or risc of injury&#xD;
      or death due to conflict in airspace or technological impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AE is considered serious if it:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is immediately life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events that are related to the patient in cardiac arrest and would be expected in patients&#xD;
      undergoing attempted resuscitation should NOT be reported. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All events categorised as serious must be reported to the study administration within 24&#xD;
      hours of becoming aware of the event.&#xD;
