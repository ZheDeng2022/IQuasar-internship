  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to validate the effectivity of a simple home-based&#xD;
      training for cycling with functional electrical stimulation (FES). The training is designed&#xD;
      to progressively increase strength and endurance of the paralysed muscles of a person with&#xD;
      complete spinal cord injury. After a limited period of only several months, performance will&#xD;
      be assessed during FES-assisted cycling on a recumbent tricycle over flat ground. The&#xD;
      outcomes of this study should provide evidence for the effectivity of FES-cycling as&#xD;
      potential rehabilitation method.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injuries suffer from numerous comorbidities, linked in particular to&#xD;
      immobility and sedentariness. Studies have shown the benefits of training and reconditioning&#xD;
      to adapted effort in spinal cord injured people. Among other innovative techniques,&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) is aimed primarily at mobilizing as many muscles as&#xD;
      possible. Concerning electro-stimulated pedaling on a tricycle, it would allow individuals&#xD;
      with paraplegia or tetraplegia to practise physical activity in perspective of experiencing&#xD;
      pleasure during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, our team carried out a pilot study aiming at using a recumbent tricylce powered by&#xD;
      the lower limbs of a person with complete paraplegia under electrostimulation. The&#xD;
      participant was trained for 12 months, whit the objective to participate at an international&#xD;
      competition (Cybathlon 2016). This first study has opened up prospects and identified avenues&#xD;
      for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to significantly improve, over a limited period of time,&#xD;
      the pedalling performance on a tricycle by using electrical stimulation of the sub-lesional&#xD;
      muscles of people with spinal cord injuries. Secondary focusses will be: physical and&#xD;
      psychological tolerance to training; influence on pain, cardio-respiratory functions, body&#xD;
      composition regarding muscle trophicity and bone metabolism; psycho-social impact; impact of&#xD;
      modification of stimulation parameters (frequency, phase width, intensity, waveform, contact&#xD;
      location) in performance optimization and delay of muscle fatigue; performance impact of&#xD;
      mechanical modifications performed on the tricycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective case study: patients suffering from a complete traumatic injury and&#xD;
      followed at the Centre de Rééducation et de Réadaptation Fonctionnelle (CRRF) La&#xD;
      Châtaigneraie (Menucourt) will be recruited by the investigating physician during a&#xD;
      consultation for a period of approximately 6 months. The centre specialised in the management&#xD;
      of acute and chronic neurological lesions. The eligibility criteria are predefined to ensure&#xD;
      the participants safety. After verification of the criteria and before the start of the&#xD;
      programme, an exercise test (monitoring of the evolution of VO2max) will be carried out in&#xD;
      the Sports Medicine department of the CHI of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The first phase (V1)&#xD;
      consists of a one-month home-based isometric muscle training programme by electrostimulation&#xD;
      followed by a two-month programme (phase V2) of home-based muscle training by&#xD;
      electrostimulation on an ergocycle including one training per week at the CRRF. The home&#xD;
      ergocycle electro-stimulation muscle training, will be continued once or twice a week and&#xD;
      complemented in the third phase (V3) by training at the CRRF on a tricycle for one month.&#xD;
      Only the patient selected to participate in the Cybathlon 2020 will continue with the final&#xD;
      phase (V4), which includes, over a period of 2 to 4 months, muscle training by&#xD;
      electrostimulation on an ergocycle at home, electrostimulation sessions on a tricycle up to 3&#xD;
      times a week at the CRRF. In this phase, the optimization of the stimulation and electrical&#xD;
      patterns and the mechanics of the tricycle will take place in order to maximize the pilots&#xD;
      overall performance. Finally, the pilot will take part in the tricycle FES-Cycling race at&#xD;
      the Cybathlon 2020 in Zurich, i.e. an international competition and technological challenge,&#xD;
      requiring to master 1200 metres in a maximum time of 8 minutes. The different training&#xD;
      programs are based on sport-scientific principles and a physiotherapist will follow up on the&#xD;
      home sessions. The collaborating teams (engineers and researchers from INRIA, the French&#xD;
      National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control) will measure performance in&#xD;
      a bimonthly frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research should demonstrate that the safety, acceptability, satisfaction, self-esteem&#xD;
      and quality of life induced by the practice of FES-assisted pedalling, opens a new way of&#xD;
      training in rehabilitation centres and at home with the perspective of improving certain&#xD;
      physiological functions in the long-term.&#xD;
