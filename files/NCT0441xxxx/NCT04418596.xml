  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a clinical problem in which abnormal contact occurs&#xD;
      between the thighbone and the hip socket. In intensive, mostly still young, male athletes,&#xD;
      this problem seems to be related to a bony deformity on the head of this thighbone, a&#xD;
      so-called CAM. FAI itself gives rise to pain symptoms, but in time can even lead to premature&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. However, the cause of a CAM deformity itself, nor how FAI then arises, is&#xD;
      insufficiently known. In view of FAI prevention and its better treatment, this project thus&#xD;
      tries to better understand the underlying mechanisms. For this purpose, we will combine&#xD;
      detailed biomechanical evaluations of specific movement patterns with advanced medical&#xD;
      imaging and state of the art clinical evaluations to longitudinally follow up a group with a&#xD;
      known high risk of developing a CAM deformity, being young male elite soccer players.&#xD;
      Findings within this study will be additionally compared with similar analyses performed in&#xD;
      patients with FAI. This research aims to thus form a basis to define novel (sports-specific)&#xD;
      training schemes for the prevention of FAI, but also to define the actual treatment and&#xD;
      rehabilitation plans in more patient-specific and a better-informed way.&#xD;

      This is a longitudinal follow-up study in which subjects are invited for data collection&#xD;
      twice, the baseline time-point and the two years time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-16 years old male soccer players (40 elite level players , and 40 recreational level&#xD;
      players)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both data collection time-points the following measurements are preformed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical screening of hip joint&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radial MRI of bilateral hips&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biplanar and conventional x-ray Imaging of hip and pelvic region&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Athlete-specific 3D motion analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Questionnaires on injury history and physical activity levels.&#xD;
