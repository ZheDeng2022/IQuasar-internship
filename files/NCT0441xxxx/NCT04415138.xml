  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assistance allows performance of mitral valve operations with a truly minimally&#xD;
      invasive and totally thoracoscopic approach, with significant advantages for patients&#xD;
      compared to sternotomy-based surgery. Nonetheless, its diffusion has been limited by: 1)&#xD;
      significant learning curve and technical requirements; 2) increased immediate financial costs&#xD;
      due to dedicated equipment and materials. The aim of the present study is to perform a&#xD;
      prospective data collection and evaluation of the in-hospital and follow-up clinical results&#xD;
      of mitral valve repair using the last generation DaVinci X robotic platform. A&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis of this approach will be also conducted, under a global&#xD;
      healthcare system perspective (including the overall patients' pathway starting from&#xD;
      diagnosis of mitral valve disease until the completion of the 1st postoperative year). Since&#xD;
      the 'competitor' surgical technique is not represented by sternotomy-based mitral surgery,&#xD;
      but instead by minimally invasive, video-assisted mitral surgery, patients operated on using&#xD;
      such technique will serve as controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an observational, prospective, case-control investigation, the clinical data of all adult&#xD;
      (18 years-old or more) patients undergoing robotic-assisted mitral surgery in the Sponsor&#xD;
      hospital during the study period will be collected, including preoperative, intraoperative&#xD;
      and early postoperative variables. Patients need to be affected by severe mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation due to degenerative lesions and be eligible to robotic-assisted surgery. An&#xD;
      informed consent for inclusion in the study and management of personal data will be asked&#xD;
      from all participants. A total of 30 Baseline variables, 9 intraoperative variables, 26 early&#xD;
      postoperative variables and 55 follow-up variables will be collected. Systematic in-house&#xD;
      follow-up (clinical and echocardiographic) will be performed at the 3rd, 6th and 12th&#xD;
      postoperative months. The database will be managed by research assistants under the&#xD;
      supervision of the surgical team. Operations will be performed according to the Institutional&#xD;
      protocol using the DaVinci X robotic platform by a trained multidisciplinary team including&#xD;
      cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists, cardiologists, perfusionists and scrub nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same data will be obtained for all patients undergoing minimally invasive, video-assisted&#xD;
      non-robotic-assisted mitral repair during the study period. These patients will serve as&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints will include procedural success, early postoperative complications,&#xD;
      postoperative functional recovery (both immediate and at follow-up), echocardiographic&#xD;
      results of mitral repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such data will be compared with those from control patients undergoing minimally invasive,&#xD;
      non-robotic-assisted mitral surgery in our Department during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cooperation with Hospital Administration Team, all direct and indirect costs (Euros)&#xD;
      associated with the in-hospital pathway of each individual patient will be quantified (17&#xD;
      variables per patient within a separate database). Data collection will be expanded to any&#xD;
      hospitalisation occurring during the 1st postoperative year. Such data collection will&#xD;
      include patients undergoing both the robotic-assisted and the minimally invasive&#xD;
      video-assisted non-robotic-assisted strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using intergoup comparison statistical tests.&#xD;
