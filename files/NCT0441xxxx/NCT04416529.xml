    <textblock>
      Family caregivers were recruited through a combinations of strategies including a larger&#xD;
      caregiving project and its partners, memory clinics, community outreach, online&#xD;
      advertisement, flyers and brochures and word of mouth. After the telephone screening,&#xD;
      eligible individuals were scheduled for an in-person baseline meeting at which they received&#xD;
      additional information about the study, signed a consent form, completed baseline outcome&#xD;
      measures and then were randomized to the intervention or control group using an online&#xD;
      randomization program (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm). All participants&#xD;
      completed outcome measures immediately post-intervention for the intervention group and at 2&#xD;
      months for the control group and all participants completed follow-up outcome measures at 3&#xD;
      month following the baseline assessment. Participants in the intervention group completed a&#xD;
      practice log which was designed to track their daily practice of mindfulness at home. The&#xD;
      study was reviewed and approved by the Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board.&#xD;

      Intervention (tele-MBCT) group Tele-MBCT was an 8-week program delivered to participants&#xD;
      online via a videoconferencing program called Zoom. Zoom is an Ontario Personal Health&#xD;
      Information Act (PHIPA) compliant videoconferencing program that provides remote&#xD;
      communication for one-to-one or group meetings. Signing up, one-to-one meetings and attending&#xD;
      a meeting as an invitee are free. The host of a group meeting is charged a monthly fee (CAD&#xD;
      14.99-19.99). All hosting fees were paid by the Sinai Health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the intervention, each participant's internet device was checked for&#xD;
      compatibility with Zoom. If the device was not compatible, the participant was loaned a&#xD;
      tablet for the duration of the intervention which was returned at the end of the study. Each&#xD;
      participant was also trained in the use of their device to connect and use the Zoom platform&#xD;
      and had an online intake interview with the tele-MBCT instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each session, the host emailed the Zoom link to the participants. At the scheduled&#xD;
      time of each group session, participants joined the live streamed session via their computers&#xD;
      by using the link and following the on-screen instructions. During the live sessions, each&#xD;
      participant was able to see, hear and speak with the group leader and other group members and&#xD;
      they each could mute/unmute, turn on/off video, send messages via chat box and leave the&#xD;
      session at any time if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tele-MBCT instructor was a mental health clinician at the Reitman Centre who had a&#xD;
      University of Toronto specialist and applied mindfulness certificate and mindfulness training&#xD;
      at Mount Sinai Psychotherapy Institute (MSPI). She had extensive experience in developing and&#xD;
      delivering online training and services to professionals and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group were given a mindfulness package which included a book&#xD;
      called &quot;The Mindful Way Workbook&quot; (Teasdale, Williams, and Segal 2014), a practice log and a&#xD;
      snack pack of raisins (which was needed for the first session for mindful eating practice).&#xD;
      &quot;The Mindful Way Workbook&quot; contains information about emotional distress, MBCT foundation and&#xD;
      theories, other individuals' experiences with MBCT, weekly practices/explanations and&#xD;
      homework. The book also contains a CD audio guide to each week's mindfulness practice. The&#xD;
      practice log was a simple log for self-recording daily practices (number of minutes of daily&#xD;
      MBCT practice) and a note pad for recording the reasons/obstacles for not practicing. These&#xD;
      logs were anonymous and did not include any personal health information of the participants.&#xD;
      At the completion of the tele-MBCT training, participants submitted their logs for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele-MBCT was delivered in three, 8-week rounds. Each round consisted of 8 weekly, 2-hour&#xD;
      group sessions with 4-6 participants, held via Zoom on Wednesdays from 2:00 to 4:00 pm. For&#xD;
      any technical problems during the sessions, participants had telephone access to the&#xD;
      instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During tele-MBCT training, participants were trained in mindfulness concepts and techniques&#xD;
      including mindful eating, body scan, sitting meditation, breathing awareness, mindful walking&#xD;
      and mindful movements. Mindfulness practices, except for mindful walking and mindful&#xD;
      movements, were done in a sitting position in a chair or standing. Participants were asked to&#xD;
      do the mindful walking with safety measures and in the room in which they were getting the&#xD;
      training. The mindful movements were gentle stretches performed in seated and standing&#xD;
      positions and were modified to each participant's abilities. At the completion of each&#xD;
      session, participants were instructed to practice a specific mindfulness exercise during the&#xD;
      week and record them in their practice log. They could use the CD for guided meditation and&#xD;
      their home practice. The book also provided them with further readings. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the training, participants were asked to set aside 30-45 minutes per day for practice.&#xD;
      However, they were free to practice based on their schedule. Participants were permitted to&#xD;
      miss up to 2 sessions for unanticipated problems. None of the sessions was audio/video&#xD;
      recorded. Missed sessions were made up by reading about the missed session and doing the&#xD;
      daily practice according to the book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, MBCT was modified in two ways for online delivery: omitting the retreat day&#xD;
      from the schedule and mindful movements in lying position. In face to face MBCT training, the&#xD;
      retreat day is held between sessions 6 and 7 and lasts 5-6 hours, during which individuals&#xD;
      spend most of the day together in silence, doing guided practices of the previous sessions.&#xD;
      Because of the long hours of the retreat day, it was deemed impractical in an online&#xD;
      intervention and omitted. Because of safety issues, it was necessary that all the&#xD;
      participants in the group could be seen (via their cameras) by the instructor during the&#xD;
      whole training by adjusting the individual's device and finding the best position. This issue&#xD;
      was addressed in the Zoom training and the interview with the instructor. Because doing the&#xD;
      mindful movement in the lying position required adjustment of the device during the session&#xD;
      which was time consuming and challenging, individuals were instructed to do mindful movements&#xD;
      only in standing and sitting positions. However, the instructor explained the mindful&#xD;
      movements in lying position and encouraged the participants to practice them at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Participants in the control group continued their usual caregiving activities.&#xD;
      At 3 months after completion follow-up surveys, they received the &quot;Mindful Way Workbook&quot; and&#xD;
      were offered the opportunity to attend the same tele-MBCT training after the study ended.&#xD;
