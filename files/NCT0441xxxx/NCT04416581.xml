  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of P-CAB (tegoprazan 50&#xD;
      mg once daily) as compared with PPI (rabeprazole 20 mg once daily) for protection of GI&#xD;
      events in patients with cardiovascular disease receiving antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy who are at high GI bleeding risk. The primary hypothesis is that P-CAB (experimental&#xD;
      arm) is non-inferior to PPI (standard arm) with respect to the rate of the primary composite&#xD;
      endpoint of GI events at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, as exploratory nature, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose P-CAB&#xD;
      (tegoprazan 25 mg once daily) as compared with standard-dose P-CAB (tegoprazan 50 mg once&#xD;
      daily) and standard-dose PPI (rabeprazole 20 mg).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before randomization phase, one lead-in subject (N = 300 patients) will be enrolled to&#xD;
      perform safety surveillance of standard-dose tegoprazan (50 mg for 6 months) and to ensure&#xD;
      the safety of tegoprazan (safety surveillance phase). Data on lead-in subjects will not be&#xD;
      included in the data set used for primary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of tegoprazan will be estimated SIAEs(Special Interest Adverse Events) as follows;&#xD;
      Composite Event&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. liver function abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. hypergastrinemia, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. enteric infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver function abnormality: defined as AST or ALT&gt;3× upper limit of normal or two&#xD;
           consecutive measurements of total bilirubin &gt;2 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hypergastrinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enteric infection including C.difficile infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are any new tegoprazan-related findings, it will be considered in the estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no safety concern during safety surveillance phase, investigator-driven,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, clinical trial (N = 3,000&#xD;
      patients) will be subsequently performed (randomization phase).&#xD;

             requirement for chronic use of antithrombotic therapy (either antiplatelets or OAC).&#xD;
             Specific clinical conditions that may confer a need for long-term antithrombotic&#xD;
             therapy may include acute coronary syndrome and those with a history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization,&#xD;
             stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial&#xD;
