  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center's Community Outreach and Engagement Team&#xD;
      will implement Screen to Save 2 in two formats-traditional outreach using in-person fairs and&#xD;
      an online format. The education in both formats will be based on a set of key messages that&#xD;
      cover information about colorectal cancer, including risk factors, prevention, screening&#xD;
      recommendations, and screening options. Key messages provided by the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute will be tailored to the local context of NH and VT, including information about&#xD;
      local options for getting screened for colorectal cancer. A third arm will receive education&#xD;
      about lung cancer screening. This third arm will serve as the control arm for the first two&#xD;
      arms (the arms receiving in-person or online colorectal cancer screening education) to assess&#xD;
      study Aim 1. This third arm will also serve as an intervention arm for assessing Study Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using online or telephone surveys, some participants will be contacted approximately three&#xD;
      months after their initial participation. Some of the participants contacted after three&#xD;
      months will again be contacted another three months later (six months after initial&#xD;
      participation). The three- and six-month surveys will assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs,&#xD;
      and behaviors related to cancer screening, including outcomes from cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Implement and evaluate Screen to Save 2 outreach and educational activities to improve&#xD;
      knowledge of colorectal cancer screening methods, to increase intent to get screened for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, and connect screening services to the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Conduct cancer screening fairs in Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) 7-9 counties,&#xD;
      using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and, where feasible, coordinate with local&#xD;
      service providers to make colorectal cancer screening services available to event attendees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Utilize web-based module to conduct targeted outreach about colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and refer them to&#xD;
      locally-available screenings, healthcare provider systems, and/or healthcare coverage&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate online educational activities' ability to reach 45-74 year old current and&#xD;
      former tobacco users from rural (RUCC 7-9) counties, increase lung cancer screening knowledge&#xD;
      among that demographic, and encourage engagement with local tobacco treatment resources and&#xD;
      lung cancer screening.&#xD;
