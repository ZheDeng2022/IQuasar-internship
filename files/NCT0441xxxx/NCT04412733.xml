  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial palsy) is the most common peripheral lesion of the cranial&#xD;
      nerves and the most common mono-neuropathy. Therapeutic ultrasound (US) is among the commonly&#xD;
      used physical modalities for treating musculoskeletal disorders. The effects of US are due to&#xD;
      alteration of cell membrane activity, vascular wall permeability and facilitation of tissue&#xD;
      healing. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pulsed US treatment in&#xD;
      patients with Bell's palsy when added to superficial heating, massage and exercise therapies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this double -blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 32 patients (aged 18-65 years)&#xD;
      diagnosed as idiopathic facial palsy with appropriate criteria were included. All patients&#xD;
      were evaluated with motor nerve conduction studies and electromyography at 3-4 weeks after&#xD;
      the onset of paralysis and 3 months after the treatment. Paralytic side frontalis and&#xD;
      orbicularis oris muscles were used for electrophysiological analysis. Electrophysiological&#xD;
      examinations were performed by an experienced electromyographer who was blind to the&#xD;
      patient's treatments. Patients were separated into two groups as Group 1 (pulsed ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy) and Group 2 (sham). Both groups were undergone to a conservative treatment program&#xD;
      (20 min hot pack, massage 20 min and facial expression exercises) for 3 weeks, 5 days a week.&#xD;
      In group 1 pulsed US treatment (frequency: 1000 kHz, intensity: 0.5w/cm2, on-off ratio: 1:2,&#xD;
      duration 5 min) were applied to the paralyzed facial muscles. The patients in group 2&#xD;
      received exactly the same procedure as the treatment group, except that the power switch was&#xD;
      off. All treatments were applied for 5 days a week for 3 weeks by the same 5-cm2 head US&#xD;
      device (Enraf-Nonius Sonopuls 434) and the same physiotherapist. Patients were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, after last session, and 3 months after the treatment. Sunnybrook Facial Grading&#xD;
      System, House Brackmann Facial Grading System and Facial Disability Index and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic parameters were used for outcome evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Sunnybrook Facial Grading System is a scale used to assess facial function, and scores range from 0 (complete paralysis) to 100 (normal facial function). This scale provides a clinical score which combines a static and dynamic assessment of facial muscles with the degree of synkinesis.</description>

    <measure>Hause Brackman Facial Nerve Grading System</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hause Brackman Facial Nerve Grading System is based on a six-grade score ( I-VI) that offers a gross evaluation of facial motor function and also includes evaluation of sequelae.</description>

    <measure>Facial Disability Index</measure>
