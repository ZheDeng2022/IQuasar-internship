  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients with malignant hemopathy is based on comprehensive management. In&#xD;
      this context and faced with the various difficulties encountered by cancer patients, the&#xD;
      question of spirituality and its experience is central. Spirituality refers to the person's&#xD;
      attachment to what inspires and gives him foundation, as well as the beliefs, values, and&#xD;
      existential experiences associated with it, whether these are religious in nature or not.&#xD;
      Although the concept has been identified as a resource in the literature and widely treated&#xD;
      in an end-of-life context, assessing the needs of patients with hematological cancer and&#xD;
      their loved ones in terms of spirituality from the initiation of treatment does not has not&#xD;
      been developed&#xD;
