    <textblock>
      The success of treatment of breast cancer has improved, hence the prevalence of survivors&#xD;
      have increased. However, experienced late effects from the cancer itself or from cancer&#xD;
      treatment is substantial. Anti-cancer treatment can have a number of side effects including&#xD;
      nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anorexia and alopecia. Late effects such as cancer related fatigue&#xD;
      (CRF) are very persistent. CRF is a common side effect of cancer therapy, and affects the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and their families. It is important to point out that CRF is a&#xD;
      form of fatigue that are different from normal fatigue which everyone can experience every&#xD;
      now and then. Acupuncture is increasingly used in cancer centers both in the US and Europe,&#xD;
      and that patients are positive to using acupuncture. Albeit the emerging evidence for&#xD;
      acupuncture and CRF, acupuncture has neither been offered as a treatment for CRF within a&#xD;
      Norwegian hospital nor in general practice. Hence the investigators think there is a need for&#xD;
      a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a Norwegian health care setting.&#xD;

      Introduction Breast cancer is the most common tumour type in women worldwide. The success of&#xD;
      the treatment of breast cancer have improved hence the prevalence of survivors have increased&#xD;
      (American Cancer Society). However, experienced side effects from the cancer itself or from&#xD;
      cancer treatments is substantial. Anti-cancer treatment can have a number of side-effects&#xD;
      including nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anorexia and alopecia (1 - 3). However, some side&#xD;
      effects such as cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are very persistent. CRF is a common adverse&#xD;
      effect of cancer and cancer therapy, and effects the quality of life of the patients (4). The&#xD;
      definition of CRF from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is that it is &quot;a&#xD;
      distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness,&#xD;
      related to cancer or cancer treatment, that is not proportional to recent activity and&#xD;
      interferes with usual functioning&quot; (5). It is important to point out that CRF is a form of&#xD;
      fatigue that are different from normal fatigue which everyone can experience every now and&#xD;
      then. The symptoms of CRF is under-reported by patients and underestimated and undertreated&#xD;
      by clinicians, despite the prevalence and negative impact of CRF (6). It is recommended to&#xD;
      patients that they are screened for CRF after completion of primary treatment and that they&#xD;
      are offered specific information and strategies for management of the fatigue (7). Getting&#xD;
      CRF as a side-effect after cancer treatment can have a major impact in their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway on average 3090 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, giving a&#xD;
      incidence rate per 100 000 persons of 121,0. In 2014, 3348 patients were diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancer. The prevalence of fatigue is high in breast cancer survivors (BCS), with some&#xD;
      studies reporting as many as 50% of the patients experiencing this (8). In a meta-analysis&#xD;
      involving 12327 BCS, concluded that approximately one in four BCS suffers from severe fatigue&#xD;
      (9). Several different treatments have been recommended for CRF such as exercise,&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention, pharmacological interventions and mind-body interventions (4).&#xD;
      From several randomized trials mind-body interventions such as yoga and acupuncture has been&#xD;
      shown to relieve fatigue in cancer survivors (7). These studies, have however not focused&#xD;
      solely on BCS but included other cancer types as well (10). Acupuncture has been shown to&#xD;
      have an effect on CRF (10,11). A recent meta-analysis on CRF and acupuncture is positive (12)&#xD;
      In Norway BCS are offered treatment such as cognitive behaviour therapy, exercise, relaxation&#xD;
      techniques, yoga and nutritional coaching for their CRF. The use of acupuncture in the&#xD;
      treatment of chemotherapeutic induced nausea is well established in Norway (13), also a&#xD;
      Norwegian study on acupuncture on hot flashes in breast cancer patients has been published&#xD;
      (14). The patients are found to be positive to acupuncture (15,16). In US acupuncture seems&#xD;
      to have found its place in several hospitals which offers integrative medicine care to cancer&#xD;
      patients (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological approach A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial At the moment the study&#xD;
      group, behind this present application, is running a pilot study on fatigue in breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors with acupuncture as the intervention. This pilot study has been approved by the&#xD;
      Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK sør-øst A; reference&#xD;
      2017/2197). The purpose of conducting this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of our&#xD;
      approach that is intended to be used in the planned larger randomised controlled study. Hence&#xD;
      the design and methodological approach of the study in question wil be equal to the ongoing&#xD;
      pilot study. By doing this the investigators can evaluate the feasibility of recruitment,&#xD;
      randomization, collaboration, assessment procedures, and implementation of acupuncture. This&#xD;
      will help us also to identify, revisions, if any, needed in the design of the larger,&#xD;
      pragmatic randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention with the pragmatic, RCT is to test acupuncture as a complete treatment package,&#xD;
      i.e. including the therapeutic relationship and expectation, and address the important&#xD;
      question of the overall effect of acupuncture-care, which is highly relevant to breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors experiencing CRF. This question concerning the overall effect of acupuncture is&#xD;
      also of importance for their health care providers and health authorities in general. As such&#xD;
      a pragmatic trial will help users choose between options for care, and ''explanatory'' to&#xD;
      describe trials that test causal research hypotheses (i.e., that a given intervention causes&#xD;
      a particular benefit).Further, a pragmatic trials are primarily designed to determine the&#xD;
      effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it will be applied, whereas&#xD;
      explanatory trials are primarily designed to determine the effects of an intervention under&#xD;
      ideal circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment includes sociodemographic data, medical and gynaecological history,&#xD;
      previous experience with acupuncture, which other self-provided and therapist-provided&#xD;
      interventions they have used earlier to relieve fatigue, current use of drugs and dietary&#xD;
      supplements, level of physical activity, smoking status and level of alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each treatment session the acupuncturists ask specifically about, and record, any adverse&#xD;
      events that have occurred during or after the last treatment, and adverse event forms are&#xD;
      filled in at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue, and the severity of it, will be measured at inclusion/baseline, just after&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment. This will be measured after 12 weeks after the inclusion in the&#xD;
      control group; thereafter in both groups at 6 months after baseline evaluation. All secondary&#xD;
      measurements will be measured at the same time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment Women between 18-60 yrs who are defined as breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors by their respective cancer hospital will be invited to take part in the study.To&#xD;
      achieve a homogenues group of participants an important inclusion criteria be that they are&#xD;
      treated with Tamoxifen. The potential participants will be given written information about&#xD;
      the study - no further information will be given by the health personnell at the hospital. If&#xD;
      they want to participate, after reading the information, the participants have to sign the&#xD;
      paper and send it to Kristiania University College/AcuBreast study by a pre addressed and&#xD;
      stamped envelope. Thereafter the research team will contact the potential participants. Women&#xD;
      who are interested in participating, will than register their fatigue on a Visual Analog Pain&#xD;
      Scale (VAS); women scoring ≥4 will be eligible. Participants will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      needle phobia; low platelet count (&lt;50 000); co-morbidity with a bleeding disorder;&#xD;
      co-morbidity with thyroid dysfunction; planned to be pregnant during the study period or&#xD;
      present pregnant; haemoglobin levels &lt;10 g/dl and haematocrit &lt;30; anaemia on active&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment or receiving blood transfusion or steroids, and life expectancy &lt;6&#xD;
      months. In addition, lymphoedematous limbs are excluded from needling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Our collaborating statistician from the University of Bergen, will prepare the&#xD;
      randomisation database and acts as a central randomisation service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture group The women randomized to acupuncture treatment will receive 12 acupuncture&#xD;
      treatments during 8-12 weeks. The participating acupuncturists must have finished their&#xD;
      Bachelor degree in acupuncture at least 5 years ago and they will be members of the &quot;The&#xD;
      Norwegian Acupuncture Association&quot;. The form of acupuncture used in this trial will be based&#xD;
      upon theories from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The diagnostic process in TCM is&#xD;
      complex and unique. It is a procedure that guides the practitioners to establish for&#xD;
      themselves a correct treatment according to their theoretical knowledge and clinical&#xD;
      experience within Chinese medicine. Taking a medical history according to TCM theories, match&#xD;
      somehow the experience of a ''lived body.'' Hence added to the acupuncture treatment, there&#xD;
      could be given relevant advices in relation to diet, exercise, rest and sex. Such advices are&#xD;
      common within TCM; all advices given would be registered within the study in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Our control group will do &quot;business as usual&quot;. Hence they will continue with&#xD;
      their usual care for their CRF. By inclusion in the pilot study and by the end of it, the&#xD;
      participants in the control group will fill in the requested and similar instruments as the&#xD;
      participants in the acupuncture group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of acupuncture and special procedures for our patient group. Acupuncture in general&#xD;
      has been reported to be safe in the hands of well-educated acupuncturists (17-19). Special&#xD;
      precautions have been described for treating cancer patients with acupuncture (20). Avoid&#xD;
      needling the arm of patients who have undergone axillary dissection, the same applies for any&#xD;
      lymphedematous limbs. Possible participants with low platelet count; comorbidity with a&#xD;
      bleeding disorder or are planning pregnancy within the study period will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All analyses will be conducted blinded to group allocation. The primary&#xD;
      analysis is intention-to-treat, comparing mean changes from baseline to end of treatment&#xD;
      after 12 weeks in the two groups, using a two-sample t-test. In the presence of meaningful&#xD;
      baseline differences, analysis of covariance will be employed. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      data will be somewhat right-skewed, therefore analyses will be checked after appropriate data&#xD;
      conversion, and also checked using non-parametric methods. Secondary analyses will compare&#xD;
      the changes at different time points. Secondary measures will be analyzed using appropriate&#xD;
      parametric or non-parametric methods. Subgroup analyses include per-protocol analyses to&#xD;
      assess efficacy of acupuncture care, and comparison of changes in fatigue scores among women&#xD;
      grouped by TCM syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and safety monitoring The study is performed according to the Helsinki declaration and&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice requirements. Application for approval of the studies will be sent to&#xD;
      the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK sør-øst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination and communications strategy The investigators will utilize dissemination and&#xD;
      public outreach to boost the impact of the work in the research project. Scientific results&#xD;
      will be published in high-impact journals, and results will be presented on national and&#xD;
      international scientific meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project management Professor Terje Alraek, at Kristiania University College, Institute of&#xD;
      Health Sciences, has worked within the field of acupuncture for more than 30 years. First and&#xD;
      still as a clinician and from 1994 has he been involved in research on acupuncture. He has&#xD;
      during his research initiated, been invited to and developed several international groups of&#xD;
      researcher with interest in acupuncture. Alraek and the foreign members of the established&#xD;
      research group have published a substantial amount of scientific papers and they have also&#xD;
      published many books in relation to all the problems of doing research on such a complex&#xD;
      intervention as acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team are happy to have managed to have one national- and two important&#xD;
      international cancer centers as collaborating partners on this project. Our collaborating&#xD;
      partners in US besides being researchers, are also experienced clinicians in treating&#xD;
      breastcancer survivors with acupuncture for fatigue at their respective centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User involvement The user representative has a special responsibility for ensuring that the&#xD;
      research is in line with the preferences, values and needs of breast cancer patients&#xD;
      suffering from CRF.&#xD;
