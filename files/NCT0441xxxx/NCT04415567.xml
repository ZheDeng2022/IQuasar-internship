  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-risk patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suffer&#xD;
      from a high ratio of recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Lenvatinib, as a novel&#xD;
      targeted drug, has shown an excellent effect in the treatment of advanced HCC, but there is&#xD;
      no study on its effect in preventing HCC recurrence in the patients undergoing&#xD;
      transplantation. Therefore, to evaluate the role of adjuvant lenvatinib in preventing&#xD;
      recurrence of high-risk LT recipients with HBV-related HCC, the investigators retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzed 23 high-risk patients consisting of lenvatinib group (n=14) and control group (n=9)&#xD;
      with HBV-related HCC who underwent LT. Disease-free survival (DFS) and HCC recurrence of the&#xD;
      two groups were compared. The adverse events (AEs) and drug tolerance of lenvatinib were&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed 23 Chinese HCC patients with HBV infection, who&#xD;
      underwent LT in our hospital from June 2018 to December 2019. All donor grafts were allocated&#xD;
      by the China Organ Transplant Response System. All these patients were diagnosed by histology&#xD;
      and were defined as &quot;high-risk&quot; for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were divided into lenvatinib group and control group according to their&#xD;
      willingness to take lenvatinib as adjuvant therapy after LT. Of the 23 patients, 14 pantients&#xD;
      in lenvatinib group began to take lenvatinib about a month after LT except for routine&#xD;
      treatment, while the other 9 patients in control group received routine treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up after transplantation. Clinical data and demographic characteristics was obtained.&#xD;
      This study was conducted according to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine&#xD;
      (No. XHEC-D-2020-068). All patients enrolled in this study provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usage of lenvatinib and immunosuppressants The participants in lenvatinib group received oral&#xD;
      lenvatinib (Eisai, Japan) 12 mg/day (for bodyweight (BW) ≥60 kg) or 8 mg/day (for BW &lt;60 kg)&#xD;
      in 28-day cycles until HCC recurrence or serious adverse events (SAEs) or voluntary&#xD;
      withdrawal. Dose interruptions followed by reductions for lenvatinib-related toxicities (to 8&#xD;
      mg and 4 mg/day, or 4 mg every other day) were permitted. All 14 patients took lenvatinib for&#xD;
      more than 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction immunosuppression strategies for all participants enrolled in the study&#xD;
      involved IV infusion of 20mg of basiliximab within 2 hours prior to operation and a second&#xD;
      dose 4 days later, oral tacrolimus started on the fourth day after LT at a dose of 0.04mg/kg&#xD;
      (BW) and adjusted according to its plasma concentration, taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)&#xD;
      from the next day after surgery at a dose of 500mg/kg(BW), and rapid withdrawal of&#xD;
      glucocorticoids with the initial dose of 500mg. Maintenance immunosuppression which was&#xD;
      started about one month after LT included sirolimus (4 mg/M2 per day) plus oral tacrolimus&#xD;
      with the plasma concentration maintained at 5-8 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed up monthly within six months after LT and every three months&#xD;
      within two years. During each follow-up, complete blood count, urinalysis, serum AFP level,&#xD;
      liver and kidney function test, and blood concentration of FK506 were recorded. Chest and&#xD;
      abdominal computed tomography was implemented at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually&#xD;
      thereafter. Other radiological examinations such as radionuclide bone scan, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) were obtained when local&#xD;
      recurrence or distant metastasis was suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DFS was defined as the period between the day of LT and the day of HCC recurrence&#xD;
      confirmed by imaging, while the OS was defined as the duration from LT to death of patients&#xD;
      for any reason or to end of follow-up. Common terminology criteria for adverse events version&#xD;
      5.0 (CTCAE V5.0) was used to assess the AE during oral administration of lenvatinib. The&#xD;
      FK506 dosage and blood concentration of each patients in the first six months after liver LT&#xD;
      was recorded for evaluate the influence of lenvatinib on the immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean and standard deviations were used for descriptive statistics. The patient&#xD;
      characteristics in each group were compared by one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests. Repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis of variances was used for comparing the difference of FK506 dosage and&#xD;
      blood concentration between two groups. The OS and DFS were statistically analyzed by the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      were performed using SPSS software Version 10.0.&#xD;
