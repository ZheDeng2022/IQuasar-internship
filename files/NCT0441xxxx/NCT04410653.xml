  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of patients with advanced solid tumors enrolled in&#xD;
      the NCT/DKTK MASTER (Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research) program&#xD;
      revealed recurrent NRG1 fusions in a substantial proportion of patients with KRAS wild-type&#xD;
      (KRASwt) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and a case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      appendix. NRG1 rearrangements drive tumor development through ERBB receptor-mediated&#xD;
      signaling, as evidenced by objective response to ERBB inhibition in two cases of&#xD;
      NRG1-rearranged PDAC in the MASTER cohort. Recently, NRG1 fusions have also been identified&#xD;
      as a therapeutic target in a substantial number of the invasive mucinous subtype of lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (IMA) as well as in cholangiocellular carcinoma and, at low incidence, other&#xD;
      tumor entities, suggesting oncogenic properties across a broader spectrum of malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this phase II clinical trial, the investigators aim to investigate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      pan-ERBB inhibitor afatinib in advanced-stage NRG1-rearranged malignancies across all tumor&#xD;
      entities following progression on standard therapy. Due to the enrichment of&#xD;
      NRG1-rearrangements observed in KRASwt PDAC and IMA, two separate study arms will focus on&#xD;
      these tumor entities while a third arm will allow inclusion of patients with any other NRG1&#xD;
      rearranged malignancy. Recruitment of adequate patient numbers in this well-defined molecular&#xD;
      subgroup will be achieved by a multicenter approach including all DKTK partner sites and&#xD;
      on-site pre-screening of PDAC for KRAS mutational status. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      identified by in-depth molecular characterization of tumors within the NCT/DKTK MASTER&#xD;
      program or identification of a NRG1-rearranged tumor by another method for fusion detection&#xD;
      (e.g. gene fusion panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NRG1-rearranged tumors fulfilling eligibility criteria will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in the trial and receive afatinib monotherapy until tumor progression or&#xD;
      discontinuation for other reasons. To assess mechanisms of secondary resistance and to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical impact of liquid biopsies in this setting, blood samples for exome&#xD;
      sequencing will be taken prior to initiation of the study treatment as well as at the time of&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
