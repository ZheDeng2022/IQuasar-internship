  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the trial is to evaluate the activity and tolerability of the anti PD1 agent&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in combination with RadioTherapy for the initial treatment of previously&#xD;
      untreated patients with limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma who are not eligible to&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll 30 patients in chinese sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated with standard radiotherapy and concurrent pembrolizumab&#xD;
      administered intravenously every 3 weeks. After 6 cycles of pembrolizumab patients with&#xD;
      complete remission, partial response and stable disease will continue with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      maintenance up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up to 4 years from treatment start.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, phase II, open label, single arm, multicentric clinical trial to&#xD;
      be conducted in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the efficacy of concurrent RT-Pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma and who are not eligible to receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to further explore the efficacy and safety of a the combination&#xD;
      of RT and Pembrolizumab as initial treatment of the patients population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated with standard IFRT and concurrent pembrolizumab&#xD;
      administered intravenously, over 30 minutes starting on day 1 of RT (C1D1, at the dose of 200&#xD;
      mg, every 3 weeks). After 6 cycles of pembrolizumab patients will undergo restaging imaging.&#xD;
      Patients with complete remission (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) will&#xD;
      continue with pembrolizumab maintenance up to 2 years that will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously, at the dose of 200 mg, over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks up to 34 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will last up to 4 years from treatment start.&#xD;
