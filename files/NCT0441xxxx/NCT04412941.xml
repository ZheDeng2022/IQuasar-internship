  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Obstructive Sleep Apnea is characterized by obstruction of the upper airway during sleep&#xD;
      (for at least 10 sec), with repeated breathing pauses, accompanied by oxygen desaturation in&#xD;
      the blood and by sleep interruption with repeated arousals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that good sleep hygiene, the execution of respiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercises, with specific myofascial exercises on the muscles that are&#xD;
      compromised in the Obstructive Sleep Apnea, can improve the patient's clinical outcome and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of respiratory rehabilitation with&#xD;
      myo-functional exercises in mild obstructive sleep.&#xD;

      Patients: Eligible patients aged between 40 and 80 years old, with BMI &lt; 30 and with a recent&#xD;
      diagnosis of mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea evaluated with home night cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude patients with one or more of the following conditions:&#xD;
      subjects who regularly use hypnoinductive drugs, with craniofacial malformations, who have&#xD;
      suffered recent facial trauma, suffering from hypothyroidism, suffering from neuromuscular&#xD;
      diseases, with recent strokes, severe obstructive nasal disease, systemic infectious diseases&#xD;
      and neoplastic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home night cardio-respiratory monitoring: all patients will be evaluated according to&#xD;
      international guidelines (AAMS American Academy Sleep Medicine) with an instrument equipped&#xD;
      with sensors for detection oral/nasal flow, snoring, chest/abdomen movements, pulse oximetry&#xD;
      and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire: The investigators will employ questionnaires validated in Italy: Snoring&#xD;
      frequency (derived from the Berlin questionnaire); subjective daytime sleepiness (Epworth&#xD;
      questionnaire); quality of sleep (Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups randomly with a 1: 1 ratio: group 1 (treated&#xD;
      group) or group 2 (control group) for a total of 20 patients per group (according to the&#xD;
      sample size calculation reported in the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will be subjected to an integrated rehabilitation protocol, composed of&#xD;
      Respiratory rehabilitation exercises with diaphragmatic breathing, thoracic mobilization&#xD;
      exercises and manual pompage techniques, followed by manual trigger point therapy techniques,&#xD;
      (that were identified by palpation following the guidelines provided by Travell and Simons&#xD;
      trigger point manual), the accessory inspiratory muscles like pectoralis minor muscle,&#xD;
      scapula elevator muscle, Sternocleidomastoid muscle. The integrated rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
      will be 45 minutes, 3 weekly sessions for 4 weeks, for a total of 12 consecutive sessions.&#xD;
      Also, at every patient will be taught oropharyngeal exercises to perform at home twice a day&#xD;
      (the duration of 15 minutes each session) involving in particular exercises for soft palate,&#xD;
      tongue, facial and genio-glosso muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both in the treated group and the control group will be given a booklet with the rules for&#xD;
      proper sleep hygiene because sleep is influenced by our lifestyle and various environmental&#xD;
      factors can affect the quality of night sleep.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>AHI is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Berlin Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>it consists of 3 categories related to the risk of sleep apnea (1-severity of snoring, 2- excessive daytime sleepiness, 3-history of obesity or high blood pressure). Depending on the answers and therefore the reported symptoms, it allows a subdivision in high risk or low risk of having apneas;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>it is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness with a short questionnaire; the answers range from normal (0) to intense (3) in eight different situations; a total score greater than 10 is considered excessive daytime sleepiness</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep questionnaires, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. Evaluate seven sleep items on a scale of 0 to 3, 0 indicating no difficulty and 3 indicating severe difficulty. The results are expressed in an overall score (between 0 and 21). Values above 5 are consistent with poor sleep quality.</description>
