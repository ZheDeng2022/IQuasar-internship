  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a frequent disorder in children&#xD;
      and adolescents. The diagnosis is clinical with the input of several informants (child,&#xD;
      family, teachers, …). ADHD is a risk factor for academic difficulties, school dropout, social&#xD;
      isolation, injury, oppositional behaviour. In school-age children and adolescents having&#xD;
      moderate to high or persistent impairment despite psycho-educational support and&#xD;
      environmental modification, the first-line treatment is methylphenidate. Group or individual&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy for parents and/or children and adolescents is recommended for&#xD;
      co-occurring disorders and persistent impairment. In France, the initiation of&#xD;
      methylphenidate requires an annual hospital prescription by a paediatrician or psychiatrist,&#xD;
      and a regular medical supervision (weight, heart rate, blood pressure, …). At least once a&#xD;
      year, the indication of methyphenidate needs to be re-evaluated and confirmed at the&#xD;
      hospital. In case of lack of efficiency and/or poor tolerance, therapeutic alternatives&#xD;
      including non-psychostimulants should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial evaluated the dose of methylphenidate received over a period of&#xD;
      13 months. It was observed that the &quot;combined treatment&quot; group (methylphenidate +&#xD;
      psychosocial treatments) received a lower average dose of methylphenidate than the&#xD;
      &quot;methylphenidate alone&quot; group. These results are difficult to extrapolate to the general&#xD;
      population, due to the study protocol (regular monitoring of ADHD symptoms with the aim of&#xD;
      total remission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a global consideration of children's needs, it is important to better understand the&#xD;
      interactions between these two therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in the study, parents will have to complete an online questionnaire. This&#xD;
      questionnaire contains anamnestic data collection, questionnaires to assess ADHD symptoms and&#xD;
      parenting practices.&#xD;
