  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of asthma attacks on&#xD;
      the lives of patients who experience them. This will help us to describe the true extent of&#xD;
      the impact of asthma attacks on factors of importance to patients which have not previously&#xD;
      been well described, including the psychological, social, financial and emotional burden of&#xD;
      asthma attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it is hoped that detailed questioning regarding features of asthma attacks from&#xD;
      a patient perspective will improve our understanding of patient recognition of attacks,&#xD;
      consistency of certain features of attacks and patient views regarding preventative&#xD;
      strategies for attacks. Patient experiences of asthma attacks are poorly described in&#xD;
      previous research. Hence this work is expected to provide useful insights into these&#xD;
      experiences which will contribute to improvements in detecting, treating and preventing&#xD;
      asthma attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a one-off interview lasting about 45 minutes with patients who have&#xD;
      recently had asthma attacks. We plan to recruit patients for the study from an outpatient&#xD;
      clinic for those who have had a recent attack or from a register of patients who have&#xD;
      volunteered for future asthma research studies. The interviews will take place in person at&#xD;
      the Respiratory Research Unit at the Nottingham City Hospital or over the telephone depending&#xD;
      on patient preference.&#xD;
