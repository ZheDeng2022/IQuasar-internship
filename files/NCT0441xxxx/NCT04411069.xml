  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous history of nausea and vomiting induced by prior chemotherapy still not included as&#xD;
      predictive factor of postoperative nausea and vomiting, although has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      has influence in postoperative outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to evaluate the efficacy of a simplified algorithm in prevention&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting , with pacients with previous history of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting induced by prior chemotherapy, submitted to medium or large surgery.&#xD;

      Quasi-experimental study, with evaluation after the application of a specific postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting prevention algorithm for cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Team training. In this phase, a protocol was established for PONV prophylaxis, using&#xD;
      two questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient undergoing chemotherapy before surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient presented chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the answer is yes to both questions, the anesthetist administers 3 antiemetics (4mg&#xD;
      dexametasone, 4mg ondansetron and 0,625mg droperidol). If the answer is no to one of the&#xD;
      questions, the anesthetist administers 2 antiemetics (4mg dexametasone and 4mg ondansetron);&#xD;
      In this phase, educational measures will be implemented by team meetings and individual&#xD;
      approach of all anesthesiologists at ICESP to present the study project and the algorithm. A&#xD;
      summary of the the study will be sent daily through the social network Whats App®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients was calculated taking into account adherence to the new prophylaxis&#xD;
      protocol for post-operative nausea and vomiting. If we consider an alpha error of 5% and test&#xD;
      power of 80%, to have a NVPO reduction of 41% (current overall incidence) to 25% (incidence&#xD;
      after protocol adherence) in high-risk patients, we need to study 270 patients (135 each&#xD;
      group adherence and non-adherence to the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Post-training assessment. In the second phase of the study, after the end of the&#xD;
      dissemination of the protocol among doctors, the patients will be evaluated on the first&#xD;
      postoperative day. The following variables were analyzed: sex, race, age, body mass index,&#xD;
      general state of American Society of Anesthesiologist, Apfel scale, type of surgery and&#xD;
      anesthesia, use and type of opioids, history of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      type of antiemetics used in the operating room and in the first postoperative day, duration&#xD;
      of anesthesia and surgery and nausea and vomiting in 6 and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
