      Investigation of efficacy and tolerability of bezlotoxumab in patients with cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      in terms of preventing CDI recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be prospective, open-label, single center with historical control. All&#xD;
      procedures will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the&#xD;
      provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval of Institutional Review Board at Cooper&#xD;
      Health Care will be obtained prior to commencing the study and actively enrolled patients&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent form. Data will be collected on a case report form and&#xD;
      confidentiality will be protected according to laws and regulations. Study population will&#xD;
      include adult cancer patients diagnosed with CDI being treated at MD Anderson cancer center&#xD;
      affiliated with Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ, USA. The comparison arm will be a&#xD;
      historical group of patients treated at the same center with same inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria within the previous 3 years of start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited patients will receive a single dose of Bezlotoxumab (Zinplava) 10mg/kg (actual body&#xD;
      weight) 60-minute intravenous infusion during active CDI treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pharmacoeconomic analysis, data collected from the financial department will include&#xD;
      total hospitalization costs, drug costs, length of stay, total amount charged and total&#xD;
      amount reimbursedpertaining to CDI diagnosis code/ICD-10 for recurrent CDI. The analysis will&#xD;
      encompass the perspectives of the hospital and the third party payer. Adjustment of&#xD;
      retrospective cost data will be performed using Medical Consumer Price index (MCPI) inflation&#xD;
      rates established by Bureau of Labor Statistics. Cost-avoidance analysis will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the cost of preventing recurrence. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)&#xD;
      defined as the difference in cost divided by difference in outcomes will be reported. The&#xD;
      outcome being examined, the percent of recurrences avoided, will be used in the denominator.&#xD;
      Graphically, a cost-effectiveness plane will be used to depict the comparison. Secondary&#xD;
      analyses will examine specific differences between groups, including total drug costs, length&#xD;
      of stay (LOS) and per diem hospitalization costs. Univariate sensitivity analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine robustness of the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching of intervention group with control will be based on inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      sex, and GEIH-CDI propensity score as shown in the table below. Matching will be in the ratio&#xD;
      of 1:2. Selected historical control based on inclusion/exclusion criteria will matched to&#xD;
      same sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated at MD Anderson cancer center affiliated with Cooper University Hospital&#xD;
      Camden, NJ, USA with diagnosis of CDI will be screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be approached for consent. Recruited patients will receive the study&#xD;
      intervention either as in-patients or at the out-patient infusion unit according to their&#xD;
      current status. The study patients will be followed for 12 weeks (day1 is the day of study&#xD;
      intervention) on week1, week2, week 4, week 8 and week 12 (- or + 5 days) until study exit&#xD;
      day. Study required clinical data will be collected from medical records on case report form.&#xD;
      Financial data will be acquired from accounting department records. Recruited patients will&#xD;
      be interviewed on the phone or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention drug will be stored at the Pharmacy Department, Cooper University&#xD;
      Hospital. Shortly before the time of administration, infusion will be prepared as per&#xD;
      manufacturer instructions (250 mL infused over 1 hours through 0.22-micron sterile filter&#xD;
      controlled by volumetric pump) and transported for administration per the hospital protocol.&#xD;
      Patients receiving bezolotoxumab infusion will be under observation and follow up as per&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess recurrence, clinical cure is achieved in patients receiving standard of care&#xD;
      treatment and have no diarrhea (&lt; 3 bowel movements per day) for 2 consecutive days following&#xD;
      completion of therapy. Patients will be followed by reviewing medical records, in person and&#xD;
      by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of bezolotoxumab will be assessed by collecting clinical and laboratory data&#xD;
      about adverse events as detailed below under adverse experience reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10-mL blood sample will be collected from patients in heparinized tubes (processed and/or&#xD;
      stored as required by the lab) for genetic DNA profiling. An an assessment of bezlotoxumab&#xD;
      efficacy and the correlation with the SNP will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from the study will be voluntary or at the discretion of investigators/sponsor in&#xD;
      case of tolerability concerns, protocol violation or any other reason.&#xD;
