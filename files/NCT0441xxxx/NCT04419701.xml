      Effective pain relief allows the patients to obtain early knee mobilization and optimal&#xD;
      rehabilitation and thus improves the patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of perioperative pain control is to minimize delays in recovery, postoperative&#xD;
      delirium and pain-related stress responses that can lead to serious morbidity and poor&#xD;
      outcomes. Numerous approaches to effectively control postoperative pain in TKA patients have&#xD;
      been evaluated, as poorly controlled acute postoperative pain can be associated with&#xD;
      persistent pain. Furthermore, increased pain intensity after surgery on the second knee seems&#xD;
      to be closely associated with chronic post-TKA pain, with similar mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      hyperalgesia or chronic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), one of the most commonly performed operations in orthopaedic&#xD;
      department, has been a successful intervention for patients with end-stage knee arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) routinely starts immediately after surgery&#xD;
      on the postoperative ward and therefore requires adequate analgesia. An ideal analgesic&#xD;
      modality for post-TKA rehabilitation should permit adequate knee flexion with minimal pain&#xD;
      without motor impairment, resulting in successful mobilization. Pain control plays an&#xD;
      essential role in the overall postoperative period for the patients undergoing TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pain relief allows the patients to obtain early knee mobilization and optimal&#xD;
      rehabilitation and thus improves the patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of perioperative pain control is to minimize delays in recovery, postoperative&#xD;
      delirium and pain-related stress responses that can lead to serious morbidity and poor&#xD;
      outcomes. Numerous approaches to effectively control postoperative pain in TKA patients have&#xD;
      been evaluated, as poorly controlled acute postoperative pain can be associated with&#xD;
      persistent pain. Furthermore, increased pain intensity after surgery on the second knee seems&#xD;
      to be closely associated with chronic post-TKA pain, with similar mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      hyperalgesia or chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the degree of knee flexion has been used as an outcome measure after TKA to&#xD;
      evaluate functional recovery and the success of the type of analgesia used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods such as intravenous opioids, extraarticular and intraarticular injection,&#xD;
      epidural analgesia and femoral or sciatic nerve blocks are currently used for postoperative&#xD;
      pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, each method is reported with potential side effects, for example, opioid drugs&#xD;
      caused vomiting, nausea, constipation, dizziness and urinary retention, epidural analgesia&#xD;
      with urinary retention, respiratory depression and spinal headache, femoral or sciatic block&#xD;
      with diminished muscle control and possible nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periarticular multimodal drug injection in TKA is a technique that patients received&#xD;
      intraoperative drug injection in the periarticular fields such as posterior capsule, medial&#xD;
      and lateral collateral ligaments, quadriceps mechanism and peripatellar tissue at the end of&#xD;
      the surgery. Multimodal drugs mainly consist of local anaesthetics, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, epinephrine with or without corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genicular nerve block (GNB) and ablation have been used for managing chronic pain from knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with good success.&#xD;
