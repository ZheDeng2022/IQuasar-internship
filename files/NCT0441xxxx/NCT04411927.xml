      Background: Chronic kidney disease is associated with comorbid conditions that result in&#xD;
      physical impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Investigate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on postural stability in&#xD;
      children compared with age matched typically developing children using Human Assessment&#xD;
      Computer (HUMAC) balance system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: An observational design (cross-sectional study). Settings: The assessment procedures&#xD;
      were conducted at the Nephrology Unit, Zagazig University Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Seventy-five children, age ranged from 8 to 15 years represented three groups&#xD;
      of equal numbers; control group (typically developed), non-dialysis (stage 3 and 4) and&#xD;
      hemodialysis group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The HUMAC balance system was used to assess the limits of stability, center&#xD;
      of pressure and sensory organization and balance.&#xD;

      Methods Study design This study is an observational cross-sectional design (prospective&#xD;
      database study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and setting Participants included children with CKD extracted from a data set of&#xD;
      731 individuals with CKD diagnoses, who receive regular medical follow-up/hemodialysis at&#xD;
      Nephrology Unit, Zagazig University Hospitals. The study was conducted from January 2018 to&#xD;
      January 2020 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Code of Ethics of the World&#xD;
      Medical Association). The study protocol was approved by the Ethical committee of the Faculty&#xD;
      of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Egypt (No.P.T.REC/012/002169). Children's&#xD;
      par-ticipation was authorized by a signed written consent form with parent's/legal guardian's&#xD;
      acceptance for participation before starting the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Fifty eligible volunteer children with CKD were recruited from Nephrology Unit,&#xD;
      Zagazig University Hospitals to be enrolled in this study and allocated into either&#xD;
      hemodialysis (on hemodialysis) or non-dialysis group (children at stage 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medically diagnosed with CKD (regardless of medical history),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ranged from eight to fifteen years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both genders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were excluded if they had:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communication problems such as intellectual disability, autism, Down syndrome, or&#xD;
           cerebral palsy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant visual or hearing problems,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any neurological and/or musculoskeletal disorders which influence postural stability,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disorders. Twenty-five volunteer typically developed&#xD;
           age matched group were enrolled as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic and clinical information Demographics and physical characteristics (age,&#xD;
      sex, weight, height) and clinical data (renal function test, recent hematology and blood&#xD;
      chemistry counts, co-morbidity, and medication) were recorded from medical reports to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study power and sample size Sample size was predestined before conducting the study by&#xD;
      G*POWER statistical software (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany; version 3.1.9.2) [F&#xD;
      tests- ANOVA: Fixed effects, one-way, α=0.05, β=0.2, and large effect size] with the number&#xD;
      of groups=3, giving a total number of 66 participants to be recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Outcome measures The Human Assessment Computer (HUMAC) Balance System, primarily being&#xD;
      part of a video game appliance (Wii Balance Board), is a distinct technology used in&#xD;
      assessment and rehabilitation of postural control. It is an affordable, portable and&#xD;
      prevalent obtainable force plate provides the patient and tester with visual feedback as well&#xD;
      as numerical data. The system displays several reporting options with objective datum&#xD;
      providing clinicians with comprehensive case progression which is used for baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up analysis with eight programs to choose from (HUMAC balance, 2017; Blosch et al.,&#xD;
      2019). The HUMAC-type technology has been found to detect more imbalances than traditional&#xD;
      tests (Merchant-Borna et al., 2017). In the current study limits of stability, COP and the&#xD;
      Clinical Test of Sensory Organization and Balance (CTSIB) were assessed. Each child in the&#xD;
      three study groups performed three trials and the mean value was estimated for each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5.1. Limits of Stability test: Limits of stability are known as the furthest distance a&#xD;
      subject is capable to shift his/her COP in different directions whilst keeping the&#xD;
      configuration of the BOS and adjust the body position. This commonly requires the use of a&#xD;
      force plate that records COP movement and a visual feedback that serves to maximize COP&#xD;
      displacement in certain directions (Lemay et al., 2014). During this test, the participant is&#xD;
      instructed to shift the round cursor on the screen (the COP) to the highlighted target. As&#xD;
      he/she remains in the target for the hold time, this target point is deactivated and should&#xD;
      move between the center targets to each surrounding target in a random order. A count-up&#xD;
      timer displays the total test time. He/she must return to the center target after each outer&#xD;
      target. The test was conducted at two levels 4 and 6. At level 4; this is considered as&#xD;
      simple test compared with level 6; the distance between center targets to each surrounding&#xD;
      target is relatively small. On the other hand, at level 6 the distance between center targets&#xD;
      to each surrounding target is larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5.2. Center of pressure test This test is used to measure the variation in a subject's COP&#xD;
      and displays his/her Right/Left and Anterior/Posterior weight distribution. In the current&#xD;
      study, the COP test variables recorded were the stability score and path length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stability test: It measures the participant's ability to stabilize his/her balance at&#xD;
           locations around their neutral position. Results are reported as the percent of time a&#xD;
           subject holds his COP in each of the eight flashing targets in clockwise order&#xD;
           (right/left and anterior/posterior weight distribution). These targets are eight&#xD;
           specific points in which the current target flashes green when the participant is&#xD;
           on-target and flashes yellow when he is off-target. The HUMAC system provides a&#xD;
           counts-down of the hold time to inform the participant when he/she should move to the&#xD;
           next target. In addition, the system provides variety of levels based on the distance&#xD;
           from the center to the farthest target.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Path length: The COP path length represents the COP displacement in which lower values&#xD;
           indicate better performance (Ju-Hyeong et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5.3. Clinical Test of Sensory Organization and Balance: It is sometimes referred as the&#xD;
      Romberg or Foam and Dome test. It is used to test how a participant's vestibular,&#xD;
      somatosensory and visual systems integrate in the conditions of open and closed eyes compared&#xD;
      to a normal population. The CTSIB protocol typically uses four conditions including eyes&#xD;
      closed soft surface (ECSS); eyes closed firm surface (ECFS); eyes open soft surface (EOSS);&#xD;
      Eye open soft surface (EOSS) and eyes open firm surface (EOFS). The participant was&#xD;
      instructed to stand in a neutral position with the arms at body sides. Each participant went&#xD;
      through a series of the four tests, which were each 30 seconds long. As participants&#xD;
      completed the test, the board monitored their COG to determine their stability and path&#xD;
      length. The requirements of the assessment were clearly demonstrated to all children. The&#xD;
      assessment procedures were administered following the HUMAC Balance System manual detailed&#xD;
      instructions. All participants performed three trials of each test, each lasting 30 seconds&#xD;
      to determine the stability score and path length.&#xD;
