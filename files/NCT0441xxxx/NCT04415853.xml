  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open trial, unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients that failed at least second-line&#xD;
      treatment and overexpressed EGFR were enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      group and control group at a 1: 1 ratio.,who received Larotinib and the chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      chosen by the investigator (Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection or Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil&#xD;
      Potassium Capsule),respecitively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are administered until disease progression assessed by the RECIST V1.1 standard&#xD;
      (unless the investigator evaluates that the subject continues to have clinical benefit from&#xD;
      continuing treatment, the subject may be allowed to continue treatment), and begins to&#xD;
      receive new anti-tumor treatment, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or&#xD;
      other conditions that meet the criteria for terminating trial treatment / withdrawal from the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research phase of this study is divided into pre-screening period (~ D-28), screening&#xD;
      period (D-28 ~ D-1), treatment period, treatment end visit (± 7 days after the last dose),&#xD;
      safety follow-up ( Until 28 ± 7 days after the last dose) and survival follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental group and the control group were administered until the disease progression&#xD;
      assessed by the RECIST V1.1 standard (unless The investigator evaluates that the subject&#xD;
      continues to have clinical benefits, and the subject can be allowed to continue receiving&#xD;
      treatment), start new anti-tumor therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw informed consent,&#xD;
      ect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research phase of this study is divided into screening period, treatment period,&#xD;
      treatment end visit, safety follow-up and survival follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have finished the screening examination and evaluation after the screening&#xD;
      period enter the treatment period, and evaluate the efficacy. Subjects who have finished the&#xD;
      treatment need to continue to undergo safety follow-up ; For subjects who have finished the&#xD;
      trial treatment due to toxic reactions or other reasons, and have not observed the&#xD;
      progression, they still need to carry out imaging evaluation according to the original&#xD;
      frequency until the occurrence of tumor progression judged by RECIST V1.1 standard, start of&#xD;
      new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or end of&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs first; all subjects receive survival follow-up until death,lost of&#xD;
      ,the follow-up or the study ended，whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK studies: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are conducted only in centers with appropriate&#xD;
      conditions. Only some subjects in the experiemtal group are required to undergo a PK study.&#xD;
      Participate in intensive PK blood collection (8-12 cases), and participate in sparse PK blood&#xD;
      collection (150 cases). Subjects participating in intensive PK blood collection do not&#xD;
      participate in sparse PK blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker research: Detect EGFR overexpression and amplification research on tumor tissue&#xD;
      samples for all subjects and explore the relationship between its efficacy and changes in&#xD;
      EGFR overexpression and amplification status before and after treatment.&#xD;
