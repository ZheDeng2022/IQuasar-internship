  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ED-SED Pilot is a multicenter, prospective, before-and-after study conducted on 344&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated emergency department patients at three academic medical centers:&#xD;
      Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO), Cooper Hospital of&#xD;
      Rowan University (Camden, NJ), and University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine (Iowa City,&#xD;
      IA). The overall goal is to assess the feasibility of implementing targeted sedation (in&#xD;
      terms of sedation depth) for mechanically ventilated ED patients in order to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of unnecessary deep sedation and improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      The ED-SED Pilot is a multicenter, prospective, before-and-after study conducted on 344&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated ED patients at three academic medical centers. Patients in the before&#xD;
      phase of the study will receive usual care after the initiation of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      After 172 patients have been enrolled in the before phase, the investigators will begin&#xD;
      educational initiatives to implement ED-based sedation protocols and order sets. The research&#xD;
      team will educate providers on the importance of sedation protocols on patient outcome so&#xD;
      that the existing protocols begin to be used effectively in the ED. This educational&#xD;
      initiative will allow targeted sedation to be effectively used in the ED as well, allowing&#xD;
      the intervention to be tested under real-world conditions. Participants in the after phase&#xD;
      will also receive standard post-intubation care at the discretion of the treating team,&#xD;
      though it will be after the educational initiative aimed at improving post-intubation&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to more effectively use sedation in the ED, the investigators will collect voluntary&#xD;
      and anonymous surveys from ED nurses and physicians to assess the potential facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers to adherence to guideline-recommended sedation.&#xD;
