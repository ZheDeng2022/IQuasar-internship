  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has emerged as a clinically relevant&#xD;
      predictive and prognostic biomarker in several metastatic solid malignancies, and even now&#xD;
      represents standard-of-care for prescription of some targeted therapies in non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (blood-based T790M companion diagnostic test). cfDNA can be detected not only in&#xD;
      plasma but also in urine, even in patients with non-invasive disease. Recent studies found&#xD;
      that the detection of genomic alterations in plasma of urothelial bladder carcinoma patients&#xD;
      was relatively uninformative in the localized setting. However, urine cfDNA has been shown to&#xD;
      provide a promising resource for robust whole-genome tumor profiling in clinically localized&#xD;
      Muscle invasive Bladder cancer (MIBC) and Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). Genomic&#xD;
      alterations using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel have been recently&#xD;
      documented in a series of treatment-naïve high-risk NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's aim is to determine whether liquid biopsies can be used as a new&#xD;
      diagnostic assay to guide immunotherapeutic approaches in patients with high-risk NMIBC. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to develop a &quot;testing decision tree&quot; to segment patients for informing on&#xD;
      therapeutic decision and customizing treatment.&#xD;

        The study population concerns :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 1 : patients with high-risk NMIBC treated by BCG therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 2 : patients with MIBC treated by radical cystectomy. This group will be&#xD;
             considered as a positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        During their conventional follow-up, a urine collection will be performed to each patient&#xD;
        for testing of cell-free DNA. Genomic analysis of the primary tumor will be carried out on&#xD;
        the tumor samples resetced during the initial diagnosis.&#xD;
