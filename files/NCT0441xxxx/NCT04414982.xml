  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to reduce the effects of stereotype threat on the adherence of&#xD;
      American Indian/Alaska Native patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study, which employs a values affirmation intervention, are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effects of the values-affirmation exercise with a control exercise in AI/AN&#xD;
           patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effects of the values-affirmation exercise in AI/AN patients with its&#xD;
           effects in white patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in the U.S. bear a disproportionate burden of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. They have a higher prevalence of conditions that predispose to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and poorer outcomes after developing cardiovascular disease than white&#xD;
      Americans. The causes of these differences are complex and multiple, but there are widespread&#xD;
      concerns that racial bias contributes to the problem. As concluded over a decade ago in the&#xD;
      2003 Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, &quot;Racial/ethnic disparities in health&#xD;
      care occur in the context of broader historic and contemporary social and economic inequality&#xD;
      and evidence of persistent racial and ethnic discrimination… Bias, stereotyping and prejudice&#xD;
      on the part of healthcare providers may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health&#xD;
      care.&quot; These concerns persist. Minority group members are well aware of negative stereotypes&#xD;
      targeted at them as a group and of the possibility of bias directed at them as individuals.&#xD;
      Given the reality of prejudice and their previous experiences with it, it is understandable&#xD;
      that minority group members would be apprehensive about the possibility of being judged in&#xD;
      light of the stereotype, both outside and inside the healthcare system. Critically, this&#xD;
      apprehension may occur in the absence of actual bias. This raises the possibility that&#xD;
      interventions directed at patients' perception of discrimination may have an independent and&#xD;
      additive effect beyond the effects of interventions directed at provider bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to evaluate a novel intervention that reduces the detrimental effects&#xD;
      of negative stereotypes on minority patients by reducing stereotype threat through values-&#xD;
      affirmation. Stereotype threat is a stressful psychological state that occurs when a person&#xD;
      fears being judged in light of negative stereotypes. The stress of this situation and the&#xD;
      pressure to avoid confirming negative stereotypes can result in impaired performance and&#xD;
      worse outcomes - something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, an American Indian&#xD;
      patient fearful of confirming the stereotype of being unintelligent may fail to ask for&#xD;
      clarification of changes in antihypertensive medications and, based on misconceptions,&#xD;
      persist in taking an old regimen that is ineffective. Values-affirmation is a process in&#xD;
      which global sense of personal worth is strengthened in the face of a threat, making&#xD;
      individuals better able to cope with psychological threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention proposed in this application is based on one found to be effective in&#xD;
      alleviating stereotype threat in other contexts such as education and in alleviating more&#xD;
      general threats to the self in a health context as well as in a prior study investigators&#xD;
      performed with African American patients. Investigators will randomly assign AI/AN patients&#xD;
      with hypertension to complete an affirmation exercise or a control exercise prior to a visit&#xD;
      with their providers. The affirmation exercise is performed immediately before a clinic&#xD;
      visit. It asks patients to reflect on values or self-defining skills that they find&#xD;
      important, and to write a few sentences about why one of them is important. The project is&#xD;
      innovative in that it is directed against a mechanism, stereotype threat, not generally&#xD;
      recognized as important in healthcare settings. Since the intervention is brief and easily&#xD;
      applied across a wide range of health conditions, it directly addresses the need for&#xD;
      interventions to be generalizable and sustainable.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Antihypertensive Medication Adherence using Pharmacy Records</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This antihypertensive medication adherence outcome will be a summary measure of adherence which assesses the proportion of days covered (PDC) over the period of observation for which a patient obtains antihypertensive medications. Adherence will be calculated for each antihypertensive drug in the regimen and combined across drugs into a summary measure of adherence for the entire drug regimen.</description>

    <measure>Change in Antihypertensive Medication Adherence using Self-Reported Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This antihypertensive medication adherence outcome will be a summary measure of self-reported adherence using the validated Voils instrument, which has 3 questions that address adherence over the previous 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Change in Antihypertensive Medication Adherence using Pill Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This antihypertensive medication adherence outcome will be a summary outcome measure of adherence where if x is the number of pills in the bottle, y is the number of pills that would have been in the bottle had all pills been taken since the bottle was filled, and z is the number of pills that should have been taken since the last fill, and adherence is calculated as 1- [(x-y)/z].</description>
