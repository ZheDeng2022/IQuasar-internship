  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of intensive care unit (ICU)-based palliative care is highly variable,&#xD;
      particularly for the 2 million older adults admitted annually to ICUs. To address these care&#xD;
      delivery barriers among older ICU patients, a mobile app platform called PCplanner&#xD;
      (Palliative Care planner) was developed. PCplanner automates the identification of high-risk&#xD;
      patients (e.g., dementia, declining health status, poor functioning) by directly capturing&#xD;
      data from electronic health record (EHR) systems, cultivates family engagement with&#xD;
      supportive information and a digital system for self-report of actual needs, and facilitates&#xD;
      the delivery of care to those with a high burden of need by coordinating collaboration&#xD;
      between ICU teams and palliative care specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 patients, 150 family caregivers, and 75 physicians from academic and community settings&#xD;
      will be enrolled in a RCT designed to test the efficacy of PCplanner-augmented collaborative&#xD;
      palliative care vs usual care. Family caregiver and clinician experiences will be explored&#xD;
      using mixed methods to understand intervention mechanisms as well as implementation barriers&#xD;
      within diverse case contexts. The key hypothesis is that compared to usual care, PCplanner&#xD;
      will reduce family caregivers' unmet needs and psychological distress, increase the frequency&#xD;
      of goal concordant treatment among older adult patients, and reduce hospital length of stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of intensive care unit (ICU)-based palliative care is highly variable,&#xD;
      particularly for the 2 million older adults admitted annually to ICUs. However, improving&#xD;
      care quality on a broad scale with the efficient delivery of patient-centered, need-targeted&#xD;
      palliative care is challenging because of logistical and technological barriers. To address&#xD;
      these care delivery barriers among older ICU patients, a mobile app platform called PCplanner&#xD;
      (Palliative Care planner) was developed. PCplanner automates the identification of high-risk&#xD;
      patients (e.g., dementia, declining health status, poor functioning) by directly capturing&#xD;
      data from electronic health record (EHR) systems, cultivates family engagement with&#xD;
      supportive information and a digital system for self-report of actual needs, and facilitates&#xD;
      the delivery of care to those with a high burden of need by coordinating collaboration&#xD;
      between ICU teams and palliative care specialists. In pilot comparison to a standard&#xD;
      palliative care control, the intervention reduced unmet needs, psychological distress, and&#xD;
      length of stay and increased goal concordant care, communication, and hospice utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these data are compelling, an efficacy evaluation of PCplanner is needed. Therefore,&#xD;
      150 patients, 150 family caregivers, and 75 physicians will be enrolled from academic and&#xD;
      community settings in a project with 2 key aims: (1) Test the efficacy of PCplanner-augmented&#xD;
      collaborative palliative care vs usual care in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 3-month&#xD;
      follow up, and (2) Explore family caregiver and clinician experiences using mixed methods to&#xD;
      understand intervention mechanisms as well as implementation barriers within diverse case&#xD;
      contexts. The key hypothesis is that compared to usual care, PCplanner will reduce family&#xD;
      caregivers' unmet needs and psychological distress, increase the frequency of goal concordant&#xD;
      treatment among older adult patients, and reduce hospital length of stay.&#xD;
