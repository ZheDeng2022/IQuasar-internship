      This study is designed to observe and evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the&#xD;
      anti-programmed-death-1 antibody (anti-PD-1) Triprilumab in combination with chemotherapy of&#xD;
      Gemcitabine PLUS Cisplatin in patients who were advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with&#xD;
      no chance for primary surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, also known as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, is derived&#xD;
      from intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, the second most common primary liver malignant&#xD;
      tumor in china. but most (60% -70%) patients is diagnosed at the advanced stage . Gemcitabine&#xD;
      plus cisplatin is the standard first-line advanced treatment recommended in international and&#xD;
      domestic guidelines, but the treatment effect remains to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefits of immune therapies for HCC are emerging. Early clinical data already&#xD;
      show the safety of immune checkpoint inhibition. This study is to analyze the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of immunotherapy Triprilumab Injection combined with Gemcitabine Injection plus&#xD;
      Cisplatin Injection in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were aged 18 to 80 years with a histological or cytological diagnosis of&#xD;
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma，locally advanced or multiple liver metastases, including&#xD;
      postoperative occurrence, will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
