  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mozambique contributes with 5% of global malaria cases, and despite control efforts the&#xD;
      Sofala province continues to experience a high burden of malaria. The resistance to&#xD;
      insecticides and changes in vector habits can compromise the use of common vector control&#xD;
      tools. The use of spatial repellents is thus an interesting alternative, as it does not exert&#xD;
      selective pressure on resistance genes or eliminate other insects with impact on&#xD;
      biodiversity. IR3535 is a non-toxic repellent and if used at community level can extend&#xD;
      protection to outdoor biting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Using the IR3535 repellent for indoor and outdoor spraying will reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of malaria and reduce vector density and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental Before-After-Control-Intervention will be carried out with two groups: a)&#xD;
      Intervention (Tambai Q2 and Q6): with intra and extra-household spraying with IR3535 and b)&#xD;
      Control (Tambai Q3 and Q4): without spraying. Tambai is acommunity of Bebedo, Nhamatanda,&#xD;
      Sofala, Mozambique. The mosquito distribution, diversity, density and sporozoite rate will be&#xD;
      monitored indoors and outdoors in both communities for 2 years. The prevalence of malaria&#xD;
      will be determined in under five years old children at the beginning, the end of the 1st year&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. Additionally, cross-sectional studies with a mixed approach&#xD;
      assessing the community knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) will be carried out to&#xD;
      detect gaps that persist at the community level. Heads of households and health professionals&#xD;
      will be interviewed at the beginning of the study, the end of 1st year and at the end of the&#xD;
      study. The data will be analyzed using SPSS and R software packages. For matching situations&#xD;
      (before and after), the McNemar test will be used to ascertain statistical significance.&#xD;
      Generalized Linear Models (GLM) will be used to jointly analyze several explanatory&#xD;
      variables. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) and Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) models will be&#xD;
      used to compare longitudinal data. The prevalence of malaria and entomological indices&#xD;
      relevant for transmission are expected to decrease with the intervention while community&#xD;
      knowledge on malaria and its control are expected to increase.&#xD;

      Study area and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in the communities of Tambai, locality of Bebedo, district of&#xD;
      Nhamatanda, Sofala province, Mozambique. The community is covered by the Mutondo Health&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective experimental Before-After-Control-Intervention test will be carried out with&#xD;
      two groups: a) Intervention (community of Tambai quarters 2 (Q2) and 6 (Q6)): with indoors&#xD;
      and outdoors spraying with IR3535 (3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) and&#xD;
      b) Control (community of Tambai quarters 3 (Q3) and 4 (Q4)): without spraying. This&#xD;
      longitudinal study will last for 2 years. Mosquitoes will be captured indoors and outdoors to&#xD;
      determine entomological indicators relevant to transmission. Mosquito breeding sites in the&#xD;
      communities will be mapped using &quot;Participatory Mapping&quot;. The prevalence of malaria in&#xD;
      children under five will be determined in the control and in the intervention communities, at&#xD;
      the beginning, middle and end of study. A KAP survey on malaria to Tambai householders (Q2,&#xD;
      Q3, Q4; Q6) and health professionals and key community actors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population interventions and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the Beira Operational Research Center (CIOB) and the Institute of Hygiene and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine of the Nova University Lisbon (IHMT-NOVA), in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Mutondo health center, Provincial Directorate of Health of Sofala and the Directorate&#xD;
      district health district of Nhamatanda and the Gorongosa National Park, will present the&#xD;
      intervention in a participatory manner and explain the approach directed to the community in&#xD;
      order to guarantee its appropriation by the community from the beginning of the study. Before&#xD;
      conducting the study, communities will be informed, and the local structures will be briefed&#xD;
      in order for the community to understand the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys on community knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three KAP surveys will be carried out, at the start (baseline), at the end of the first year&#xD;
      and at the end of the second year. The study population will comprise all households from Q2,&#xD;
      Q3, Q4 and Q6 of Tambai. Household data will be collected using a questionnaire designed for&#xD;
      tablets, with Android system, through the ODK application. Interviews to the head of&#xD;
      household will take place at their homes or at a location proposed by them. The KAP about&#xD;
      malaria and the different aspects related to the acceptability of the use of repellents will&#xD;
      be complemented by focus groups and interviews to local key actors. The collection of the&#xD;
      data will be carried out based on two techniques: a) semi-structured interviews (Flick, 2006)&#xD;
      to health professionals at the Vinho Health Center (a Maternal and Child Health Nurse and a&#xD;
      preventive medicine professional), two activists and local leaders; b) focus groups (Flick,&#xD;
      2006) with matrons and practitioners of traditional medicine from the two communities under&#xD;
      study. All participants in this component of the study will be selected intentionally&#xD;
      (Hancock, Ockleford and Windridge, 2009). Participation will be made by signing the informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The malaria prevalence will be determined in children under 5 years of age in both locations&#xD;
      Tambai Q2 and Q6 (intervention) and Tambai Q3 and Q4 (control) at the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      at the beginning of the second year and at the end of the second year (end of the project).&#xD;
      Consent will be requested to the legal guardian. Capillary blood will be collected using a&#xD;
      sterile pipette and individual lancet from all children in the study aged 6-59 months of age&#xD;
      for: a) Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for Plasmodium falciparum; b) blood drop smears and c)&#xD;
      filter paper for nucleic acids extraction (FTA Cards ThermoFisher). The samples will be&#xD;
      coded, and information about the coordinates of the associated household will be recorded.&#xD;
      The initial sample processing will be carried out at the laboratory of the Health Center of&#xD;
      Ponta Gea - Beira, and the molecular analyzes at IHMT-NOVA - Lisbon, as defined in the MTA.&#xD;
      Identification of Plasmodium will be done by PCR and genotyping by whole genome sequencing&#xD;
      (Ocholla et al. 2014). Children who are diagnosed with malaria by RDT during the study will&#xD;
      be referred to the Mutondo Health Center for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      House Spraying with repellent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spraying with IR3535 will start at the beginning of the study and will be performed&#xD;
      monthly during the first 3 months, bimonthly during the next 6 months and then quarterly&#xD;
      thereafter. The spraying will be carried out inside and outside the houses during the&#xD;
      morning. Spraying will only be carried out in intervention quarters, while there will be no&#xD;
      spraying in control quarters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entomology&#xD;
&#xD;
      For entomological study households will be randomly selected. In case of failure of satellite&#xD;
      imagery and geographical analysis (Wampler et al. 2013, Escamilla et al. 2014), a classic&#xD;
      approach based on household inventories in each community will be used manually. Using local&#xD;
      mapping and numbering, two lists of numbered households will be created. After a random&#xD;
      number generator (e.g., Random.org) will be used to randomly select the households from each&#xD;
      list (Wampler et al. 2013). Mosquitoes will be collected twice a month inside and outside the&#xD;
      houses at the selected households for 2 years in the intervention and the control quarters.&#xD;
      Inside each household, resting mosquitoes that fed the previous night will be collected using&#xD;
      a Prokopak aspirator. Outside the residences, CDC- light traps will be placed in the early&#xD;
      evening and collected at the following morning. The traps will be placed outdoors, in places&#xD;
      equidistant from the buildings (houses) that compose the household. The physiological state&#xD;
      of the mosquitoes will be determined, and the females classified as unfed, partially fed,&#xD;
      fed, semi-gravid or gravid (Detinova, 1962). Mosquito females will be identified&#xD;
      morphologically and confirmed by the PCR (Abilio et al. 2015). The density of mosquitoes&#xD;
      caught in the control and intervention communities will be estimated using Williams'&#xD;
      geometric mean. GEE and LMM will be explored to compare the two groups along time. The rate&#xD;
      of infection will be determined by detecting and quantifying sporozoites in mosquitoes. The&#xD;
      mosquitoes' heads and thorax will be removed and prepared to isolate DNA (Abilio et al.&#xD;
      2011). Sporozoites will be detected and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as described in&#xD;
      (Marie et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breeding sites mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mosquito breeding sites will be mapped using the &quot;participatory mapping&quot; approach (Dickin&#xD;
      et al. 2014). The method will be used to identify the spatial perceptions of malaria risk in&#xD;
      the community, based on the spatial identification of existing breeding sites. Interview&#xD;
      participants and focus groups will be invited to draw a map of the areas they associate with&#xD;
      breeding in communities and describe the important features of the map. These maps can then&#xD;
      be digitized on a geographic information system (GIS) to create a georeferenced map of&#xD;
      community knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria cases in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, cases of malaria in Tambai will be monitored through patients who visit the&#xD;
      Mutondo Health Center. Patients of all ages from the communities with suspected malaria will&#xD;
      be recruited. A questionnaire will be administered. A RDT, a thick drop and blood smear will&#xD;
      be performed, and a drop of blood collected for subsequent molecular diagnosis by PCR (as&#xD;
      described above). Enrolment and consent will be asked after the patients have received all&#xD;
      the care they need in the health unit. Written informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      participants or their legal representatives for patients under 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study variables can be divided into variables from the survey (questionnaire) and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. Variables can be grouped into the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-demographic variables: Age; Sex; Marital status; Profession; Education level;&#xD;
           Degree of kinship to the householder; Household size (nº of houses, area); Number of&#xD;
           rooms in the house; nº of people per division; Type of construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ownership and use of mosquito nets: Ownership of mosquito nets; Use of mosquito nets;&#xD;
           Mobility and activities of household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria knowledge, attitudes and practices: Malaria knowledge level; Malaria attitudes;&#xD;
           Mosquito control and bites; Ownership, conservation and use of mosquito nets; Knowledge&#xD;
           about repellents; After analyzing the questionnaire data, the variables are deduced;&#xD;
           Level of knowledge, attitude and practices about malaria (score categorized as: bad (&gt;&#xD;
           50%), medium (50% -74%) and high (≥75%)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of the study will also be those resulting from the collection of biological&#xD;
      material (peripheral blood and mosquitoes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria cases in children under five (RDT, optical microscopy and PCR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria cases attending the Vinho Health Center;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mosquito density inside and outside homes; Percentage of infected mosquitoes;&#xD;
           Distribution of mosquito species inside and outside homes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breeding site (participatory mapping)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for KAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 126 householders will be surveyed (according to the National Institute of&#xD;
      Statistics of Moçambique (INE) report, 2017) corresponding to the total number of households&#xD;
      in the communities under study. The chosen locations are comprised of only 126 households,&#xD;
      therefore everyone contacted will be included to participate in order to guarantee a maximum&#xD;
      power for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of malaria in the intervention and control community&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the INE report, 2017, the total number of the population in the two study areas&#xD;
      is 630 inhabitants. To calculate the number of children under 5 years of age, the total&#xD;
      population was multiplied by 17.5%, so the sample will consist of about 110 children. The&#xD;
      attempt to include all children aims to try to obtain a sample size that guarantees us the&#xD;
      highest possible power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical power for entomological indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different scenarios and programs were explored to calculate the sample size. Initially, a&#xD;
      scenario corresponding to a sample size of 40 households (20 in each community) followed for&#xD;
      48 moments was considered as being feasible. The statistical power was calculated using the G&#xD;
      * Power v.3.2 program (Faul et al. 2007, 2009), with a correlation between measurements made&#xD;
      at different times 0.2; with effect of size f = 0.25; a type I error probability equal to&#xD;
      0.05. A statistical power of 91.1% was estimated. Conversely, for the same parameter values,&#xD;
      fixing the power at 95%, in the perspective of using ANOVA for repeated measurements, 24&#xD;
      aggregates were obtained in each community. However, if the assumptions of ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measurements fail, LMM or GEE models will be used, so it is important to have an idea of the&#xD;
      statistical power for these models. Using the Longpower package&#xD;
      (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/longpower/versions/1.0-19/topics/longpower-package)&#xD;
      of the R software, the power associated with the GEE and LMM models, for the previous&#xD;
      scenario (24 households), would not be satisfactory. Considering the possibility of missing&#xD;
      values (up to 20% in the last visit), a more realistic autoregressive correlation matrix for&#xD;
      measurements in each visit, several scenarios were explored in Longpower to guarantee at&#xD;
      least powers of 80%, for the various types of models. Thus, also keeping the budget and human&#xD;
      resources available, we have 40 households in each location (80 households in total), with a&#xD;
      single monthly visit to each household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 and R package. Initially, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and exploratory analysis will be performed. Parametric and non-parametric tests&#xD;
      will be used, either for independent samples (for example, comparing the two communities at a&#xD;
      given time), or for paired samples (comparing each community at the beginning, middle and end&#xD;
      of the study). The Chi-square or Fisher's test will be used to test the association between&#xD;
      qualitative variables or to compare proportions between independent groups. For paired&#xD;
      qualitative data, the McNemar test and Cochran's Q test (for binary data) will be applied.&#xD;
      For quantitative variables, the comparison of two independent groups will be performed using&#xD;
      the T-Student test, in case of compliance with the assumptions of normality and homogeneity&#xD;
      of variances, or alternatively the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      will be used for more than two groups. Signs, Wilcoxon and Friedman tests will be used to&#xD;
      compare two or more paired samples. If the sample sizes allow, generalized linear models can&#xD;
      be used to jointly analyze several explanatory variables for some events of interest (for&#xD;
      example, use of repellent). For the longitudinal comparison between the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups, as for entomological indices, Mixed Linear Models and Generalized Estimation&#xD;
      Equation Model or a Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial Experiments&#xD;
      (nparLD) approach will be applied, using several packages of the R. software. The&#xD;
      (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) CONSORT2010 standards, an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (IT) analysis will be used, and there may be a need to proceed previously with a treatment&#xD;
      for missing values. Differences and associations will be considered statistically significant&#xD;
      when p &lt;0.05. In order to estimate the prevalence or other proportions of interest, 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be obtained by Wald method or alternatively the Wilson or Jeffreys&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sporozoite rate (% of mosquitoes with sporozoites in the salivary glands) will be&#xD;
      compared between the control and intervention community and the percentage of reduction&#xD;
      determined. The temporal and spatial distribution of the different mosquito species and their&#xD;
      densities will be explored using ArcGIS 10 with Spatial Analysis and Statistical Tools) and&#xD;
      compared between the 2 locations (control x intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative component, after recording the interviews, their full transcription will&#xD;
      be carried out. Data processing and analysis will be manual, using the content analysis&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management - Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Open Data Kit (ODK) will be used for data collection and its quality control. The&#xD;
      supervisor will review the interviews on a daily basis, before sending them to the secure&#xD;
      server located at the CIOB for storing. The server will be accessible only to the data&#xD;
      manager and the team of researchers. The transferred data does not include the names of&#xD;
      participants, only their codes. The data manager will clean and validate the data daily and&#xD;
      provide feedback to the field staff. All physical documents such as informed consents, data&#xD;
      collection forms and electronic devices (GPS and tablets) will be stored and only accessible&#xD;
      to the CIOB Principal Investigator. The paper documents will be kept for 5 years after the&#xD;
      study is completed and then destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management - Prevalence and entomology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected through a paper data collection form. Every day, each data&#xD;
      collector must enter all data in a database available on a computer and send it to the data&#xD;
      manager, after a careful revision by responsible of the team. After the data manager receives&#xD;
      the data, she/he can create a password protected folder to archive the data on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and monitoring - Training of staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel will be properly trained by the study's research team. The field team will be&#xD;
      subdivided into three (3) groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting blood samples and administering the survey to householders and conducting&#xD;
           interviews with health professionals. The team will consist of 3 health technicians with&#xD;
           experience in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mosquitoes collection and breeding sites mapping. The team will consist of 2 entomology&#xD;
           technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sprayers that will be spraying houses with repellent. The team will consist of 4 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will be focused on ethical aspects, selection of households, children aged 6-59&#xD;
      months, conducting interviews, blood sampling procedures, good clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      practices, mosquito collection, manipulation, identification, processing and storing,&#xD;
      breeding mapping and spraying techniques and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and monitoring - Supervision of field work&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teams will have a field coordinator who will be responsible for monitoring the field work&#xD;
      and ensuring data quality. During the study, a team of supervisors will periodically visit&#xD;
      the field teams to ensure proper practices. The quality control (QC) of the data will start&#xD;
      in the pilot phase, with the identification and replacement of unclear terms and study&#xD;
      questions. The field coordinator will also continuously assess compliance with standard&#xD;
      operating procedures (SOP) and ethical principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality and quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline study will include a pilot that will be conducted during training in a community&#xD;
      that is not part of the study. The pilot will have the following objectives (i) to evaluate&#xD;
      and validate the contents of the data collection instruments, (ii) to ensure compliance with&#xD;
      the ethical aspects related to the study. The pilot will help to identify the difficulties&#xD;
      and omissions during the questionnaire. The pilot will analyze the fieldwork strategy, team&#xD;
      composition, staff responsibilities and time required to complete all activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field coordinator will do the quality control of the inquiries made before they are sent&#xD;
      to the CIOB and in addition to the quality control done by the field coordinator, the main&#xD;
      investigators will also do the supervision to guarantee the quality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored at the CIOB. Study documents and data collection instruments,&#xD;
      including informed consent in physical format, that will be placed in file folders and kept&#xD;
      locked, with restricted access to researchers. All documents related to the research will be&#xD;
      filed according to the rules of the legislation and will be kept at CIOB for a period of 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of Biological samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the blood and mosquito sample will be processed in the laboratory of IHMT-NOVA,&#xD;
      Portugal, for that purpose a material transfer agreement (MTA) has been signed between CIOB&#xD;
      and IHMT-NOVA, Portugal. Part of the blood sample will be kept in the CIOB for future&#xD;
      analysis in the scope of PhDs and/or Master programs, explicitly referring to the present&#xD;
      project. The samples will be kept in a freezer at CIOB at -80 ° C, for 5 years after the end&#xD;
      of the study. Biological samples that will not be used for further analysis will be destroyed&#xD;
      at the end of the analysis within the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical review&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol has been submitted for ethical approval to the Institutional Committee on&#xD;
      Bioethics for Health of the National Institute of Health (CIBS-INS) and to the National&#xD;
      Committee on Bioethics for Health (CNBS) - Clearance Ref. 63/CNBS/20 and Addendum Ref.&#xD;
      11/CNBS/21. The study will be carried out in accordance with the rules of &quot;good clinical&#xD;
      practice (GCP)&quot;, &quot;good clinical and laboratory practice (GCLP)&quot; and all applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements, such as the Declaration of Helsinki 2013, at its 64th General Assembly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent from the heads of households, parents or legal representatives of the children&#xD;
      and health professionals selected for the study will be obtained by trained interviewers.&#xD;
      They will be fluent in the local languages (Sena and Ndau) or accompanied by an interpreter&#xD;
      during the request for informed consent and interviews. All participants will be informed&#xD;
      about the objectives of the study, procedures to be performed during the study and potential&#xD;
      associated inconveniences, as well as the possibility of leaving the study even after signing&#xD;
      the informed consent without any implications for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will have the right to privacy during the moment of the interview, it will be&#xD;
      held in a place where the participant feels comfortable, explaining that all the information&#xD;
      provided by him will be confidential, authorization for audio recording of the interview will&#xD;
      be specifically requested. Permission from the householder will be ask, for the collection of&#xD;
      a finger prick blood sample from the children in the household aged 6-59 months. If the&#xD;
      child's legal representative is different from the head of household, informed consent will&#xD;
      also be administered to her/him. If the child's parent/legal guardian is under 18, informed&#xD;
      consent will be administered to authorize the child to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorizations for periodic visits throughout the study will be requested while explaining&#xD;
      the importance of the procedures for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  spraying of their homes (indoor and outdoor) with mosquito repellent (monthly). Only in&#xD;
           Tambai Q2 and Q6;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collection of mosquitoes from the interior and exterior of their houses (twice a month)&#xD;
           in two localities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inquirers and each participant will sign 2 copies of the informed consent form, in which&#xD;
      one copy will remain with the participant and the other will remain with the inquirer for&#xD;
      later filing in the study folder. The contact of the principal investigator of the study is&#xD;
      an integral part of the document. The informed consent form will serve as proof that the&#xD;
      participant accepted to be part of the study by their own free will. In order to guarantee&#xD;
      confidentiality, each participant will be assigned an identification code for the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Each questionnaire made will have a code corresponding to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of participation are minimal, but in the event that a participant feels&#xD;
      uncomfortable during the interview with any question, they can ask to pass the question on.&#xD;
      During the blood sample collection, there may be same risk of bleeding or inflammation from&#xD;
      the collection site. To minimize that adequate material will be provided to collect capillary&#xD;
      blood (sterilized lancets and disposable gloves) through health professionals trained for&#xD;
      that specific activity. Regarding the spraying of houses with repellent, participants will be&#xD;
      informed about potential rare adverse effects. If someone in the residence, where the&#xD;
      spraying was carried out, has any reaction, which is suspected to be associated with the&#xD;
      product, the spraying will be interrupted in that residence and the individual referred to&#xD;
      the health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, after carrying out interviews, an increase of knowledge in the communities is&#xD;
      noted. This is due to the fact that often those who apply the questionnaire can alert to best&#xD;
      practices, which can contribute to improvements in the health of the community. One of the&#xD;
      benefits will be knowing whether or not you have malaria, plus children diagnosed with&#xD;
      malaria will be able to benefit from treatment.&#xD;
