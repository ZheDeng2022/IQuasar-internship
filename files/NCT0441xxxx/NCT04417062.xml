  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done in order to evaluate the effectiveness of using two drugs (olaparib&#xD;
      and ceralasertib) to treat patients with osteosarcoma that has not responded to treatment or&#xD;
      has come back after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ceralasertib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase 2, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the use of olaparib in&#xD;
      combination with ceralasertib in 2 cohorts of patients aged 12-30 with recurrent&#xD;
      osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, evaluations&#xD;
      and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Participants with unresectable osteosarcoma (unable to remove with surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Participants with lung only resectable osteosarcoma (able to remove with&#xD;
           surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a drug diary to document information about the study treatment and&#xD;
      study calender with information about what to expect during and between study visits. The&#xD;
      names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ceralasertib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days and participants will receive study treatment up to 24&#xD;
      cycles (2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 63 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is looking to test: whether olaparib and ceralasertib given together are&#xD;
           effective in patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how safe and how well tolerated olaparib and ceralasertib are when given together in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  markers in the blood and in tumor tissue to see if there are certain features of the&#xD;
           tumor that may indicate this combination of drugs is effective or not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Ceralasertib as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that Ceralasertib will be given to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved olaparib for recurrent&#xD;
      osteosarcoma but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;

             rifampicin,rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) CYP3A&#xD;

        and/or CYP2B6 substrates or CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
        index. Exposure of other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 may be reduced and&#xD;
        additional monitoring may be required The use of herbal supplements or 'folk remedies' (and&#xD;
        medications and foods that significantly modulate CYP3A activity) should be discouraged. If&#xD;

             product or any contraindication to the combination anti-cancer agent as per local&#xD;
             prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known hypersensitivity to ceralasertib or any of the excipients of&#xD;
             the product or any contraindication to the combination anti-cancer agent as per local&#xD;
             prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic&#xD;
             diseases that places the patient at unacceptable risk of toxicity or non-compliance.&#xD;
             Examples include, but are not limited to, active bleeding diatheses, renal transplant,&#xD;
             uncontrolled major seizure disorder, severe COPD, superior vena cava syndrome,&#xD;
             extensive bilateral lung disease on High Resolution CT scan, severe Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease, active inflammatory bowel disease, psychiatric condition, or active infection&#xD;
             including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungals or&#xD;
             antiviral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening for chronic conditions is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             treated central nervous system (CMS) metastases are eligible provided they meet all of&#xD;
             the following criteria: disease outside the CNS is present, no clinical evidence of&#xD;
             progression since completion of CNSdirected therapy, minimum 3 weeks between&#xD;

             acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for &gt;10 mg of prednisolone per day or an&#xD;
             equivalent dose of other corticosteroid. If on corticosteroids, the patient should be&#xD;
             receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids, started at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
