  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the benefit of treatment with a physician administered intracanalicular&#xD;
      dexamethasone insert in patients with dry eye who are beginning treatment with Xiidra&#xD;
      (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) to reduce the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will use a fellow-eye design for 20 participants, 40 eyes. All eyes&#xD;
      will receive bilateral Xiidra. The most symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZA®&#xD;
      insertion on the day Xiidra is prescribed (study eye), while the other eye will be assigned&#xD;
      to receive sham punctum dilation (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic&#xD;
      difference, the right eye will receive the intracanalicular insert. The study group will&#xD;
      consist of 20 eyes receiving DEXTENZA® insertion. The control group will consist of 20 eyes&#xD;
      receiving sham punctum dilation. Thus, for every eye in the study group, there will be a&#xD;
      paired eye with similar baseline characteristics in the control group sourced from the same&#xD;
      participant. This fellow-eye design allows for greater control of potential confounders tied&#xD;
      to participants' systemic and ocular health.&#xD;
