  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior fossa surgeries are generally complicated by difficulties in creating a watertight&#xD;
      dural closure, which often requires the use of dural substitutes. In particular, surgical&#xD;
      procedures at this location are associated with an increased rate of fluid leakage&#xD;
      (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) or inflow (blood, air, etc.) creating hydrodynamic complications.&#xD;
      Effective sealing of the dura is required to prevent such complications and infections by&#xD;
      minimizing the introduction of irritating blood products into the CSF. Since true hermetic&#xD;
      dural seals are often impossible to achieve, dural sealants have been developed that can be&#xD;
      applied to the sutured dural perimeter to help prevent complications related to CSF. Adjuvant&#xD;
      use of such sealants may be prudent, particularly in posterior fossa surgeries, as the&#xD;
      incidence of CSF leakage has been reported to be as high as approximately 15-28% with such&#xD;
      surgeries, with an increased risk of leakage. 5.84 times greater than supratentorial&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various techniques have been developed to overcome this problem and achieve a tight dural&#xD;
      closure. Although there is published evidence showing the efficacy and safety of some of&#xD;
      these sealants in posterior fossa surgery, the different types of pathologies and various&#xD;
      population risk factors included in these trials make it difficult to interpret the results.&#xD;
      Having selective inclusion criteria and including patients with a selected pathology could be&#xD;
      essential to obtain clearer results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative CSF leak has two aspects: one is pseudomeningocele (a subcutaneous collection&#xD;
      of CSF); the other is a CSF fistula in which CSF reaches the skin. This second one is much&#xD;
      more dangerous and constitutes one of the most important complications of this surgery, but&#xD;
      the pseudomeningocele is a clinical demonstration of failure of the dural closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEMOPATCH is a soft, thin, foldable and flexible collagen patch, coated with NHS-PEG.&#xD;
      HEMOPATCH is indicated as a hemostatic device and surgical seal for procedures in which&#xD;
      control of bleeding or leakage of other body fluids or air by conventional surgical&#xD;
      techniques is ineffective or impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical evidence collects a prospective case series of 200 patients, in which&#xD;
      the authors reviewed the use of HEMOPATCH for dural augmentation in high-risk patients from&#xD;
      2014 to this year. After 2 years of refining the technique, a decrease in CSF leaks from 27%&#xD;
      to 7% was achieved, and no adverse events related to the application of the product were&#xD;
      observed. A retrospective cohort study has recently been published comparing the use of&#xD;
      HEMOPATCH versus routine clinical practice in 290 patients, in which 147 used standard dural&#xD;
      reinforcement techniques, and 143 used HEMOPATCH. The CSF fistula appearance rates were 7.69%&#xD;
      in the HEMOPATCH group, compared to 32.65% in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recent results, along with the characteristics and properties of the patch, could make&#xD;
      this sealant a safe and plausible option to achieve sealing after posterior fossa surgery.&#xD;
