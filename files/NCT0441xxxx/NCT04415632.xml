  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2 x 2 cross-over dietary intervention trial designed to investigate the effects of low&#xD;
      glycemic index (LGI) versus high glycemic index (HGI) diet on hepatic fat accumulation and&#xD;
      gut microbiota composition in participants with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated randomly to a 2-week either high GI (HGI) or low GI (LGI) diet&#xD;
      followed by a 4-week wash-out period and then the LGI or HGI diet, opposite to the first&#xD;
      2-weeks (N= 16).&#xD;
