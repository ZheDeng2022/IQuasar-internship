  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mobilizing programme MobFood - mobilizing scientific knoweledge and technology to answer&#xD;
      the current nutrition market challenges - is formed by a consortium of 47 collaborative&#xD;
      entities, between the industry and ENESIIs (Entidades Não Empresariais do Sistema de&#xD;
      Investigação e Inovação) and is financed by Structural European Funds of Investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is currently investigating and undertaking collaborative scientific and&#xD;
      technological strategies based on R&amp;D and innovation, in order to boost and promote a more&#xD;
      competitive national food industry, capable of overcoming the current challenges, including&#xD;
      those of the Millennial Generation. This group is particularly conscious of the impact of&#xD;
      food behaviour and food choices on health but extremely vulnerable to dietary imbalance.&#xD;
      Strategies to improve Millenials' nutrition while providing conscious food products are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised, cross-over controlled trial designed to test the metabolic&#xD;
      effect, particularly in terms of appetite control and glycaemic response of a breakfast kit&#xD;
      (nutritionally balanced and innovative), recently developed as part of the collaborative&#xD;
      project MobFood_PPS4.&#xD;
