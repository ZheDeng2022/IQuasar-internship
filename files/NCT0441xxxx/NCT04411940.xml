    <textblock>
      The purpose on this study was to determine whether the test product, Haloperidol Tablets, 2&#xD;
      mg (Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd), and the reference product, Haloperidol Tablets, USP, 2 mg&#xD;
      (Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.) are bioequivalent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim was to conduct a single dose, open-label, randomized, two period crossover&#xD;
      pivotal study to determine the bioequivalence of two formulations containing haloperidol 2 mg&#xD;
      in healthy males and females under fasting conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 32 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) were entered into&#xD;
      the study. Volunteers were determined to be free of significant medical conditions as&#xD;
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP) under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wash-out period of at least 14 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of&#xD;
      the analyte) between consecutive administrations of the investigational medicinal product&#xD;
      (IP) was maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at at pre-dose (0 hours), at 30 minutes, at 1 hour, 1 hour 30&#xD;
      minutes, 2 hours, 2 hours 30 minutes, 3 hours, 3 hours 30 minutes, 4 hours, 4 hours 30&#xD;

      hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 168 hours and 192 hours&#xD;
      post-dose (total: 26 samples per treatment period).&#xD;
