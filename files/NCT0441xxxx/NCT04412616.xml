  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of ZZ06 in participants with all Adult Patients with Advanced&#xD;
      EGFR-positive Solid Tumor Malignancies who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to&#xD;
      characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of ZZ06 as a single agent in adult participants with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with an accelerated-titration dose escalation scheme, enrolling 1&#xD;
      patient per cohort for the first 2 cohorts with expansion to 3 patients in the event of Grade&#xD;
      â‰¥ 2 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or dose limiting toxicity (DLT) possibly,&#xD;
      probably, or definitely related to the study drug. After the first 2 cohorts, the study will&#xD;
      then proceed to a 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion to 6&#xD;
      patients in the event of a DLT.&#xD;
