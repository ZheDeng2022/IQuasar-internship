      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pleura is a double-layered membrane that surrounds the lungs. Pathological processes that&#xD;
      involve the Pleura are called &quot;Pleural diseases&quot;. Among them are included Pneumothorax (Air&#xD;
      the chest cavity), Pleural effusions, and tumor formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging of the Pleura to detect and assess pleural diseases has been proven as an&#xD;
      excellent diagnostic and safe option. Ultrasound test uses sound waves to characterize the&#xD;
      structure and function of different organs in health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard technique used to create two-dimensional ultrasound picture is called Delay and&#xD;
      Sum (DAS). Signals are transmitted and received from a series of elements and allow a two&#xD;
      dimensional picture to be created. Because a large number of sensors is required, creating a&#xD;
      two dimensional picture creates a large and usually redundant data pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This fact leads to a need for stronger processors and larger operating systems, Consumption&#xD;
      of higher energy, and hence an ungainly, slow, and expensive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signal Acquisition Modeling and Processing Laboratory (SAMPLE) in Weizmann institute has&#xD;
      developed a data processing system that allows narrowing down the number of elements needed&#xD;
      to process the ultrasound signal, while creating an ultrasound picture of abdominal organs in&#xD;
      a satisfying resolution. Sometimes even better than standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of diagnosis and characterization of pleural diseases by Ultrasound, using a&#xD;
      novel algorithm that was developed in SAMPLE laboratory in Weizmann Institute. The aim is to&#xD;
      create a faster, more reliable ultrasound imaging while minimizing sampling rate and data&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested population: Women and/or men who were diagnosed with Pneumothorax or Plural effusion&#xD;
      with other imaging modalities, and healthy volunteers as a control group, Up to 30&#xD;
      participants per each group (Total up to 90), in a 1:1:1 Ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-labeled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that will meet the required conditions will be summoned to an exam in our&#xD;
      imaging institute or will be scanned bedside, using the Verasonics ultrasound system, which&#xD;
      allows free access to ultrasound raw Channel data. The information acquired, as well as other&#xD;
      imaging scans of the participant, will be coded and delivered anonymously to SAMPLE&#xD;
      laboratory for analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pleura is a double-layered membrane surrounding the lungs. It is anatomically divided&#xD;
      into Visceral Pleura, which is attached to the outer part of the lungs, and to the Parietal&#xD;
      Pleura, which is attached to the inner side of the rib cage. Pathological processes involving&#xD;
      the Pleura are incorporated under the name &quot;Pleural diseases&quot; which include, among others,&#xD;
      pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and various tumors. This disease group is relatively&#xD;
      widespread, and as evidence that the incidence reported in the literature is over 300 to&#xD;
      100,000 people in one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and evaluation of pleural disease involve the use of various neuroimaging devices&#xD;
      such as chest radiographs, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Most often, chest radiographs are widely&#xD;
      accepted as the first means of identifying pleural diseases, with ultrasound, CT, and MRI&#xD;
      supplementing or constituting a diagnostic confirmation if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few years, a significant perceptual change has been made in the use of chest&#xD;
      ultrasound to diagnose pleural diseases as part of emergent and none emergent situations.&#xD;
      Ultrasound has been shown to be an excellent imaging device for the assessment of pleural&#xD;
      diseases. It is used as an auxiliary in a variety of clinical situations, such as&#xD;
      pneumothorax detection in emergency situations, characterization of pleural fluid as simple&#xD;
      or complex, the distinction between pleura thickening and pleural fluid loculations, and&#xD;
      more. In addition to the diagnostic aspect, the ultrasound serves as a means of performing&#xD;
      invasive operations in the chest. The use of ultrasound imaging for the chest is increasing,&#xD;
      resulting in a significant increase in the quality of the diagnosis and a decrease in the&#xD;
      incidence of various complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound test uses sound waves to characterize various organ structure and function in&#xD;
      health and disease. The test does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, so its use is&#xD;
      safer than other techniques such as chest x-rays or CT examinations. The acquired and viewed&#xD;
      images in the ultrasound device are real-time, so that changes can be detected and evaluated,&#xD;
      which in many cases affects the final diagnosis. The test is non-invasive and does not&#xD;
      require the use of contrast material containing substances that may cause an allergic&#xD;
      reaction or impairment of kidney function. In addition, the instrumentation is more readily&#xD;
      available for use at bedside examinations, and most tests do not require special preparations&#xD;
      except for up to 6 hours of fasting in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, ultrasound testing has its drawbacks as well. The method is highly&#xD;
      dependent on the operator's skill, so a great deal of experience is required to produce&#xD;
      sufficient quality information and to make an accurate diagnosis. The ultrasound does not&#xD;
      penetrate well through bones, and the quality of the test is impaired by the presence of air&#xD;
      between the transducer and the organ or area being examined. In addition, the quality of the&#xD;
      test is highly dependent on the subject's cooperation during the test, such as posture&#xD;
      changes and deep breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard technique for creating a standard 2D ultrasound image is now called Delay and&#xD;
      Sum (DAS). Signals are transmitted and received from a series of elements, and by appropriate&#xD;
      spacing of each signal, the signal readout can be focused in the required direction and&#xD;
      distance. Due to the need for many sensors, a significant amount of data is required to&#xD;
      produce the desired 2D picture. This fact leads to a need of using stronger processors,&#xD;
      resulting in higher energy consumption, larger and more expensive operating systems.&#xD;
      Therefore, Lowering the number of required samples while effectively processing the signals&#xD;
      allows creating a high-quality 2D image, while narrowing down the burden of unnecessary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAMPL Laboratory at the Weizmann Institute demonstrated this data processing method with&#xD;
      ultrasound tests on stationary organs such as the liver and kidneys where the number of&#xD;
      elements needed for signal processing could be reduced for the purpose of creating an&#xD;
      ultrasound image with a smaller volume of information, while not compromising on picture&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the medical experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to improve the diagnosis and characterization of pleural&#xD;
      diseases by ultrasound, using a new algorithm developed in the SAMPL laboratory at the&#xD;
      Weizmann Institute. The goal is to enable a fast and reliable diagnostic tool comparable to&#xD;
      the ultrasound imaging used today while minimizing the sampling rate and volume of&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Mode, M-Mode, and Doppler operation of an Ultrasonic system can provide spatial-, temporal-&#xD;
      and motion-related aspects of Pleural composition and dynamics. The standard technique used&#xD;
      by commercial medical ultrasound systems for B-mode imaging is delay and sum (DAS)&#xD;
      beamforming. However, DAS often yields images of limited resolution and contrast, which are&#xD;
      governed by the center frequency and the aperture size of the ultrasound transducer. A large&#xD;
      number of elements leads to improved resolution, but simultaneously increases data size and&#xD;
      system cost due to receiver electronics required per element. The reduction of receiving&#xD;
      channels while producing high-quality images is thus of great importance. Methods and&#xD;
      algorithms developed at SAMPL, such as the Convolutional Beamforming Algorithm (COBA), can be&#xD;
      used to achieve significant improvement of lateral resolution and contrast. COBA can also be&#xD;
      implemented efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. Based on this concept, sparse&#xD;
      beamformers were developed, resulting in the same beam pattern as DAS and COBA while using&#xD;
      far fewer array elements. Optimization of the number of elements shows an approximate&#xD;
      square-root reduction in required elements, compared to DAS. The performance of the proposed&#xD;
      methods was tested and validated using simulated data, phantom scans and in vivo cardiac&#xD;
      data. The technique may be applied to Pleural disease detection, allowing for both improved&#xD;
      image quality and reduction of the number of elements used to produce an image, and therefore&#xD;
      ultimately facilitate cheap, portable, and wireless ultrasound imaging. In addition, the&#xD;
      methods developed at SAMPL yield imaging that is fully dedicated to the assessment of pleural&#xD;
      pathologies, enabling straightforward interpretation even by untrained clinicians. Jointly,&#xD;
      wireless, cheap, and portable lung imaging, along with straightforward interpretation opens&#xD;
      up a wealth of opportunities, spanning from fast diagnosis of pneumothorax in ambulatory&#xD;
      (trauma) settings as well as in rural clinics and developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Verasonics Vantage ultrasound system is an ultrasound system suitable for human research&#xD;
      use. This system allows for raw sound wave data to be retrieved when performing ultrasound&#xD;
      scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be scanned at Haemek Medical Center (As detailed in the &quot;Intervention&quot;&#xD;
      section), and the data will be processed at the SAMPL laboratory at the Weizmann Institute.&#xD;
      All information transmitted to the laboratory at the Weizmann Institute will be encoded&#xD;
      beforehand, i.e. removing identifying information such as name, identification number,&#xD;
      address, and assignment of a serial number by the medical center, so that the patient&#xD;
      information is will be unavailable to SAMPL laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transferring the images from the imaging tests will be done after encoding the tested&#xD;
      information in an Excel file. Only the primary investigator will be exposed to pre-coding&#xD;
      information, which will be stored on a dedicated computer by the primary investigator,&#xD;
      password protected. The encoded information will be transmitted continuously to the Weizmann&#xD;
      Institute, in order to ensure reliable data acquisition and the possibility of real-time&#xD;
      feedback to the principal investigator in favor of higher quality data enabling data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
