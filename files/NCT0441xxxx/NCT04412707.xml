    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-period, cross-over Phase 2 study, comparing PK, and assessing&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and efficacy of peripheral and central intravenous administration of&#xD;
      melflufen in patients with RRMM. It is an international study, enrolling patients in US and&#xD;
      Europe. The study will enroll patients following at least 2 lines of prior therapy.&#xD;
