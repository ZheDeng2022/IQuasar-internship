  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to record hemodynamic pullback information using continuous resting&#xD;
      full-cycle flow ratio (RFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with diffuse&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. The capacity of the two indexes to predict the hemodynamic outcome&#xD;
      after stenting will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the accuracy of RFR/FFR gradients in predicting the change in whole-vessel&#xD;
           RFR/FFR after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify a threshold in the RFR/FFR gradient that is predictive of pathological&#xD;
           RFR/FFR also after the PCI of the first lesion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of the hemodynamic relevance of coronary stenoses is a well-validated method to&#xD;
      identify coronary lesions to be treated. A number of studies show that FFR-guided PCI is&#xD;
      superior to angiography guided PCI2-4. The achievement of maximal hyperemia is a prerequisite&#xD;
      for FFR measurements. Hyperemia is usually achieved with the intravenous or intracoronary&#xD;
      infusion of adenosine, which requires time and is potentially associated with discomfort for&#xD;
      the patient. To avoid this, resting indexes have been developed. The instantaneous flow&#xD;
      reserve (iFr) was the first of these indexes, and two large studies have shown that this&#xD;
      parameter is non-inferior to FFR in terms of patient prognosis5. More recently, a number of&#xD;
      other parameters have been developed, among which the RFR (resting flow ratio), which can be&#xD;
      measured with the same intracoronary wire as the FFR and therefore requires no additional&#xD;
      procedures. Studies show that these methods are equivalent6. The advantage of these resting&#xD;
      indexes (which are all included in the most recent AHA/ACC guidelines7, 8), is that they do&#xD;
      not require hyperemia. This might represent a particular advantage in the setting of tandem&#xD;
      stenoses or diffuse disease. Since hyperemic flow in a vessel is limited by each one of the&#xD;
      stenoses present in that vessel, each individual stenosis limits the capacity of FFR to&#xD;
      assess the hemodynamic relevance of the other ones. In other words, invasive measurements of&#xD;
      coronary hemodynamics using FFR in the setting of diffuse or tandem lesions are complicated&#xD;
      by the fact that maximal hyperemia cannot be achieved, which limits the capacity of FFR to&#xD;
      assess the hemodynamic relevance of individual focal stenoses. In this setting, the usual&#xD;
      binary system (FFR &lt; or &gt; 0.80) cannot be easily applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This limitation is independent of the sequence of the stenoses: proximal lesions limit the&#xD;
      reliability of FFR measurements in distal stenoses and vice versa (as long as no significant&#xD;
      side branches are present between the two lesions). Since hyperemic flow declines&#xD;
      significantly as soon as a 50% reduction in lumen diameter is present, even apparently&#xD;
      non-relevant lesions may compromise any assessment based on hyperemia. This phenomenon,&#xD;
      called hemodynamic interdependence of stenoses under conditions of hyperemia represents a&#xD;
      significant limitation that applies to FFR but not to hyperemia-free indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address this issue in routine practice, FFR is measured first, then a pullback is&#xD;
      performed and the lesion/segment where the pullback identifies the highest gradient is&#xD;
      treated first. The removal of this stenosis increases maximal achievable hyperemic flow, thus&#xD;
      increasing the significance of the remaining lesions. FFR is then measured again to test the&#xD;
      hemodynamic significance of the other stenoses at a higher level of hyperemia. The capacity&#xD;
      of FFR to predict whether removal of the first stenosis will be associated with the&#xD;
      normalization of FFR is very limited, which requires that FFR be measured multiple times,&#xD;
      prolonging the procedure and increasing the discomfort for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When studying coronary stenoses, the advantage of resting hemodynamic indexes is that&#xD;
      non-critical stenoses (ie below 90%) do not modify resting blood flow. Because resting flow&#xD;
      is more constant, and the effect of PCI is minimal, resting pressure changes measured across&#xD;
      sequential lesions are likely to be more predictable.The hypothesis of the study is that, as&#xD;
      compared to FFR, RFR will provide a better estimate of post-PCI hemodynamic outcomes.&#xD;
