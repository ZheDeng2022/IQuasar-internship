  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High grade neuroendocrine neoplasm patients are treated with platinum doublets such as&#xD;
      carboplatin and etoposide mimicking the current guidelines for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, recurrences are common and most patients with metastatic disease succumb to it&#xD;
      within a year. There is no extensive literature or consensus on second- or third-line options&#xD;
      (which include FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, capecitabine and temozolomide, taxanes or immunotherapy) and&#xD;
      there is urgent need for better regimens.&#xD;
