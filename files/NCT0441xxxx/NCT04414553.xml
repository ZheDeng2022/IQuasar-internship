    <textblock>
      To address childhood overweight disparities among Latino children in immigrant families a&#xD;
      pragmatic effectiveness trial of a community-based obesity treatment program, Community&#xD;
      Active and Healthy Families (AHF), among 5-12 year old overweight and obese Latino children&#xD;
      in immigrant families using a wait-list control randomized design will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that children randomized to Community-AHF will demonstrate a reduction in&#xD;
      child body mass index as measured by %BMIp95 (primary outcome) and improved diet physical&#xD;
      activity behaviors (secondary outcomes) at intervention completion compared with wait-list&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

      To address childhood overweight disparities among Latino children in immigrant families a&#xD;
      pragmatic effectiveness trial of a community-based obesity treatment program, Community&#xD;
      Active and Healthy Families (AHF), among 5-12 year old overweight and obese Latino children&#xD;
      in immigrant families using a wait-list control randomized design will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome analyses will explore change in %BMIp95 and the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention will be modeled using an intention-to-treat analysis using random effects&#xD;
      regression modeling with treatment assignment as the predictor and baseline %BMIp95 as the&#xD;
      covariate. The investigators are interested in the null hypothesis of no difference in&#xD;
      post-treatment outcome between intervention and control conditions, adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      %BMIp95 measurement, study site and correcting for correlation between group-treated cohorts.&#xD;
      The investigators will also complete an analysis of BMI trajectory as participants will&#xD;
      contribute at least 3 measures of BMI: at baseline, 6 and 10 months with extra BMI measures&#xD;
      extracted from the electronic medical record. The investigators will complete the same type&#xD;
      of analyses as for the primary outcome of BMI change for each of the measures used to assess&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, as all will be considered as continuous variables. The investigators will&#xD;
      also complete a moderation analysis to evaluate whether change in any of the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, moderate the treatment related change in BMI from baseline to 10 months. Finally,&#xD;
      The investigators will explore the extent to which salutary BMI change spills over to other&#xD;
      family members of the index child. The investigators will examine this with three-level&#xD;
      nested models where baseline and follow-up measures are nested within individuals who are&#xD;
      nested within families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to detect 0.322 lower mean %BMIp95 in the Community-AHF versus&#xD;
      the wait-list control at 10 months after randomization. The sample size analytic procedures&#xD;
      accounted for the trial design as an individually-randomized group treatment trial and&#xD;
      utilized pilot intervention data to inform our sample size calculations. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to have 120 child-parent dyads per intervention arm with 240 completing dyads overall.&#xD;
      Assuming an 80% completion rate, the investigators will enroll 300 child-parent dyads.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Total-log activity counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an accelerometer-derived measure on a subset of participants that characterizes volume of activity. It is calculated by taking the log of activity counts observed for each minute, adding 1, and then calculating an average value per day. The log transformation of total activity counts results in the improved sensitivity to lower volumes of activity. This measure can be helpful for populations that have low levels of activity and is a continuous measure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Activity Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an accelerometer derived measure that characterizes general volume of physical activity. This is the most commonly used measure to understand accelerometer-derived activity during the day and is a continuous measure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Active-to-sedentary transition probability</measure>

    <description>This is an accelerometer-derived measure that characterizes fragmentation of physical activity and depends on the frequency of transitioning from active to sedentary state. It is a complementary measure to volume of physical activity. This is a bounded measure between 0-1.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Community Active and Healthy Families</intervention_name>
    <description>Community-AHF will consist of eight, semimonthly 2-hour group appointments for 16 weeks followed by a visit with the pediatrician 2 months later and a final group session 4 months after that. Community-AHF sessions will target two areas: 1) Practical information regarding importance of healthy behaviors, and 2) Problem-solving skills to overcome barriers to improving diet and increasing physical activity and other related healthy behaviors. Each session covers specific objectives, includes a number of complementary activities and provides participants with take-home materials to facilitate behavior change.&#xD;
Community-AHF will be delivered by a nurse and a Community Health Worker (CHW) trained by a consultant nutritionist and study investigators. The CHW will contact families between group sessions to discuss challenges and successes regarding lifestyle changes.</description>
