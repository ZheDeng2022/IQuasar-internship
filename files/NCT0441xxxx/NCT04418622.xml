  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined according to the French society of&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngology as chronic non-mechanical damage to the nasal structures, excluding&#xD;
      infectious damage to the sinus structures. The duration of the chronic impairment must be at&#xD;
      least 12 consecutive weeks. It causes many symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal blockage and&#xD;
      anosmia. It is a poorly understood pathology that affects a large part of the population. Its&#xD;
      prevalence has increased significantly over the past 30 years. It affects about 11% of the&#xD;
      population in Europe. It has become one of ten high-cost medical conditions for employers.&#xD;
      Initially, it was accepted that CRS was due to chronic nasal infection. It is very&#xD;
      debilitating for patients leading to a major consultation with practitioners (general&#xD;
      practitioners and ENT specialists). Many treatments are used such as nose washes, nasal or&#xD;
      oral corticosteroids, antibiotic therapy or even surgical management is possible. Thèses&#xD;
      treatments allow an improvement in the symptomatology but no treatment allows a stable result&#xD;
      over time, making long-term treatments essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, it is recognized that CRS has a multifactorial etiology including inflammatory&#xD;
      processes, hyperresponsiveness of the nasal mucosa and abnormalities in immune phenomena. The&#xD;
      endonasal microbiota plays a role in these processes. Germs like Staphylococcus aureus and&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as pathogens in CRS in the first studies with&#xD;
      bacterial cultures. Thanks to the 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing technique, recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a modification in the diversity and abundance of the microbiota in patients with&#xD;
      CRS compared to healthy subjects, notably with a modification of the germs of the firmicutes&#xD;
      group. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have studied the modification of the microbiota with the treatment of CRS today.&#xD;
      However, local treatments based on nosewashing with physiological saline associated with&#xD;
      local corticosteroids and endoscopic treatments lead to an improvement in the symptomatology&#xD;
      for patients suffering from CRS. This study will describe the modification of endonasal&#xD;
      microbiota in différent conditions, such medical and surgical treatments, that usually&#xD;
      improve patients symptomatology.&#xD;
