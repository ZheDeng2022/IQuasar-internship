  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of alcoholic propolis extract on inflammation in participants with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess before and after the intervention period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The expression of transcription factors (nuclear factor-kB), antioxidant enzymes&#xD;
           (heme-oxygenase-1), inflammasome receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ,&#xD;
           as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, Tumor nuclear factor-α,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein, interleukin 1) and E-selectin adhesion molecules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The levels of protein expression of inflammatory markers and antioxidant enzymes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The profile of the intestinal microbiota of stool samples from the research&#xD;
           participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma levels of substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid and oxidized low density&#xD;
           lipoprotein as a marker of oxidative stress;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine and anthropometric laboratory variables, indicative of the metabolic profile of&#xD;
           the research participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, recovery heart rate and chair lift test to&#xD;
           assess the functional capacity of the research participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess atherogenic risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food intake and nutritional status; Compare data between the intervention and control&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has chronic systemic inflammation as an important component of&#xD;
      multifactorial origin, a factor related to both the progression and outcomes of CKD, being&#xD;
      involved in all causes of mortality in these patients, such as cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
      this context, some nutritional strategies have been proposed as an adjuvant therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative to modulate inflammation, starting from the consolidated knowledge of the role of&#xD;
      nutrients and bioactive compounds on the expression of genes related to inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress, factors that feed on each other. In view of this scenario, propolis, a&#xD;
      substance made up of a combination of several chemical components with broad potential&#xD;
      biological activity, appears as a promising alternative to modulate inflammation in patients&#xD;
      with CKD. However, clinical evidence to assess the effects of propolis in patients with CKD&#xD;
      is scarce, and there are no studies that have investigated its effects on gene expression and&#xD;
      markers related to inflammation in these patients. Thus, the present project proposes a&#xD;
      longitudinal study of the clinical trial type that aims to evaluate the effects of propolis&#xD;
      alcoholic extract on transcription factors and inflammatory markers in patients with CKD.&#xD;
