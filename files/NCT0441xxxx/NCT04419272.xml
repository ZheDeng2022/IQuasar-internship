  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate (MPH) is a stimulant, FDA-approved for the treatment of attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unknown, however, if stimulants would be of benefit for&#xD;
      memory and thinking problems due to epilepsy. In this study, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      randomly (i.e., by flip of a coin), to a group that takes MPH and a group that takes a&#xD;
      placebo (sugar pill). Participants will not know the group to which they have been assigned.&#xD;
      Tests of attention and memory will be completed before taking the study pills, at Week 4, and&#xD;
      at Week 8. All participants will then have the option of taking MPH for the next two months,&#xD;
      and attention and memory will be tested again at Week 16. The study will determine whether&#xD;
      methylphenidate is helpful for the treatment of attention and memory problems in adults with&#xD;
      epilepsy, and whether the medication is safe and beneficial when taken over an extended time&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of MPH vs. placebo in&#xD;
      subjects with epilepsy and impaired attention. In the blinded phase, subjects will receive&#xD;
      placebo and MPH (20mg twice daily) for 4 weeks each, in randomized order. Subjects will then&#xD;
      receive open-label MPH for 8 weeks (20mg twice daily). Cognitive tests will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and at the end of the open-label period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of MPH for the treatment of attentional&#xD;
      dysfunction in subjects with epilepsy. It is expected that subjects will have improved&#xD;
      attention when taking MPH compared to placebo, measured by the Conner's Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Test (CPT). The effects of MPH on other cognitive functions that rely in part on&#xD;
      attention, including memory (MCG Paragraph Test) and psychomotor speed (Symbol Digit&#xD;
      Modalities Test), as well as the impact on an overall measure of divided attention,&#xD;
      psychomotor speed, and response inhibition (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), will be&#xD;
      ascertained. Improved performance when taking MPH compared to placebo is expected. Finally,&#xD;
      the study will establish the effect of MPH on overall quality of life. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that there will be improvement in self-reported quality of life with MPH, but no change while&#xD;
      taking placebo, as assessed by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Patient Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will determine the safety of MPH, including effects on seizure frequency,&#xD;
      the impact on mood and subjective cognitive function, and continued efficacy over an&#xD;
      open-label period. Epilepsy type, concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs that impair&#xD;
      cognition, and history of head trauma will be assessed as covariates.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        1. SUBJECTS WITH EPILEPSY Participants will include subjects with epilepsy, based on&#xD;
             clinical history, imaging studies and ictal and/or interictal EEG interpreted by a&#xD;
             clinical epileptologist. Seizures may be either symptomatic or idiopathic, primary&#xD;
             generalized or focal-onset, and traumatic or non-traumatic in etiology. Subjects must&#xD;
             have self-reported cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects must meet the following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt; or = 18 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IQ &gt; or = 70, estimated by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Capacity to provide informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability to live independently and complete activities of daily living;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable seizure frequency at the time of enrollment, such that the subject's&#xD;
                  treating physician does not believe a change in anticonvulsant regimen to be&#xD;
                  warranted during the trial (the anticonvulsant drugs should remain unchanged&#xD;
                  during the 16 weeks of participation unless absolutely required clinically due an&#xD;
                  unanticipated change in seizure frequency or severity);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fluency in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychogenic, non-epileptic spells;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of dementia (i.e., Alzheimer's disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other progressive neurologic illness (i.e., malignant brain tumor). A benign,&#xD;
                  stable neoplasm with no plans for resection will not be cause for exclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alcohol or illicit drug abuse within the past year, as this may affect cognition&#xD;
                  by other mechanisms. This information may be obtained by self-report, from the&#xD;
                  referring physician or by medical record. Subjects will also undergo urine drug&#xD;
                  testing at the baseline visit. Chronic, stable use of marijuana will not be cause&#xD;
                  for exclusion. In cases of intermittent, recreational use, it will be required&#xD;
                  that subjects refrain from marijuana for 2 weeks prior to testing. Cannabidiol&#xD;
                  use will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Generalized tonic-clonic or other generalized motor seizure(s) within 48 hours or&#xD;
                  focal-onset seizures with impaired awareness within 24 hours of&#xD;
                  neuropsychological testing. This restriction will avoid testing during a&#xD;
                  post-ictal state. This timing is conservative, based on practice as well as prior&#xD;
                  studies of post-ictal cognitive function demonstrating return to baseline within&#xD;
                  one day (Dodrill and Ojemann, 2007; Helmstaedter, Elger, &amp; Lendt, 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior status epilepticus in the past year;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neurosurgery within the past 6 months, as there may be recovery in cognition&#xD;
                  post-operatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current pregnancy or pregnancy planned during the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breastfeeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI; e.g., selegiline,&#xD;
                  tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue), or use of&#xD;
                  an MAOI within 14 days of beginning the trial (due to the risk of hypertensive&#xD;
                  crisis);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious arrhythmias, or&#xD;
                  coronary artery disease, as complications due to small MPH-related increases in&#xD;
                  heart rate and blood pressure may be of concern in these populations;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of a suicide attempt in the past year;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychotic or bipolar disorders, due to the risk of psychotic or manic symptom&#xD;
                  exacerbation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent use of medications for erectile dysfunction (e.g., tadalafil,&#xD;
                  sildenafil), due to an increased risk of priapism;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of medications that may lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, immediate&#xD;
                  release bupropion);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known allergy to methylphenidate;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of narcotic or other sedating medications within 6 hours of testing (i.e.,&#xD;
                  diphenhydramine), which may interfere with cognition;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent severe major medical illness (e.g., cancer requiring chemotherapy or&#xD;
                  resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CONTROLS *DO NOT UNDERGO ANY DRUG OR PLACEBO INTERVENTION Two additional subject&#xD;
             groups will be included, to control for effects of repeated testing in the open-label&#xD;
             extension phase: healthy subjects and epilepsy patients without cognitive complaints,&#xD;
             who will not receive the study drug at any point during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Epilepsy patients without cognitive complaints must otherwise meet all of the above&#xD;
        inclusion criteria, and will be excluded for the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other progressive neurologic illness (i.e., malignant brain tumor). A benign, stable&#xD;
             neoplasm with no plans for resection will not be cause for exclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol or illicit drug abuse within the past year. This information may be obtained&#xD;
             by self-report, from the referring physician or by medical record. Subjects will also&#xD;
             undergo urine drug testing at the baseline visit. Chronic, stable use of marijuana&#xD;
             will not be cause for exclusion. In cases of intermittent, recreational use, it will&#xD;
             be required that subjects refrain from marijuana for 2 weeks prior to testing.&#xD;
             Cannabidiol use will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Generalized tonic-clonic or other generalized motor seizure(s) within 48 hours or&#xD;
             focal-onset seizures with impaired awareness within 24 hours of neuropsychological&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Capacity to provide informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to live independently and complete activities of daily living;&#xD;
&#xD;
