  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this prospective mixed-method interview study are to use&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews in parents of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to describe&#xD;
      parental attitudes of research involving genomic sequencing, including concerns about&#xD;
      participation and expectations from researchers and to use surveys to quantitatively measure&#xD;
      genetic/genomic knowledge, trust in health care provider, and literacy/numeracy ability in&#xD;
      parents of children with SCD and adolescents with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope to use the results of the planned surveys and interviews to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of misunderstanding about DNA and genetic research and build strong relationships&#xD;
      between SCD families and researchers in the future, and to design educational information and&#xD;
      study materials that will help parents with children with SCD understand important details&#xD;
      about DNA and genetic research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical gap in knowledge regarding the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of&#xD;
      parents around clinical research trials involving genomic sequencing of children with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease (SCD). SCD primarily affects children of African American (Black) race;&#xD;
      institutionally we have found differences in enrollment on genomic sequencing trials (G4K&#xD;
      (NCT02530658), PG4KDS) with patients identifying as black more likely to decline enrollment.&#xD;
      Enrollment on SCCRIP (NCT02098863), a biobank study for children with SCD is high (92.3%),&#xD;
      indicating that potential genomic research does not appear to concern many families with SCD.&#xD;
      Given the rising prevalence of clinical research involving genomic sequencing in pediatric&#xD;
      SCD, coupled with the increasing likelihood that sequencing will be required for enrollment&#xD;
      on therapeutic drug or gene therapy trials, there is a clear need for research to better&#xD;
      understand stakeholder concerns and expectations around genomic sequencing in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of children with SCD and adolescent patients will be approached to complete a short&#xD;
      survey during a routine clinic visit, in the medicine room or in-patient. Survey questions&#xD;
      will be administered at the time of the informed consent conversation. Those who agree will&#xD;
      be given a paper survey or an ipad to complete survey items which focus on genetic/genomic&#xD;
      knowledge, trust in health care provider, and literacy/numeracy ability in parents of&#xD;
      children with SCD and adolescents with SCD. Participants also have the option to have&#xD;
      questions read to them or they can take the survey on paper. Completion of the survey is&#xD;
      expected to take &lt; 30 minutes. Patient and parent can complete surveys simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of parents completing surveys, a subset will be approached for a private (in person or&#xD;
      virtual) semi-structured interview. Participants willing to be interviewed will be&#xD;
      interviewed at either the same study visit or at a future visit if this is more convenient&#xD;
      for the participant. The interview guide (member of the study team) will ask questions&#xD;
      designed to first assess parental perceptions about clinical research then begin to focus on&#xD;
      parental attitudes, beliefs, and expectations around research involving clinical genomics.&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted on-site at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in a private,&#xD;
      quiet area. The interview should last 30-60 minutes and will be audio recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some survey or interview study visits may occur remotely.&#xD;
