  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphomas are the most common haemopathic malignancy. The 3 most common types are diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). In these&#xD;
      three subtypes, the treatment strategy is most often curative. The therapeutic strategy is&#xD;
      guided by PET (positron emission tomography), which optimises the risk-benefit balance&#xD;
      between the efficacy and toxicity of the treatment and makes it possible to limit the&#xD;
      intensity of treatment for good responders and to intensify the treatment of poor responders&#xD;
      with a worse prognosis. PET therefore plays a central role in the pre-therapeutic evaluation&#xD;
      of the disease and in the assessment of response to treatment. However, other complementary&#xD;
      approaches could improve characterization prior to initiating lymphoma t-treatment and&#xD;
      individual patient management during treatment and beyond. In DLBCL, it has been shown that&#xD;
      the risk of relapse of good and bad responders is decreased by combining the PET response&#xD;
      with a reduction in the amount of tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, i.e. the genetic program of&#xD;
      lymphoma cells that circulates freely in the blood. This evaluation of ctDNA has been made&#xD;
      possible by the development of innovative techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS). In lymphomas, several approaches have been developed, the most sensitive and promising&#xD;
      being CAPP-Seq (CAncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing) developed at Stanford&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore useful to study the description of ctDNA in the 3 types of lymphomas and to&#xD;
      analyse the progression profiles under treatment by trying to establish the major potential&#xD;
      usefulness of these techniques: modifying treatment in case of poor response based on ctDNA&#xD;
      +/- and PET, detecting relapses earlier than at present in patients without any other sign of&#xD;
      relapse (clinical, blood or PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project presented here aims to build a collection of plasma samples taken before&#xD;
      treatment, during treatment and during the first 2 years of follow-up in patients with one of&#xD;
      the 3 most frequent types of lymphoma and undergoing curative treatment. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that sequential evaluation of ctDNA could improve the individualized management of future&#xD;
      patients based on the results generated by the analyses of patients in this cohort.&#xD;
