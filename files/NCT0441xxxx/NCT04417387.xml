    <textblock>
      The Genetics and Vascular Health Check study (GENVASC) is a large study run in conjunction&#xD;
      with Clinical Commissioning Groups and Primary Care practices across Leicester,&#xD;
      Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. The purpose of GENVASC is to help determine whether&#xD;
      gathering genetic information can improve the prediction of risk of Coronary Artery Disease&#xD;
      (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, coronary risk scores are used to put individuals into low (&lt;10%), medium (10-20%)&#xD;
      and high (&gt;20%) risk groups to help target prevention in individuals at the highest risk of&#xD;
      developing CAD. While this approach has merit, since the majority of individuals fall into&#xD;
      low or medium risk groups, in absolute terms more people develop CAD in these groups than in&#xD;
      the high risk group (despite their proportional risk being lower). Therefore, improving the&#xD;
      accuracy of risk categorisation for CAD has important public health and clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 5 years there has been remarkable progress in identifying genetic variants that&#xD;
      affect risk of CAD, with much of this work being co-led from Leicester. These discoveries&#xD;
      provide a framework for testing whether the addition of genetic information in the form of a&#xD;
      genetic risk score can improve current risk prediction of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GENVASC study capitalises on the unique opportunity provided by the NHS Health Check&#xD;
      Programme, which is being widely promoted and specifically targets all individuals aged 40-74&#xD;
      years who are free of cardiovascular disease. Consenting participants taking part in the&#xD;
      health check programme are asked to provide an additional sample of blood to subsequently&#xD;
      determine whether the addition of genetic information would have improved prediction of risk&#xD;
      for coronary disease in individuals at low/medium risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date more than 100 GP surgeries in Leicester and Leicestershire are involved in the study,&#xD;
      and recruitment has recently commenced in Northamptonshire . We aim to recruit and follow-up&#xD;
      over 30,000 participants over the course of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the commonest cause of premature death and disability in the&#xD;
      UK. Several demographic and lifestyle factors, such as age, gender, smoking, hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes and dyslipidaemia contribute to risk of CAD. A number of CAD prediction risk&#xD;
      algorithms based on these factors, such as the Framingham and the QRisk2 scores have been&#xD;
      developed and allow classification of individuals into low (&lt; 10%), medium (10-20%) and high&#xD;
      (&gt; 20%) 10-year CAD risk. These risk scores have been used to identify and target primary&#xD;
      prevention measures to those at highest risk. While targeting such individuals is clearly&#xD;
      beneficial, because many more subjects are located in the intermediate or low risk&#xD;
      categories, although their proportional risk is lower, in absolute terms more events actually&#xD;
      occur in these groups. Improving the accuracy of risk categorisation for CAD is therefore a&#xD;
      high public health and clinical priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inheritance plays an important role in the aetiology of CAD. The risk to an individual is 4-8&#xD;
      fold higher if a first degree relative has died prematurely of CAD. The heritability of CAD&#xD;
      is estimated at around 50%. In some, especially more recent risk scores, a &quot;family history&quot;&#xD;
      of CAD is included in the algorithm. However, identifying a positive family history due to&#xD;
      inheritance has significant limitations. Family history based on recall can be notoriously&#xD;
      inaccurate. Algorithms vary in the age cut-off used to define a positive family history.&#xD;
      Furthermore, an individual's family may not be sufficiently large (e.g. no siblings) to&#xD;
      assess familial risk, family members could have died from competing causes (e.g. cancer or&#xD;
      road traffic accidents) before manifesting CAD, or could have developed CAD but due to a&#xD;
      strong lifestyle factor such as heavy smoking. In short, although a family history of CAD can&#xD;
      be useful it is neither a sufficient or accurate surrogate for an individual's genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, significant progress has been made in directly dissecting the genetic basis of CAD.&#xD;
      In work led by the Principal Investigator in collaboration with national and international&#xD;
      collaborators, over 30 common genetic variants (carried by between 10-80% of the population)&#xD;
      have been identified that increase risk of CAD by between 5-30% per copy of each variant.&#xD;
      Further variants are likely to emerge in on-going work and especially lower frequency&#xD;
      variants that have more powerful effects. Individually, the genetic variants do not have&#xD;
      sufficient discrimination to individually change risk prediction sufficiently. However, a&#xD;
      Genetic Risk Score (GRS) based on combining the variants (adjusted for their individual&#xD;
      effects) could be more powerful. Indeed, in a recent study we showed that there was a &gt;&#xD;
      3-fold difference in odds ratio for CAD between those subjects in the highest quintile&#xD;
      compared with those in the lowest quintile for a GRS score based on 25 of the initially&#xD;
      identified CAD-associated variants. This is similar to or greater than the strength of&#xD;
      association seen with other established risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol.&#xD;
      Addition of further variants as they are discovered to the GRS is likely to further improve&#xD;
      its risk prediction potential. Therefore, recent discoveries on the basis of CAD now provide&#xD;
      a framework for testing whether adding genetic information in the form of a genetic risk&#xD;
      score can improve current risk prediction of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether a GRS for CAD can improve risk prediction requires assembling a large cohort&#xD;
      of individuals representative of the general population who are: (i) free of overt CAD at&#xD;
      recruitment (ii) who are assessed in a uniform fashion for their CAD risk (iii) and who can&#xD;
      provide blood samples for genetic analysis and (iv) who can be followed up systematically for&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) outcomes. Such cohorts are rare nationally and internationally.&#xD;
      Biobank UK (at a cost of &gt; Â£30 million) has been established to address this deficiency&#xD;
      although one of its limitations is that it is not representative of the general population.&#xD;
      One of the key factors that inhibits the assembly of such cohorts solely for research&#xD;
      purposes is the huge initial cost of setting up the infrastructure required to recruit a&#xD;
      sufficiently large sample size. In this context, the recently initiated Department of Health&#xD;
      NHS Vascular Health Check Programme provides a unique opportunity to establish such a cohort&#xD;
      as all individuals in the appropriate age range (40-74 years) free of CVD are being invited&#xD;
      to their general practices for a Vascular Health Check. The large number of subjects that&#xD;
      will be assessed in a systematic manner for cardiovascular risk and who will all have blood&#xD;
      samples routinely collected for lipid profiling provides an ideal scenario to add a research&#xD;
      project that can help determine whether a GRS will be useful in predicting CAD risk. In&#xD;
      short, the Vascular Health Check programme provides a unique opportunity to test, in a major&#xD;
      way and at a marginal cost, whether in the future adding genetic information will improve CAD&#xD;
      risk prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Addition of genetic information in the form of a Genetic Risk Score based on&#xD;
      recent discoveries of genetic variants that associate with CAD will improve risk prediction&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the GENVASC Study is to recruit (with informed consent) subjects who attend&#xD;
      their GP practices to have a Vascular Health Check. Subjects will be asked to consent to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing blood samples for research (in most cases taken at the same time as clinical&#xD;
           samples for their vascular check).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow the GENVASC research database to hold semi-anonymised (no identifiable names) data&#xD;
           on their CVD risk score calculated using conventional algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To allow the database to be periodically updated with any CVD outcomes via GP practice&#xD;
           databases as well as from appropriate national registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To allow their stored samples be used for DNA and other analyses (again anonymised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GENVASC Study will not interfere with the primary clinical imperative of the Vascular&#xD;
      Health Check Programme. It will retrospectively analyse whether addition of a GRS would have&#xD;
      improved CAD risk prediction.&#xD;
