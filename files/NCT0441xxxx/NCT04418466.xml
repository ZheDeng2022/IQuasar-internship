Scores for 3 subscales, that is, for positive subscale (sum of the scores of all 7 items) and negative subscale (sum of the scores of all 7 items) ranges from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology), and for the general psychopathology subscale (sum of the scores of all 16 items) score ranges from 16 (absent) to 112 (extreme psychopathology)</description>
