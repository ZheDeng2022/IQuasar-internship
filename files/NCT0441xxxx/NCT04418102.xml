  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the removal of trans fats from our foods, the food industry now uses&#xD;
      interesterified (IE) fats. Randomly interesterified (IE) fats rich in palmitic (Europe) and&#xD;
      stearic (North America) acids are the most commonly used IE fats by the food industry.&#xD;
      Despite their widespread use, there has been no published research on the acute and chronic&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic health effects of the most commonly consumed palmitic and stearic acid rich&#xD;
      IE fats. The aim of InterSat is to investigate the postprandial and chronic effects of a diet&#xD;
      rich in IE fats on cardiometabolic health.&#xD;

      Choice of design: A randomised crossover study with two arms, each arm consisting of a 6-week&#xD;
      dietary intervention, separated by a 3-week (minimum) washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy adult snackers aged 35-65 years. 48 participants in total, 24 at&#xD;
      each centre (see Locations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Research Unit, Franklin-Wilkins Building, Waterloo Campus, King College London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Research Unit Maastricht, Academic Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Assessment: Prospective participants will be selected based on the defined&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study management team. Recruitment will be done over&#xD;
      the phone and via the Internet and emails and prospective participants will be booked in for&#xD;
      their initial appointment to acquire baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: A 2-week run-in period, two 6-week dietary interventions, and a 3-week&#xD;
      (minimum) washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention: The InterSat intervention aims to provide 10% of total daily energy&#xD;
      intake in the form of IE fat. These will be consumed in the form of muffins and spreads,&#xD;
      designed to replace typically consumed snacks and spreads throughout the day. Energy&#xD;
      requirements will be calculated using the Henry equation and physical activity levels (PAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, participants will have and anthropometric measures and fasted blood&#xD;
      samples taken, and will be assessed for endothelial function via flow mediated dilation&#xD;
      (FMD), after which they will be provided with enough muffins and spread for a 2-week period,&#xD;
      as well a study booklet (containing instructions and a diary to log muffin and spread&#xD;
      consumption). They will receive guidance on how to incorporate the muffins and spread into&#xD;
      their diet. Food collection dates will be set, and participants are then free to leave. At&#xD;
      the second visit (first snack collection visit), no physical measures are taken, but the&#xD;
      empty tubs and muffin cases are collected, and the study booklet is checked by a researcher&#xD;
      to ensure the participant is compliant to the intervention. Any issues should be discussed,&#xD;
      and guidance given to increase compliance if necessary. Another snack collection visit is&#xD;
      booked. At the end of the 6-week intervention, participants will undergo physical and blood&#xD;
      sampling as well as FMD, as with the baseline testing day. After a 3-week (minimum) washout&#xD;
      period, the same procedures occur for the other arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Weight, height, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, body fat will be&#xD;
      taken using standard procedures, in duplicates by a trained researcher at all face to face&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Habitual food intake: Participants will complete the EPIC (European prospective investigation&#xD;
      of cancer) food frequency questionnaire at the screening visit. They will also complete three&#xD;
      4-day diet diaries (one at the run-in period and one in each of the dietary intervention&#xD;
      periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Fasting blood samples will be collected from a superficial antecubital vein&#xD;
      via venepuncture before and after each dietary intervention. Postprandial blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken via cannulation in a subgroup (see Subgroup below) for an 8-hour postprandial test&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record and monitor the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of muffins and spread consumed (study booklet). Habitual intake (4-day diet diaries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup: A subset (n = 24) of participants will undergo a postprandial test day at the&#xD;
      baseline and 6-week points of each intervention arm. After baseline samples (anthropometrics,&#xD;
      blood samples, FMD) are taken, participants will consume a breakfast containing a large bolus&#xD;
      of the IE fat they are assigned to. Blood samples will be taken over an 8-hour testing period&#xD;
      and FMD will be taken 2 more times. Liver fat will be assessed via MRI imaging (Maastricht&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
