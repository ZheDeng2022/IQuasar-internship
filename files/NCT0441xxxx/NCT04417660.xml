    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases of the thymus. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard treatment for these diseases. But in many cases, the disease returns after&#xD;
      treatment. Researchers want to see if a new drug can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if bintrafusp alfa (M7824) is an effective treatment for thymoma and thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have thymoma or thymic cancer and their disease returned or&#xD;
      progressed after treatment with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy treatment plan,&#xD;
      or they have refused standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol. Their medical, medicine, and&#xD;
      treatment history will be reviewed. They will have a tumor biopsy if they do not have a&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drug once every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion. For this,&#xD;
      a small plastic tube is put into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of their symptoms and their ability to perform their normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thigh muscle scan (using MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessment (using MRI or CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid gland test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have tumor biopsies. Some of their blood and biopsy samples will be used for&#xD;
      gene testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may take the study drug until their disease worsens or they cannot tolerate&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 2 and 6 weeks after stopping treatment. Then they&#xD;
      will have long-term follow-up visits every 3 months. These may include imaging scans. Visits&#xD;
      may be done by phone, with scans (if needed) done at their doctor s office.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymic&#xD;
      epithelial tumors (TETs). However more than half of these patients experience disease&#xD;
      recurrence and require second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no approved drugs for treatment of recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma and new&#xD;
      therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease progression on or after&#xD;
      platinum-containing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have demonstrated the safety and clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibition in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent TETs. In an ongoing trial (NCT03076554) we have shown that avelumab,&#xD;
      an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody, induces major responses and has an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination immunotherapy is under evaluation for treatment of various cancers but has not&#xD;
      been studied for the treatment of TETs. Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis can be&#xD;
      combined with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines and anti-cytokine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein that targets PD-L1 and transforming growth&#xD;
      factor-b (TGF-b) has shown activity against heavily pre-treated solid tumors including&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective analysis of pre-chemotherapy tissue obtained from 20 patients with stage IV&#xD;
      thymic carcinoma and 13 cases of stage III/IV thymoma, showed TGF-b expression in 65% cases&#xD;
      of thymic carcinoma and 15% cases of thymoma with a lower median survival among patients with&#xD;
      thymic carcinoma (30 months versus 63 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a phase I clinical trial, treatment with bintrafusp alfa resulted in a brief&#xD;
      period of disease stabilization and no immune-related adverse events in one patient with&#xD;
      heavily pre-treated, WHO subtype B3 thymoma with a large disease burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further investigation of Bintrafusp alfa in patients with recurrent TETs is needed to define&#xD;
      the clinical activity and safety of this drug in patients with TETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the objective response rate (ORR) to bintrafusp alfa in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (Bullet) age 18 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable thymoma or&#xD;
      thymic carcinoma who have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease prior to study entry or participants who have&#xD;
      refused chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive and measurable disease prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      No history of autoimmune disease, with exception of vitiligo, autoimmune thyroid disease, or&#xD;
      pure red cell aplasia that are adequately managed with medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-arm, phase II study to determine the clinical activity of treatment&#xD;
      with Bintrafusp alfa in participants with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa will be administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously once every two weeks&#xD;
      until disease progression or development of intolerable adverse events. The two-week period&#xD;
      will constitute one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design will be used to rule out unacceptably low&#xD;
      response rate of 20% in favor of an improved response rate of 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in 2 disease cohorts, thymoma and thymic carcinoma, with up to&#xD;
      17 evaluable participants of each tumor type. Accrual ceiling will be set at 38 participants&#xD;
      to account for inevaluable participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have completed 12 months of treatment with an ongoing response or disease&#xD;
      stability (for &gt; 6 months) will be given an option of discontinuing active treatment with the&#xD;
      ability to reinstitute treatment on one occasion if radiological or clinical disease activity&#xD;
      is noted during follow-up. All eligibility criteria should be met at the time of restarting&#xD;
      treatment with bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed after completion of every third cycle (6 weeks) using&#xD;
      modified immune-related RECIST criteria. When possible, an optional tumor biopsy will be&#xD;
      conducted pre-treatment, after 3 doses in participants responding to treatment or at 6 weeks,&#xD;
      whichever is sooner, to evaluate treatment-related, intra-tumoral changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives include immune correlative studies to analyze immune cell subsets,&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression and evaluation of soluble factors and intra-tumoral changes before and after&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa treatment.&#xD;

             and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization or who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. If necessary, to confirm postmenopausal status an FSH level will be&#xD;
             included at screening. The effects of Bintrafusp alfa on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for at least 2&#xD;
             months after the last dose of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with previously treated brain or CNS metastases are eligible provided&#xD;
             that the subject has recovered from any acute side effects of radiotherapy and does&#xD;
             not require treatment with steroids, and any whole brain radiation therapy was&#xD;
             completed at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylaxis or recent (within 5 months) history of uncontrollable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1-directed immune checkpoint blockade is not&#xD;
             permitted. Prior treatment with other immunomodulating drugs such as cancer vaccines&#xD;
             is permitted based on investigators discretion as long as treatment was not&#xD;
             discontinued due to life-threatening adverse events (laboratory abnormalities alone&#xD;
             with prior therapy will not exclude participants from this trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior anticancer treatment within 14 days before treatment (e.g., cytoreductive&#xD;
             therapy, radiotherapy [with the exception of palliative bone directed radiotherapy],&#xD;
             immune therapy, or cytokine therapy except for erythropoietin); major surgery within&#xD;
             14 days before treatment (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy); prior systemic therapy&#xD;
             (or 5 half-lives of a drug, whichever is shorter) with immunosuppressive agents within&#xD;
             14 days before treatment; use of hormonal agents for anti-cancer therapy within 7 days&#xD;
             before treatment; or use of any investigational drug within 14 days before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects receiving bisphosphonate or denosumab are eligible provided treatment was&#xD;
        initiated at least 14 days before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous malignant disease within the last 3 years with the following&#xD;
             exceptions: basal or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the skin treated with curative&#xD;
             intent, endoscopically resected GI cancers limited to the mucosal layer without&#xD;
             recurrence in &gt; 1 year, cervical carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             breast, papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma, and superficial/non-muscle invasive&#xD;
             bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active brain or CNS metastases causing clinical symptoms or metastases that require&#xD;
             therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or history of autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an&#xD;
             immune-stimulatory agent, with the exception of diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis,&#xD;
             autoimmune thyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment, or pure red cell&#xD;
             aplasia that are adequately managed with medical therapy. In addition,&#xD;
             anti-acetylcholine receptor binding and anti-striational antibodies will be checked&#xD;
             during screening and participants will be ineligible if results are positive, even if&#xD;
             there is no clinical history of autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving systemic corticosteroids at doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone&#xD;
             equivalent will be excluded. However, participants on inhaled steroids and adrenal&#xD;
             replacement steroid doses up to 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in&#xD;
             the absence of autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy or significant acute or chronic infections&#xD;
             including, among others:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening&#xD;
                  (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test&#xD;
                  positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known history of testing positive for HIV or testing positive for HIV at&#xD;
                  screening or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive TET participants are ineligible because of the risk of developing&#xD;
        opportunistic infections after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally,&#xD;
        TET participants are at higher risk of developing opportunistic infections due to&#xD;
        underlying immune defects. Prior cases of disseminated herpes virus, cytomegalovirus and&#xD;
        fungal infections have been documented in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation,&#xD;
             Participants who have had prior transplants that do not require immunosuppression are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 5 Grade &gt; 1); however,&#xD;
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade &lt;= 2, or other Grade &lt;= 2 not constituting a safety&#xD;
             risk based on investigator s judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unwilling to accept blood products as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             Bintrafusp alfa is in the class of agents known as antineoplastics/monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with Bintrafusp alfa, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with Bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, cerebral&#xD;
             vascular accident/stroke &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment, myocardial infarction &lt; 6&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements. All other severe acute or chronic medical&#xD;
             conditions including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis,&#xD;
             drug-induced pneumonitis requiring oral or IV steroids, interstitial lung disease,&#xD;
             pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year)&#xD;
             or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase&#xD;
             the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
             Participants with history of bleeding diathesis or recent major bleeding events&#xD;
             considered by the Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment are&#xD;
             also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to treatment, with the exception&#xD;
             of vaccination against COVID-19&#xD;
