  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect biological samples from pregnant women and their&#xD;
      babies and to collect data on long-term health, school outcomes, and the use of state and&#xD;
      county services. The information learned from this study may help identify important factors&#xD;
      that may influence the health of mothers and babies, both short-and long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Humans pass through more biological milestones during gestation and the first two years of&#xD;
      life (known as the &quot;first 1000 days&quot;) than during any other period of development.&#xD;
      Consequently, both intrinsic biology/physiology and extrinsic factors such as environmental&#xD;
      exposures can have profound impacts on long-term health and disease outcomes. The purpose of&#xD;
      this project is to develop a cohort of mother-infant dyads that can provide a collection of&#xD;
      birth samples and be studied long-term - from pregnancy through early childhood - to help&#xD;
      identify early life factors that influence lifelong health and disease. The study will&#xD;
      include collection of biospecimens from pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy, at&#xD;
      delivery, and within the first few months after giving birth, as well as collection of&#xD;
      biospecimens from the infants at birth and during their first two years of life. In addition&#xD;
      to biospecimens, health information will be collected from the participants' electronic&#xD;
      health records, and via questionnaires to assess health behaviors, social determinants, and&#xD;
      environmental exposures. Participants may also consent for yearly review of state&#xD;
      administrative data, including educational data, social services, and vital records. The&#xD;
      biospecimens and data collected in this study will allow for assessment of the impact of&#xD;
      different factors during pregnancy and early childhood on long-term health and well-being.&#xD;
