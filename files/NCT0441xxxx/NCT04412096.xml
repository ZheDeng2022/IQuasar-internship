  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness. The inability to predict a patient's IOP response to&#xD;
      medications is a critical barrier for the clinician to consistently provide highly effective&#xD;
      IOP-based treatments. Current trial-and-error approaches to glaucoma management are&#xD;
      inefficient and have not addressed this barrier as there are no predictive factors for drug&#xD;
      response. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes by identifying biomarkers and&#xD;
      environmental factors that profile a patient at risk for glaucoma by age-of-onset, rate of&#xD;
      disease progression, &quot;poor response&quot; to treatment, and large IOP fluctuation. Our purpose of&#xD;
      this research project is to address this critical barrier by focusing on physiological&#xD;
      factors that predict IOP response to drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposal responded to PA-18-351 &quot;Human Subjects Mechanistic and Minimal Risk Studies&quot;&#xD;
      and qualifies as a clinical trial. The central hypothesis is that variations in IOP response&#xD;
      to glaucoma drugs and IOP fluctuation can be predicted by the aqueous humor dynamic (AHD)&#xD;
      factors that regulate IOP. This hypothesis will be tested in up to 200 participants with&#xD;
      ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG). This hypothesis will be tested in two&#xD;
      aims: Aim 1, Test the hypothesis that AHD factors predict the IOP drug response; Aim 2, Test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that aqueous flow and outflow facility predict IOP fluctuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine which AHD factors predict a participant's IOP drug response and&#xD;
      IOP fluctuation. The scientific rationale is that AHD parameters (aqueous flow, outflow&#xD;
      facility, episcleral venous pressure, and uveoscleral flow) determine drug response and IOP&#xD;
      fluctuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is IOP response to glaucoma drugs. Exploratory outcome measures include&#xD;
      IOP fluctuation and the AHD measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes participants who have either OHT or OAG. The inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria described in 5.3, Study Population. The goal is to recruit 150-200&#xD;
      participants over 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs and instruments used in this study have been FDA approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three sites will enroll participants: Mayo Clinic, The Ohio State University, and University&#xD;
      of Nebraska Medical Center. All sites have experience and expertise with AHD studies in&#xD;
      humans. These study team members have productive collaborations during AHD studies in&#xD;
      controls during the prior NIH funding period. There are no sites outside of the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design is a prospective, open-label, clinical trial with randomized cross&#xD;
      over treatment using the topical glaucoma medications, timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005%.&#xD;
      Timolol 0.5% is a beta-blocker and will be dosed as one drop two times a day. Latanoprost&#xD;
      0.005% is a prostaglandin analogue and will be dosed as one drop daily in the evening. The&#xD;
      treatment order will depend on randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHD measurements are performed at baseline without glaucoma medications. The AHD measurements&#xD;
      include IOP, aqueous humor flow, outflow facility, and episcleral venous pressure.&#xD;
      Uveoscleral outflow is calculated. Some participants who are already taking glaucoma&#xD;
      medications will be washed out in order to assess baseline AHD measurements. An IOP safety&#xD;
      check will be scheduled for those who are washed out of their glaucoma Rx. After baseline AHD&#xD;
      measurements, the AHD measurements are repeated after each of the 7-day drug interventions to&#xD;
      determine the effect of the drug treatment on AHD variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are six study visits, Visits 1 - 6, that include clinical testing, surveys, and AHD&#xD;
      procedures (see 1.2 Schema). Participants will be trained to use the Icare® HOME tonometer to&#xD;
      measure IOP outside of clinic to assess IOP fluctuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, open-label, randomized order of 7-days treatments with&#xD;
      timolol 0.5% (1 drop two times daily) followed by a washout period and then with latanoprost&#xD;
      0.005% (1 drop daily in the evening) or vice versa. These are referred to as Tx 1 and Tx 2.&#xD;
      IOP safety checks during washout are included for those already taking glaucoma Rx upon&#xD;
      entering the study. IOP response will be determined to each of these medications. AHD factors&#xD;
      will be determined for both study treatments using tonometry, fluorophotometry, tonography,&#xD;
      and episcleral venomanometry. IOP fluctuation will be assessed using the FDA-approved Icare®&#xD;
      HOME tonometer. All test procedures and drugs are FDA approved. There are no experimental&#xD;
      tests or agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes and power calculations provide rigor to test the hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A REDCap database is populated from data on case report forms (CRF), surveys, and the Icare®&#xD;
      HOME tonometer. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics of central tendencies and&#xD;
      dispersion, and regression methods in order to understand the individual data in the&#xD;
      distribution of the cohort.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The overall study design is a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial with randomized order of 7-day treatments with timolol followed by a washout period and then with latanoprost or vice versa. Participants will undergo two 7-day treatments, with timolol 0.5% (1 drop two times daily) and latanoprost 0.005% (1 drop daily in the evening). The order of timolol and latanoprost will be randomized. The IOP, AHD parameters and IOP fluctuation will be compared in an individual under three conditions: (i) baseline, and after a randomized order of 7-day treatment of (ii) timolol 0.5% 1 drop two times daily and (iii) latanoprost 0.005% 1 drop in the evening separated by a 6-week washout period. The overall time commitment to complete these procedures is three to four months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Eye pressure is a steady state quantitative trait that is measured in mm Hg. Eye pressure is determined by the following physiological factors (units of measure): eye fluid or aqueous humor production (microliters/minute), aqueous humor outflow (microliters/minute), outflow resistance (microliters/minute/mm Hg) and venous pressure (mm Hg) of the eye. All of these physiological factors will be determined under baseline condition and under glaucoma drug treatment.</description>
