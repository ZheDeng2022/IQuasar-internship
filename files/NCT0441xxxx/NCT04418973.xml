  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dyspnea is a common symptom in patients with many respiratory diseases particularly&#xD;
      chronic obstructive airway diseases, but also cardiovascular pathologies, obesity, or also in&#xD;
      the deconditioned healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Called volatolom corresponds to the set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contained in&#xD;
      exhaled air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of volatolom can be done either by the methods based on mass spectrometry which&#xD;
      allows the identification of each VOC in the exhaled air or by the use of electronic noses&#xD;
      which are more simple to use, less specific and produce a quantitive signal change based on&#xD;
      pattern recognition algorithms providing a global profile of the VOC without identifying&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the analysis of VOCs in exhaled air would&#xD;
      identify biomarkers related to the intensity and type of experimental dyspnea.&#xD;
