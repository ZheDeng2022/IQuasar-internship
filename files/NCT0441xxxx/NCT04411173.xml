  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of isocaloric and isonitrogenous (2 x&#xD;
      15-gram) doses of rice protein or whey protein to stimulate resistance training adaptations&#xD;
      in young, healthy, resistance-trained men.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted using a randomized, double-blind approach with individuals being&#xD;
      provided two doses of either 15 grams of rice or 15 grams of whey protein over an 8-week&#xD;
      supplementation period while completing a heavy resistance training. One dose will be&#xD;
      ingested within one hour of completing each workout and the other dose will be ingested&#xD;
      within an hour of going to bed. On non-workout days, one dose of 30 grams will be ingested&#xD;
      within 60 minutes of going to bed. The resistance training protocol will follow a linear&#xD;
      periodization, split-body resistance training design consisting of two upper body and two&#xD;
      lower body workouts each week resulting in each muscle group being trained twice each week.&#xD;
      To minimize the influence of training experience and any learning effect, individuals with at&#xD;
      least 12 months of resistance training history will be recruited. Participants will also be&#xD;
      required to complete a two-week lead-in period (8 total workouts) before beginning the&#xD;
      supplementation regimen to become accustomed to the training program and to account for any&#xD;
      early neurological adaptations. Participants will then continue to follow the resistance&#xD;
      training program for an additional 8 weeks. To assess the efficacy of the two different forms&#xD;
      of protein supplementation on resistance training adaptations, changes in fat-free, lean, and&#xD;
      fat mass will be determined using DEXA. Maximal strength and endurance of both upper and&#xD;
      lower-body muscle groups will be determined while anaerobic capacity markers will be measured&#xD;
      with the completion of a Wingate anaerobic capacity test. Participants will also be provided&#xD;
      nutritional recommendations in order to ensure adequate energy and macronutrient consumption&#xD;
      to facilitate positive training adaptations and eliminate any potential influence of&#xD;
      differing dietary intakes.&#xD;
