  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, the primary objective is to investigate the effect of multiple doses of&#xD;
      itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single dose of&#xD;
      ASTX660.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the primary objective is to investigate the effect of a single dose of ASTX660 on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam and its metabolite, 1-hydroxy&#xD;
      midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of a single dose of ASTX660 in the absence and presence of multiple&#xD;
      doses of the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole and in the presence of a single dose of the CYP3A4&#xD;
      substrate midazolam will also be evaluated.&#xD;
