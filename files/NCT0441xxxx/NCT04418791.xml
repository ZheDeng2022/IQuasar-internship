  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complexity of psoriasis is partially affected by dietary effects, and some diets have&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial in psoriasis. Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve many of&#xD;
      these disturbances, even inflammatory parameters such as TNF and CRP. Individuals with&#xD;
      psoriasis have been reported to have impaired intestinal integrity and it has been suggested&#xD;
      that gut health affects skin health, pointing towards a gut-skin axis. Understanding how&#xD;
      dietary lifestyles can affect epithelial lineages such as the skin and gut, will greatly&#xD;
      improve our understanding on the development of psoriasis. Modified intermittent fasting&#xD;
      (MIF) of 2 non-consecutive days has shown to have positive metabolic effects, yet its effect&#xD;
      on gut and skin remains underexplored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the role of gut health, more specifically the intestinal barrier, in individuals&#xD;
      with psoriasis and the effects of fasting on both organs in a prospective cohort cross-over&#xD;
      study. The investigators will test whether MIF can improve (i) skin lesions (clinical and&#xD;
      molecular level), (ii) intestinal integrity markers such as zonulin, IFABP and sCD14, and&#xD;
      (iii) the timing of these improvements. As such, it can be determined whether fasting&#xD;
      benefits psoriasis and gut health. MIF will consist of a limited calorie uptake of 500 kcal&#xD;
      for 2 days a week. The remaining days of the week are as usual. Gut and skin health will be&#xD;
      tested at the molecular level during 12 weeks with another crossover of 12 weeks (alternating&#xD;
      between MIF and usual diet).&#xD;
