  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the benefit of treatment with a physician administered intracanalicular&#xD;
      dexamethasone insert in evaporative dry eye disease (DED) patients with meibomian gland&#xD;
      disfunction (MGD) and underlying inflammation undergoing LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, non-randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical&#xD;
      study seeks to investigate the benefit of managing patients with DED secondary to MGD with a&#xD;
      sustained release intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insert in addition to LipiFlow&#xD;
      Thermal Pulsation compared to LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation alone. In addition, this study will&#xD;
      evaluate the ease of Dextenza insertion and the patient preference for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening a given patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and gaining informed&#xD;
      consent, each eye will undergo LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation on the same day. The most&#xD;
      symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZAÂ® insertion on the day of the procedure&#xD;
      (study eye), while the other eye will be assigned to a receive a sham punctum dilation&#xD;
      (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic difference, the right eye will receive the&#xD;
      intracanalicular insert. Per patient, the study period will last for approximately 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the LipiFlow procedure, consisting of one screening visit, one treatment v4isit and 3&#xD;
      post-procedure follow-up visits (week 1, week 4 and week 12). At week 1, week 4 and week 12,&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed alongside standard-of-care procedures.&#xD;
      Adjusting for enrollment period, the study will last a total of approximately 4 months.&#xD;
