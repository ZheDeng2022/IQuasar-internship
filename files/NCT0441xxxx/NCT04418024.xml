      ** See updated study design under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04882735. **&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), also called &quot;Familial Transthyretin-Mediated&#xD;
      Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP)&quot; is a hereditary condition caused by mutations in the TTR gene.&#xD;
      It is estimated that around 10,000 people in the world are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ATTR-PN, amyloid builds up in the nerves that detect temperature, pain, and touch.&#xD;
      Patients with ATTR-PN can experience a loss of sensation, tingling, numbness, or pain in the&#xD;
      hands and feet (also called peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study Eidos is researching the investigational drug AG10 800mg (2 tablets)&#xD;
      administered orally twice a day. Through the study, Eidos wants to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of AG10 in patients with ATTR-PN versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 18 month, placebo-controlled study. This means that, during the 18 month study,&#xD;
      investigators conducting the research and study participants will not know whether the study&#xD;
      participant is receiving AG10 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the difference between AG10 and placebo groups in the&#xD;
      Modified Neurologic Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) at 18 months of treatment versus baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 18 months, participants may be eligible to receive investigational AG10, and&#xD;
      there is no placebo. This is called an &quot;open label extension.&quot; This part of the study may&#xD;
      help us better understand the safety related to taking AG10 over a longer period of time.&#xD;
