  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an single arm, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of using&#xD;
      the combination of Camrelizumab with apatinib as second-line therapy for advanced PDAC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the heavy chain is&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the light chain is immunoglobulin κ (IgK). Camrelizumab&#xD;
      specifically binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand (PD-L1),&#xD;
      allowing T cells to recover against tumor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response，disease&#xD;
      control rate, drugs related side effects were recorded and analyzed, to assess the&#xD;
      combination treatment could or couldn't benefit the patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
