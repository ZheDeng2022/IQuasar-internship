  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for&#xD;
      which no standard treatment is available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation, first-in-human study will assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a, determine the maximum tolerated dose of DS-1055a,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of DS-1055a, and the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)&#xD;
      against DS-1055a and other antibodies.&#xD;
