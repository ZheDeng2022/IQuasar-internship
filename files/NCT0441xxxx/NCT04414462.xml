    <textblock>
      Exergames showed beneficial effects than conventional exercises for gaze stability, balance&#xD;
      and gait improvements in older individuals. Further studies should be conducted to explore&#xD;
      the benefits of exergames on older adults. This study aims to explore that exergaming has&#xD;
      more effects on gaze stability, balance and gait performance of older individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to a recent report by 2050, the global adult population between the age 65 and&#xD;
      above is expected to increase to 28%. A total of 12.13 million people in Pakistan are above&#xD;
      age of 60, which is expected to raise to 17.53 million by 2025. A high quality of life as&#xD;
      well as longevity is considered important in older adults.However, characteristics of aging&#xD;
      include a decrease in muscle strength, balance and decreased vestibular functions can lead to&#xD;
      falls and compromise good health in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular rehabilitation is an exercised based program intended to alleviate both primary&#xD;
      and secondary problems caused by vestibular disorders.The main focus of vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation is to use the existing vestibular system for gaze, postural stability and gait&#xD;
      by use of somatosensory and visual cues. Depending on the vestibular disorders three main&#xD;
      types of exercises are used. Habituation Gaze stability exercises ,Balance training.&#xD;
      Habituation exercises are indicated for patients who complain of dizziness during quick head&#xD;
      movements and when they change position like when they bend over or look up to reach above&#xD;
      their head. The goal of habituation exercise is to reduce the dizziness through repeated&#xD;
      exposure to specific movements or visual stimuli that provoke patient's dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaze stability exercises include eyeball movement, saccadic eye movement, pursuit eye&#xD;
      movement, vergence eye movement, vestibular-ocular reflex exercise. These exercises improve&#xD;
      the static balance control thus improves postural control required for vestibular function&#xD;
      and can be mediated by VSR improvements. These exercises are useful in bilateral vestibular&#xD;
      hypofunction. Balance training are used to improve standing, bending, reaching and&#xD;
      performance of dual tasks on even and uneven surfaces. These exercises proved to be effective&#xD;
      in making individuals do activities of daily livings and prevents the risks of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer based technology is becoming popular in rehabilitation. It stimulates learning in&#xD;
      real-life environment and provides a 3-dimensional sensory feedback. A computer-generated&#xD;
      technology allows the user to interact with a virtual world and to make correction during&#xD;
      performing an exercise task. In particular, previous studies have suggested that new&#xD;
      technology, such as the Wii Fit Board (WFB) can be used for balance training using virtual&#xD;
      reality These games have showed repeated good results in vestibular rehabilitation of&#xD;
      elderly.Virtual reality enables the individual to be physically active and provides a&#xD;
      pleasant and motivating way of training in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are literature for the safe and effective use of exergaming in improving gaze&#xD;
      stability, balance and postural control in older individuals Jaap Swanenburg et al concluded&#xD;
      that exergaming is effective in improving gaze stability, balance and postural control in&#xD;
      older adults .Lynne M Taylor showed that active video games proved to be effective in&#xD;
      improving balance and gait in older individuals .J Hashim concluded that Exergames improved&#xD;
      dynamic balance in older adults when compared with conventional exercises.&#xD;

    <measure>Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline balance to 6th Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TUG is a test used to assess a person's mobility. TUG measured the time required for an individual to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk 3 m, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Normal healthy elderly usually completes the task in ten seconds or less. Very frail or weak elderly with poor mobility may take 2 minutes or more.</description>

    <measure>Dynamic Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline vestibular ocular reflex to 6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>It provides an objective and instrumented way of assessing Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)function in response to rotational and functional head movement stimuli. The DVA testing system consisted of a personal computer with a monitor and a velocity sensor which is fixed on a headset to the participant's head. Minimum acceptable head testing velocity was 150â—¦/s.</description>
