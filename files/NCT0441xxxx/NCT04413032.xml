    <textblock>
      The Investigators have developed the dreaMS App, a data communication platform collecting&#xD;
      data from the patients' mobile devices (smartphone and wearables). Through the use of&#xD;
      app-based tests, surveys and sensor data, the Investigators aim to identify novel types of&#xD;
      clinical data that can be used as digital biomarkers with complementary clinical value as&#xD;
      compared to the traditional diagnostic methods and techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study a number of digital biomarkers will be applied to test their&#xD;
      technical reproducibility/stability and meaningfulness to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      causing focal lesions of demyelination and diffuse neurodegeneration in the grey and white&#xD;
      matter of the brain and spinal cord, leading to physical and cognitive disability. Currently&#xD;
      there is a limited number of relevant biomarkers available in patients with MS, such as&#xD;
      clinical, imaging or biological measures. Patient history and neurologic examination in&#xD;
      combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), evoked potentials and analysis of serum&#xD;
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the gold standard of diagnosis and mainly patient history,&#xD;
      neurologic examination and MRI are used for patient monitoring. However, their prognostic&#xD;
      value on a patient level is still very limited. Therefore, the scientific community and&#xD;
      patients are in need for new and more reliable biomarkers, especially biomarkers of disease&#xD;
      progression in order to adapt therapeutic approaches on an individual level. Digital&#xD;
      biomarkers have the potential to fill this gap allowing for quasi-continuous measures that&#xD;
      might be more informative than episodically collected conventional data concerning the impact&#xD;
      of the disease on activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have developed the dreaMS App, a data communication platform collecting&#xD;
      data from the patients' mobile devices (smartphone and wearables). Through the use of&#xD;
      app-based tests, surveys and sensor data, the Investigators aim to identify novel types of&#xD;
      clinical data that can be used as digital biomarkers with complementary clinical value as&#xD;
      compared to the traditional diagnostic methods and techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study a number of digital biomarkers will be applied to test their&#xD;
      technical reproducibility/stability and meaningfulness to patients and to select the most&#xD;
      informative for the planned validation study.&#xD;
