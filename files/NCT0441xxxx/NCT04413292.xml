      Purpose: Survivin is a common member of the inhibitors of the apoptosis protein (IAP) family&#xD;
      with a dual role in promoting cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. Fibulin-3, a&#xD;
      matrix glycoprotein, was recently presented as a promising novel biomarker for malignant&#xD;
      pleural mesothelioma. The aim of this study was to validate the expression levels of survivin&#xD;
      and fibulin-3 in benign and malignant respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: The study included 73 patients, with various benign and malignant&#xD;
      respiratory diseases. For validation of the data, a control group including 20 healthy&#xD;
      subjects was chosen. The clinical and radiological assessments of the included individuals&#xD;
      were done. The serum survivin and fibulin-3 levels were measured using ELISA assays kits,&#xD;
      while their local expressions in the lung and pleura were assessed using western blot&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      Study design and participants The current prospective cohort study has been conducted with 73&#xD;
      patients of both sexes, with recently diagnosed benign and malignant respiratory diseases&#xD;
      recruited from Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and Oncology Departments, Qena University Hospitals,&#xD;
      South Valley University, Egypt. The included patients were categorized into 4 groups. Group A&#xD;
      included 21 patients with lung cancer, group B included 21 patients with various benign lung&#xD;
      diseases, group D included 15 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and group E&#xD;
      included 16 patients having various benign pleural diseases. In addition, 20 age and sex&#xD;
      matched unrelated healthy subjects serve as the control group (group C). Patients with renal&#xD;
      failure, hepatic failure, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, coagulopathy or hemodynamically&#xD;
      unstable were excluded The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt, and it was conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent has been obtained from every included&#xD;
      subject. The study duration was two years from January 1st, 2017 to December 30th, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Full history, thorough clinical examinations were taken for every included&#xD;
      patient. Additionally, radiological assessments by plain CXR and CT, and routine laboratory&#xD;
      investigations (serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, albumin, liver and kidney&#xD;
      functions, ESR and CBC) were performed. Multiple lung biopsies were taken and sent for&#xD;
      histopathological examination when indicated. Thoracentesis was done for cases with proved&#xD;
      pleural effusion. The standard pleural fluid analysis was done including: pH, biochemical&#xD;
      testing of pleura/serum (LDH, glucose, albumin and Adenosine deaminase (ADA), cytology and&#xD;
      microbiological testing (Z-N, L-J culture) and differential cell count) and Light's original&#xD;
      criteria (ratio of pleural fluid/serum protein &gt;0.5, ratio of pleural/serum LDH &gt;0.6 or&#xD;
      pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper limit of normal serum value) to&#xD;
      discriminate exudative from transudative pleural effusions. Thoracoscope was done for&#xD;
      patients with indecisive cytology or pleural fluid analysis, and multiple pleural biopsies&#xD;
      were taken for histopathological examination. The malignant pleural effusion was diagnosed if&#xD;
      pleural fluid cytology or pleural biopsy findings were positive for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging of MPM was done using van Meerbeeck et al, while that of lung cancer was assessed&#xD;
      according to Lim et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and pleural effusion fluid collections Five mls of venous blood was withdrawn&#xD;
      from every included subject using serum separator gel tubes and was allowed to clot at room&#xD;
      temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000g. The separated sera&#xD;
      were stored into aliquots using 1 ml cryotubes at -800C for later biochemical assays of&#xD;
      survivin and fibulin-3. Additionally, 10 ml of pleural fluids from the included patients were&#xD;
      centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000g and stored into aliquots using 1 ml cryotubes at -800C&#xD;
      for later molecular assays of survivin and fibulin-3 expression levels using western blot&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA assays of IGF-I and survivin Quantitative determinations of serum survivin and&#xD;
      fibulin-3 were achieved using commercially available ELISA assay kits supplied by Chongqing&#xD;
      Biospes Co., Ltd, China with catalog numbers BYE3519 and BYEK2017 respectively. The assays&#xD;
      were performed using microplate ELISA reader (EMR 500, USA), according to manufacture&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Western blotting assessments of survivin and fibulin-3 expression levels Lung and pleural&#xD;
      biopsies were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer(Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy),&#xD;
      containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., MA, USA) using&#xD;
      Potter-Elvehjem rotor-stator homogenizer (glass/teflon homogenizer), fitted with a Teflon&#xD;
      pestle and stored frozen at -70 °C for subsequent assessment of tissue nuclear survivin and&#xD;
      fibulin-3 expressions by Western blotting technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteins in each corresponding lung , pleural tissue homogenates or pleural effusion sample&#xD;
      were denatured at 95 °C for 5 minutes in 2× Laemmli buffer followed by addition of 5%&#xD;
      2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was achieved by loading 50 µg protein per lane at&#xD;
      75 volts through resolving gel (18% for survivin and 15% for fibulin-3) followed by 125 volts&#xD;
      during approximately 2 hours and transferred to a PVDF membrane using T-77 ECL semidry&#xD;
      transfer unit (Amersham BioSciences UK Ltd) for 2 hours. Immunoblotting was performed by&#xD;
      incubating the PVDF membrane in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween and 5% non fat milk for one&#xD;
      hour at 4°C, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with rabbit anti-survivin polyclonal&#xD;
      antibody (Bioss Inc., Massachusetts, USA) and rabbit anti-fibulin-3 polyclonal antibody&#xD;
      (Novus Biologicals, LLC, Littleton, CO, USA) at a dilution of 1:1500. After being washed&#xD;
      three times with TBST buffer, each membrane was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with&#xD;
      an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Novus Biologicals,&#xD;
      LLC, Littleton, CO, USA) at a dilution of 1:5000. After being washed four times in TBST, the&#xD;
      membrane bound antibody was detected with a commercially available BCIP/NBT substrate&#xD;
      detection Kit (Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc., CA, USA). Equivalent protein loading for each&#xD;
      lane was confirmed by stripping and re-blotting each membrane at 4°C against mouse monoclonal&#xD;
      anti β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) at a dilution of 1:5000. The&#xD;
      analysis was repeated 3 times to assure the reproducibility of results. Quantification was&#xD;
      performed using ImageJ software and expressed as the band density relative to that of&#xD;
      β-actin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data entry and data analysis were done using SPSS version 19&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Science). Data were presented as a number, percentage, the&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation for parametric data. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were&#xD;
      used to compare qualitative variables. Independent t-test was used to compare quantitative&#xD;
      variables between two groups. Pearson correlation was done to measure the correlation between&#xD;
      quantitative variable. Medcalc Program was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive values with calculation of the AUC (95% CI). P-value was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant when &lt;0.05.&#xD;
