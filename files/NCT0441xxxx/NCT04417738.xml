  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to test the hypothesis that transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM)&#xD;
      (i.e., 4-minutes of 810nm near-infrared light at 250 mW/cm2 by LED to the forehead at F3 or&#xD;
      F4 versus an indistinguishable placebo treatment) can safely reduce opioid craving in&#xD;
      individuals with opioid dependence in a within-patient study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorders (OUD) are an epidemic causing catastrophic consequences to individuals,&#xD;
      families, and society despite treatments including psychotherapy, substitution therapy or&#xD;
      receptor blockers, and psychoeducation. The investigators have developed a novel treatment&#xD;
      that combines transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) and Schiffer's Dual Brain Psychology&#xD;
      (DBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which&#xD;
      22 patients with significant opioid cravings and a history of recent or current OUD attended&#xD;
      three one-hour weekly sessions. After baseline measures of opioid craving, and other&#xD;
      psychometrics, subjects will receive two unilateral t-PBM applications (810 nm CW LED, 250&#xD;
      mW/cm2, 60 J/cm2, 4 min) or a sham (foil-covered LED) at F3 or F4. Prior to any treatment,&#xD;
      the investigators will use 2 tests to determine which hemisphere is more associated with a&#xD;
      negative outlook and cravings and will treat that side before the more positive hemisphere.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be an opioid craving scale (OCS). plus weekly Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HARS) Rating Scales prior to treatments. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored for any possible adverse side-effects from the treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will come to the lab on 3 consecutive weekly visits. On the first, they go through the consent process and if signed, will have a clinical interview and ROS then be given baseline measures and then treated with transcranial photobiomodulation, following which they will undergo post-treatment measures. The treatment the first week will be randomized to active or sham and the second week they will receive the opposite treatment. The third week will be a follow-up of the second treatment.</intervention_model_description>
