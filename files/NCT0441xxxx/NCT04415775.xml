  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal will evaluate the neural underpinnings of (a) the decline of mobility&#xD;
      function in Parkinson's disease (PD), and (b) the effects of an innovative computer-guided&#xD;
      dual-task (DT) mobility training platform (complementary approach: exercise intervention).&#xD;
      Improved mobility functioning in PD, specifically balance, gait and cognition, directly&#xD;
      translates to improved community ambulation as well as increased physical activity and social&#xD;
      participation. These benefits are known to have a significant preventive and&#xD;
      disease-modifying impact that surpasses any currently available pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions. Outcomes of this research will provide new insights into brain plasticity&#xD;
      mechanisms and will accelerate further optimization and commercialization of multi-modal&#xD;
      mobility-cognitive training applications along with accompanying smart electronic monitoring&#xD;
      tools. With wider usage of this training platform, rehabilitation specialists will be able to&#xD;
      effectively scale services, while still monitoring quality and ensuring accountability. Thus,&#xD;
      the study is highly transformative.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The investigators propose a collaborative project between our research centers at the&#xD;
      University of Manitoba and the University of Toronto, to further understand the neural&#xD;
      underpinnings of cognition/gait impairment and the effects of DT training in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutting-edge behavioural brain imaging methods will be used to identify functional brain&#xD;
      metabolic network re-organization and the molecular basis of gait/cognitive impairment. This&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate the neurophysiological underpinnings of the DT treadmill training&#xD;
      effect, which has repeatedly demonstrated to be clinically effective. The possibility of&#xD;
      detecting these changes and localizing the site(s) of brain plasticity will have important&#xD;
      implications at several levels. These biomarkers could be used as an indicator of disease&#xD;
      severity, outcome measures for neuroprotection studies and other treatment and lifestyle&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To characterize the abnormal brain metabolic pattern in PD patients during&#xD;
      DT-walking as compared to healthy age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: The investigators will examine whether a 10-week treadmill walking program&#xD;
      combined with specific cognitive activities (i.e. true DT walking training known to improve&#xD;
      gait function and reduce falls) will &quot;normalize&quot; the brain abnormality (that is identified in&#xD;
      Aim 1), or whether it will activate a novel compensatory mechanism and therefore evidence to&#xD;
      isolate the region(s) of brain plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the DT gait-related abnormal brain metabolic pattern and abnormally&#xD;
      elevated amyloid deposition are inter-related and that these abnormal functional connectivity&#xD;
      patterns and structural changes are highly associated with gait, cognitive and DT walking&#xD;
      deficits in PD. It is also hypothesized that the DT treadmill-training program will result in&#xD;
      specific and significant changes in the DT gait-related abnormal brain metabolic pattern, in&#xD;
      the PD participants.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be expected to play several cognitive computer games while standing on a sponge pad (10-min warm-up and while walking on the treadmill at your self-selected comfortable speed. (Dual-task treadmill training). This would be done in intervals of 2-4 min with rest periods for a total time of 35 minutes Treadmill speed and the difficulty level of the cognitive games will progress depending on participant performance and comfort level.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a mixture of current gait training programs available for people with Parkinson's Disease. The protocol will be a Warm-up exercise consisting of rhythmical large movements (10 minutes), as well as video game practice while standing (i.e., single-task; 10 minutes). Treadmill walking in intervals of 2-4 minutes with rest periods. Walking over the ground while negotiating through obstacles. (10 minutes) The speed of the treadmill will be progressed gradually and as tolerated.</description>
