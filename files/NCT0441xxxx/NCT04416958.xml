      Right ventricular pacing causes ventricular dyssynchrony and may be associated with impaired&#xD;
      outcome. In the last decade, several approaches for more physiological pacing became&#xD;
      available and were implemented in the latest guidelines. However, compared to conventional&#xD;
      device implantation, cardiac resynchronization, His bundle pacing and left bundle area pacing&#xD;
      remain demanding procedures in the individual case. Goal of the single center observational&#xD;
      &quot;Pace conduct&quot; study is to evaluate implantation success, safety and outcome of pacing&#xD;
      methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional ectopic myocardial right ventricular pacing (RVP) causes ventricular&#xD;
      dyssynchrony and may be associated with reverse ventricular remodeling, reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (EF), left ventricular dilatation, functional mitral valve regurgitation, heart&#xD;
      failure and an increased rate of new onset atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent on individual patient's characteristics, several strategies are established to&#xD;
      prevent and to overcome the potential drawbacks of chronic RVP. In general, unnecessary&#xD;
      ectopic RVP should be avoided. For example, in patients with sinus node disease and intact&#xD;
      atrioventricular (AV) conduction, atrial pacing, AV (search) hysteresis or AAI-DDD/ADI pacing&#xD;
      may be used. In patients with impaired cardiac function and an expected higher percentage of&#xD;
      RVP, pacing strategies for cardiac resynchronization are indicated. Conventional cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) uses an additional transvenous left ventricular lead for&#xD;
      synchronous ventricular stimulation and was shown to shorten QRS duration and to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, left bundle branch block&#xD;
      (LBBB) and reduced EF. Due to the non-physiological left ventricular epicardial stimulation,&#xD;
      however, conventional CRT is associated with 30% of non-responders and may even prolong&#xD;
      ventricular activation in patients with narrower QRS complex. First described in 1968, His&#xD;
      bundle pacing (HBP) has evolved to an increasingly used alternative for cardiac pacing.&#xD;
      Currently, HBP is regarded the most physiologic approach for ventricular stimulation because&#xD;
      it prevents ventricular dyssynchrony and its potential fatal long-term consequences by&#xD;
      preserving normal electrical activation of the ventricles. Clinical benefit of HBP has been&#xD;
      shown compared with conventional permanent RVP and CRT. Recent studies documented restoration&#xD;
      of normal electrical and mechanical left ventricular synchrony for both selective and&#xD;
      non-selective HBP. However, compared with conventional RVP the implantation procedure for HBP&#xD;
      is much more demanding requiring exact placement of the pacing lead within the anatomically&#xD;
      variable His bundle area. Alternatively, the correction of bundle branch conduction disorders&#xD;
      has been demonstrated for left bundle branch area (LBBA) pacing. As a consequence, current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend pacing methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation in&#xD;
      patients with atrioventricular block who have an indication for permanent pacing with a LVEF&#xD;
      between 36% and 50% and are expected to require ventricular pacing more than 40% of the time&#xD;
      (class IIa indication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is increasing evidence showing the benefits of the different strategies for&#xD;
      physiologic pacing but the appropriate use of these approaches may be challenging in the&#xD;
      individual case. Therefore, appropriate patient selection, implantation approaches, device&#xD;
      programming and follow-up require further intensive evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goal of the study is to evaluate implantation success for pacing methods aiming to&#xD;
      maintain physiologic ventricular activation. Procedural success is defined as stable lead&#xD;
      positioning and effective pacing within the target area with an appropriate and stable pacing&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals of the study are to document and to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  procedural parameters (e.g. venous access, time needed for lead implant, procedural&#xD;
           duration, radiation) and adverse events dependent on procedural approaches and patients&#xD;
           characteristics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performance of the implanted system (sensing, pacing thresholds) and clinical outcome&#xD;
           during routine follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, non-randomized, observational study, retrospective data analysis, on-going&#xD;
      prospective patient enrollment, descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center: Klinikum Fuerth (Dept. for Heart and Lung diseases, section for clinical&#xD;
      electrophysiology) / Germany in cooperation with the Dept. of Cardiology of the University&#xD;
      Erlangen / Germany and the University of Trieste / Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Implantation success. Effective pacing and acceptable pacing threshold at&#xD;
      the targeted lead position. Target for lead placement is the area with maximum delayed&#xD;
      ventricular activation for transvenous CRT, the His bundle for selective or non-selective HBP&#xD;
      and the right interventricular septum with left bundle branch capture for LBBA pacing,&#xD;
      respectively. Target thresholds for the lead placed within the coronary sinus or at the&#xD;
      intrinsic conduction system is &lt;2.5 V @ 1 ms with a maximum acceptable threshold of &lt;4.0 V @&#xD;
      2 ms or &lt;5 V @ 1 ms. Target for all other leads is &lt;1 V @ 0.5 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: patient characteristics and association with outcome. Implantation&#xD;
      success and outcome correlated with patient characteristics including electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameter and procedure related techniques and parameter. Safety: radiation&#xD;
      exposure, number and type of adverse events and adverse device related events. Follow-up:&#xD;
      device function, interrogation, programming and clinical outcome as evaluated in routine&#xD;
      follow-up, incl. ECG, echocardiography and parameter for assessment of heart failure.&#xD;
      Subpopulations: managed ventricular pacing, His bundle pacing, LBB-area pacing, CRT.&#xD;
      Implantation with or without electroanatomic mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation of a pacemaker or ICD according to the current guidelines (Class I or IIa&#xD;
      indication) aiming to avoid pacing induced dyssynchrony, e.g. managed ventricular pacing,&#xD;
      His-bundle pacing, LBB-area pacing or conventional transvenous CRT. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;

      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No given informed consent for the procedure. No follow up data available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the observational study, there is no pre-specified sample-size. Data from 200 patients&#xD;
      and procedures are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study related data are collected by the study investigators in an anonymous clinic-internal&#xD;
      data-base that is password protected. All investigators have to provide valid GCP training.&#xD;
