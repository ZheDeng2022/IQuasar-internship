  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical deterioration is observing in up to forty percent of patients with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke (AIS) due to large vessels occlusion. Until now, there is no automated monitoring&#xD;
      system for early detection of neurological deterioration in such patients. As a first step to&#xD;
      develop such system investigators suggest this study aiming to evaluate patterns of brain&#xD;
      electrical activity registered by EEG in patients with AIS attributed to the MCA or ICA&#xD;
      territory correlated with location and extension of ischemic lesions as determined by&#xD;
      non-contrast CT (NCT).&#xD;

      Rationale. Despite the exciting developments in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS)&#xD;
      in last years, the problem of neurological deterioration in patients with AIS remains&#xD;
      unresolved and poorly understandable. This is especially correct about patients with AIS&#xD;
      resulted from large vessel occlusion (LVO), mainly internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Such deterioration is observing in up to forty percent of&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO. On the other side, according to the&#xD;
      literature about 40 % of LVO strokes resulted from atrial fibrillation. Until now, there is&#xD;
      no automated monitoring system for early detection of neurological deterioration in AIS&#xD;
      patients. Such monitoring system may save millions of lives of stroke victims all over the&#xD;
      world. As a first step to develop such system based on change of brain electrical activity&#xD;
      registered by electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with AIS investigators suggest this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall goal. The aim of the suggested research is to evaluate patterns of brain electrical&#xD;
      activity registered by EEG in patients with AIS attributed to the MCA or ICA territory in&#xD;
      correlation with location and extension of ischemic lesions as determined by non-contrast CT&#xD;
      (NCT). Based on these data, the attempt to find algorithms, describing such correlation will&#xD;
      be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population. The prospective study will include at least 200 AIS patients with acute&#xD;
      stroke resulted from MCA or ICA occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Non contrast CT and EEG will be done at the same day. Neurologist will evaluate&#xD;
      neurological status at the day of EEG and CT performing and clinical score by National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) will be obtained. EEG will be performed continuously&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes with 19-channel EEG machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment. After gathering clinical, EEG and NCT data mathematical and computerized analysis&#xD;
      (including Artificial Intelligence methods) will be applied aiming to find algorithms&#xD;
      describing relationship between size and location of AIS and change in brain electrical&#xD;
      activity registered by EEG in AIS patients.&#xD;

    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a painless and harmless method to record the bioelectric activity of the brain. Clinically, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp This method can be helpful in the diagnosis of many various brain diseases and pathological conditions.&#xD;
For the examination, electrodes are placed on the head, using a special harmless gel, similar to gel, used in ultrasonographic studies.</description>
