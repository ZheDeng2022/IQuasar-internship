  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab and ipilimumab) given&#xD;
      together as a possible treatment for INI1-negative tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational drug or drug combination to learn whether the drug or drug combination&#xD;
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab (OPDIVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab (YERYOY)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is studying whether nivolumab and ipilimumab work to treat INI1-negative cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved combination nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab for the specific diseases in this study but it has been approved for other&#xD;
      diseases. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been tested in children to find out a safe dose of&#xD;
      this combination.&#xD;

             pneumonitis&#xD;

             local steroid injections are not excluded. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine,&#xD;
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
