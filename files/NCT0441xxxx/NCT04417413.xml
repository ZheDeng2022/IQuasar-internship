  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to retrospectively collect the data on patients who underwent&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse treatment using a non-ablative Er:YAG laser with SMOOTH mode and to&#xD;
      conduct an objective evaluation of safety and efficacy of Er:YAG laser treatment. In a group&#xD;
      of patients that have concomitant stress urinary incontinence symptoms, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the treatments on these symptoms will be evaluated as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affect many women and can&#xD;
      dramatically decrease their quality of life. Most of the patients diagnosed with stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence also have a degree of pelvic organ prolapse and vice-versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the more promising new approaches in treating disorders connected to pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction has been the introduction of vaginal erbium laser treatment for pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present retrospective study was toassess the effectiveness of vaginal&#xD;
      erbium laser with SMOOTH mode for the treatment of patients with pelvic organ prolapse and&#xD;
      co-existing stress urinary incontinence, if present.&#xD;
