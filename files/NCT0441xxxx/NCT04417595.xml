    <textblock>
      Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including&#xD;
      preterm birth, neonatal death, and maternal complications. Rates of smoking cessation during&#xD;
      pregnancy are low, particularly in underserved populations, and currently approved&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation either are considered unsafe in pregnancy or have&#xD;
      uncertain effectiveness. Identifying safe and effective interventions, which might mitigate&#xD;
      the adverse effects of smoking on maternal-fetal outcomes, is a major public health priority.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA relative deficiencies may be an important&#xD;
      mechanism contributing to tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      supplementation specifically targeted to pregnant smokers may reduce these complications.&#xD;
      Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent secondary analysis of the Omega-3 Fatty Acids&#xD;
      Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth trial that found that only smokers taking n-3&#xD;
      LCPUFAs had a reduction in preterm labor risk as compared to non-smokers. While compelling,&#xD;
      this study was a post hoc analysis that included only a small sample of smokers and did not&#xD;
      collect data on smoking behaviors during follow up. Yet the ascertainment of longitudinal&#xD;
      smoking behavior is critical, as some clinical studies have found that supplemental n-3&#xD;
      LCPUFAs might also reduce nicotine cravings, and lower daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may&#xD;
      doubly benefit from replenishing n-3 LCPUFAs via lower risk of preterm labor and/or increased&#xD;
      smoking cessation. To address these knowledge gaps, we are proposing a multi-center,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in 400&#xD;
      pregnant smokers. We will collect detailed information on smoking behavior, validated&#xD;
      biological markers of cigarette exposure (urinary cotinine, end-expiratory carbon monoxide)&#xD;
      and biomarkers of n-3 LCPUFA status (red blood cell phospholipid membrane fatty acids). Our&#xD;
      specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery and preterm labor in pregnant smokers and 2) determine the effect&#xD;
      of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on tobacco use in pregnant smokers. We will recruit potential&#xD;
      participants from eight obstetrics clinics across the Middle-Tennessee area. Our study could&#xD;
      have a major translational impact on both adverse tobacco-related birth outcomes and smoking&#xD;
      cessation efforts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is the most important modifiable risk factor associated with adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes and increases the risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction and sudden&#xD;
      infant death syndrome. Over 11% of women report smoking during pregnancy, with higher rates&#xD;
      seen in the Southeastern United States. Fewer than half of pregnant smokers are able to quit&#xD;
      on their own during pregnancy. Currently, FDA-approved pharmacological strategies for smoking&#xD;
      cessation are generally not used in pregnancy: varenicline and bupropion are unsafe and&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy has limited data to support its efficacy in pregnant smokers.&#xD;
      Identifying safe and effective therapies to prevent tobacco-related pregnancy outcomes and/or&#xD;
      increase smoking cessation in pregnant women would have a substantial public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group and others have reported that cigarette smoking is associated with a relative&#xD;
      deficiency in circulating n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) levels. Our&#xD;
      overarching hypothesis is that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA deficiencies contribute to&#xD;
      tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that supplementation of n-3 LCPUFAs in&#xD;
      pregnant smokers may prevent these complications. Support for this hypothesis comes from a&#xD;
      recent secondary analysis of the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth&#xD;
      trial which found that only smokers taking n-3 LCPUFAs had a reduction in preterm labor risk&#xD;
      as compared to non-smokers. While compelling, this study was a post hoc analysis that&#xD;
      included only a small sample of smokers and did not collect data on smoking behaviors during&#xD;
      follow up. Yet the ascertainment of longitudinal smoking behavior is critical, as some&#xD;
      clinical studies have found that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs might also reduce nicotine cravings&#xD;
      and lower daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may doubly benefit from replenishing n-3 LCPUFAs&#xD;
      via lower risk of preterm labor and/or increased smoking cessation. We conducted a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled pilot RCT of n-3 LCPUFAs in 28 pregnant smokers and found the intervention&#xD;
      to be feasible and well-tolerated. Compared to placebo, n-3 LCPUFAs lowered both nicotine&#xD;
      dependence at 4 weeks (change from baseline in Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence -2.5&#xD;
      vs. 0, p = 0.01) and resulted in a non-statistically significant reduction in cigarettes per&#xD;
      day and urine cotinine. To address important remaining knowledge gaps we propose the&#xD;
      Investigating N-3 Fatty Acids to prevent Neonatal Tobacco related outcomeS (INFANTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal has three Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs compared to placebo on&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery and preterm labor in pregnant smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs compared to placebo on&#xD;
      tobacco use in pregnant smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine if the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on preterm labor is&#xD;
      mediated by changes in smoking behavior and/or increases in circulating n-3 LCPUFAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INFANTS study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study that&#xD;
      will randomize 400 pregnant smokers to either supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled between 12 and 24 weeks gestation and followed until delivery.&#xD;
      We will recruit participants from eight clinical centers in the Middle-Tennessee area. We&#xD;
      will assess smoking behavior after 12-weeks of supplementation using self-report and&#xD;
      validated biomarkers of tobacco exposure (urine cotinine). We will measure response to&#xD;
      supplementation using biological markers of n-3 LCPUFA status (red blood cell phospholipid&#xD;
      membrane fatty acid percentages). Our primary endpoint will be preterm labor as reflected by&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery, which will be extracted from the medical record. Our secondary&#xD;
      endpoint will be change from baseline in cigarettes per day at 12 weeks biochemically&#xD;
      confirmed through reduction in urine cotinine. We will conduct mediation analysis to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms contributing to the effects of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on birth&#xD;
      outcomes in pregnant smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is innovative in that it will be the first clinical trial of n-3 LCPUFAs&#xD;
      exclusively recruiting pregnant smokers. This will be the first study to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      on n-3 LCPUFAs on tobacco use in smokers who wish to quit, thus identifying a novel strategy&#xD;
      to reduce tobacco use that could be relevant for all smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFAs supplements are well tolerated in pregnancy but currently are not recommended as&#xD;
      part of routine prenatal care in smokers. Thus if our study demonstrated that supplemental&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFAs are effective at reducing the risk of tobacco-related adverse neonatal outcomes&#xD;
      and/or reducing tobacco use during pregnancy, our results could have an immediate and major&#xD;
      clinical impact on pregnancy care and neonatal outcomes in the United States.&#xD;
