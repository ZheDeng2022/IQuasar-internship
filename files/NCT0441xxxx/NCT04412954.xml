  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of the Smartphone intervention on % weight loss and maintaining % weight loss at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months in a sample (N=256) of Black community college students who are overweight or obese,&#xD;
      ages 18-25 years. Investigators will also examine mediating variables of the intervention on&#xD;
      weight at 6 and 12 months, including adherence to self-monitoring, discrimination, and&#xD;
      dietary and physical activity self-efficacy. In addition, investigators will explore&#xD;
      potential moderators of weight loss at 6 months and 12 months, including depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      ideal body image, and motivation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 256 students, ages 18-25, who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited from Columbus State Community College (CSCC). A sample size of 256 subjects (n=128&#xD;
      per each trial arm) will have sufficient power (&gt;80%) to detect an average between-group&#xD;
      difference with a moderate effect size of 0.4. The mixed effect modeling for repeated outcome&#xD;
      measures at 6 and 12 months was used for the power calculation using two-sided significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05 assuming 1) first-order autoregressive covariance structure, 2) the&#xD;
      within-structure correlation of 0.8, and 3) 20% attrition rate at 12-month follow-up. The&#xD;
      effect size of 0.4 was reasonably assumed based on data from published trials on weight-loss&#xD;
      interventions (an effect size of 0.8 using 8-week social media, 0.3 using 12-week Smartphone&#xD;
      intervention, and 0.6 using 4-month text messaging). Investigators will conduct stratified&#xD;
      recruitment by gender (female vs. male) and ethnicity (Non-Hispanic Black vs. Hispanic Black)&#xD;
      to achieve a study sample with 80% Non-Hispanic Black and 20% Hispanic and 50% male in each&#xD;
      ethnic group. The recruitment and randomization will be equally distributed with&#xD;
      approximately 10 subjects per month, which is a feasible enrollment target considering the&#xD;
      pool of eligible participants and our previous recruitment success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants who contact through telephone or email will undergo a preliminary&#xD;
      screening via telephone and receive an explanation of the study. Included in this screening&#xD;
      are four questions from the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), which will be asked to&#xD;
      determine symptoms of disordered eating in the past 6 months. Those who seem to meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and are interested in participating will be scheduled for an in person&#xD;
      visit for the informed consent and screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the informed consent process and baseline visit questionnaires, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to intervention or the attention-control group. Investigators will use&#xD;
      stratified randomization by sex (female vs. male) and ethnicity (Non-Hispanic Black vs.&#xD;
      Hispanic Black). For each gender strata, randomization will occur in permuted blocks of&#xD;
      varying block sizes. Subjects in each block will be randomly assigned to intervention arm or&#xD;
      attention-control arm with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The advantage of permuted block&#xD;
      randomization is that it will ensure balance in the number of subjects in the two trial arms&#xD;
      during the entire study period.&#xD;

    <description>The program includes (1) use of a free commercially available smartphone application program for 12 months, (2) a wearable Fitbit Charge device that will be provided by the study to monitor active minutes, and (3) one 45-minute behavioral counseling session focused on healthy eating and exercise and (4) personalized text messaging for 6 months by a health coach. The health coach will not send feedback during months 6-12. The intervention will be fully self-directed in these months, as there will be no contact between the 6 months visit and 12-month visit.</description>
