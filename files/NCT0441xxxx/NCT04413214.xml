      The trial is a study conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of&#xD;
      Carrimycin tablet and measure its anti-tumor efficacy initially in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (non&#xD;

      This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK&#xD;
      characteristics of Carrimycin tablet in the treatment of patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (non NPC). The 3x3 dose&#xD;
      escalation design will be adopted, including 200mg, 400mg and 600mg of Carrimycin; and three&#xD;
      subjects at each dose level initially. If there is no DLT in the dose level of 200mg, the&#xD;
      dose level of 400mg will be followed; if there is one DLT in the dose level of 200mg, another&#xD;
      three patients will be added in the dose level of 200mg; if there is no DLT occurs in the&#xD;
      another three patients, the dose level of 400mg will also be followed; if there is one DLT in&#xD;
      the another three patients, the trial will be closed. The same condition to the dose level of&#xD;
      400mg and 600mg. If a patient fails to receive the full prescribed dose for reasons other&#xD;
      than DLT at the time of the first administration, the patient will be replaced. Carrimycin&#xD;
      treatment to the patients with DLT will be discontinued immediately and they will enter the&#xD;
      follow-up period and will not be replaced. The study consists of screening period, treatment&#xD;
      period and follow-up period. The treatment period continues until the patients develop&#xD;
      progressive disease, dies, lost to follow-up or withdraw informed consent.&#xD;
