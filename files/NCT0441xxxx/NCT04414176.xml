      This case-control study will be conducted all over the country (in Persian, Kurd, Azari,&#xD;
      Arab, Lor, Bakhtiari, Baluch, Turkman, Qashqai, Gilak and in Muslims, Christians, Jewish, and&#xD;
      Zoroastrian). the investigators intend to recruit patients (men 60≥ years of age and women&#xD;
      70≥ years of age) who underwent coronary angiography. Patients with coronary artery stenosis&#xD;
      more than 75% (or left-main stenosis more than 50%) are defined as case group and patients&#xD;
      with normal angiography are considered as the control group. at the same time, the prevalence&#xD;
      of premature coronary artery disease in patients with positive angiography will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most important causes of mortality in the world&#xD;
      and accounts for up to 30% of deaths. CHD is also prevalent in Iran and in some studies, the&#xD;
      prevalence of the disease has been reported to be about 20 to 30 percent. The prevalence of&#xD;
      premature coronary heart disease (CHD) is increasing every year, which is related to the risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular disease in humans. The prevalence of premature CHD in Iran is also&#xD;
      high, which justify better understanding of the factors affecting it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many known risk factors are involved in coronary artery disease, including age, sex, obesity,&#xD;
      high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and family history. These risk factors&#xD;
      do not have the same prevalence or attributable risk among different ethnicities and&#xD;
      religions. Also due to genetic differences, the effect of environmental factors can&#xD;
      accelerate or diminish the effects of some factors on the occurance of premature CHD. These&#xD;
      mechanisms are often unknown, but high-risk environments can trigger an earlier onset of CHD&#xD;
      in people who are genetically susceptible. This relation is called the genetic-environment&#xD;
      interaction. As showed in previous reports, CHD is a multifactorial disease that can be&#xD;
      affected by environmental factors and expression of different genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case-control study the investigators intend to recruit documented CHD patients who&#xD;
      underwent coronary angiography from diverse ethnic and religious groups. A total of 5000&#xD;
      individuals from different ethnic backgrounds such as Persian (fars), Turk, Kurd, Arab, Lor,&#xD;
      Bakhtiari, Baluch, Turkman, Qashqai, Gilak and in Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians&#xD;
      will be selected throughout the country. Sampling among different ethnicities and religions&#xD;
      will be based on their proportion of the total population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic characteristics (educational&#xD;
      level, working status, income), history of smoking, alcohol consumption, addiction, family&#xD;
      and personal history of CHD, psychosocial habit, physical activity, and dietary habits will&#xD;
      be collected. The heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be taken twice in&#xD;
      sitting position, and under standard conditions and the average of the two measurements will&#xD;
      be recorded. The patient's weight (in kilograms), and height (in meters), the circumference&#xD;
      of the wrist, neck, thigh, waist, and hip (all in centimeters) will be measured in light&#xD;
      clothes and without shoes and body mass index and waist to hip ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be evaluated for fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles (Triglyceride,&#xD;
      High-density lipoprotein-C, Low-density lipoprotein-C, and Total Cholesterol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of serum, plasma, buffy coat, whole blood, urine, stool, and saliva will be frozen&#xD;
      and Individuals genetic and epigenetic variations will be examined in later stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biological Samples will be transferred to the central lab of the Isfahan Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Research Institute to create a BioBank for future genetic and epigenetic studies. The data&#xD;
      collection teams will receive the necessary training in several sessions and the supervisory&#xD;
      committee will regularly monitor the implementation of the plan.&#xD;
