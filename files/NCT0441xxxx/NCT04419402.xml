  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 randomised clinical trial will investigate the activity and safety of adding&#xD;
      Lu-PSMA to enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC) not previously treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, stratified, 2-arm, multicentre phase 2 clinical trial&#xD;
      recruiting 160 participants over 12 months and followed until 150 events occurred&#xD;
      (approximately another 18 months). Participants will be randomised to enzalutamide or&#xD;
      enzalutamide and Lu-PSMA in a 1:1 ratio. A minimisation approach will be used to minimise&#xD;
      chance imbalances across the following stratification factors: study site, volume of disease&#xD;
      (&gt;20 versus ≤20 sites of disease measured on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT), prior treatment with early&#xD;
      docetaxel for castration- sensitive disease (yes vs no), and prior treatment with early&#xD;
      abiraterone for castration-sensitive disease (yes vs no).&#xD;

    <measure>Aspects of Health-related Quality of life (HRQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 4-6 weeks, through study completion, approximately 4 years from recruitment.</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core quality of life questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and quality-of-life scale to assess HRQL in cancer patients. The Patient DATA form is a simple, multi-item quality of life instrument based on 11-point numeric rating scales for a range of relevant symptoms and functions. It combines cancer specific items from the UBQ-C, GLQ-8 and LASA cancer-specific quality of life instruments. The Fear of Cancer Progression form is a short questionnaire assessing possible future concerns related to the participant's illness.</description>
