      Part I: Evaluating the increase in dermal blood flow upon topical application of&#xD;
      cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin on the fingers in healthy, male volunteers. In addition, the&#xD;
      inter-period and inter-hand reproducibility of the increase in dermal blood flow will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
