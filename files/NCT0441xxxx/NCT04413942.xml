  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and&#xD;
      Severity Index (EASI) score, of multiple intravenous (IV) doses of FB825 in subjects with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IgE plays an important role in mediating hypersensitivity reactions responsible for most of&#xD;
      the allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma etc. which remain poorly controlled.&#xD;
      FB825 blocks the biological pathway of IgE synthesis and thus can be used to treat&#xD;
      IgE-mediated allergic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FB825 was found to be safe when given IV repeat dose in toxicology study in monkey. No&#xD;
      adverse effects of FB825 were observed in parameters included electrocardiograms for&#xD;
      cardiovascular, ophthalmic examinations and other clinical, CNS and respiratory safety&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of FB825 was demonstrated in the US phase I randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study with healthy subjects. Also, the FB825 was proved by in vivo study that it&#xD;
      is able to block the biological pathway of IgE synthesis and thus can be used to treat&#xD;
      IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Therefore, in this study, the effects of IgE in patients with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis receiving FB825 treatment will be investigated. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      safety and efficacy in adults with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). The mean percentage change of NRS reflects the changes of participants in itch intensity.</description>
