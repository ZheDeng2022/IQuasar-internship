    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the neuroprotective, anti atherogenic and&#xD;
      hepatoprotective properties of tocotrienols (palm vitamin E) supplementation as determined by&#xD;
      white matter lesion load on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), carotid artery magnetic&#xD;
      resonance angiography (MRA) and liver ultrasound (US) as well as lipid profile analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer in Malaysia. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 52,000 Malaysians suffer stroke annually. In 2005, 3245 cases of stroke were&#xD;
      fatal. It is projected that the number of fatal stoke cases will exceed 25,000 in 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found that at nanomolar concentrations, α-tocotrienol but not α-tocopherol prevent&#xD;
      glutamate-induced neuron cell death in mice through inhibition of c-Src kinase and&#xD;
      12-lipoxygenase. Tocotrienol-supplemented rats showed more protection against stroke-induced&#xD;
      injury compared with matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White matter lesion as detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is closely related to&#xD;
      vascular events of the brain. MRI and histopathological study has shown that the larger white&#xD;
      matter lesions not usually conforming to usual areas infarcts can actually represent areas of&#xD;
      subclinical infarct. In addition there is positive correlation between white matter lesions&#xD;
      with established vascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rotterdam Scan Study showed that elderly people with silent brain infarcts and white&#xD;
      matter lesions are at a strongly increased risk of clinical stroke, which could not be&#xD;
      explained by the major stroke risk factors alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies showed that white matter lesions may be an independent prognostic&#xD;
      measure of future stroke risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White matter hyperintensities as detected on MRI is closely related to vascular events of the&#xD;
      brain and in some instances represent subclinical infarcts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore conceivable to study the neuroprotective properties of tocotrienol&#xD;
      supplementation in humans by looking at serial changes of white matter disease load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tocotrienol supplementation brings about various favourable effects including improving lipid&#xD;
      profiles, lowering of thromboxane B2 and platelet factor 4 and reduced LDL oxidation. Carotid&#xD;
      artery MR angiography is an established and robust technique in the evaluation of carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis. Therefore, to study the anti-atherogenic effects of tocotrienols&#xD;
      supplementation, serial MR angiography of the carotid arteries are done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a not fully understood, both in&#xD;
      aetiology and significance, liver disorder. FLD is reported to be the most common cause of&#xD;
      chronic liver disease in the U.S.A. and other western countries with a prevalence rate&#xD;
      ranging between 15% to 30% of the adult population. However, limited data are available for&#xD;
      Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US imaging provides valuable information of the liver condition with a sensitivity of&#xD;
      93-100%. Frequently NAFLD is associated with dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      type II diabetes and it represents the liver component of the metabolic syndrome (MetS).&#xD;
      Patients with NAFLD are reported to have low levels of serum vitamin E. NAFLD patients&#xD;
      present a significant increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk, thus linking NAFLD, MetS and&#xD;
      accelerated atherosclerosis.&#xD;
