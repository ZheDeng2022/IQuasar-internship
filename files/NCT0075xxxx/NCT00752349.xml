  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is widely applied in many fields of medicine but less commonly used in the&#xD;
      evaluation of tongue movement and swallowing abnormality. Fuhrman RAW reported the usefulness&#xD;
      of using ultrasound to evaluate poor tongue coordination [1]. Peng CL stated that ultrasound&#xD;
      could provide excellent quantitative and qualitative bases of tongue movement during&#xD;
      swallowing using cushion-scan technique [2]. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) is&#xD;
      widely accepted as the gold standard of evaluating swallowing abnormality because it is able&#xD;
      to evaluate the whole swallowing procedure without interference of pharyngeal contraction and&#xD;
      foreign body sensation when swallowing is examined by using a fiber-optic laryngoscope. One&#xD;
      of the most important information that VFSS can provide is the detection of subclinical&#xD;
      silent aspiration. The decision and management of many patients with swallowing abnormalities&#xD;
      are usually based on the VFSS findings [3]. As shown in many reports, our experiences showed&#xD;
      that VFSS provided extremely important information of understanding the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      change of dysphagia due to variable etiologies, such as in patients with nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer suffering from radiation therapy [4] and in patients with stroke [5]. Using the&#xD;
      findings of VFSS, physicians and medical staffs can make important decision whether oral&#xD;
      feeding should be given, which safety swallowing maneuver works and what is the appropriate&#xD;
      choices of food consistency safe to dysphagic patients. The difficulties of VFSS are usually&#xD;
      in the transportation of paraplegic and hemiplegic patients from ward to the examining chair.&#xD;
      The frequency and examination duration of VFSS is usually limited for avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      radiation exposure. Hence, ultrasound provides a role in evaluating oral condition with the&#xD;
      benefits of convenience of transportation and availability as well as no radiation exposure.&#xD;
      Therefore, validation of the value of ultrasound for the oral swallowing with correlation of&#xD;
      VFSS is important to test the clinical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peng CL et al reported their experiences of using real-time ultrasound in the evaluation of&#xD;
      intrinsic tongue movement [2, 6, 7]. The findings of submental ultrasound are quite different&#xD;
      from the findings of VFSS which provides the surface information of the tongue in the&#xD;
      swallowing of radiopaque barium sulfate bolus. Combined real-time B mode and M mode&#xD;
      ultrasound, it was reported the potential of digital data analysis of oral phase swallowing.&#xD;
      Kuhl V et al reported the usefulness of ultrasound in the evaluation of laryngeal elevation&#xD;
      in patients with dysphagia [8]. They found significant decrease of laryngeal elevation in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed as neurogenic dysphasia [8]. Casas et al successfully combined ultrasound&#xD;
      examination and plethysmography to evaluate the swallowing condition of children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy [9]. The results of these studies explained the potential of ultrasound in&#xD;
      oral swallowing and dynamic laryngeal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our experiences of VFSS showed the usefulness VFSS in diagnosing and management of patients&#xD;
      with swallowing problem or dysphagia [4, 5, 10, 11]. To our knowledge, there was little&#xD;
      experience of comparing between ultrasound and VFSS in patients with swallowing problem.&#xD;
      Therefore, we conducted this study to correlate submental ultrasound and VFSS findings and&#xD;
      tried to find out the clinical feasibility and usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: This study was to evaluate the usefulness of submental ultrasound (SM US) in oral&#xD;
      phase swallowing in correlation with videofluoroscopic study (VFSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare normal volunteers and patients with swallowing abnormality with submental&#xD;
           ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate and compare patients with swallowing problem using submental ultrasound and&#xD;
           VFSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Retrospective. Time of study: Jan 2004 - July 2006.&#xD;
