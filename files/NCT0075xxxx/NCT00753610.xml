      Invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix remains the most common invasive cancer in women in&#xD;
      many countries. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is now recommended as a standard&#xD;
      treatment for locally advanced and high-risk cervical carcinoma. However, CCRT achieves a&#xD;
      better control of cervical cancer accompanied by greater morbidity. To avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      over-treatment, the optimization of CCRT is of critical importance. Herein, the development&#xD;
      of a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment efficacy as well as toxicity is pivotal to&#xD;
      optimize CCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), derived from bone marrow, can be used as a&#xD;
      marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis therapy including angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitors and metronomic chemotherapy. Preclinical models indicated that the source of&#xD;
      apoptotic circulating endothelial cells (CEC) was most likely the tumor vasculature. In&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, apoptotic CEC were demonstrated to be a surrogate marker for efficacy&#xD;
      of metronomic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this grant, we intent to monitor the levels of circulating EPC/CEC in locally advanced&#xD;
      cervical cancer patients before, during and after CCRT.&#xD;

      Invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix remains the most common invasive cancer in women in&#xD;
      many countries. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is now recommended as a standard&#xD;
      treatment for locally advanced and high-risk cervical carcinoma (1-3). Although the local&#xD;
      control rate and survival have improved with use of CCRT, the treatment does cause greater&#xD;
      toxicity in the bone marrow and other normal tissues compared with that caused by&#xD;
      conventional RT. Our previous study demonstrated that serial changes in serum cytokines&#xD;
      during chemoradiation correlated with tumor regression and treatment morbidity. The sudden&#xD;
      elevation of serum TGF-beta 1 and VEGF levels after the first fraction of brachytherapy&#xD;
      correlate with the development of greater RT morbidity. Higher pretreatment TGF-beta 1 and&#xD;
      VEGF levels are associated with poor tumor response to chemoradiation (4). It implicates that&#xD;
      angiogenic factor, such as VEGF, may play roles in the toxicity and outcome of CCRT. However,&#xD;
      it still lacks a surrogate marker for prediction of clinical outcome of CCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs combined with radiation as radiosensitizers are&#xD;
      cis-platinum and 5-fluorouracil. These drugs, especially cis-platinum, are toxic to kidney,&#xD;
      myelosuppressive and prone to cause life-threatening neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      which are more severe than those with radiotherapy alone (1-3). To avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      over-treatment, the optimization of CCRT is of critical importance. Herein, the development&#xD;
      of a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment efficacy as well as toxicity is pivotal to&#xD;
      optimize CCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is a heavily regulated process, which is involved by complex interactions&#xD;
      between inhibitory and stimulatory angiogenic factors. It is essential for tumor growth,&#xD;
      progression and metastasis and is correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients including&#xD;
      cervical cancer (5). Many novel compounds, such as EGCG (6), that potently inhibit formation&#xD;
      of neoplastic blood vessels have been recently developed. There is increasing interest in&#xD;
      developing angiogeneis-suppressive agents for cancer treatment and growing number of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials for various&#xD;
      malignancies. Promising results have been reported include an increase in overall survival&#xD;
      and reduction in the risk of death (Bevacizumab), reversal of cellular drug resistance&#xD;
      (Cetuximab) and activity as second-line therapy in colorectal cancer patients who have&#xD;
      exhausted other available treatment options (Cetuximab, ABX-EGF, PTK-787, Gefitinib,&#xD;
      Erlotinib) (7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the therapeutic role of angiogenesis target therapy has been approved in cancer&#xD;
      treatment, the way to optimize the dose of angiogenesis inhibitors remains to be determined&#xD;
      because of the lack of reliable surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis. Shaked et al.&#xD;
      reported that the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), which contribute&#xD;
      to the tumor vessel formation, reflect the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-angiogenesis regimens&#xD;
      (9,10). Growing evidence suggests that the levels of circulating EPC reflect the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy both in animal model and clinical trial (11-13). Thus, circulating EPC can be&#xD;
      used as a marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis therapy including&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitors and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating endothelial cells (CEC), especially apoptotic CEC, were observed to increase in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients with a clinical benefit (defined as a clinical response or a stable&#xD;
      disease) after metronomic therapy (14). Preclinical models indicated that the source of&#xD;
      apoptotic CEC was most likely the tumor vasculature (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether circulating EPC or CEC can be served as markers of CCRT efficacy and toxicity in&#xD;
      cervical cancer or not remains undetermined. Since CCRT is now a standard treatment of&#xD;
      locally advanced and high-risk cervical cancer, the development of the surrogate marker for&#xD;
      monitoring CCRT response and optimize treatment intensity, again, is very important.&#xD;
