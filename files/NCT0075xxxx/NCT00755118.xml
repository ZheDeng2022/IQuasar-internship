      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the effective drugs in a alternating&#xD;
      chemotherapy schedules in pretreated patients with mCRC, who have received all effective&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a major cause of death worldwide and is ranked third in incidence and&#xD;
      deaths from cancer in the USA for men and women. Incidence and mortality have been decreasing&#xD;
      steadily in past decades, with 5-year survival for patients diagnosed in 1996-2002, being&#xD;
      about 65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although curative surgical resection is possible in 70-80% of patients at diagnosis, almost&#xD;
      half of them will develop local or/and metastatic recurrence and will die of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently three active cytotoxic agents that have been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced colorectal cancer: 5-Fluorouracil combined with Leucovorin (5-FU/LV),&#xD;
      Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin. During the last few years, the median overall survival of&#xD;
      patients with advanced CRC has been substantially increased from 12 months to about 21-22&#xD;
      months, when combination of these chemotherapeutic agents are administered. Combinations of&#xD;
      5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (5-FU/LV) either as bolus (Roswell Park) or infusional&#xD;
      administration (De Gramont schedule) r weekly infusional (AIO regimen), combined with&#xD;
      Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin accepted as the mainstay of first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of targeted therapy further expanded treatment options for patients with mCRC.In&#xD;
      particular, inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and angiogenesis by&#xD;
      blocking Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) using monoclonal antibodies, led to&#xD;
      further improvement in the outcome of patients with mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR is expressed by most CRCs. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that&#xD;
      specifically targets EGFR. In combination with Irinotecan, Cetuximab is approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of EGFR-expressing mCRC, that has failed prior Irinotecan-based therapy, suggesting&#xD;
      that Cetuximab may circumvent Irinotecan resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor&#xD;
      (VEGF). In CRC, increased VEGF expression correlates with invasiveness, vascular density,&#xD;
      metastasis, recurrence and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase 2 trial of treatment of CRC, the addition of bevacizumab to FU/LV increased the&#xD;
      response rate, the median time to disease progression, and the median duration of survival.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown in randomized phase 2 trials that bevacizumab, when combined with&#xD;
      irinotecan plus bolus FU/LV in the first line treatment of metastatic CRC, and with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin plus continuous FU/LV (FOLFOX) in second-line treatment leads to an increased&#xD;
      median survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and response rate compared with cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
