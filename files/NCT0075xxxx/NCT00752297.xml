  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm,&#xD;
      single-dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mentor Purified Toxin for the&#xD;
      treatment of glabellar rhytides. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized 3:1 (300 Mentor Purified Toxin: 100 placebo) to receive&#xD;
      either intramuscular injections of 30 U of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo&#xD;
      (preservative-free saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injected subjects will be observed for 180 days of post treatment follow-up. Follow-up clinic&#xD;
      visits are scheduled for post treatment days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at up to ten clinical sites. Safety, tolerability, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, onset and duration of effect will be studied during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of Mentor Purified Toxin will be determined by the degree of frown line&#xD;
      reduction, during maximum forced frown and at rest (neutral expression):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed live by the subject, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal (0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe (3)&#xD;

          2. History of autoimmune disease, that, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;
             interfere with subject outcomes (e.g., osteoarthritis is not considered an exclusion&#xD;
             criteria; however, subjects with dermatomyositis are not permitted to participate in&#xD;
             this study);&#xD;
&#xD;

             outcome measures or the safety of the subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has any condition(s) that in the investigator's opinion would a) warrant exclusion&#xD;

             potential must have negative urine pregnancy test results prior to enrollment into the&#xD;
             study. Such subjects, including peri-menopausal women who have had a menstrual period&#xD;
             within one year, must use appropriate birth control (see protocol/informed consent for&#xD;
