    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease. People with COPD&#xD;
      have difficulty breathing because of lung damage. However, for many people with COPD, while&#xD;
      some areas of the lungs are damaged, other nearby areas are not. This study will examine lung&#xD;
      tissue from people with and without COPD who are undergoing lung transplantation to&#xD;
      investigate how and why certain areas of the lungs are damaged in some people but not others.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a common lung disease and is the fourth most common cause of death in the United&#xD;
      States. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath,and wheezing.&#xD;
      There is no cure for COPD, and the disease worsens over time. Treatment can include stopping&#xD;
      smoking, taking medications, receiving supplemental oxygen, and in severe cases, undergoing&#xD;
      lung transplantation. COPD is usually the result of many years of cigarette smoking, but it&#xD;
      remains unknown exactly how cigarette smoking causes this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason that people with COPD experience shortness of breath and cough is because the lung&#xD;
      airways are partly damaged and obstructed. In healthy people, oxygen is breathed in and then&#xD;
      passes easily into the bloodstream through bunches of small air sacs that fill the lungs. In&#xD;
      people with COPD, these air sacs are damaged, making it difficult for oxygen to pass into the&#xD;
      bloodstream. However, even in people with severe COPD, the air sacs in some areas of the&#xD;
      lungs continue to work, even though neighboring air sacs are damaged. It is possible that an&#xD;
      overactive immune response may cause the air sac damage and that some people with COPD are&#xD;
      more prone than others to such immune system abnormalities. By examining the differences in&#xD;
      lung tissue in people with and without COPD who are undergoing a lung transplant, this study&#xD;
      will investigate why some people's immune systems cause lung damage and others do not and how&#xD;
      and why some air sacs are damaged while other nearby air sacs are not. Study researchers will&#xD;
      also examine whether genetic factors play a role in the development and severity of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with COPD who are undergoing lung transplantation. Before the&#xD;
      lung transplantation surgery, participants will attend one study visit, which will include a&#xD;
      medical history review, height and weight measurements, and a blood collection. A portion of&#xD;
      blood will be stored for future genetic research. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires to collect information on activities, health, and quality of life. Some&#xD;
      participants will undergo a 3-Helium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure, which is an&#xD;
      imaging technique that allows doctors to see the air spaces inside of the lungs. After the&#xD;
      lung transplantation surgery, study researchers will collect lung tissue from surgery. Study&#xD;
      researchers will contact participants at the end of the study to collect follow-up medical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Acceptable chest computed tomography (CT) exam completed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in&#xD;
             the 3 years before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vulnerable populations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coexisting active chronic inflammatory or collagen vascular disease, immunodeficiency&#xD;
             of any kind, non-cutaneous malignancy (melanoma is an exclusion), or previous organ&#xD;
             transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coexisting (other than COPD / emphysema / chronic bronchitis)significant pulmonary&#xD;
             parenchymal disorder (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for 3-Helium MRI Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to perform 10 to 15 second breath hold for 3-Helium MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to MRI (including pacemaker, metal implants, other devices affected&#xD;
             by the magnet).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to 3-Helium MRI (including significant anemia [hemoglobin less than&#xD;
             or equal to 12 g/dL, with the last testing within 1 month of the MRI scan] or marked&#xD;
             oxyhemoglobin desaturation at rest when breathing room air [requiring more than 4&#xD;
             liters per minute of supplemental oxygen to keep saturation of oxygen (SaO2) at least&#xD;
             90%]).However, patients deemed to be low risk kfor complications of cerebrovascular&#xD;
             disease, cardiovascular disease, heart dysrhythmias, and seizures through the thorough&#xD;
             lung transplant evaluation will be eligible for testing. Since most of the patients&#xD;
             with these contraindications to 3-Helium MRI will be ineligible for lung&#xD;
             transplantation, we expect few patients to have such contraindications to testing.&#xD;
