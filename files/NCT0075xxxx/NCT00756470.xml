      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how well lapatinib taken alone, followed&#xD;
      by taking lapatinib with paclitaxel, and then taking lapatinib with 5-fluorouracil,&#xD;
      epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC75) works to help to control Inflammatory Breast Cancer&#xD;
      (IBC). The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins&#xD;
      inside the cancer cell, called the Her2/neu receptor and the epidermal growth factor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil are designed to block cancer cells from&#xD;
      dividing, which may slow or stop their growth and their ability to spread throughout the&#xD;
      body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epirubicin is designed to attach to DNA (the genetic material of cells) which may slow or&#xD;
      stop their growth and cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Weeks 1-24 you will take lapatinib every day by mouth with water (about 8 ounces). It&#xD;
      should be taken at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after eating. It is important that&#xD;
      you take the study drug at about the same time every day. You should not eat pamelo fruit,&#xD;
      grapefruit, star fruit, pawpaw, and/or drink their juices while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you forget to take a dose of the study drug, you should take the missed dose as soon as&#xD;
      you remember, unless it has been more than 12 hours. If it has been more than 12 hours, do&#xD;
      not take the missed dose. Instead, take the next dose as scheduled the next day. If you vomit&#xD;
      after taking the study drug, wait until the next day to take your next dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug should be stored at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. The study&#xD;
      drug should be kept away from children. About every 3 weeks, you will need to bring back your&#xD;
      empty or partially used bottle of study drug as instructed by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Weeks 3-12, you will receive paclitaxel through a needle in your vein 1 time a week. The&#xD;
      infusion will take about 1 hour. You will continue to take lapatinib every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Weeks 13-24, you will receive 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide 1 time&#xD;
      every 21 day study cycle. You will receive 4 cycles. Each 5-fluorouracil infusion will take&#xD;
      about 3-5 minutes, each epirubicin infusion will take about 5-10 minutes, and the&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide infusion will take about 45-60 minutes. You will continue to take lapatinib&#xD;
      every day during Weeks 13-24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience intolerable side effects, the study doctor may give you drugs to help with&#xD;
      this side effect or change your dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs that you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks while taking combination chemotherapy and study drug, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any changes in your health and any drugs that you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 6, you will have a CT scan, MRI, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the chemotherapy treatment, the disease will be measured by physical exam,&#xD;
      chest CT scan and sonogram to check the status of the disease. If the disease has gotten&#xD;
      worse, you will be taken off study. If the disease has gotten worse, you will be taken off&#xD;
      study. Your doctor will discuss your next step of treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the chemotherapy period, if the disease has responded well to the drugs, you&#xD;
      will have surgery to remove the breast tumor. You will sign a separate consent form for the&#xD;
      surgery. Either at the end-of-treatment visit at week 24 after you are done with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or before the surgery, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram to check your&#xD;
           hearts health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a tissue biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive the study drugs for up to 24 weeks. You will be taken off study&#xD;
      early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will have follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months after surgery. At&#xD;
      these visits, you will have a MUGA or ECHO performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have additional visits every 4 months for Years 2 and 3, and then every 6 months for&#xD;
      Years 4 and 5. At these visits, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Lapatinib is FDA approved and commercially available when&#xD;
      taken in combination with capecitabine for another type of breast cancer. Using Lapatinib in&#xD;
      inflammatory breast cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel are all FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for treating breast cancer. The combination of these drugs is not&#xD;
      currently FDA approved for the treatment of IBC. At this time, this drug combination is only&#xD;
      being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
