      This study will determine patient and provider preferences regarding vaginal speculum&#xD;
      examinations done with and without stirrups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research hypothesis: Women undergoing speculum examination will experience at least&#xD;
      20% less physical discomfort, 20% less sense of vulnerability, and 20% less sense of loss of&#xD;
      control when using a no-stirrup method of examination compared to traditional in-stirrup&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research hypothesis: 25% or less of the providers taught this alternative method of&#xD;
      speculum examination will find it to be unacceptable.&#xD;

      Subjects will be consented for inclusion into the study at the time of their presentation for&#xD;
      one of the eligible presenting complaints. Those that agree to be part of the study will then&#xD;
      be randomized to either stirrup or no-stirrup examinations. This will be done by opening&#xD;
      previously sealed envelops with a data collection sheet inside of it. The sheet will say&#xD;
      &quot;stirrups&quot; or &quot;no-stirrups&quot; at the top. This choice will be made via a random number table&#xD;
      prior to beginning the study. The patient will then undergo examination using the indicated&#xD;
      procedure. See Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo speculum examination with medium Graves speculum. Patients needing,&#xD;
      or requesting, other size speculums will be removed from the study. The participating&#xD;
      provider will fill out the top of the data collection sheets and the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out the bottom of the sheet after the provider leaves the room. The sheets will then be&#xD;
      dropped off at the nurses' station or leave them in the examination room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple aspects of physical discomfort, sense of control and sense of vulnerability will be&#xD;
      assessed using a continuous scale. Patients will be asked to place a mark on a continuous&#xD;
      line between two extremes. The distance will then be measured in millimeters in order to&#xD;
      convert it to a numeric value. The measurement will be done by an independent provider in a&#xD;
      blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical providers participating in the study will be consented for enrollment. They will be&#xD;
      mailed consent forms and asked to sign them in front of a witness and mail the consent form&#xD;
      back to the PI. They will be eligible as long as they believe they can enroll 25 patients&#xD;
      over the course of approximately one year. Providers will be trained on how to perform a&#xD;
      no-stirrup examination. The training will include standardized draping of patients as well as&#xD;
      standardized positioning of patients in order to reduce the amount of variation introduced by&#xD;
      the providers into these examinations. The training will include still images and an&#xD;
      instructional video. The Principal Investigator will be available to anyone who has further&#xD;
      questions regarding the technique. Participating providers will also be asked to perform at&#xD;
      least 5 no-stirrup examinations on non-study subjects prior to beginning enrollment into the&#xD;
      study to ensure familiarization with the technique. Providers will be recruited if they agree&#xD;
      to attempt to enroll 25 or more patients to the study over the course of approximately one&#xD;
      year. This will not be a difficult number to achieve for an active clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers who had not been trained on the no-stirrup speculum examination prior to the&#xD;
      beginning this study will be sent a questionnaire querying them about their experience with&#xD;
      the method after all data is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protected Health Information will not be collect, so HIPAA forms will not be required.&#xD;
