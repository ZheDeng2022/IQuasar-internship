  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a variety of changes in the immune system. These changes result in a&#xD;
      less effective immune response, which places the elderly at a greater risk for infection and&#xD;
      disease. Respiratory infections cause a great number of morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      elderly population. Vitamin E has been known to improve the immune response of the elderly&#xD;
      and has been suggested for use in preventative strategies for this population. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the effect of one year vitamin supplementation on respiratory&#xD;
      infection in the elderly population residing in nursing homes. This study was conducted using&#xD;
      a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial at 33 long-term care facilities&#xD;
      in the greater Boston area. A total of 617 subjects over the age of 65 were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, with 451 completers. The participants were supplemented wit either 200 IU of vitamin E&#xD;
      per day or placebo. The primary outcomes consisted of respiratory tract infection, number of&#xD;
      sick days, and antibiotic use. The study involved use of questionnaires, standard&#xD;
      anthropometrics measurements, non-invasive body composition, blood and urine sample&#xD;
      collection, and delayed type test (DTH) using the Mantoux method. This study has been closed&#xD;
      since August 2000 and is in the stage of data analysis only.&#xD;
