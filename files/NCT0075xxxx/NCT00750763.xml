  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation for assessing the lining of the colon. Colon&#xD;
      cleansing preparations are required to be taken prior to colonoscopy to provide effective&#xD;
      visualisation and identification of any abnormalities and different types of colon cleansing&#xD;
      preparations exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some colon cleansing preparations have been shown to cause visible changes in the lining of&#xD;
      the bowel which may cause confusion and incorrect diagnoses to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This audit aims to assess the ability of different colon cleansing preparations to clear the&#xD;
      colon of faeces. The tolerability of each will also be assessed, as will any changes in the&#xD;
      lining of the bowel to assess if one type of colon preparation is more likely to cause&#xD;
      visible changes than another.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several published trials of different colon cleansing agents for colonoscopy (which&#xD;
      is the investigation of choice for visualisation of the colonic mucosa) which compare&#xD;
      different regimens. However, a recent published meta-analysis has shown that most audits and&#xD;
      studies were underpowered with poor study design and so no consensus on the most effective&#xD;
      preparation exists1. 10-20% of failed colonoscopy is attributable to inadequate bowel&#xD;
      cleansing which has a negative impact on the detection of potential malignant lesions in the&#xD;
      colon3 as well as requiring the patient to attend again for further colonoscopy after&#xD;
      repeated colon cleansing which also impacts on waiting lists and healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon cleansing preparations can be broadly classified into three groups. Osmotic laxatives&#xD;
      such as sodium phosphate (NaP) increase colon water content by attracting extracellular fluid&#xD;
      efflux through the bowel wall. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxatives are high molecular weight&#xD;
      non-absorbable polymers that are administered in a dilute electrolyte solution, this is&#xD;
      retained in the colon where it acts as a bowel cleanser without any significant fluid&#xD;
      exchange across the colonic mucosa. The third group are stimulant laxatives such as senna or&#xD;
      sodium picosulphate which work primarily by enhancing smooth muscle contractility and also&#xD;
      they may increase bowel water content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous published audits and studies comparing different types of colon cleansing&#xD;
      preparations have been limited by small sample size with only 5 published papers having over&#xD;
      100 patients in each arm of the study. These 5 studies suggest that NaP may be better than&#xD;
      PEG but the recent meta-analysis failed to show this, primarily due to the large number of&#xD;
      smaller studies showing PEG was better than NaP. Interpretation of the studies is limited by&#xD;
      inconsistent and poorly defined measures of efficacy outcome. Most studies have used a&#xD;
      subjective endoscopists assessment of the overall quality of the bowel preparation making&#xD;
      comparisons between studies impossible. Recently a calibrated externally validated outcome&#xD;
      assessment tool has been developed to objectively quantify the quality of bowel preparation4,&#xD;
      but no randomised published study has yet utilised this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of clear difference in efficacy between preparations then patient tolerability&#xD;
      is likely to be an important distinguishing feature when selecting a treatment. Data on&#xD;
      tolerability outcomes is limited but there is some evidence that PEG solutions are less well&#xD;
      tolerated due to the volume of liquid required to drink. This is an area where further study&#xD;
      is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of a colonic cleansing preparation to clean the colon effectively also must be&#xD;
      balanced by its ability to not induce changes in the lining of the bowel itself. Ulceration&#xD;
      and inflammation of the colon has been shown to occur in 3-24% of patients using NaP compared&#xD;
      with 1-2% in those receiving PEG. Such findings can be mistaken for inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease such as Crohns or put down to drug induced changes such as non steroidal anti&#xD;
      inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). However, these studies have been either non randomised5 or&#xD;
      underpowered to detect real differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most satisfactory colonic cleansing agent in terms of efficacy, tolerability and safety&#xD;
      therefore remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess which bowel preparation provides the best colon cleansing using a validated&#xD;
           score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the incidence of mucosal inflammation/ulceration induced by each colon&#xD;
           cleansing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To see which colon cleansing agent is best tolerated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this audit will enable the type of colonic cleansing preparation&#xD;
      to be tailored to the subjects indication for requiring colonoscopy. For example in those&#xD;
      with possible inflammatory bowel disease the colon cleansing agent which produces the least&#xD;
      mucosal inflammation would be required to reduce the incidence of a false positive diagnosis&#xD;
      whilst the colon cleansing agent which is most tolerable may be more important in the&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective blinded audit comparing three colon cleansing agents, which&#xD;
      are used routinely in clinical practice for colonoscopy. The three will be Sodium Phosphate&#xD;
      (Fleet), Sodium Picosulphate (Picolax/Picoprep) and PEG (Colonlytlye).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are referred to undergo colonoscopy would be entered into the study except&#xD;
      for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or suspected inflammatory bowel disease, or&#xD;
           patients on current non steroidal antiinflammatory medication (excluding low dose&#xD;
           aspirin). These patients may have mucosal inflammation/ulceration which would prevent&#xD;
           analysis of mucosal abnormalities due to the colon cleansing agent and so would not be&#xD;
           studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with heart failure (NYHA &gt;2) or renal failure (GFR&lt;30) (since fluid shifts&#xD;
           associated with sodium phosphate bowel preparation have been reported).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients over the age of 75 due to potential dehydration and hyperphosphatemia from&#xD;
           the bowel preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient would be randomised to receive one of the three colon cleansing agents (Sodium&#xD;
      Phosphate, Sodium Picosulphate or PEG) that are routinely used in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      endoscopy administration staff at each site would be responsible for random allocation of the&#xD;
      bowel preparation using random number generation with the resultant bowel preparation being&#xD;
      collected by the patient from a pharmacy, as per usual practice, prior to the colonoscopy.&#xD;
      There are no exclusion criteria for bowel preparation selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of colonoscopy but prior to the procedure an assessment of the tolerability of the&#xD;
      colon cleansing agent would be made using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During colonoscopy an assessment of the efficacy of the colon cleansing agent is made by the&#xD;
      blinded colonoscopist using the previously validated Ottawa bowel preparation assessment&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
