  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : The objective of this study is to determine if bromfenac reduces diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      (DME) as an adjunct to argon laser therapy (ALT). Leading cause of Blindness in the&#xD;
      working-aged population in the United States. 60% of patients with Type-II DM, and nearly all&#xD;
      with Type-I DM progress to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in twenty years. Diabetic Macular Edema&#xD;
      is the principal cause of vision loss in DR. Approximately 50% of patients with DME will&#xD;
      experience a loss of &gt;=2 lines of best-corrected visualacuity (VA) after 2 years of&#xD;
      follow-up. The pathogenesis of DME is multifactorial and complex, but intervention stratagem&#xD;
      have tended to be singular. Photocoagulation laser applied directly to leaking microaneurysms&#xD;
      and a &quot;grid&quot; of laser has been the mainstays of treatment since the publication of the Early&#xD;
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). This landmark clinical trial was an NIH&#xD;
      sponsored, multicenter, controlled study that demonstrated efficacy of laser for diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema. It also demonstrated that 20% of patients did not respond. Recent efforts to&#xD;
      improve the results are focusing on pharmaceutical interventions injected into the vitreous&#xD;
      cavity. The route of administration and lack of substantiated efficacy are problematic.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female &gt;18 years of age scheduled to undergo argon laser therapy. Patients&#xD;
             with diabetic macular edema (DME) and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy as&#xD;
             evidenced by ophthalmic examination and diagnostics, with either central macular or&#xD;
             peripheral involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a normal menstrual cycle and a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test result prior to study entry. Women must be either&#xD;
             post-menopausal or surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
             bilateral oopherectomy), or women of childbearing potential must use an effective&#xD;
             method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives (i.e. pill, patch, ring, injection, implant), intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide or condom with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The incidence of DME will be determined by 2 methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of clinical DME can be made by the masked investigator during the study&#xD;
                  based on the investigator's medical opinion and expertise&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of DME by a masked clinical specialist will review all Optical&#xD;
                  Coherence Tomography (OCT) after conclusion of study. The diagnosis will be&#xD;
                  stratified into 3 categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Definite DME: retinal swelling or blurred vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Probable DME: Presence of changes in retinal swelling or blurred vision&#xD;
                       noted from baseline to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Possible DME: subtle to moderate changes in retinal swelling or blurred&#xD;
                       vision noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) ranging between 20/40 and 20/400.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received intra-vitreal/sub-tenon corticosteroid injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Macular scarring/fibrosis, advanced cataract, advanced glaucoma, retinal pigment&#xD;
             epithelial detachments (RPEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other causes affecting visual improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to bromfenac or NSAIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to sulfite.&#xD;
