    <textblock>
      The data available for the efficacy of AScVS and prazosin is generated through different&#xD;
      trials done in different clinical setting. Hence it was felt worthwhile to confirm the&#xD;
      documented efficacy of AScVS and prazosin in terms of time taken for clinical recovery in a&#xD;
      clinical trial. Along with this, effects of both the therapies on various biochemical&#xD;
      parameters will be recorded and compared with. It was also felt necessary to study the effect&#xD;
      of combination on the clinical outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Red Scorpion (Mesobuthus Tamulus Concanesis Pocock) sting is a common medical emergency in&#xD;
      the coastal regions of India and is a cause for considerable morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms show either cholinergic or adrenergic predominance. Cholinergic symptoms&#xD;
      are profuse sweating, priapism, bradycardia, increased salivary and bronchial secretions and&#xD;
      vomiting. Adrenergic symptoms are transient hypertension followed by hypotension,&#xD;
      tachycardia, tachypnoea, pulmonary edema and circulatory failure in later stages. Scorpion&#xD;
      venom blocks voltage dependent inactivation of sodium channels, resulting in intense&#xD;
      persistent voltage depolarization of autonomic nerves with massive release of catecholamines&#xD;
      from adrenal medulla and parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve endings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prazosin a selective alpha-1 blocker is used as the treatment for scorpion sting, which can&#xD;
      only counteract the manifestations of sympathetic over-activity. Experimentally and&#xD;
      clinically it is seen that scorpion venom stays in the body for 24-36 hours, as Prazosin does&#xD;
      not neutralize the venom, 3 hourly round the clock doses of prazosin and continuous I.C.U.&#xD;
      monitoring is necessary with alpha blocker therapy. However, ideal treatment modality remains&#xD;
      neutralization of venom in the systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1997 enzyme refined AScVS ( Monovalent Anti-scorpion venom serum against Mesobuthus&#xD;
      tamulus concanesis Pocock.) has been made available by Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals, Mumbai&#xD;
      for field use. Throughout the konkan(western coastal Maharashtra, India) area the same&#xD;
      species of scorpions responsible for fatal envenomation is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1997-2002, 48 patients of serious scorpion envenomation were treated with AScVS(1).&#xD;
      Based on this experience a clinical scoring system for dose requirement was evolved based on&#xD;
      sweating, pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, CNS effects and presence of priapism.&#xD;
      In our experience computed doses given as intravenous bolus are more effective and&#xD;
      successfully ameliorated signs and symptoms in all patients. Subsequently 16 patients were&#xD;
      given treatment with either AScVS (n=8), Prazosin (n=5) and a combination of both (n=3) so as&#xD;
      to compare the effects of these available treatment modalities. It was found that the&#xD;
      patients receiving either AScVs or a combination showed a complete recovery approximately&#xD;
      within 4 hours of onset of therapy as against patients receiving Prazosin, who required 16&#xD;
      hours for recovery. There was no mortality in any of the group. There was not a single&#xD;
      incidence of anaphylaxis after administration of AScVS. Release of adrenaline in the systemic&#xD;
      circulation by scorpion sting itself appears to be protective against the danger of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis. The label on the AScVS vials states that the maximum dose is 3 vials, which can&#xD;
      be given either intramuscular or by intravenous route. However we used AScVS as slow bolus&#xD;
      intravenously and dose was decided clinically depending upon the severity of the patient&#xD;
      condition. (maximum 10-15vials.) Based on this experience, an open labeled, randomized&#xD;
      controlled parallel group clinical trial has been initiated. Eighty-three patients have been&#xD;
      recruited so far, 28 patients each, in AScVS and AScVS + prazosin group and 27 patients in&#xD;
      Prazosin group, two patients out of 27 in Prazosin group were withdrawn as both the pediatric&#xD;
      patients (around 12 years old) developed pulmonary edema after few hours, so AScVS had to be&#xD;
      given. The onset of relief (based on composite score) with AScVS or combination of AScVS with&#xD;
      prazosin was early and complete recovery occurred at 4.14+/- 1.6 hrs. and 3.46+/- 1.10hours.&#xD;
      However, in patients receiving only prazosin, the clinical score was found to worsen&#xD;
      initially, followed by a gradual improvement and subsequent complete recovery, at 19.28 +/-&#xD;
      5.03 hrs. (p&lt;0.001 vs AScVS). Recovery time with AScVS is much shorter because after complete&#xD;
      neutralization of venom, fresh secretion of catecholamines stop and adrenaline and&#xD;
      nor-adrenaline which are already in circulation have action as short as 1 to 2 minutes. These&#xD;
      findings appear consistent with our clinical experience and indicate that in the near future&#xD;
      AScVS would evolve as a safe, efficacious and life saving treatment modality for patients&#xD;
      with severe scorpion envenomation. Use of clinical scoring system can enable the clinician to&#xD;
      select the optimum dose of AScVS to be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutralization of venom is thus proved to be better than therapy for complications, akin to&#xD;
      the dictum 'prevention is better than cure'.&#xD;
