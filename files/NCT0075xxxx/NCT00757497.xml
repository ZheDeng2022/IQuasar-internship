      This study will test whether transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) can be used&#xD;
      safely in children with schizophrenia and if it can improve memory and attention span or&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations in these children, at least temporarily. TDCS has temporarily&#xD;
      improved memory and attention span in healthy adults and a similar method called TMS has&#xD;
      relieved auditory hallucinations in adults with schizophrenia. For the TDCS procedure, the&#xD;
      child sits in a chair and two soft sponge electrodes are placed on the child s forehead and&#xD;
      held in place with a soft wrapping. One sponge electrode is placed on an arm. The electrodes&#xD;
      are attached to a stimulator with a wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with schizophrenia who meet the following criteria may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are 10 yrs or older age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are participating in NIH protocol 03-M-0035.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are on a stable medication regimen for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have problems with memory and attention span or have auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either real or sham TDCS on an inpatient or&#xD;
      outpatient basis in 20-minute sessions daily, except weekends, for 10 days. For real TDCS,&#xD;
      patients receive stimulation to the front of the brain. For sham stimulation, the children&#xD;
      have electrodes placed on the forehead, but no actual stimulation is delivered. In addition&#xD;
      to TDCS, patients have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checks of blood pressure, pulse and breathing rate before, during and right after each&#xD;
           stimulation and again 8 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) before starting stimulation and&#xD;
           after completing the 10 days of TDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews and examinations to check for side effects of TDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pen-and-paper or computer tests of learning, attention and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the 10 sessions, children who were in the sham TDCS group are offered the&#xD;
           same number of sessions of active TDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up telephone call 1 month after the end of stimulation to see how the child is&#xD;
           doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1- to 2-day outpatient visit 6 months after the stimulation. This visit includes&#xD;
           interviews with the parent and the child, rating of the child s psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
           and pen-and-paper or computer tests of thinking, attention and memory.&#xD;

      Background: The majority (about 75%) of patients with childhood onset schizophrenia still&#xD;
      have impairing cognitive and psychotic symptoms after drug treatment optimization. Recent&#xD;
      studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) indicate moderate efficacy in symptom&#xD;
      reduction in adult patients with schizophrenia. Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (TDCS) may be a safe and effective additional treatment of residual symptoms of schizophrenia&#xD;
      in medication stable patients. Recent research into adult-onset schizophrenia established&#xD;
      both safety and efficacy in 20-minute daily DC polarization (TDSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish whether bilateral DC polarization (using TDCS) of either dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex or superior temporal cortex is safe in patients with childhood onset&#xD;
      schizophrenia and whether it is associated with improvement in cognitive performance or&#xD;
      reduction in auditory hallucination (psychotic symptoms) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Up to 40 patients with schizophrenia, ages 10 and older will be recruited.&#xD;
      All patients will be on optimized medications for at least 2 months prior to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The design has two concurrent study options; both double-blind sham controlled, with&#xD;
      10-day, 40-minute daily DC polarization. Patients will be selected for one of the two&#xD;
      treatment options: 1. Bilateral Anodal DC polarization of prefrontal cortex or 2. Bilateral&#xD;
      Cathodal DC polarization of superior temporal cortex. A small battery powered device&#xD;
      (Phoresor II Auto Model PM850) approved by the FDA for iontophoretic transdermal drug&#xD;
      delivery will be used to administer the DC current. Sham treatment will be electrode&#xD;
      placement without current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure would be to determine whether TDCS treatment is&#xD;
      safe in children and adults with schizophrenia, as assessed by vital signs monitoring,&#xD;
      reporting/evaluation of adverse effects, clinical ratings and neurocognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: The secondary outcome measures would be improvement on 1)&#xD;
      Hallucination Change Scale (HCS) and Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) for auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations; SAPS, SANS and BPRS scales for psychotic symptoms and 2) performance on the&#xD;
      working memory (verbal and non verbal), attention/vigilance, and verbal learning sub tests&#xD;
      for cognitive improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Measure: Effect of DC polarization on regional GM cortical thickness in DLPFC and&#xD;
      STG regions.&#xD;
