      This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TriCilest as comparted with Diane-35&#xD;
      among female patients with moderate acne vulgaris. The study design was double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel and active controlled. The sponsor planned to recruit approximately 50&#xD;
      patients to complete 40 evaluable patients. At the end of the study, a total of 48 patients&#xD;
      were randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TriCilest (noregestimate-ethinyl estradiol), 0.18mg-0.035mg or 0.215mg-0.035mg or&#xD;
      0.25mg-0.035mg, Oral admistration, The duration was three consecutive menstrual cycles.&#xD;
