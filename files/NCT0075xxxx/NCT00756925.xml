  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is an insidious disease underscored by a powerful proclivity to relapse&#xD;
      despite an individual's ability to recognize the deleterious consequences of continued drug&#xD;
      use. To date, there are only a limited number of treatments, and no FDA approved medications&#xD;
      for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Attempts to find reliable and successful treatments&#xD;
      for cocaine dependence may be marred by gender differences in brain chemistry, structure, and&#xD;
      function that are manifested as drug craving and relapse. For example, cues, drug exposure,&#xD;
      and stress promote relapse, yet females appear be more susceptible to stress induced relapse,&#xD;
      while males may be more susceptible to cue induced relapse. Therefore identifying the neural&#xD;
      substrates involved in processing the valence of internal and external stimuli may provide&#xD;
      further insight into cocaine dependence and provide more effective therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      aimed at preventing relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is a pharmacological activator of the hypothalamic&#xD;
      pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, and has been implicated in stress induced drug relapse.&#xD;
      Corticotropin releasing hormone receptors are located at extrahypothalamic brain nuclei that&#xD;
      have been implicated in determining the significance of both internal (somatic) and external&#xD;
      (environmental) stimuli. The primary directive of this pilot project is to utilize functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify possible brain nuclei associated with with&#xD;
      stress induced drug craving in cocaine dependent females.&#xD;

        A total of 20 cocaine dependent subjects (10 cocaine dependent females and 10 cocaine&#xD;
        dependent males) will be enrolled in the study. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in&#xD;
        Section E, Human Subjects. Cocaine subjects will be matched for age and nicotine&#xD;
        dependence. Women taking birth control pills, or Depo Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate)&#xD;
        will be excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be recruited through the use of flyers, advertisements on the MUSC website,&#xD;
        MUSC broadcast messages, advertisement in local newspapers and weeklies, and similar&#xD;
        ongoing studies within the Clinical Neuroscience Division.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Right-handed&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males and females meeting criteria for cocaine dependence (DSM-IV), within the past&#xD;
             three months (current).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual&#xD;
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must consent to remain abstinent from all drugs of abuse (except nicotine)&#xD;
             for a three-day period immediately prior to the GCRC admission. Nicotine dependence&#xD;
             can affect HPA function therefore it would be ideal to exclude subjects with nicotine&#xD;
             use. Because of the comorbidity of cocaine and nicotine dependence, this would&#xD;
             seriously compromise the feasibility of recruitment. Alcohol has also been known to&#xD;
             affect HPA function, however to enhance recruitment efforts, individuals with alcohol&#xD;
             dependence or abuse will be included in the study if they do not require medically&#xD;
             supervised detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants must have a negative breathalyzer, urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must consent to outpatient admission to the GCRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease including&#xD;
             diabetes, as these conditions may affect HPA axis function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with any liver function test of greater than two times normal, as compromised&#xD;
             liver function can interfere with HPA axis activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with Addison's disease, Cushing's disease or other diseases of the adrenal&#xD;
             cortex likely to affect HPA axis function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of or current psychotic disorder or bipolar affective disorder&#xD;
             as these may interfere with HPA function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with current major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder as&#xD;
             these disorders are associated with characteristic changes in HPA axis function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects receiving synthetic glucocorticoid therapy, any exogenous steroid therapy, or&#xD;
             treatment with other agents, that interfere with HPA axis function within one month of&#xD;
             the time of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects taking opiates, opiate antagonists, or benzodiazepines. (Subjects who have&#xD;
             been maintained on SSRI's, anticonvulsants, or antipsychotics (for sleep only) for&#xD;
             more than 8 weeks or longer are NOT excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with any acute illness or fever as this may affect HPA axis activity.&#xD;
             Individuals who otherwise meet study criteria will be rescheduled for evaluation for&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who are &gt; 30% over ideal weight or have a BMI greater than 30 will be&#xD;
             considered for study participation based on the clinical judgment of study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who are unwilling to maintain abstinence from alcohol and other drugs of&#xD;
             abuse (except nicotine) for two days prior to the stress task procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Persons with ferrous metal implants or pacemaker since fMRI will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects that are claustrophobic&#xD;
