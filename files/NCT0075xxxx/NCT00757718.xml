    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common problem in the adult population. By conservative&#xD;
      estimates, 4% of the adult female population has SDB. SDB is a recognized cause of&#xD;
      hypertension and treating SDB can improve blood pressure control in people with hypertension.&#xD;
      More recently, research efforts have looked at SDB as a possible cause of pregnancy induced&#xD;
      hypertension (PIH), a condition which complicates 10% of pregnancies. Traditionally, the best&#xD;
      way to assess SDB required patients to spend a night sleeping in the Sleep Laboratory. This&#xD;
      is inconvenient and for pregnant women often impossible to arrange, considering the short&#xD;
      time frame that exists between time of PIH diagnosis and eventual delivery. Researchers at&#xD;
      the University of Saskatchewan are now looking at whether an adequate sleep assessment can be&#xD;
      performed at the bedside - either in a patient's home or on the hospital ward. The&#xD;
      researchers will also look at different treatment options for sleep apnea, to see if these&#xD;
      can improve blood pressure control in this patient population, and delay the need for early&#xD;
      delivery. The information from this study may result in a detailed sleep assessment becoming&#xD;
      part of the complete assessment of women with PIH. There is an association between sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing (SDB) and gestational hypertension (GHTN). Treatment for the SDB may&#xD;
      represent an effective addition to the management of the cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      perturbations of GHTN We plan to assess women whether treating SDB with one of two methods&#xD;
      will improve the management of GHTN. We will also assess if one method is more effective than&#xD;
      the other.&#xD;
