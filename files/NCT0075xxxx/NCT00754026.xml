  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain following shoulder surgery is reported as severe for 70% of patients, and is a major&#xD;
      concern in both hospitalised and ambulatory surgery patients. Pain control is particularly&#xD;
      important, as adequate analgesia allows rapid mobilisation of the operated shoulder and&#xD;
      prevents complications related to immobility. Several methods have been proposed to treat&#xD;
      this pain, the most promising being the interscalene nerve block. The injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetics reduces sensation from the shoulder and provides better pain relief after surgery&#xD;
      than narcotic medication. To prolong the duration of the analgesia, a catheter must be&#xD;
      positioned next to the brachial plexus. Through this catheter, small quantities of local&#xD;
      anesthetics can be continuously delivered for several hours after surgery, effectively&#xD;
      relieving the worst of the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the continuous interscalene nerve block has been shown to improve pain relief, to&#xD;
      reduce nausea, vomiting, pruritus and sleep disturbances after shoulder surgery. It also&#xD;
      reduces the need for opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, catheter techniques were not frequently used due to technical difficulties&#xD;
      encountered with catheter installation and catheter displacement after surgery. Due to recent&#xD;
      improvements in nerve and catheter localisation, catheter installation has become easier,&#xD;
      more precise and more reliable. However, the distance at which the catheter must be advanced&#xD;
      next to the brachial plexus in order to provide the best pain relief remains unknown.&#xD;
      Insertion distance could influence the initial quality and distribution of the freezing, its&#xD;
      duration, or both. Therefore, this study is designed to compare two catheter insertion&#xD;
      distances, in order to help determine which is best for pain relief after shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Insertion of the catheter :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1 : 2 cm insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2 : 6 cm insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anesthesiologist will insert the interscalene catheter before the beginning of&#xD;
           anesthesia for surgery. The usual medication will be used to make the installation of&#xD;
           the catheter comfortable. Standard non-invasive monitoring will be used. The exact&#xD;
           location where the catheter will be put in place will be identified using an ultrasound&#xD;
           machine. This device will allow the anesthesiologist to identify the various anatomical&#xD;
           structures. A specially designed needle will be inserted next to the brachial plexus and&#xD;
           its position will be confirmed with a neurostimulator. Once the adequacy of needle&#xD;
           position is confirmed, the anesthesiologist will introduce 2 cm (Group 1) or 6 cm (Group&#xD;
           2) of the catheter through the needle, and then will withdraw the needle. The catheter&#xD;
           will be fixed in place to avoid displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive standard regional or general anesthesia for this type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-operative analgesia :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients : patients will receive, through the interscalene catheter, a&#xD;
                continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0,15% at the rate of 5 mL/h for at least 24&#xD;
                hours post-operatively After surgery, pain will be assessed using a verbal numeric&#xD;
                pain scale. Patients will be asked to fill out a pain intensity measurement form&#xD;
                using a 0-10 pain scale at 3, 6 and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inpatients : along with the infusion; a Patient Controlled Analgesia pump will be&#xD;
                provided to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ambulatory patients : the infusion will be given through a disposable elastomeric&#xD;
                pump. Along with the infusion, patients will receive oral hydromorphone to complete&#xD;
                pain relief. Patients will receive standard post-operative instructions on the use&#xD;
                of the pump and catheter. Telephone and pager numbers for physicians available at&#xD;
                all time will also be provided to each patient. They will be asked to record their&#xD;
                opioid use on a medication log for the first 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sensory block will be assessed in the major nerve distributions of the arm at 24 h after&#xD;
           surgery. Ambulatory patients will be invited to return to the hospital to have this&#xD;
           assessment performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a phone call from the research team one week after surgery to&#xD;
      assess their satisfaction towards the analgesia and to inquire about potential complications&#xD;
      of the interscalene block.&#xD;
