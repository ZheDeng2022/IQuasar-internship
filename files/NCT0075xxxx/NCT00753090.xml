      This study is being conducted on the Vanguard™ Deep Dish Rotating Platform (DD RP) to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of the DDRP components.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vanguard™ Deep Dish Rotating&#xD;
      Platform Knee (mobile bearing knee) as compared to Vanguard Cruciate Retaining Knee (fixed&#xD;
      bearing knee). This trial will be conducted as the randomised, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant loosening and polyethylene wear in fixed-bearing knee prostheses were recognized as&#xD;
      major causes of late failure. The mobile bearing knee have the theoretical advantages of&#xD;
      potentially minimizing the polyethylene wear and reducing implant to bone interface stress in&#xD;
      order to reduce the incidence of implant loosening. Therefore, the aims of this study are to&#xD;
      prove the Vanguard deep dish rotating platform knee is at least as effective in clinical&#xD;
      outcome as the widely used current design of knee replacement and better in long term&#xD;
      survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the device will be determined by the relief of pain, restoration of function&#xD;
      and range of motion. The durability of device will be determined by the absence of&#xD;
      revision/removal and radiological integrity. To assess the safety of the device, all post&#xD;
      operative complications will be recorded either device related or otherwise. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction as determined by answers to patient outcome questionnaires (Oxford Knee Score,&#xD;
      WOMAC and Lower Extremity Activity Scale).&#xD;
