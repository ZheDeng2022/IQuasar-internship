      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been given a high priority for genetic and neurobiological&#xD;
      study. There is no such information in Asian population and no study has conducted using&#xD;
      Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) to investigate the connectivity throughout the world.&#xD;
      Moreover, no follow-up study has been done to examine the developmental changes of structural&#xD;
      and functional connectivity. We anticipate to establishing a cohort of 50 ASD and their&#xD;
      siblings with complete clinical, neuropsychological, brain imaging, and genetic data for&#xD;
      longitudinal study on ASD. Our findings will contribute to our understanding of the&#xD;
      structural and functional dysconnectivity for ASD and whether dysconnectivity can be an&#xD;
      endophenotype for ASD and used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neuro-developmental disorder with prominent&#xD;
      reciprocal social and communication impairment and restricted repetitive behavior or&#xD;
      interest. Because ASD runs in family, because there is no effective biological treatment, and&#xD;
      because early intervention can lead to better outcomes, ASD has been given a high priority&#xD;
      for genetic and neurobiological study. Although abnormal brain structure has been reported,&#xD;
      there is limited data regarding structural and functional dysconnectivity in autism. There is&#xD;
      no such information in Asian population and no study has conducted using Diffusion Spectrum&#xD;
      Imaging (DSI) to investigate the connectivity throughout the world. Moreover, no follow-up&#xD;
      study has been done to examine the developmental changes of structural and functional&#xD;
      connectivity. We thus propose this prospectively follow-up brain imaging study on ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the location and extend of structural and functional dysconnectivity and&#xD;
           their changes over a 2-year period among children with ASD, as compared to their&#xD;
           unaffected siblings and normal controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate the structural and functional dysconnectivity to clinical severity and&#xD;
           neuropsychological functioning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the association between brain dysconnectivity and several candidate genes&#xD;
           related to the CNS patterning (e.g., RELN, En-2, Wnt, bcl-2); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test whether neuropsychological and brain imaging findings can be the intermediate&#xD;
           phenotype of ASD for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 50 children with DSM-IV ASD (autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder) aged&#xD;
      3-15, their siblings, and 50 age-, sex-, and handedness-matached healthy controls. A number&#xD;
      of instruments will be used to measure autistic symptoms, functional levels, and cognitive&#xD;
      ability (i.e. ADI-R, ADOS, SCQ, SRS, and CAST; WISC-III (WPPSI-R, Bayley), DDST, CPM, and&#xD;
      SPM; CPT, WCST, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries). We will also look&#xD;
      directly at the brain for structural and functional connectivity using the DSI and fMRI,&#xD;
      respectively. We will repeat the assessments at a 2-year interval. The major tasks consisted&#xD;
      of five parts: (1) 3 months-recruitment of subjects, researcher training, and pilot study;&#xD;
      (2) 1 years 6 months-clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, DSI and fMRI assessments of 150&#xD;
      subjects; (3) 6 months-data analysis, reports to subjects, and manuscript preparation; (4) 1&#xD;
      years 6 months-same assessment of 150 subjects at a 2-year interval; (5) 4 months-data&#xD;
      analysis, reports to subjects, and manuscript preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate to establishing a cohort of 50 ASD and their siblings with complete clinical,&#xD;
      neuropsychological, brain imaging, and genetic data for longitudinal study on ASD. Our&#xD;
      findings will contribute to our understanding of the structural and functional&#xD;
      dysconnectivity for ASD and whether dysconnectivity can be an endophenotype for ASD and used&#xD;
      as a biomarker for early diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for the subjects with ASD are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  that subjects have a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder, or Asperger disorder&#xD;
             defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10, which was made by a full-time board-certificated&#xD;
             child psychiatrist at the first visit and following visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  their ages range from 3 to 15 when we conduct the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects and their biological parents (and siblings if any) consent to participate in&#xD;
             this study for completing clinical and brain imaging assessments and blood withdraw&#xD;
             for genetic study (this criteria also applied to the controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proband subjects will be excluded from the study if they currently meet criteria or&#xD;
        have a history of the following condition as defined by DSM-IV:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Schizoaffective Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organic Psychosis&#xD;
