      This study is designed to compare thoracic epidural catheter insertion distances, in order to&#xD;
      determine which is the best for pain relief following a thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The quality of epidural analgesia upon coughing one hour following the end of surgery&#xD;
           will not be inferior if the catheter is inserted 7 cm in the epidural space, versus 3&#xD;
           and 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The quality of epidural analgesia upon coughing at 24 hour will not be inferior if the&#xD;
           catheter is inserted 3 cm in the epidural space, versus 5 and 7 cm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgery such as posterolateral thoracotomy is associated with severe postoperative&#xD;
      pain. Pain control is particularly important, as adequate analgesia allows rapid mobilisation&#xD;
      and prevents complications related to immobility. Over the last years, thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia has become increasingly popular and is now considered the gold standard after&#xD;
      thoracotomy. Thoracic epidural analgesia improves pain relief and also significantly&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of morbidity and mortality following pulmonary resection. It also&#xD;
      reduces the length of stay in the hospital and long-term pain 6 months after surgery. This&#xD;
      method is now offered to a majority of patients undergoing a thoracotomy in our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placement of a catheter in the thoracic epidural space remains a challenge for the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Suboptimal placement of the catheter within the epidural space can result&#xD;
      in inadequate pain relief. The distance at which the catheter must be advanced in the&#xD;
      thoracic epidural space remains unknown. Insertion distance could influence the initial&#xD;
      quality and distribution of sensory blockade, its duration, or both. Therefore, this study is&#xD;
      designed to compare three catheter insertion distances, in order to help determine which is&#xD;
      best for pain relief after a thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Insertion of the epidural catheter :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1 : 3 cm insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2 : 5 cm insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 3 : 7 cm insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anesthesiologist will insert the epidural catheter at T6-T7 before the induction of&#xD;
           anesthesia for surgery. The usual medication will be used to make catheter installation&#xD;
           comfortable. Standard non-invasive monitoring will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Correct placement of the epidural catheter will be assessed by infusing a bolus of 5 mL&#xD;
           of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 1 : 200,000. After induction of anesthesia and after&#xD;
           placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, the epidural infusion&#xD;
           (bupivacaine 0.1% and fentanyl 2 mcg/mL) will be started at a rate of 0.1 mL/kg/h.&#xD;
           Adjustments will be made between 4 to 16 mL/h with boluses of 0.1 mL/kg (maximum 7 mL)&#xD;
           of solution as needed. Surgery will be performed under general anesthesia using a&#xD;
           standardised protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-operative analgesia :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain will be assessed using a verbal numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 refers to &quot; no&#xD;
           pain &quot; and 10 refers to &quot; the worst pain imaginable &quot;. Pain at the surgical site and&#xD;
           post-thoracotomy shoulder pain will be assessed separately. Post-thoracotomy shoulder&#xD;
           pain will be treated with acetaminophen 975 mg every 6 hours and nonsteroidal&#xD;
           antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients experiencing moderate to severe pain at the surgical incision site will receive&#xD;
           a bolus of 0.1 mL/kg (maximum 7 mL) of epidural solution, and the infusion rate will be&#xD;
           increased in 2 mL/h increments, to a maximum infusion rate of 16 mL/h. The infusion rate&#xD;
           will be adjusted to maintain a pain score at the surgical site of 3 or less on the&#xD;
           numeric rating scale. One hour after arrival in the recovery room, NRS during cough, at&#xD;
           rest, and upon palpation, as well as loss of cold sensation will be assessed by a member&#xD;
           of the research team who is blinded to the patient's group assignment. Total bupivacaine&#xD;
           and morphine doses will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 hours after surgery, NRS during cough, at rest, and upon palpation, as well as loss of&#xD;
      cold sensation, will be assessed by a member of the research team who is blinded to the&#xD;
      patient's group assignment. Total bupivacaine and morphine doses will be recorded. Catheter&#xD;
      distance at the skin will be verified for displacement.&#xD;
