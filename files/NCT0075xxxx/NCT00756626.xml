      This Integrated Project (Research + Extension) aims to reduce the risk of early childhood&#xD;
      overweight through changing bottle-feeding behavior. Excess bottles of whole milk and sweet&#xD;
      beverages beyond the advised weaning age of 12 months, &quot;inappropriate bottle-feeding,&quot; has&#xD;
      been linked to overweight. Our pilot of this intervention reduced bottle use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPONENTS OF THE 'FEEDING YOUNG CHILDREN STUDY' (FYCS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)- of a bottle-weaning intervention in low-income&#xD;
           multi-ethnic toddlers, will enroll n=464 12 month olds using &gt;2 bottles/day from two WIC&#xD;
           sites. Bottle use, anthropometrics, dietary intake, and nutrient density outcomes will&#xD;
           be assessed at Baseline, and 4 times over a 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observational Study- nested within the RCT, will describe dietary intake and nutrient&#xD;
           density data (24 hour recalls) for this period of feeding transitions. FYCS fills a gap&#xD;
           in knowledge about this population's dietary habits, and their relationship to bottle&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extension- our Marketing Department will produce: a 5-8 minute 'infomercial' and&#xD;
           nutritionist and client guides (freely downloadable) at WIC, maternal/child health, and&#xD;
           pediatric websites, and; a public TV segment. We will disseminate findings through a)&#xD;
           the National WIC Association, b) nutrition &amp; pediatric journals, and; c) lay print,&#xD;
           media, and websites with assistance from our Public Relations Department.&#xD;

      Mounting evidence finds that obesity tracks with age, even from infancy.1-10 Excess bottles&#xD;
      of whole milk and sweet beverages beyond the advised weaning age of 12 months- inappropriate&#xD;
      bottle-feeding- is linked to overweight. Inappropriate bottle use as used herein refers to&#xD;
      children &gt; 12 months drinking &gt; 2 bottle-type containers/day. In our prior work inappropriate&#xD;
      bottle use was associated with overweight in local WIC centers and national survey data.&#xD;
      And,a February 2007 publication from a national study found that &quot;taking a bottle to bed&quot; was&#xD;
      a major predictor of 3 year olds' being overweight or obese. Our pilot of the proposed&#xD;
      intervention reduced daily bottle use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Feeding Young Children Study (FYCS) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a&#xD;
      bottle-weaning intervention aimed at reducing the risk of overweight in low-income&#xD;
      multi-ethnic toddlers in WIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: To reduce inappropriate bottle-feeding practices (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.The Intervention group will reduce inappropriate feeding practices, as measured by:&#xD;
      absolute weaning; # of bottles; ounces consumed from bottles; and content, pattern &amp; timing&#xD;
      of bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim#2: To decrease the risk of overweight in children (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Intervention group will see a decrease in the percentage of children &gt;85th&#xD;
           percentile weight-for-length, and &gt; 95th % ile weight-for-length over the 12 month&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Intervention group will have lower age- and sex-adjusted weight-for-length z scores;&#xD;
           and a decreased weight gain velocity over the 12 month follow-up, compared with&#xD;
           Controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: To understand dietary intake &amp; nutrient density (Observational Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. We will describe beverage and food intakes and nutrient density at baseline and over time&#xD;
      in relation to bottle use patterns and anthropometrics, for the sample and by treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #4: To produce sustainable products and widely disseminate findings (Extension)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will produce a 5-8 minute bottle-weaning infomercial, and nutritionist and client&#xD;
           guides for download from WIC,15 maternal/child health16,17 and pediatric18 websites-- as&#xD;
           well as a segment for &quot;Keeping Kids Healthy,&quot; a nationally syndicated, Emmy award&#xD;
           winning TV show.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will extend findings through a) lay print, media, and web outlets via Public&#xD;
           Relations; b) the National WIC association; and c) nutrition &amp; pediatric journal papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll n=464 12 month olds who are drinking &gt;2 (non-water) bottles or sippy cups/day,&#xD;
      from 2 Bronx WIC sites. Bottle/sippy cup use, anthropometrics, and dietary intake will be&#xD;
      assessed at Baseline, and again at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of age. FYCS nutritionists&#xD;
      (blinded to group assignment) will collect two 24 h recalls of all beverage and solid intake,&#xD;
      and enter it into the Windows-based Nutrition Data Systems for Research software, the&#xD;
      premiere dietary data collection and nutrient density calculation tool. WIC nutritionists&#xD;
      will administer the Intervention at Baseline, and (blinded to outcomes) as needed at&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
