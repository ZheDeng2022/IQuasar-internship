      Supplementary feeding and intensive IEC at the community level will effectively reduce&#xD;
      moderate PEM compared to the control children within 3 months .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive nutrition education at the household level will reduce by at least one third of the&#xD;
      prevalence of moderate malnutrition (40% of present level) within a short period of 3 months&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bangladesh is one of the countries having highest proportions of malnourished children in the&#xD;
      world. The Bangladesh Integrated nutrition Project (BINP) is a recent initiative of the&#xD;
      Government of Bangladesh to reduce malnutrition of women and children under two years of age.&#xD;
      The BINP includes a specific programme to address severely malnourished children at the&#xD;
      community level, however there is no such programme directed toward moderately malnourished&#xD;
      children. Moderately malnourished children form a large proportion of children in the&#xD;
      community, and with success of the BINP, this proportion is growing, as severely malnourished&#xD;
      children shift to the moderately malnourished category. To address this, operations research&#xD;
      will be undertaken in a BINP thana named Shahrasti, in Chandpur District over a 6 month&#xD;
      period. A total of 300 children in three groups from Community Nutrition Centres (CNC) will&#xD;
      be studied. There will be groups in the study. In addition to usual component of the BINP,&#xD;
      mothers of the first group of intervention will receive intensive nutrition education and&#xD;
      motivation for child care, complementary food demonstration, and household food mobilization&#xD;
      for child feeding weekly for first four weeks then reinforced every two weeks. The second&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a packet of the usual BINP food supplement daily for 6 days a&#xD;
      week for 3 months and nutrition education at the same intensity. The third group will be a&#xD;
      control group and will receive only the usual programme inputs of BINP and their weight gain&#xD;
      will be recorded. The CNP, women group and village nutrition committee will be involved.&#xD;
      Focus group discussion will be held with mothers. Data on morbidity will be collected and&#xD;
      necessary medical advise will be given equal to each group. Data collection, counseling on&#xD;
      child caring practice, food demonstration and nutrition education using IEC will be organized&#xD;
      and supervised by project staff. It is assumed that if the intervention is successful, and&#xD;
      once the nutritional status improves, they are likely to maintain good health. The IEC on&#xD;
      dietary practice will be communicated to the village members for preventive measures. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed for change in nutrition groups from moderate to mild malnutrition or normal&#xD;
      nutrition and will be compared between the control and two intervention groups. It is&#xD;
      expected that the results of the study will help to address to reduce moderate malnutrition&#xD;
      existing in the large proportion of malnourished children. This will in turn reduce the risk&#xD;
      of regressing to severe malnutrition.&#xD;
