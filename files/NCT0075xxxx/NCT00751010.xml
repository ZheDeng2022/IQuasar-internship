  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of pain in women with IC is often difficult to identify resulting in unnecessary&#xD;
      medical and surgical treatments (e.g. hysterectomies). The vulva may actually be the site of&#xD;
      some of the reported pain in women with IC, not the urethra or bladder. IC and vulvodynia can&#xD;
      impact one's sexual functioning and diminish one's quality of life. Unfortunately, vulvodynia&#xD;
      is often unrecognized since it is not part of the usual urological assessment with IC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulvodynia is characterized by persistent generalized or localized vulvar pain of varying&#xD;
      degrees often characterized as &quot;burning,&quot; suggestive of a neuropathic pain response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a mailed survey (Part 1 of this study), 127 women with a documented diagnosis of IC agreed&#xD;
      to be contacted for an in-office examination. The mailed survey was internally developed&#xD;
      specifically for this project and included items related to demographics, adolescent and&#xD;
      adult history related to genital pain and current health. The last section allowed the&#xD;
      subject to include contact information if they would also like to participate in Part 2&#xD;
      (additional questionnaires and examination) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will review those surveys containing contact information and all women&#xD;
      at least 18 years of age will be invited to the WISH program (Beaumont Women's Initiative for&#xD;
      Pelvic Pain and Sexual Health) to be examined by a certified Nurse Practitioner (NP) who will&#xD;
      be blinded to their survey responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed by the subject. These questionnaires relate to one's&#xD;
      history, pain symptoms, quality of life, bladder symptoms and sexual function and will be&#xD;
      completed prior to the examination. The NP will perform all the clinical evaluations. A&#xD;
      vaginal pH and wet mount slide will be done first. Testing for vulvodynia will be done&#xD;
      utilizing an algesiometer q-tip followed by Neurometer® surface CPT testing for pain&#xD;
      threshold (not tolerance) to quantify pain levels in the distribution of the pudendal nerve&#xD;
      on the perineum and vulva will be done. The Neurometer® current perception threshold (CPT) is&#xD;
      a device for evaluating and measuring sensation It is a battery-operated stimulator which&#xD;
      delivers painless electrical stimulation via surface electrodes at frequencies of 5 Hz, 250&#xD;
      Hz, and 2000 Hz and at a current of 0.01 to 99mAmps.&#xD;
