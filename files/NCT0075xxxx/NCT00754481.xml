      The investigators hypothesized that, following cardiac arrest in pediatric patients,&#xD;
      hypothermia therapy will improve the proportion of patients with a good functional outcome&#xD;
      compared to a normothermic control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in children and hypothermia&#xD;
      therapy has the potential to be beneficial in children following cardiac arrest. We have a&#xD;
      track record of both clinical and laboratory research of hypothermia therapy following&#xD;
      cardiac arrest at the Hospital for Sick Children and have completed a 3-site randomized&#xD;
      controlled pilot study of hypothermia therapy following cardiac arrest in children funded by&#xD;
      The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of&#xD;
      Ontario. This protocol was used to develop the protocol for the THAPCA trials (see 2&#xD;
      manuscripts published Moler et al NEJM 2015 and 2017 and multiple other manuscripts).&#xD;
      Hypothermia therapy, compared to active maintenance of normothermia, had no beneficial effect&#xD;
      on functional outcome or mortality in children with out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the Normothermia arm (esophageal temp 36.5-37.5 ºC) were maintained at an esophageal temperature of 36.5-37.5ºC for 48 hours. Patients who were hypothermic (temperature &lt; 35 ºC) when randomized to the normothermia group were rewarmed slowly using the servo-controlled mattress. Patients who were hyperthermic following randomization to the normothermia group were actively cooled to normothermia using the servo-controlled mattress. Neuromuscular blockers were administered as needed intravenously in both groups of patients to prevent shivering.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hypothermia</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients randomized to the Hypothermia arm (esophageal temp 33º to 34 °C) were cooled rapidly using the cooling protocol developed for the Hypothermia Paediatric Head Injury Trial. A temperature probe was placed in the esophagus and its position confirmed using a chest radiograph. Patients were placed on a servo-controlled cooling blanket and covered in crushed ice (in sealed plastic bags covered by pillow cases) and a second cooling blanket. Once the esophageal temperature reached 34.0ºC, the ice and second cooling blanket was removed and esophageal temperature was maintained at 33º to 34 °C for 48 hours using the servo-controlled cooling mattress. Patients treated with ECMO were cooled using the extracorporeal circuit cooling-device. Rewarming was done at a rate of 0.5 ºC every 2 hours until an esophageal temperature of 36.5 ºC was reached. Thereafter temperature was recorded but not controlled by surface cooling.</description>
