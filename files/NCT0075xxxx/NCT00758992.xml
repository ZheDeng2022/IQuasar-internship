      These studies are designed to evaluate the relative efficiency of gene transfer into&#xD;
      primitive human hematopoietic cells by comparing lentiviral and foamy virus vectors as&#xD;
      vehicles for transfer and expression of globin genes. Normal volunteers will serve as&#xD;
      research participants. Each will receive a 4 day course of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating&#xD;
      Factor (G-CSF) after which a peripheral blood apheresis will be performed to recover a&#xD;
      mononuclear cell population enriched in primitive hematopoietic cells. The stem and&#xD;
      progenitor cells will be purified by selection based on expression of the CD34 antigen. The&#xD;
      CD34+ population will be cultured in vitro with various cytokines and transduced with vector&#xD;
      particles. The efficiency of gene transfer will be evaluated in the transduced CD34+&#xD;
      population, in progenitors contained within that population by culture in semisolid media and&#xD;
      in cells capable of establishing human hematopoiesis in immunodeficient mice. The level of&#xD;
      transgene expression will be evaluated in mature hematopoietic lineages that develop in vitro&#xD;
      or in immunodeficient mice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral blood has been established as a source of hematopoietic stem cells, providing&#xD;
      an alternative source to bone marrow for hematopoietic reconstitution of patients with&#xD;
      oncologic, hematologic, and genetic diseases. Although apheresis is less efficient than bone&#xD;
      marrow harvesting for collection of large numbers of CD34+ (a marker of early hematopoietic&#xD;
      precursors) cells, apheresis is less traumatic, requires no anesthesia and can be performed&#xD;
      more frequently than bone marrow harvesting. The purpose of this preclinical research project&#xD;
      is to investigate the use of hematopoietic stem cells mobilized into peripheral blood as&#xD;
      targets for retroviral-mediated gene therapy, to compare the efficiency of transduction of&#xD;
      primitive cells with the lentiviral and foamy viral vector systems and to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability to expand those stem cells ex vivo using hematopoietic growth factors (cytokines).&#xD;
      Research participants in this study will be healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth factor, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), will be given for 4 days&#xD;
      prior to apheresis to mobilize increased numbers of primitive hematopoietic cells from the&#xD;
      bone marrow into the circulation. Nucleated blood cells will be collected by apheresis and a&#xD;
      CD34+-enriched cell population isolated using antibody-based techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of G-CSF is essential to allow collection of sufficient numbers of primitive&#xD;
      stem and progenitor cells from normal volunteers. In the dose to be used in this study, a&#xD;
      15-35 fold increase in the concentration of CD34+ cells occurs in peripheral blood over the 4&#xD;
      days of G-CSF administration resulting in an apheresis product which contains, on average,&#xD;
      about 1-2 x1010 nucleated cells from which 1-2x108 purified CD34+cells can be recovered. This&#xD;
      number is sufficient to allow an experimental design which includes in vitro culture,&#xD;
      transduction with vector particles and assay of transduced cells in the immunodeficient mouse&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of G-CSF for mobilization of stem and progenitor cells is a widely used clinical&#xD;
      technique for both autologous and allogeneic transplantation which has proved both safe and&#xD;
      effective. Bone and muscle pain, headache and fatigue are the most common complications which&#xD;
      are typically managed with acetaminophen and rarely require discontinuation of G-CSF.&#xD;
      Transient elevations in alkaline phosphatase and LDH are common. Follow-up studies have shown&#xD;
      prolonged, mild neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia following G-CSF administration&#xD;
      and apheresis. Splenic enlargement has been shown by non-invasive measurements and four cases&#xD;
      of splenic rupture in normal individuals have been described. A reduction in arterial pO2&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in the O2 saturation from 98 to 96% has been reported. Transient&#xD;
      thrombophilia has been inferred based on changes in blood coagulation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other rare complications have been reported including the development of inflammatory or&#xD;
      infectious lesions. A fatal crisis occurred in a sibling donor for allogeneic transplantation&#xD;
      who had hemoglobin SC disease. These rare complications should be put in the context that&#xD;
      G-CSF administration followed by apheresis to recover primitive hematopoietic cells from&#xD;
      normal individuals has been utilized in all major transplant centers for more than a decade&#xD;
      and has generally been safe and without significant complications. We propose to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of serious complications by limiting the age range of research participants to 18-40&#xD;
      years and excluding those with a history of inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      thrombosis or pulmonary embolization, inflammatory skin disorders, hematological disease or&#xD;
      hemoglobinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to expand mobilized CD34+ cells in vitro using various cytokine combinations and&#xD;
      culture conditions will be examined using flow cytometry, in vitro colony assays and by&#xD;
      quantitating the concentration of cells that are able to establish hematopoiesis in&#xD;
      immunodeficient mice. Both unexpanded and expanded CD34+ cells will be used in experiments&#xD;
      designed to investigate their suitability as targets for retroviral-mediated gene transfer.&#xD;
      Gene transfer efficiency and functional expression of transferred sequences will be assessed&#xD;
      in the differentiated progeny of CD34+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to compare the lentiviral and foamy virus vector systems with respect to relative&#xD;
      efficiency of gene transfer into primitive human hematopoietic cells. Various substances&#xD;
      e.g., Fibroblast Growth Factor -1 and Wnt 3A, that have been reported to cause expansion of&#xD;
      primitive murine hematopoietic cells will also be evaluated for their effects of primitive&#xD;
      human hematopoietic cells in culture. Another focus is the comparison of various globin gene&#xD;
      vectors with respect to the relative levels of globin gene expression in differentiating&#xD;
      erythroid cells. Finally, the impact of cryopreservation on viability and engraftment&#xD;
      potential of primitive hematopoietic cells will be assessed. This research proposal will&#xD;
      provide preclinical data that will aid in the development of treatment strategies for genetic&#xD;
      diseases, specifically hemoglobin disorders, based on gene transfer into repopulating stem&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
