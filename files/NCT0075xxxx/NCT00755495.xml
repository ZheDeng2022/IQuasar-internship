  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ramelteon, once daily (QD),&#xD;
      combined with doxepin in treating subjects with insomnia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 to 70 million adults in the United States alone are affected by insomnia.&#xD;
      Daytime symptoms of insomnia include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and&#xD;
      irritability. Recent epidemiologic research focusing on quality of life has identified&#xD;
      significant insomnia-related morbidities that relate to work productivity, health care&#xD;
      utilization, and risk of depression. Insomnia is also associated with diminished work output,&#xD;
      absenteeism, and greater rates of accidents. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory&#xD;
      transmitter in the central nervous system and most currently prescribed sleep agents are&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which induce sleep by binding to the benzodiazepine&#xD;
      receptor site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid -A receptor complex. In addition to sleep,&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor agonists can cause a wide range of ancillary effects not directly&#xD;
      related to sleep, including sedative, anxiolytic, muscle-relaxant, and amnesic effects, and&#xD;
      have risks of tolerance, dependence, and abuse potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxepin is one of a class of psychotherapeutic agents known as dibenzoxepin tricyclic&#xD;
      compounds. Doxepin is indicated for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and psychotic&#xD;
      depressive disorders. The most common adverse event associated with the use of doxepin is&#xD;
      drowsiness. A limited number of controlled studies have been performed to examine the effects&#xD;
      of low doxepin on insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-375 (Ramelteon) is a melatonin receptor agonist with affinity for the human melatonin&#xD;
      receptor subtype 1 (MT1), melatonin receptor subtype 2 (MT2) and selectivity over the&#xD;
      melatonin receptor subtype 3 (MT3) receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will determine if the co-administration of ramelteon and doxepin will decrease&#xD;
      both latency to persistent sleep and wake time after sleep onset. Study participation is&#xD;
      anticipated to be about 2 months.&#xD;
