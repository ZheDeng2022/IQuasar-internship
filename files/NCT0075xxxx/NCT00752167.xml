    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) at the NCAA Division I collegiate&#xD;
      level is over diagnosed, while poorly controlled asthma resulting in exercise-related&#xD;
      symptoms in this same population may be under diagnosed, being erroneously attributed to EIB.&#xD;
      This project will test individuals self-identified as having exercise induced bronchospasm or&#xD;
      asthma, as well as gender-matched controls from the same sport, with eucapnic voluntary&#xD;
      hyperventilation to assess for the presence of EIB or asthma. By making the correct&#xD;
      diagnosis, improved health outcomes may be achieved and athletic performance may be enhanced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to identify all Division I athletes, male and female, at the University of Arizona&#xD;
      that are currently being treated for either EIB or asthma by review of preparticipation&#xD;
      physical forms or identified by the medical staff. In addition, athletes that were prescribed&#xD;
      inhalers through Campus Health Services will be identified through review of electronic&#xD;
      pharmacy records. Each athlete identified will be matched with two control athletes (ie, not&#xD;
      currently using asthma medications) from the same sport. Subjects will be tested for EIB&#xD;
      using eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation, the gold standard for making this diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment Potential subjects will be identified as described above. Subjects will&#xD;
      be approached by one of the co-investigators, the study explained and an opportunity to&#xD;
      review the consent form and ask question provided. Subjects who consent will then be&#xD;
      scheduled for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire Subjects, once enrolled, will be asked to complete a 27 item questionnaire&#xD;
      including questions about prior history and treatment of asthma, as well as history of&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. In addition, subjects will be asked to complete the Asthma Control Test&#xD;
      (ACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVH and Spirometric Testing All subjects will undergo baseline assessment of lung function&#xD;
      using the KoKo Legend Portable Spirometer. The subjects will then undergo eucapnic voluntary&#xD;
      hyperventilation testing. EVH testing will require the subject to hyperventilate dry air&#xD;
      containing 5% carbon dioxide at room temperature for six minutes at a target ventilation of&#xD;
      30 times the subject's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The EVH test will be&#xD;
      considered positive if a fall in FEV1 of 10% or more from baseline is recorded after a 6&#xD;
      minute period of hyperpnea. To overcome the problem of any post-test respiratory muscle&#xD;
      fatigue, the FEV1 will be recorded at least three minutes after challenge and then repeated&#xD;
      at three-minute intervals through 21 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry will be carried out according to American Thoracic Society standards. Both&#xD;
      absolute and percent-predicted spirometric values will be recorded. Predicted values will be&#xD;
      calculated from validated, published, race-specific regression equations. (Hankinson, et al.&#xD;
      Spirometric reference values values from a sample of the general US population. Am J Respir&#xD;
      Crit Care Med 1999; 159:179-187.) Asian-American athletes will be evaluated using norms for&#xD;
      whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide the optimal test circumstances, some medications will be withheld for 8 to 96&#xD;
      hours before the bronchial provocation test: no short-acting bronchodilators, sodium&#xD;
      cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, or ipratropium bromide for 8 hours; no long-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators or antihistamines for 48 hours; no leukotriene antagonists for four days.&#xD;
      Steroids should not be inhaled on the day of the test. No caffeine should be taken on the&#xD;
      morning of the test. Vigorous exercise will be avoided for at least four hours prior to the&#xD;
      start of the test as well as any exercise on the day of testing. Subjects will be scheduled&#xD;
      for testing to allow at least 6-8 hours to elapse between previous vigorous activity and&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO) Measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of eNO will be obtained prior to measurement of pre-EVH spirometry. Exhaled NO&#xD;
      will be measured employing a technique modified after Silkoff et al (1997) and following&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society guidelines for eNO assessment (American Thoracic Society, 1999). In&#xD;
      brief, this technique utilizes a resistive device that provides a constant low expiratory&#xD;
      flow rate and ensures vellum closure. The combination of vellum closure and low flow rates,&#xD;
      specifically 50 ml/s, assures accurate measurement of specific pulmonary derived eNO, while&#xD;
      excluding potential contamination by nasal and paranasal sinuses NO (which can be a large&#xD;
      source of eNO). Nitric oxide concentrations will be measured using a rapid-response&#xD;
      chemiluminescent analyzer (NIOXâ„¢ System, Aerocrine, Sweden), which has a response time of &lt;&#xD;
      700 ms for 10-90% full scale. The Food and Drug Administration has approved this device for&#xD;
      clinical application in asthma management. The measurement circuit will consist of a&#xD;
      mouthpiece-filter connected to a resistor/flow meter and collection bag. The participant will&#xD;
      inhale to total lung capacity (TLC), insert the mouthpiece, and then immediately exhale&#xD;
      slowly. During expiration, the participant will attempt to maintain a target flow of 50&#xD;
      ml/sec. The target period of exhalation time will be 10 seconds. However, for participants&#xD;
      that are not able to perform the 10 second exhalation, the time requirements may be decreased&#xD;
      to 6 seconds. Dietary history by recall for the 4-6 hours prior to testing will be obtained&#xD;
      to screen for dietary sources of NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Spirometric values and quality control measures for EVH testing will be&#xD;
      recorded on forms specifically designed for this purpose and, for spirometry, already in use&#xD;
      in the Pediatric Pulmonary Function Laboratory. Data will entered into a computer spreadsheet&#xD;
      and double-checked by a second person to assure accuracy. It will then be transferred to a&#xD;
      statistical package (STATA) for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis For this observational study summative and descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      carried out. If opportunities for comparative analysis are identified, parametric and&#xD;
      nonparametric analysis will be carried out as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fall occurring early in the post-EVH period, especially in conjunction with documented&#xD;
      pre-exercise elevation in eNO, will be taken as being more suggestive of poorly controlled&#xD;
      asthma, while a fall 9-12 minutes after EVH, especially in the absence of an elevated eNO,&#xD;
      will be interpreted as being more indicative of true EIB.&#xD;
