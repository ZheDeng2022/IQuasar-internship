  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the combination&#xD;
      of TAS-106 and carboplatin that can be given to patients with advanced cancer or cancer that&#xD;
      has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of TAS-106 and carboplatin&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of TAS-106 and carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the antitumor activity of TAS-106 combined with carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the relationship between selected biomarkers and efficacy and safety outcomes.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAS-106 and carboplatin are designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping&#xD;
      cell division, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the study drug combination that is based on when you joined this study. Up to 6 dose&#xD;
      levels of the study drug combination will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      at each dose level. If no intolerable side effects occur in the first group of 3 people, the&#xD;
      next 3 people enrolled in the study will receive the same dose of carboplatin and a higher&#xD;
      dose of TAS-106. If this second group has no intolerable side effects, the next 3 people will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of carboplatin while receiving the same dose of TAS-106 as the second&#xD;
      group. This will continue until the highest safe dose combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;cycle&quot; in this study is 3 weeks long. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive carboplatin&#xD;
      by vein over 60 minutes, followed by TAS-106 by vein over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 1 day), you will come to the clinic to have the following&#xD;
      procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you have taken recently and any side effects you may&#xD;
           have experienced. The study doctor may give you drugs to lessen any possible side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Weeks 2 and 3 of each cycle (+/- 3 days), blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn&#xD;
      for routine tests. If your blood cell counts (white blood cells, red blood cells, and/or&#xD;
      platelets) drop to a low level, you may need to have these routine tests repeated more often&#xD;
      than once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles (+/- 1 week), you will have CT scans, MRI scans, and/or x-rays&#xD;
      to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must stay in the Houston area during Cycle 1. During that time, all blood tests and other&#xD;
      study tests and procedures must be done at MD Anderson. Starting in Cycle 2, if you prefer,&#xD;
      you may have the blood tests at Weeks 2 and 3 of each cycle performed at a medical laboratory&#xD;
      that is close to your home. If you need to have the additional blood cell count testing&#xD;
      performed as well, those blood tests can also be done close to home. All other study tests&#xD;
      and procedures must be done at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to stay on the study drugs for as long as you are benefiting. If the cancer&#xD;
      gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects, you will be taken off study. If you&#xD;
      experience side effects that are severe but not intolerable, however, your doctor may decide&#xD;
      that it is necessary to delay your next dose of the study drug combination and/or lower the&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you go off study for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit with all of the&#xD;
      same tests performed as at your other study visits. You will also have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Carboplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      other uses. TAS-106 is not FDA approved or commercially available. The combination of&#xD;
      carboplatin and TAS-106 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time, the&#xD;
      combination is being used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 55 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
