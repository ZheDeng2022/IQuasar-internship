      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repeat&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this a randomized withdrawal Phase III, multi-center research study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repeat treatment with an intramuscular dose of&#xD;
      Mentor Purified Toxin in the reduction of glabellar rhytides (frown lines). Approximately 700&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at approximately 12 clinical sites in the U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be determined by the degree of frown line reduction, during maximum forced&#xD;
      frown and at rest (neutral expression):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed live by the subject, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal (0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study. In the first part, all study participants will receive&#xD;
      treatment with an intramuscular injection of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin on two&#xD;
      separate occasions (Cycles 1 and 2) no more than 6 months apart. In the second part of the&#xD;
      study (Cycle 3), subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo (preservative-free saline) and&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for 1 month (3:1, PurTox : placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive five intramuscular injections for a total of 0.5 mL of study drug&#xD;
      in the glabellar area, during each treatment visit. Participation takes place over a maximum&#xD;
      of 14 months, including Part 1 (Cycle 1 and 2) and Part 2 (Cycle 3). The number of clinic&#xD;
      visits will vary from person to person depending upon the subject's response to the study&#xD;
      drug, but will range from approximately 9 to 19 clinic visits. There will also be up to 4&#xD;
      telephone follow-up contacts.&#xD;
