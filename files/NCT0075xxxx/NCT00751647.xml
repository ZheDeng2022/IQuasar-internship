      The purpose of this project is to determine the short-term effects of a customized Core&#xD;
      Strengthening and Respiratory Exercise Program (CSREP) on children with cystic fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      between the ages of 10 and 21 who are receiving outpatient care at Children's Hospitals and&#xD;
      Clinics of Minnesota. The CSREP, which will be provided by a physical therapist and a&#xD;
      physical therapist assistant, consists of specific breathing techniques and core&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, designed to improve rib cage mobility, pulmonary function, aerobic&#xD;
      capacity, posture, and core strength. Currently the CF population at Children's receives&#xD;
      physical therapy on an inpatient basis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this program is to prove the viability of an outpatient exercise program&#xD;
      for this population. Specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To customize a CSREP protocol per each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure patient outcomes at baseline and six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a satisfaction tool in order to measure patient experience and satisfaction&#xD;

      Study Design: Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether a customized physical therapy exercise intervention titled&#xD;
      Core Strengthening and Respiratory Exercise Program (CSREP) clinically improves the following&#xD;
      outcome measures for children between the ages of 10 and 21 with cystic fibrosis: pulmonary&#xD;
      function, aerobic capacity, rib cage mobility, posture, and core strength, thus warranting&#xD;
      more extensive study and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Previous research conducted in pediatric populations has focused on the effects&#xD;
      of aerobic training, anaerobic training, and strengthening of the extremities on the health&#xD;
      of children with cystic fibrosis. However, the disease process of cystic fibrosis secondarily&#xD;
      causes impairments in the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. No intervention study aimed at&#xD;
      positively impacting these systems has been done to date with children with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 6-month CSREP will be customized to meet the specific needs of each participant.&#xD;
      During Part I of the program participants will attend weekly CSREP treatments for 4 to 6&#xD;
      weeks; in Part II they will attend monthly CSREP treatments over a five-month period. Each&#xD;
      session will last for 45-60 minutes. During these treatments, participants will be given&#xD;
      instruction on a daily home exercise program and will receive hands on physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions. Handouts with pictures and how-to instructions for assigned exercises will be&#xD;
      provided. Participants will be given calendars to track completion of home exercises and&#xD;
      level of compliance. During Part II, a researcher will call participants every week in order&#xD;
      to encourage compliance with the home exercise program and to provide clarification as&#xD;
      needed. All participants will continue to receive regular medical care as well as PT&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A respiratory therapist will perform the pulmonary function tests, a respiratory therapist&#xD;
      along with an exercise physiologist will perform the VO2max testing, and a physical therapist&#xD;
      will perform the physical therapy evaluation, including assessment of rib cage mobility, core&#xD;
      strength, and posture. Another physical therapist as well as a physical therapist assistant&#xD;
      will provide the physical therapy treatments, instruct the participants in their home&#xD;
      program, and make the weekly phone calls to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experience survey will be designed to evaluate both satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 and&#xD;
      self scoring of outcome measures including: respiratory function, cough strength, activity&#xD;
      tolerance, posture, and strength on a three point Likert scale of: 1) Got worse; 2) Stayed&#xD;
      the same; and 3) Got better. Additionally, the survey will include a question on the&#xD;
      likelihood of continuing with the home program after the study has ended. The survey will be&#xD;
      administered at 6 months upon completion of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The results of this inquiry as to the viability of the CSREP will prove relevant&#xD;
      to the above-mentioned patient outcomes within the cystic fibrosis population. The customized&#xD;
      CSREP protocol will provide a non-pharmacological outpatient treatment option that can be&#xD;
      completed on an outpatient basis, independently, in the patient's home.&#xD;
