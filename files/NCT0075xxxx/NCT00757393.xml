      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that growth hormone,&#xD;
      administered daily by subcutaneous injection for 2 years will result in a significantly&#xD;
      greater BMD Z-score over optimal standard therapy.&#xD;

      Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by a parallel loss of bone mineral and&#xD;
      matrix which results in enhanced bone fragility and an increased risk of fractures. The&#xD;
      associated fractures, and the morbidity and mortality that ensue, make osteoporosis a public&#xD;
      health problem of enormous proportions. Clinical and research observations strongly suggest&#xD;
      that most adult osteoporosis has its roots in childhood and have identified both genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors as central to the pathogenesis of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is not only a major public health problem in the adult population but is&#xD;
      increasingly diagnosed during childhood. Most cases are secondary to chronic illnesses&#xD;
      (secondary osteoporosis). In chronically ill children several factors, in addition to the&#xD;
      underlying chronic illness itself, may predispose to either reduced bone mass or impairment&#xD;
      of bone quality. Osteoporosis in the otherwise healthy child (primary osteoporosis) is&#xD;
      generally classified as either osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or juvenile idiopathic&#xD;
      osteoporosis (JIO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimizing Vitamin D and calcium intake as well as a weight bearing exercise program are&#xD;
      central approaches in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Despite increased&#xD;
      awareness of this disorder in the pediatric population and more active implementation of&#xD;
      these principles, an ever increasing number of children with osteoporosis present with&#xD;
      symptomatic disease; that is progress to the stage of frequent peripheral fractures,&#xD;
      vertebral compression fracture and/or deliberating pain. Bisphosphonates are often then added&#xD;
      to the therapeutic regiment. However, it is widely acknowledged that little is currently&#xD;
      known about the key factors that might predict the safe and effective use of these agents in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children whose bone biopsy results indicate an adynamic form of osteoporosis and who have low&#xD;
      bone turnover markers make up a significant number of the children with symptomatic&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Many of these patients have in addition growth failure (due to prolonged&#xD;
      glucocorticoid usage and chronic illness) and some may have low growth hormone secretion. In&#xD;
      this circumstance, the agent of choice would be an anabolic agent known to increase&#xD;
      osteoblast activity, normalize histomorphometric parameters and improve bone quality.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, one of the most promising of these agents, recombinant PTH (Teripeptide) is&#xD;
      precluded from use in pediatric patients because of concerns regarding induction of&#xD;
      osteosarcoma. It is unclear to what extent antiresorptive therapy might achieve these goals,&#xD;
      although it has become the therapy of choice by default.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Growth hormone (GH)/IGFI- axis plays a central role in longitudinal bone growth as well&#xD;
      as in the acquisition and maintenance of bone mass in children. Studies, in both growth&#xD;
      hormone excess and deficiency, suggest that growth hormone may be useful as an anabolic agent&#xD;
      in children with osteoporosis. In acromegaly, bone turnover markers indicate activation of&#xD;
      both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Both markers correlate with circulating GH and IGF-1&#xD;
      levels. IGF-1 levels are increased in cortical bone suggesting that the anabolic actions of&#xD;
      GH are mediated by local production. The impact on bone density in unclear, as some studies&#xD;
      show no differences from healthy controls. However, other studies indicate an increase in&#xD;
      cortical bone mass while trabecular mass appears to be unchanged or somewhat reduced.&#xD;
      Furthermore rates appear not to be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Growth hormone (GH)/IGFI-axis plays a central role in the longitudinal bone growth as&#xD;
      well as in the acquisition and maintenance of bone mass in children. Studies, in both growth&#xD;
      hormone excess and deficiency, suggest that growth hormone may be useful as an anabolic agent&#xD;
      in children with osteoporosis. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is recognized to result in&#xD;
      reduced bone mass, decreased bone turnover markers, secondary osteoporosis and increased&#xD;
      fracture rate. Epidemiological studies suggest that GHD alone may explain the increased&#xD;
      fracture rate seen in these patients. Treatment of GHD patients with GH results in an&#xD;
      increase in turnover markers. While short-term studies showed little improvement in bone&#xD;
      mass, longer term studies with treatment periods of 2 years or more have shown significant&#xD;
      increases in bone mass.&#xD;
