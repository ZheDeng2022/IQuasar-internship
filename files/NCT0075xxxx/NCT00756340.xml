      The main goals of this Phase I study are to learn about the side effects that may occur when&#xD;
      everolimus and bevacizumab are given to children and young adults and to find the highest&#xD;
      doses of these drugs that can be given together without causing severe side effects.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be given into the vein (IV) over 30-90 minutes every two weeks and&#xD;
      everolimus tablets will be given daily by mouth. A cycle of therapy will be four weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a traditional phase I dose finding study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of bevacizumab,&#xD;
      administered every 2 weeks IV and everolimus administered orally daily to children with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory solid tumors including CNS malignancies. Patients will receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab every two weeks IV, and everolimus orally daily. Four consecutive weeks will&#xD;
      constitute one course and subsequent courses will immediately follow with no break in the&#xD;
      administration of either drug. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, treatment can continue for 2 years. The bevacizumab dose will start at 10 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Everolimus will start at 4 mg/m2, 80% of the MTD established in our current phase I trial. A&#xD;
      traditional 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design will be used to determine the joint MTD&#xD;
      for these two agents. Doses to be studied are detailed in the table below. Consistent with&#xD;
      the traditional design, we will enroll cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level starting with&#xD;
      dose level 1 and will escalate to the next higher dose, if none of these 3 experiences a DLT.&#xD;
      If one of 3 patients experiences a DLT at a dose level then 3 more patients will be studied&#xD;
      at this level. If none of these 3 experiences a DLT then escalation to the next level will&#xD;
      occur. Otherwise the current dose will be considered too toxic and de-escalation will occur.&#xD;
      Under this setting, MTD will be the dose level at which 0/3 or 1/6 patient would have&#xD;
      experienced DLT and the next dose level is determined to be too toxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of everolimus and&#xD;
           bevacizumab within the confines of a phase I study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the incidence of PTEN and PI3Kinase pathway activation in recurrent or&#xD;
           refractory solid tumors of childhood&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess everolimus pharmacokinetics in children, including the effect of concomitant&#xD;
           drug therapy (e.g., dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore changes in correlative magnetic resonance imaging in children receiving&#xD;
           everolimus and bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify additional genes both within and outside of the mTOR pathway that may act as&#xD;
           determinants of response to everolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms responsible for everolimus disposition&#xD;
           (e.g., metabolism and elimination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To test the ability of everolimus to inhibit mTOR pathway signaling in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent solid tumors including CNS malignancies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To estimate blood levels of VEGF, BFGF, TSP-1, I-CAM, v-CAM and circulating endothelial&#xD;
           cells prior to, during therapy and after therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have ≥ Grade 2 uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a stroke, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina in the previous 6&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a bleeding diathesis or PT INR&gt;1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing Coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure(s) within previous 4 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minor surgical procedures within 7 days prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an abdominal fistula, GI perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within&#xD;
             previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with CNS tumors or known CNS metastases, evidence of intracranial or&#xD;
             intratumoral hemorrhage on baseline MRI obtained within 14 days prior to study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If there is proteinuria present on dipstick, patients are excluded if they have &gt;500&#xD;
             mg protein on 24 hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Require treatment with any of the medications listed in Appendix II (Excluding&#xD;
             dexamethasone: Corticosteroid therapy is permissible only for the treatment of&#xD;
             increased intracranial pressure in patients with malignancies in the CNS or for spinal&#xD;
             cord compression. Corticosteroid should be used at the lowest dose to control symptoms&#xD;
             and discontinued if possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of H2 antagonists such as ranitidine, cimetidine and proton pump blockers such as&#xD;
        omeprazole are permissible only in conjunction with corticosteroids in the setting of&#xD;
        increased intracranial pressure or for spinal cord compression, as these drugs interfere&#xD;
        with CYP3A4. If patients are given such drugs, they must be taken at least 4 hours after&#xD;
        intake of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of infection with the hepatitis B and/or C viruses or positive hepatitis B&#xD;
             virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry. The effects of everolimus on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. However, bevacizumab is known to be teratogenic&#xD;
             and detrimental to fetal development in animal models. In addition, bevacizumab may&#xD;
             alter corpus luteum development and endometrial proliferation, thereby having a&#xD;
             negative effect on fertility. For these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately and will be removed from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breastfeeding. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with everolimus or bevacizumab,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative to&#xD;
             give written informed consent.&#xD;
