  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to assess the safety of administration of up to 3 dose levels of&#xD;
      eritoran in subjects undergoing or scheduled to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      (BMT). An allogeneic BMT is the transplantation of blood stem cells taken from the bone&#xD;
      marrow or blood of another person.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Adult subjects (aged 18 to 55 years old) undergoing or scheduled to undergo&#xD;
             myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic BMT, or stem cells from matched donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects using either busulfan or total body irradiation (TBI) containing regimens for&#xD;
             BMT for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant diseases. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cyclophosphamide and Total Body Irradiation (CY-TBI) with a TBI dose of at least&#xD;
                  1200 cGy of fractionated TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Etoposide and Total Body Irradiation (VP16-TBI) with a TBI dose of at least 1200&#xD;
                  cGy of fractionated TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU-CY) with at least 14 mg/kg busulfan orally or&#xD;
                  11.2 mg/kg busulfan intravenously (14 x 0.8 correction factor) or a targeted&#xD;
                  busulfan dosing strategy aimed at a serum concentration greater than 600 ng/mL at&#xD;
                  steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Leukemia patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or subsequent complete remission&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first or subsequent chronic phase or in&#xD;
                  accelerated phase&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are in complete remission as determined by&#xD;
             physical exam, CT and PET scans, and are otherwise considered candidates for&#xD;
             allogeneic BMT as judged by the treating institution&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Available matched related CD34+ stem cells (target cell dose between 2 x 10^6/kg and&#xD;
             10 x 10^6/kg (actual body weight)) for transplantation (matched at 6/6 HLA at Class I&#xD;
             HLA-A and B and Class II HLA-DRBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sex distribution: men or nonpregnant women. Women of childbearing potential must have&#xD;
             a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or urine assay prior to eritoran&#xD;
             treatment or prior to the beginning of conditioning treatment. Menopausal women must&#xD;
             have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Race: any.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has signed informed consent before any study-specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unwilling or unable to agree to be fully evaluated for all follow-up visits. The&#xD;
             subject or subject's representative and the study staff should agree to perform all&#xD;
             study assessments even if the subject is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); testing is not needed if already&#xD;
             performed (documentation required) as part of screening for conditioning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a documented or possible systemic infection, or suspected of having a&#xD;
             medically significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection at the beginning of&#xD;
             treatment on Day -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have taken any investigational medications (ie, not approved by the FDA for any&#xD;
             indication) within the 30-day period prior to enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &lt;60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have previously received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Are to receive T-cell depleted BMT or stem cell infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;

             Previously treated cancer with a curative intent of &gt; 5 years will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Legal incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any of the following laboratory parameters within 2 days prior to the beginning of&#xD;
             treatment on Day -3:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  direct bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  liver function tests (ALT or AST) with values ≥ 3x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine ≥ 2x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who are enrolled in other interventional, investigational protocols. As aGvHD&#xD;
             is likely to only occur after treatment with eritoran is completed, investigational&#xD;
             treatments for Grades III and IV aGvHD may be allowed and should be discussed with the&#xD;
             Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with a history of or with current pulmonary disease with forced vital&#xD;
             capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 60% predicted&#xD;
             (corrected for hemoglobin).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with a history of a cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 45%, or with marked screening&#xD;
             or baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval (QTc interval &gt; 470 mSec).&#xD;
