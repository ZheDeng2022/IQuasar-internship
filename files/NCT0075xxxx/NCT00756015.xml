    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the influence of post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation on the rate of tendon healing and clinical outcomes following arthroscopic&#xD;
      repair of the rotator cuff. There are two schools of thought on what type of therapy program&#xD;
      is most beneficial following surgical cuff repair. However there has been little data&#xD;
      available to compare them. Therefore, the investigators would like to compare these two&#xD;
      standard plans of care so that the investigators may better define the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      early mobilization of the shoulder versus keeping the shoulder immobilized following surgical&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotator cuff disease is the leading cause of shoulder pain and disability. Previous studies&#xD;
      regarding the epidemiology of rotator cuff disease have demonstrated a high incidence of age-&#xD;
      related cuff tears, approximately 50% of individuals over the age of 55 years 1-3. Failure of&#xD;
      conservative treatment often leads to surgical repair of the torn rotator cuff tendons.&#xD;
      Indeed, rotator cuff repair is one of the most common surgical procedures currently performed&#xD;
      in the shoulder with approximately 200,000 Americans undergoing this surgery yearly. We&#xD;
      estimate that the Shoulder and Elbow Service at Washington University performs approximately&#xD;
      400 rotator cuff repairs per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the primary concerns following repair of the rotator cuff is healing of the repaired&#xD;
      tendon. Although pain relief and improved shoulder function are predictable following rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair, the rate of healing of the tendon repair has been much less consistent. In most&#xD;
      instances, the repaired tissue is degenerative, 4, 5 possesses a poor blood supply 6 and,&#xD;
      therefore, a limited ability to heal following repair. The rates of healing of the repaired&#xD;
      cuff tendons have ranged from 6% to 80% across multiple studies depending on a variety of&#xD;
      patient, tendon tear and surgery related factors 7-13. The major factors that have been&#xD;
      identified to effect healing after rotator cuff repair include patient age, the size of the&#xD;
      tear and the strength of the repair construct 8, 9, 12. To this point, there has been little&#xD;
      data regarding the potential influence of postoperative rehabilitation of the shoulder on the&#xD;
      structural integrity of rotator cuff repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shoulder and Elbow Service at Washington University has had extensive experience in&#xD;
      studying various factors related to not only the progression of rotator cuff disease, but&#xD;
      also tendon healing and outcomes of treatment 8, 14-16. A strength of our research team has&#xD;
      been the collaborative experience developed with musculoskeletal radiologists at the&#xD;
      Mallinkrodt Institute using high-resolution ultrasound to examine the integrity of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff. Extensive data with ultrasound at this institution has validated it as a highly&#xD;
      accurate means of identifying and quantifying rotator cuff tears in both the preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative settings 17-20. High-resolution ultrasound, in the hands of experienced&#xD;
      musculoskeletal radiologists, has been proven to be more accurate than magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging in assessing the integrity of the rotator cuff in the postoperative setting 19. With&#xD;
      this modality, we have been able to study the outcomes and tendon healing rates following&#xD;
      repair of the rotator cuff using conventional arthroscopic repair techniques 8. Recent data,&#xD;
      from this institution, has also been completed examining the clinical outcomes and repair&#xD;
      integrity following newer arthroscopic techniques (double-row rotator cuff repairs) in three&#xD;
      separate patient populations: partial thickness cuff tears, full thickness cuff tears and&#xD;
      revision of recurrent rotator cuff tears (manuscripts in progress). Our service has also been&#xD;
      currently involved in a NIH R01 funded study prospectively examining factors related to the&#xD;
      progression of asymptomatic rotator cuff tears over time. Given our research experience with&#xD;
      ultrasound, the Shoulder and Elbow Service at Washington University has been uniquely&#xD;
      positioned to study one of the most important issues in shoulder surgery - the effect of&#xD;
      rehabilitation on healing of the rotator cuff following surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to tendon healing, one of the primary goals following shoulder surgery is the&#xD;
      early restoration of range of motion of the joint. Stiffness is one of the more common&#xD;
      complications following shoulder surgery. Early range of motion helps to prevent the&#xD;
      formation of adhesions within the joint and surrounding capsule and ligaments. Although most&#xD;
      cuff repair constructs provide sufficient stability for early range of motion, the effect of&#xD;
      motion at the repair site and the subsequent effect on healing are unknown in humans.&#xD;
      Concerns regarding a deleterious effect of early motion on tendon healing have led some&#xD;
      investigators to advocate substantially more conservative rehab after surgery. A delay in&#xD;
      motion at the shoulder may theoretically improve the rate of tendon healing as stresses are&#xD;
      minimized across the tendon repair site. This may be particularly important given that tendon&#xD;
      repair constructs gradually becomes weaker before a more mature healing response occurs.&#xD;
      However, a delay in motion will slow the return of mobility to the shoulder and may increase&#xD;
      the risk of prolonged stiffness. Therefore, the clinician must balance the potential benefit&#xD;
      (prevention of stiffness) against the potential harm (compromise of the surgical repair) of&#xD;
      early rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair surgery. Despite the critical role early&#xD;
      motion may have, there have been no published studies examining the influence of&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation on the clinical outcomes and repair integrity following rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the influence of postoperative rehabilitation&#xD;
      on the rate of tendon healing and clinical outcomes following arthroscopic repair of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff. The ideal rehabilitation protocols following rotator cuff repair have yet to be&#xD;
      determined. The clinical impact of this study will be significant in that we will better&#xD;
      define the safety and efficacy of early mobilization of the shoulder following the surgical&#xD;
      management of rotator cuff tears. A better understanding of appropriate postoperative&#xD;
      physical therapy regimens is fundamental to the effective care of patients following rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair. This study will serve as a basis for further research defining nonsurgical&#xD;
      factors that influence tendon healing and outcome after rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To prospectively compare the rate of tendon healing following arthroscopic&#xD;
      repair of small and medium sized tears of the rotator cuff in patients treated with two&#xD;
      distinct postoperative rehabilitation protocols: immobilization versus early range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The rate of tendon healing following repair of small to medium sized rotator&#xD;
      cuff tears will be the same for those patients treated with immobilization compared to an&#xD;
      early range of motion protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To prospectively compare the clinical outcomes following arthroscopic repair&#xD;
      of small and medium sized tears of the rotator cuff in patients treated with two distinct&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation protocols: immobilization versus early range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The clinical results following repair of small to medium sized rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears will be substantially better for those patients treated with an early range of motion&#xD;
      protocol as compared to those that were immobilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary power analysis has been performed to determine the necessary number of patients&#xD;
      for each group (alpha level =.05 and beta level = .20). Data from this institution suggests&#xD;
      an 80% healing rate within this age group for small and medium size rotator cuff tears fixed&#xD;
      with double-row cuff repair techniques. Given a presumed healing rate of 80% in the&#xD;
      immobilization group, the numbers necessary to detect a difference in healing of 20% between&#xD;
      the two rehabilitation protocols is 70 subjects in each group. Assuming a conservative&#xD;
      attrition rate of 20%, we will estimate that a total of 170 subjects will need to be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All rotator cuff repairs will be performed with a standard technique utilizing arthroscopic&#xD;
      double-row suture anchor constructs. The surgery will also include subacromial decompression&#xD;
      and acromioplasty as dictated by acromial degenerative changes. Concomitant procedures&#xD;
      related to the biceps tendon will be performed as indicated. At the time of preoperative&#xD;
      surgical evaluation, patients will be randomized by sealed envelope into one of two&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immobilization group: 6 weeks of sling shoulder immobilization. Immediate range of motion of&#xD;
      the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. At 6 weeks, PROM and stretching of the shoulder allowed&#xD;
      under therapist direction. At 12 weeks, AAROM and AROM exercises will be initiated and&#xD;
      capsular stretching advanced until full ROM achieved. Strengthening activities of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff, deltoid and scapular stabilizers will be permitted at 4 months post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early range of motion group: Shoulder pendulum exercises will be allowed from the time of&#xD;
      surgery. Immediate range of motion of the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. At the first&#xD;
      postoperative visit, PROM of the shoulder will be permitted under therapist direction.&#xD;
      Patients will avoid IR and behind the back stretching. At 6 weeks, AAROM and AROM will be&#xD;
      advanced as tolerated. Capsular stretching will be advanced until full range of motion is&#xD;
      achieved. Strengthening activities of the rotator cuff, deltoid and scapular stabilizers will&#xD;
      be permitted at 3 months post surgery.&#xD;
