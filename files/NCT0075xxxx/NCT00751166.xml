  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study that used both an&#xD;
      active control (cetirizine) and a placebo control to evaluate desloratadine 5 mg once daily&#xD;
      during a 28-day treatment period. The active treatments and placebo were allocated in a 2:2:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have demonstrated their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its&#xD;

          -  Have had signs and symptoms of CIU for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been experiencing a current flare of their CIU of at least 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             Baseline Visit. Hives were to have been present for at least 3 days per week during&#xD;
             the current flare prior to the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an overall condition of CIU that was at least of &quot;moderate&quot; severity (minimum&#xD;
             score of 2) at both Screening and Baseline Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least a moderately severe pruritus score (minimum score of 2) and hives&#xD;
             (minimum score of 1) present at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have, at Baseline, a total pruritus score of 14 or greater for the sum of AM and PM&#xD;
             (reflective) diary scores for the 3 days prior to Baseline and the AM diary score on&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to&#xD;
             assess and record their symptom severity scores, medication times,concomitant&#xD;
             medications, and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in general good health and free of any clinically significant disease (other than&#xD;
             CIU) that would have interfered with study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have had a negative urine (hCG) pregnancy&#xD;
             test at the time of Baseline (Visit 2).&#xD;

             not sexually active were to agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned&#xD;
             methods should they become sexually active while participating in the study. If the&#xD;
             subject had had a tubal ligation or was using an intra-uterine device, or if the&#xD;
             husband/partner had had a vasectomy, another method was to be used.&#xD;
