    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the IOP-lowering efficacy of a combination of&#xD;
      Travoprost / Timolol maleate, dosed in the morning or in the evening, in patients with&#xD;
      open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, who have an insufficiently controlled IOP (mmHg),&#xD;
      and are using prostaglandin analogue monotherapy.&#xD;
