  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main of the proposed study is to assess whether the use of the Cox-2 inhibitor Etoricoxib&#xD;
      is beneficial for the use in fibromyalgia. We intend to seek whether this medication may&#xD;
      improve psychiatric and rheumatologic parameters of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is an ill-defined clinical disorder characterized by&#xD;
      widespread pain and diffuse tenderness which is assessed at specified anatomical locations.&#xD;
      The FMS is 10 times more common in females, and its prevalence in the community increases&#xD;
      from two percent at age 20 to eight percent at age 70. Although the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology (ACR) has defined classification criteria for the diagnosis of the FMS its'&#xD;
      pathogenesis remains vague. Diffuse and persistent musculoskeletal pain, consistent with the&#xD;
      mentioned ACR criteria have also been reported among patients with other ill defined medical&#xD;
      conditions such as migraines, chronic fatigue pain, myofascial pain, irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      which presentation often overlaps with the FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are mounting data supporting an overlap between the FMS and psychiatric conditions&#xD;
      including depression, panic disorders and anxiety. For example, a lifetime history of major&#xD;
      depression has been reported in 50% to 70% of patients with FMS and current depression was&#xD;
      detected in 18% to 36% of patients with the FMS. This association has been questioned raising&#xD;
      the possibility that this high prevalence reflects the long term outcome of coping with&#xD;
      chronic disabling pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-depressants are the corner stone of therapy in FMS. Benzodiazepines and recent&#xD;
      experience with melatonin has been implicated in order to alleviate sleep disturbances that&#xD;
      are so often encountered among patients with this disorder. Nevertheless, patients with the&#xD;
      FMS often need therapeutical medications in order to ease acute exacerbations of diffuse pain&#xD;
      which are often provoked by mental or physical stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2-selective agents and acetaminophen are&#xD;
      often used by a large number of FMS patients seeking a relief of acute pain. However,&#xD;
      numerous studies have failed to confirm their effectiveness as analgesics in FMS, although&#xD;
      there is limited evidence that patients may experience enhanced analgesia when treated with&#xD;
      combinations of NSAIDs and other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that successful relief of diffuse pain may sever the bond tying pain and increased&#xD;
      anxiety which is so characteristic in these patients. Furthermore, a clinical path that&#xD;
      underlines the importance of pain relief may ensure the adherence and compliance that are&#xD;
      needed to other elements of the therapeutical multidimensional approach in FMS and may be&#xD;
      even improve psychiatric comorbidity that stem from the chronic non relenting pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major factor limiting use of NSAIDs is concern for the development of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications such as bleeding. COX-2 selective inhibitors were developed to decrease the&#xD;
      risk of gastrointestinal tract injury and to avoid the anti-platelet effect of traditional&#xD;
      NSAIDs. The recent MEDAL study has confirmed this finding by randomizing more than 30,000&#xD;
      patients to either etoricoxib or to the traditional NSAID diclofenate. Furthermore, the MEDAL&#xD;
      investigators demonstrated similar cardiovascular outcome measures in both patient groups&#xD;
      showing that the use of this has a similar cardiovascular safety profile as the traditional&#xD;
      used NSAIDS. Using a safe analgesic with a low rate of adverse events in FMS patients, a&#xD;
      population with enhanced somatoform ideation, is of great importance and may also insure the&#xD;
      adherence to the other components of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - Adding etoricoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, to the therapeutic regimens of&#xD;
      patients with the FMS may ease their degree of pain; improve measures of over all quality of&#xD;
      life, disability, sleep, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives - Organic, mental and functional aspects of the FMS will be assessed in patients&#xD;
      treated with etoricoxib (as an &quot;add on&quot;) compared to placebo. The protocol-defined primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be pain severity as measured by the self-reported BPI (short form)&#xD;
      average pain severity score (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include tender point count, validated parameters that measure&#xD;
      quality of life, quality of sleep, disability, pain, depression and anxiety and the&#xD;
      fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (which measures physical function, pain assessment, fatigue&#xD;
      and distress). The study will include eighty patients.&#xD;
