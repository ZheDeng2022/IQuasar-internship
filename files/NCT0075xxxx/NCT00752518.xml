      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability and determine the Japanese&#xD;
      recommended dose (RD) of bortezomib administered as a once-daily intravenous bolus twice&#xD;
      weekly for 2 consecutive weeks(Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period (Days&#xD;
      12 to 21) in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Japan, there is no clear treatment guidance for patients with multiple myeloma that&#xD;
      repeatedly relapsed and became refractory. At present, various therapies including other&#xD;
      multi-drug combination chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, corticosteroid&#xD;
      massive therapy, interferon therapy, thalidomide therapy, radiation therapy and other&#xD;
      experimental therapies are conducted exploratory as salvage therapies to find the one to&#xD;
      which the patient shows response. Considering that the antitumor activity of JNJ-26866138&#xD;
      against relapsed or refractory MM is clear and and the tolerability is acceptable based on&#xD;
      results of the overseas clinical studies, the development of JNJ-26866138 in Japan is quite&#xD;
      meaningful. This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study which&#xD;
      consisting of the two parts: the Phase I part is intended to intravenously administer&#xD;
      JNJ-26866138 twice daily for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) to establish the Japanese RD&#xD;
      based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), while the Phase II part is&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-26866138 in patients repeatedly treated&#xD;
      at the Japanese RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the body surface area calculated before treatment in each cycle, the dose is&#xD;
      calculated for each patient according to the dose level specified by the Patient Enrollment&#xD;
      Center (0.7mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2). JNJ-26866138 is intravenously administered once&#xD;
      daily, twice weekly for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11), followed by a 10-day rest period&#xD;
      (Days 12 to 21). This is considered one cycle (21 days), and treatment is repeated up to 6&#xD;
      cycles in patients expected to show a response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on the predetermined diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received at least standard first-line therapy and had documentation of&#xD;
             failure to that therapy or relapsed after remission and currently requires therapy&#xD;
             because of progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator (subinvestigator)&#xD;
             at enrollment. There is no limitation in the number of prior therapies (salvage&#xD;
             therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Number of regimens)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable disease, defined as follows: Secretory Multiple myeloma:&#xD;
             Quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (in general, serum M protein values of &gt;=&#xD;
             1.0 g/dL of IgG and &gt;= 0.5 g/dL of IgA.), When M protein is excreted in urine, M&#xD;
             protein is quantitatively assayable by urinary protein electrophoresis (in general,&#xD;
             urinary M protein excretion of &gt;= 0.2g/day.). Non-secretory Multiple myeloma: Presence&#xD;
