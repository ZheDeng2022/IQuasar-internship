  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to determine whether a synthetic hydroxyapatite is as&#xD;
      effective as an enamel matrix protein for periodontal regeneration in patients who have&#xD;
      intra-bony periodontal defects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regeneration of periodontal tissues that have been diminished by periodontal disease is the&#xD;
      main goal of periodontal therapy. While conventional surgical therapy only offers limited&#xD;
      potential towards recovering tooth-supporting tissues, more recently developed techniques&#xD;
      lead to a greater and more predictable regeneration of the periodontal structures. Among&#xD;
      these techniques, application of enamel matrix proteins or bone grafts can promote&#xD;
      periodontal regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, controlled, mono-center, randomized, clinical trial, that is open&#xD;
      to the operator, blinded to the examiner. It will be conducted in a parallel group design.&#xD;
      Participants who have at least 1 intra-bony periodontal defect will receive regenerative&#xD;
      surgery at baseline with the randomly selected devices. A newly developed synthetically&#xD;
      manufactured bone grafting material made of hydroxyapatite (Ostim) will be the product under&#xD;
      investigation. An enamel matrix protein derivative (Emdogain) will act as control device.&#xD;
      Both materials will be applied in intra-bony defects during periodontal flap surgery.&#xD;
      Follow-ups will take place at 7 and 14 days post surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the test product with the control in the&#xD;
      treatment of 1- and 2-wall intrabony periodontal defects on the amount of bone fill 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery. Secondary parameters will be the clinical attachment level gain and reduction&#xD;
      of probing pocket depth at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Ostim® is synthetically manufactured and comprises nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. The small particle size facilitates resorption. Ostim is an aqueous watery paste and can be used to fill bone defects or to build up bony structures in the region of the jaws. Ostim is osteoconductive, facilitating bone growth. It will act as a scaffolding for the new bone. Ostim is absorbed during the healing process, in the beginning it is osseously interweaved and finally replaced by natural bone.</description>
