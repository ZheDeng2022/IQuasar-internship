  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this open-label study is to determine if concomitant therapy with&#xD;
      topiramate and flunarizine has any effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug. Safety will&#xD;
      be assessed for all subjects, for the entire duration of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized open-label study to be conducted in 2 groups of subjects.&#xD;
      Group 1 will consist of migraine patients to be recruited at multiple sites and Group 2 will&#xD;
      include healthy subjects at a single study center. In Group 1 a total of 36 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled with a target of having 24 subjects complete the study. In Group 2, a total of 28&#xD;
      healthy subjects will be enrolled so that at least 24 will complete the trial. Group 1 will&#xD;
      include patients under treatment for migraine prophylaxis with any dose of flunarizine for at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks prior to the 6-week run-in phase. Once selected, patients will enter a 6-week&#xD;
      run-in phase in which they will receive 5mg of flunarizine every evening. Following this&#xD;
      run-in phase, patients will continue on flunarizine and be randomized into 2 subgroups of&#xD;
      equal size; Subgroup 1a will consist of patients being treated with topiramate and&#xD;
      flunarizine and Subgroup 1b, the control group, where patients will only be receiving&#xD;
      flunarizine treatment. Patients in Group 1 (Subgroups 1a and 1b) will commence initial&#xD;
      confinement (Day 1) after completing the 6-week run-in phase. All these patients must have a&#xD;
      history of migraine according to IHS1 criteria for at least 1 year prior to study entry. For&#xD;
      both Groups 1 and 2 dropouts will be replaced to ensure the required number of&#xD;
      patients/subjects of each sex to complete the study. Safety will be assessed by studying the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and abnormal findings of other&#xD;
      safety evaluations. Changes in clinical laboratory test and vital sign results from Baseline&#xD;
      to End of Study or early termination will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 1: 5 mg flunarizine every 24 hours (at 8:00 p.m.), beginning on Day -42 for 6 weeks,&#xD;
      through Day -1. Patients will continue to receive this dose from Days 1 through 81. Group 1a:&#xD;
      On Day 4 Topiramate dose titrated from 25 mg BID to 75 mg (25 mg am and 50 mg pm) by Day 19&#xD;
      and 50 mg BID by Day 26 - Day 81. Group 1b continue on Flunarizine only. Group 2: Topiramate&#xD;
      beginning Day 2 titration from 25 mg BID to 50 mg BID by Day 5 through 18. 5mg Flunarizine&#xD;
      daily starting Day 12- Day 18.&#xD;
