  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional spine procedures are an increasingly popular means of diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      of spine disease. By convention, local anesthetics are used at the beginning of these&#xD;
      procedures with the goal of minimizing pain. However, the infiltration of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic is painful. This initial painful stimulus can heighten pain awareness and cause&#xD;
      anxiety or excessive movement during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine patient discomfort with administration of cutaneous&#xD;
      local anesthetic prior to interventional spine procedures compared to no anesthetic&#xD;
      administration for different gauge procedural needles. Another purpose is to determine&#xD;
      patient discomfort with administration of local anesthetic by traditional technique compared&#xD;
      to an alternative technique and to develop a standardized technique and criteria for local&#xD;
      anesthetic administration during spine injection procedures that minimizes patient pain, and&#xD;
      may help reduce the overall risk of these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll a total of 200-300 subjects coming to Stanford for symmetric bilateral&#xD;
      single injections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any patient referred by their treating physician for symmetric bilateral single injections&#xD;
      (for example, bilateral transforaminal epidural injections, bilateral facet injections, or&#xD;
      bilateral SI joint injections, etc.) will provide written informed consent before the&#xD;
      procedure is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of the consent forms will be used to explain the study to patients. Patients&#xD;
      with pregnancy, coagulopathy, systemic infection, allergy to contrast dye, mentally disabled&#xD;
      or those whom are unable to give informed consent will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different cutaneous local anesthetic techniques will be investigated, hereafter&#xD;
      referred to as (a), (b), and (c), and described in detail here:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local anesthetic injected with a 27-gauge 1.25&quot; needle using traditional technique-&#xD;
           formation of a subcutaneous wheal with 0.25cc 1% Lidocaine, then 0.75cc 1% Lidocaine&#xD;
           injected along the planned needle trajectory to the hub depth of the 27-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local anesthetic injected with a 27-gauge 1.25&quot; needle using an alternative technique-&#xD;
           needle is immediately inserted in the planned needle trajectory to the hub depth. Then&#xD;
           1cc 1% Lidocaine is injected slowly as the needle is withdrawn to the skin creating a&#xD;
           small point wheal at the skin prior to removal of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No local anesthetic is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients are randomly assigned to receive one of three possible combinations of&#xD;
                anesthetic techniques (one on each side i.e. (a) &amp; (b), (a) &amp;(c), (b)&amp;(c).&#xD;
                Randomized assignment will occur on a rotating basis, i.e.; patient #1 will receive&#xD;
                (a)&amp;(b), patient #2 will receive (a)&amp;(c), patient #3 will receive (b)&amp;(c), and so&#xD;
                on. Regardless of technique (a), (b), or (c), the following four steps are&#xD;
                followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After the starting point of the procedure is identified, before placement of any&#xD;
                needles, we ask the patient to take note of any subsequent discomfort or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Complete the designated anesthesia technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Next, place the treatment needle to a depth of 1 inch. Needle size is determined by&#xD;
                the injectionist at the time of the procedure, based on what is determined to be&#xD;
                best suited for the patient and the procedure from the following quinke point&#xD;
                needles: 26-gauge 3.5&quot;, 25-gauge 3.5&quot;, or 22-gauge 3.5&quot; needle. The same size&#xD;
                needle will be used on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Finally, we ask the patient to rate on a 10 point verbal analog scale the amount of&#xD;
                pain they experienced during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Repeat steps 2 thru 5 for the second side of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data is collected during the procedure. There will be no follow-up visits after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
