      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if whole brain radiation can lower the&#xD;
      chances of developing brain tumors in patients with small cell carcinoma of the urinary&#xD;
      tract, including the bladder. The safety of whole brain radiation will also be studied.&#xD;

      Pregnancy Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test to be eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI/CT Scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within six (6) weeks before having whole brain radiation, you will have a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain to check if brain tumors have&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the radiation therapy begins, you will have a &quot;simulation visit&quot; to plan for the&#xD;
      radiation therapy. During this session, you will be fitted to a plastic mask to hold your&#xD;
      head still during radiation. The mask is made of a material called &quot;thermoplastic&quot; that&#xD;
      becomes soft when it is placed in warm water. While this plastic is soft, it will be pulled&#xD;
      over your face to make a mold. When the plastic cools down, it will harden again and the mask&#xD;
      will be completed. After the mask is made, a CT scan of your head will be done for treatment&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will begin radiation within 1 week after the simulation visit. You will have radiation&#xD;
      visits Monday through Friday for 3 weeks (15 total therapy visits). Each therapy session will&#xD;
      last about 15 minutes. It will take the study staff about 10 minutes to position you on the&#xD;
      table and put the mask on. The radiation will be given over 2-3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of each week of therapy, you will have a brain X-ray to see if the radiation&#xD;
      is being given to the best area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the radiation therapy, you will have an MRI or a CT scan of the brain every 6 months&#xD;
      for 1 year and then every year for 5 years to check the status of the disease. More frequent&#xD;
      scans will be performed if your doctor thinks they are needed. You will also complete a&#xD;
      written mental status exam with your doctor every 3-6 months for 2 years and then every year&#xD;
      for 5 years. The exam will have a series of tests to check your memory and ability to follow&#xD;
      instructions. The test will take about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      your disease gets worse or if intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of radiation to check for brain tumors before they&#xD;
      have formed is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically proven small cell carcinoma of the bladder, or elsewhere&#xD;
             along the urothelium, which is locally advanced or metastatic (i.e. &gt; or = cT3b, &gt; or&#xD;
             = pT3b, N+, or M+) at the time of presentation or cystectomy who have been treated&#xD;
             with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have had a response to chemotherapy, which the investigator feels is&#xD;
             likely to resulting systemic control of the cancer. In most instances, this would&#xD;
             reflect a major response (i.e. &gt; or = 90% reduction of tumor), though a lower&#xD;
             percentage may be acceptable if the investigator feels the residual reflects another&#xD;
             component, such as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Dr Arlene Siefker-Radtke will&#xD;
             serve as the final arbiter when questions regarding response arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Since small cell tumors of the bladder are often associated with other variant&#xD;
             histology including TCC and adenocarcinoma, the presence of variant histology will be&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be &gt; or = 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may be on other trials (either here at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center or at an&#xD;
             outside institution) as long as the other eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not have any evidence of progressive disease at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have an MRI or CT of the head showing no CNS metastases within 6 weeks&#xD;
             of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as evidenced by: a) Zubrod&#xD;
             Performance Status (PS) of &lt; or = 2; b) Adequate bone marrow reserves as evidenced by&#xD;
             ANC &gt; 1000, and platelet count &gt; 75,000. Supranormal values judged to be of benign or&#xD;
             inconsequential etiology will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be enrolled within 6 months of completing chemotherapy or after surgery&#xD;
             of the primary site. Any acute/subacute &gt; or = grade 3 toxicities from the&#xD;
             chemotherapy must be resolved to &lt; or = grade 2 at the time of study entry. It is&#xD;
             suggested that patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation as a soon as they&#xD;
             have recovered from chemotherapy or surgery, at a minimum of 2 weeks, and up to 6&#xD;
             months following chemotherapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with CNS metastasis at presentation will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of TIA or stroke within 6 months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior cranial irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women will not be eligible; women of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test before starting therapy.&#xD;
