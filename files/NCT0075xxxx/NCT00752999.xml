  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 225 patients meeting study entry requirements will be enrolled and randomized&#xD;
      (2:1, active versus placebo superimposed on background treatment) to R788 or placebo.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for efficacy and safety parameters for 6 months. The investigator&#xD;
      should taper corticosteroids if clinically warranted.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trial. Study enrollment will comprise approximately 225 patients meeting&#xD;
      study inclusion requirements. The study will be conducted at up to 80 multinational&#xD;
      investigational sites. Eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into one of two 6 month&#xD;
      treatment groups. One group (approximately 150 patients) will receive R788 150 mg PO bid; the&#xD;
      other treatment group (approximately 75 patients) will receive placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient must otherwise be in good health as determined by the investigator on the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant or uncontrolled medical disease in any organ system, other than&#xD;
             due to SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Background immunosuppressive therapy that has not remained stable ≤ 4 weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active severe neuropsychiatric SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
