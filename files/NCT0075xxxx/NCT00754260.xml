      A. Statement of Objective: To conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of caffeine&#xD;
      restriction on Overactive Bladder(OAB) symptoms including urinary frequency, nocturia,&#xD;
      incontinence episodes, symptom severity and bother and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Specific Aims/Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if reduction in caffeine intake decreases urinary frequency, nocturia and&#xD;
           incontinence episodes as measured on a 3-day voiding diary in women with Overactive&#xD;
           Bladder (OAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that women with overactive bladder will report less frequent urination&#xD;
           and decreased nocturia and incontinence episodes with caffeine reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether caffeine reduction results in decreased symptom severity and bother&#xD;
           and improved quality of life scores as measured by the Questionnaire for Incontinence&#xD;
           Severity Index (ISI), Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID),&#xD;
           Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that women with OAB who reduce their intake of caffeine will report decreased&#xD;
      symptom bother and improved quality of life as measured by the ISI, UDI-6 and the IIQ-&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of caffeine reduction education on urinary frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Women with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms who scored a 6 on the Questionnaire for&#xD;
      Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and who consumed at least 200 mg of caffeine daily were&#xD;
      recruited. After completing baseline 3-day bladder diaries including amount and type of&#xD;
      caffeine consumption, as well as validated urinary symptom severity, bother and quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires, women were randomized to receive caffeine reduction education vs. a&#xD;
      control group who reviewed their voiding diary with no counseling to reduce caffeine; both&#xD;
      groups were asked to maintain total fluid intake. Participants repeated the 3-day bladder&#xD;
      diary and validated questionnaires following randomization. A total of 80 women were required&#xD;
      to achieve 80% power with an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a difference of 1.3 in mean number&#xD;
      of daily voids averaged over a 3-day voiding diary.&#xD;
