  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two fundamentally different ways to ventilate critically ill patients: constant&#xD;
      flow, volume-preset modes (such as volume assist-control) and pressure-preset modes (such as&#xD;
      pressure-control and pressure-support). Critically ill patients suffer mechanical&#xD;
      derangements of the respiratory system that raise the work of breathing. Knowledge of these&#xD;
      mechanical properties is useful diagnostically and as a measure of response to treatment over&#xD;
      time. It has been proposed that only constant flow, volume-preset modes are able to offer&#xD;
      diagnostic information about the changes in the subject's lungs in terms of resistance and&#xD;
      elastance properties. This study proposes to examine if similar information can be extracted&#xD;
      from pressure-preset modes by comparing information from both modes of ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To compare the respiratory system resistance and elastance obtained during&#xD;
      constant-flow, volume-preset ventilation (using conventional means) and during&#xD;
      pressure-preset ventilation (by analyzing the slope of the flow versus time waveform, as&#xD;
      described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether patient effort and level of alertness impair the accuracy of&#xD;
      resistance and elastance measurements during pressure-preset ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Our primary hypothesis is that the flow versus time waveform contains&#xD;
      information sufficient to calculate the respiratory system resistance and elastance. To test&#xD;
      the primary hypothesis, we propose to measure resistance and elastance of subjects ventilated&#xD;
      in the ICU during assist-control ventilation (a standard constant flow, volume-preset mode).&#xD;
      Then we will record the flow versus time waveform during pressure-preset ventilation. By&#xD;
      extrapolating the flow versus time waveform (which is generally linear) to the time axis, one&#xD;
      can calculate elastance since at zero flow, the alveolar pressure equals the ventilator&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure. Then Ers = (Pinsp - Total PEEP)/Extrapolated VT, where Pinsp is the set&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure and extrapolated VT is the tidal volume if inspiratory time had been&#xD;
      sufficient to allow equilibration between patient and ventilator (using trigonometry).&#xD;
      Similarly, by extrapolating the flow versus time waveform to the flow axis (to find the&#xD;
      maximal flow), one can calculate the resistance, assuming that flow depends on the pressure&#xD;
      difference between ventilator and patient and the square of the resistance. We will compare&#xD;
      the values derived during pressure-preset ventilation with those determined during&#xD;
      assist-control (taken as the true values).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that inspiratory effort will be sufficient in some subjects to&#xD;
      distort the flow versus time waveform from that which would be seen if the patient were&#xD;
      passive, leading to erroneous values for resistance and elastance. We will estimate the&#xD;
      respiratory drive using a standard measure, the fall in Pao during a brief inspiratory&#xD;
      occlusion 100ms following the onset of inspiration (P0.1). Further, we will measure each&#xD;
      subject's alertness on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). We expect our&#xD;
      estimations of resistance and elastance to less accurate (during pressure-preset ventilation&#xD;
      compared with assist-control) in subjects with greater respiratory drive and higher levels of&#xD;
      alertness.&#xD;

    <description>During volume assist-control ventilation, a 0.4 second end-inspiratory pause will be set and the following pressures measured: peak pressure; plateau pressure; and PEEP. The following ventilator settings will be recorded: inspiratory flow; expired tidal volume; and rate. The presence or absence of autoPEEP will be noted.&#xD;
During pressure-control ventilation, the flow versus time waveform will be printed from the ventilator using a conventional computer printer for later analysis. The following ventilator settings will be recorded: inspiratory pressure; PEEP; and expired tidal volume.</description>
