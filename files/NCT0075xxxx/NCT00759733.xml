  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal cardiac disease complicates approximately 2 percent of pregnancies and is the&#xD;
      leading cause of non-obstetrical maternal death. Evaluating cardiac function and dysfunction&#xD;
      is a complex process requiring skilled clinicians and technology such as ECG, long-term&#xD;
      monitoring, and echocardiography. A fast, easily obtained blood test for B-type natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide (BNP) has been developed that can give evidence for heart muscle stretch and&#xD;
      dysfunction among adults with suspected congestive heart failure. Preliminary experience&#xD;
      indicates that ventricular dysfunction among OB patients with a history of heart disease can&#xD;
      be detected with this serum assay. A prospective cohort design consisting of two groups of&#xD;
      pregnant patients; one with a history of cardiac disease and one without, will be followed&#xD;
      over the course of the pregnancies and cardiac function will be measured using&#xD;
      echocardiography and serum BNP. It is hoped that the blood test for BNP will be a reliable&#xD;
      way to help evaluate OB patients with suspected abnormal heart function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cardiac disease during pregnancy is about 2 percent, and is the leading&#xD;
      cause of non-obstetrical maternal mortality (1). Women with known cardiac disease and&#xD;
      suspected cardiac dysfunction have been monitored and evaluated during pregnancy, labor,&#xD;
      delivery, and post partum with electrocardiogram, long-term rhythm recording, and&#xD;
      echocardiogram (2). Physiological changes that occur in normal pregnancy include a 43%&#xD;
      increase in cardiac output, 45 to 50% increase in intravascular volume, 14% decrease in serum&#xD;
      colloid osmotic pressure, and 28% decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure to pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary wedge pressure ratio. These hemodynamic changes are believed to maintain adequate&#xD;
      uteroplacental perfusion, meet the increased oxygen and nutritional demands throughout&#xD;
      gestation and to protect against sudden hemodynamic changes precipitated by blood loss,&#xD;
      decreased venous return to the heart, and hypotension (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] is released from ventricular myocardium in response to&#xD;
      increased ventricular wall tension or stretch. A rapid assay for the measurement of serum BNP&#xD;
      levels has been developed and is in clinical use for the evaluation of dyspnea related to&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. Serum BNP determination has been described as having a higher level&#xD;
      of diagnostic accuracy for congestive heart failure as a cause for dyspnea than any other&#xD;
      single historical, physical, or laboratory finding. When used in conjunction with other&#xD;
      clinical information, the rapid assay for serum BNP levels is useful in establishing or&#xD;
      excluding cardiac dysfunction as a cause for acute onset dyspnea (4). During uncomplicated&#xD;
      pregnancy, serum BNP levels remain the same as levels seen in non-pregnant women. Among&#xD;
      patients with severe preeclampsia, serum BNP levels have been observed to rise to eight times&#xD;
      baseline values. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and percentage of fractional&#xD;
      shortening within myocardium was observed in the preeclampsia group compared to the normal&#xD;
      pregnancy group. The degree of structural and functional change was linearly related to the&#xD;
      degree of elevation of cardiac natriuretic peptides, including B-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      levels (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical experience indicates that serum BNP levels obtained by a commercially&#xD;
      available rapid assay method may be related to the degree of ventricular dysfunction among&#xD;
      obstetrical patients with acute dyspnea associated with preeclampsia, tocolysis therapy, or&#xD;
      an underlying history of cardiopulmonary disease (6). The purpose of this protocol is to&#xD;
      determine prospectively if the measurement of serum BNP levels will correlate with cardiac&#xD;
      function changes noted on echocardiography and clinically among pregnant women with a history&#xD;
      of cardiac disease. This group is to be compared to a group of pregnant women with no history&#xD;
      of cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a cohort of subjects that have a history of heart disease that have a&#xD;
           diagnosis of cardiac disease, either congenital or acquired, that are pregnant and wish&#xD;
           to continue their pregnancies through to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide standard obstetrical and cardiac care for these subjects and their fetuses as&#xD;
           would be indicated by the type, nature, and degree of cardiac disease present from the&#xD;
           first trimester until after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study interventions to include a series of echocardiograms to begin at the time of&#xD;
           pregnancy diagnosis and proceed until the end of the post partum time frame. These&#xD;
           studies will take place in the first, second, third trimesters, during labor, two to&#xD;
           three days after delivery, and six weeks post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. With each echocardiogram a serum BNP level will be drawn and measured for correlation&#xD;
           with the findings noted on echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Additional data may be collected if an individual subject were to require additional&#xD;
           evaluations with echocardiography and/or BNP serum measurements based on clinical&#xD;
           indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Establish a cohort of control subjects with no history of cardiac disease that will have&#xD;
           echocardiography and serum BNP measurements on the same schedule described for subjects&#xD;
           with a history of cardiac disease for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At the completion of the study, a description of physiologic changes in cardiac function&#xD;
           in the cardiac disease cohort attributable to the subjects' history of cardiac disease&#xD;
           versus those attributable to the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy will be&#xD;
           available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At the completion of the study, a description of changes in the serum levels of BNP will&#xD;
           reflect cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol employs a prospective cohort design. A group of woman with a history of&#xD;
      cardiac disease and pregnancy will be identified as potential subjects for a study cohort.&#xD;
      Each potential subject will have an initial assessment of her cardiac history, condition, and&#xD;
      functional status. A detailed review of her complete medical, surgical, gynecologic, and&#xD;
      obstetrical history will be obtained as dictated by standard care. Appropriate management for&#xD;
      each potential subject's medical and obstetrical care will be initiated and undertaken by&#xD;
      accepted clinical practice. Potential subjects for this cohort will be obstetrical patients&#xD;
      either cared for directly by or in consultation with the Regional Perinatal Center, Division&#xD;
      of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, SUNY Upstate Medical&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second group of women with no history of cardiac disease and pregnancy will also be&#xD;
      identified as potential subjects for a control cohort. Each potential subject will also have&#xD;
      an initial assessment of her medical, surgical, gynecologic, and obstetrical history as&#xD;
      dictated by standard care. Appropriate management for each potential subject's medical and&#xD;
      obstetrical care will be initiated and undertaken by accepted clinical practice. Potential&#xD;
      subjects for this cohort will be obstetrical patients either cared for directly by or in&#xD;
      consultation with the Regional Perinatal Center, Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine,&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, SUNY Upstate Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the management given as part of standard medical and obstetrical care, each&#xD;
      subject from both cohorts will have a series of serum BNP measurements and echocardiograms. A&#xD;
      serum BNP measurement and echocardiogram will be obtained during the first, second, and third&#xD;
      trimesters, during the course of labor or delivery, 48 to 72 hours post-delivery, and 6 to 8&#xD;
      weeks post-delivery. Additional studies will be obtained as indicated by standard clinical&#xD;
      indications. Serum BNP measurements will be made through laboratory services available at&#xD;
      SUNY Upstate Medical University or Crouse Hospital. Echocardiogram studies will be performed&#xD;
      at Cardiology P.C. or Pediatric Cardiology at SUNY Upstate Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard form will be used for each subject to record the results of the serum BNP&#xD;
      measurements, results of the maternal echocardiograms, and details of the clinical course&#xD;
      experienced by each subject during the course of her pregnancy, labor, delivery, and&#xD;
      post-delivery care. Complications related to cardiac function as well as other medical and&#xD;
      obstetrical complications will also be recorded. Please see the attached standard data&#xD;
      collection form for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, a comparison will be made between the cohort of women with&#xD;
      cardiac disease and the cohort of woman without cardiac disease. Specific comparison will be&#xD;
      made in regard to serum BNP levels, cardiac function as measured on echocardiography, and&#xD;
      clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods, Data Analysis, Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no prior published reports regarding the use of a rapid serum BNP assay to evaluate&#xD;
      cardiac function during pregnancy for women with known cardiac disease. From June 1, 2003 to&#xD;
      May 31, 2004, the Regional Perinatal Center at SUNY Upstate Medical University provided&#xD;
      obstetrical care and consultation for 55 patients with ICD-9 Code 648.63, cardiac disease in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Since this is a pilot study, it is anticipated that 20 subjects for the cardiac&#xD;
      disease cohort can be followed over the course of 1 to 2 years, along with a control cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific measurements that will be obtained by echocardiography and recorded as measures of&#xD;
      cardiac function will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated left ventricular wall thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated cardiac output&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right and left atrial chamber volumes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right and left ventricular chamber volumes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated pulmonary artery pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum BNP measurements will be obtained and recorded as units of picograms/milliliter.&#xD;
      Approximately 3-4 milliliters of blood is obtained per assay in a standard lavender-top tube&#xD;
      by standard blood sampling methods. The rapid quantitative assay for BNP will be run on the&#xD;
      Triage® BNP Test (International) of Biosite Diagnostics, Incorporated, San Diego, California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of serum BNP will be correlated with clinical course and objective measures of&#xD;
      cardiac function as determined by echocardiography. A linear relationship between the&#xD;
      elevation of serum BNP measurement and degree of cardiac dysfunction is expected. Elevated&#xD;
      serum BNP and cardiac dysfunction demonstrated on echocardiogram should also correlate with&#xD;
      the clinical estimate of NYHA functional status and the degree of congestive failure.&#xD;
