    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study that used both an&#xD;
      active control (cetirizine) and a placebo control to evaluate desloratadine 5 mg once daily&#xD;
      during a 28-day treatment period. The active treatments and placebo were allocated in a 2:2:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have demonstrated their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its&#xD;
             procedures by signing a written informed consent. For pediatric patients, the parent&#xD;
             or legal guardian was to have signed a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be between 12 and 70 years of age, of either sex and any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had signs and symptoms of CIU for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been experiencing a current flare of their CIU of at least 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             Baseline Visit. Hives were to have been present for at least 3 days per week during&#xD;
             the current flare prior to the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an overall condition of CIU that was at least of &quot;moderate&quot; severity (minimum&#xD;
             score of 2) at both Screening and Baseline Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least a moderately severe pruritus score (minimum score of 2) and hives&#xD;
             (minimum score of 1) present at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have, at Baseline, a total pruritus score of &gt;= 14 for the sum of AM and PM&#xD;
             (reflective) diary scores for the 3 days prior to Baseline and the AM diary score on&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to&#xD;
             assess and record their symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant&#xD;
             medications, and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in general good health and free of any clinically significant disease (other than&#xD;
             CIU) that would have interfered with study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have had a negative urine (hCG) pregnancy&#xD;
             test at the time of Baseline (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential were to be counseled in the appropriate use&#xD;
             of birth control while in the study. They were to be using a medically accepted method&#xD;
             of birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had asthma requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had been unresponsive to antihistamine treatment in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a history of allergies to more than two classes of medication or who were allergic&#xD;
             to or unable to tolerate antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had used any investigational drug in the last 30 days prior to Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had food or drug allergies manifested as skin reactions. Subjects with urticaria that&#xD;
             was primarily due to physical urticaria or other known etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, were pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a history of hypersensitivity to the study drug or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were family members of the investigational study staff involved with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had previously been randomized into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had current evidence of clinically significant hematopoietic, cardiovascular, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal, neurologic, psychiatric, autoimmune disease, or other disease that precluded&#xD;
             the subject's participation in the study. Particular attention was to be given to&#xD;
             subjects with conditions that would interfere with the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion of the study medication or with the subject's ability to&#xD;
             reliably complete the diary card.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were morbidly obese (BMI &gt;= 35, as described in Appendix 6 of the protocol)&#xD;
