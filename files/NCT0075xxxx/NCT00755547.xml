      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know that exercise helps children develop strong bones and muscles and&#xD;
      generally stay healthy. What is unclear however, is how much exercise a child needs to lower&#xD;
      their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to find out whether high-intensity exercise for a short-period of&#xD;
      time is better than moderately intense exercise for improving the diabetes risk profile in&#xD;
      teens who are at risk for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that exercise-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity (a risk&#xD;
      factor for diabetes) will be greater following vigorous intermittent physical activity than&#xD;
      following low intensity physical activity in overweight adolescents 13-18 yrs at risk for&#xD;
      T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Description of Research Project: Teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 yrs, who are&#xD;
      at risk for type 2 diabetes (either by their family history or an abnormal response to sugar)&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two activity groups or a control group. The activity&#xD;
      groups will have supervised exercise sessions 3 to 5 days per week for 6 months. One group&#xD;
      will do high-intensity exercise, and the other will do lower-intensity exercise. We will&#xD;
      measure how sensitive their body is to insulin and the amount of fat in their muscle and&#xD;
      liver tissue at the beginning and end of the exercise intervention.&#xD;

      The Physical activity for OverWEight youth at Risk for type 2 diabetes (POWER) Trial is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial designed to study the effects of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training regimens differing in intensity (relative to peak fitness) on insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      overweight youth. Additionally, this trial will explore the biologic mechanisms through which&#xD;
      chronic physical activity alters lipid metabolism to result in improvements in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 90 eligible adolescents and randomly assign them to one of two six-month&#xD;
      intervention arms that differ by intensity but elicit similar amounts of energy expenditure:&#xD;
      (1) a low intensity continuous activity arm (40-55% of peak oxygen uptake for 60 min); (2)&#xD;
      vigorous intensity intermittent activity arm (70-85% of peak oxygen uptake for 30 min) or a&#xD;
      sedentary control group. The primary outcome measure of this trial will be insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, measured directly from Bergman's frequently sampled intravenous glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test.&#xD;

    <description>All sessions will be designed to elicit a certain degree of energy expenditure that will progressively increase throughout the trial. Adolescents randomized to the vigorous activity group will perform interval sessions that ensure an average heart rate between 70 and 85% of maximal heart rate reserve while those randomized will perform aerobic activity between 40 and 50% of heart rate reserve. The goal for the trial will be to expend a minimum of 350 kcal. The type of exercise will depend on the preference of each participant however, during the supervised sessions walking/jogging on a treadmill or outdoors will be used to elicit exercise intensities. The three activity sessions held at the YMCA-YWCA facilities in Winnipeg and be supervised by a trained kinesiologist who will record heart rate and perceived exertion for each session.</description>
