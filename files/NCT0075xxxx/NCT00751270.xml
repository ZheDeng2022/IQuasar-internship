    <textblock>
      This phase I study evaluated a Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy approach for malignant&#xD;
      gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study was to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering an experimental approach called&#xD;
      GliAtak which uses AdV-tk, an adenoviral vector containing the Herpes Simplex thymidine&#xD;
      kinase gene, plus an oral anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, in combination with standard&#xD;
      of care radiation.&#xD;

      This study was designed to include patients with newly diagnosed unresectable (Arm A) and&#xD;
      resectable (Arm B) malignant glioma. Three dose levels of AdV-tk were evaluated with a fixed&#xD;
      dose level of valacyclovir prodrug. AdV-tk was delivered to tumor cells by stereotactic&#xD;
      injection into the tumor at the time of biopsy (Arm A) or injection into the tumor bed&#xD;
      following resection (Arm B). Oral valacyclovir began 1-3 days after the AdV-tk injection and&#xD;
      continued for 14 days. Standard radiation therapy began 3-7 days following the AdV-tk&#xD;
      injection to maximize synergy with radiation. Standard temozolomide could be administered&#xD;
      after completion of valacyclovir.&#xD;
