      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of azilsartan, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), in subjects with essential hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 60 million&#xD;
      people in the United States are hypertensive. Although no single risk factor is responsible&#xD;
      for the development of hypertension, some of the many risk factors can be controlled, and&#xD;
      some cannot. Controllable risk factors include weight gain, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle,&#xD;
      poor eating habits, emotional stress, physical tension, sodium sensitivity, alcohol abuse,&#xD;
      and use of oral contraceptives. Uncontrollable risk factors include family history, gender,&#xD;
      age and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is termed the &quot;silent killer&quot; because many patients are asymptomatic. Chronic&#xD;
      hypertension causes extensive arterial wall damage, which allows cholesterol to adhere to the&#xD;
      damaged endothelial lining and produces increased cardiac stress. Hypertension dramatically&#xD;
      increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, renal damage, impaired vision, heart&#xD;
      failure and overall mortality. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are a class of drugs used for&#xD;
      the treatment of hypertension that not only decrease blood pressure, but also likely&#xD;
      contribute to protecting hypertensive individuals from cardiac events, strokes and loss of&#xD;
      renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin II has significant physiological effects on tissues and organs throughout the&#xD;
      body including vascular smooth muscle, adrenal cortex, kidney, and brain. Angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptors are located on the plasma membrane of target cells to facilitate the rapid onset of&#xD;
      angiotensin II. Three distinct subtypes of angiotensin II receptors have been identified:&#xD;
      angiotensin II type-1 receptor, angiotensin type 2, and angiotensin type 4; and the relative&#xD;
      proportion of each vary from tissue to tissue. The angiotensin II type-1 receptor subtype is&#xD;
      expressed predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells where activation by angiotensin II&#xD;
      results in vasoconstriction, cell proliferation, fibrosis, and cellular hypertrophy. In&#xD;
      contrast, angiotensin II type-2 receptor stimulation produces pharmacologic activities that&#xD;
      are opposite to those that occur after angiotensin II type-1 receptor stimulation. The&#xD;
      angiotensin II type-4 receptor has been reported to be expressed in the adrenals, brain, and&#xD;
      myocardium, but its exact function remains unknown. It is not considered to play an important&#xD;
      role in human pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-536 (azilsartan) is a synthetic angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist being developed&#xD;
      as a treatment for mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension&#xD;
