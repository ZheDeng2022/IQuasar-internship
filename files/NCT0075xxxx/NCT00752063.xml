      HCC is an aggressive, largely chemo-resistant cancer with a poor prognosis, currently there&#xD;
      is no effective systemic chemotherapy for HCC. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are both overexpressed in HCC and thought to&#xD;
      contribute to tumor development. Oxaliplatin in combination with other chemotherapies or&#xD;
      biologic agents have been shown to be an effective and safe treatment in advanced HCC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, blocks tumor cell proliferation by targeting&#xD;
      multiple growth factor pathways and also exerts an anti-angiogenic effect. Clinically, single&#xD;
      agent Sorafenib has been shown to have some efficacy in patients with advanced HCC and the&#xD;
      primary result of prolonged overall survival seems to have been achieved in the phase III&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy, with an annual&#xD;
      incidence of over 500,000 new patients and more than half of the new cases occur in China.&#xD;
      The most common etiological causes of HCC are hepatitis B and hepatitis C viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC is a cancer of high particular relevance in Hong Kong because of the high prevalence&#xD;
      (10%) of hepatitis B virus infection in the population. It is the second most common cancer&#xD;
      causing death in Hong Kong. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are regarded as the&#xD;
      main curative treatments for HCC. Nevertheless, the majority of patients have unresectable&#xD;
      HCCs because of advanced tumor stage and poor liver function. Besides, transplantation is&#xD;
      indicated only for early small HCCs, and its application is limited by the shortage of liver&#xD;
      graft, which is a particularly severe problem in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC is an aggressive, largely chemo-resistant cancer with a poor prognosis, currently there&#xD;
      is no effective systemic chemotherapy for HCC. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are both overexpressed in HCC and thought to&#xD;
      contribute to tumor development. Oxaliplatin in combination with other chemotherapies or&#xD;
      biologic agents have been shown to be an effective and safe treatment in advanced HCC&#xD;
      patients. Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, blocks tumor cell proliferation by&#xD;
      targeting multiple growth factor pathways and also exerts an anti-angiogenic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib has been approved by FDA for use in renal cell carcinoma based on prolonged&#xD;
      survival in phase III trials. Single agent Sorafenib has been shown to have some efficacy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced HCC and the primary result of prolonged overall survival have been&#xD;
      achieved in a recent randomized phase III trial. However, most patients would only have&#xD;
      disease stabilization as the phase II trial only showed a tumor response rate of only 8% (PR&#xD;
      &amp; MR). Combination with chemotherapy may improve the tumor response rate.&#xD;
