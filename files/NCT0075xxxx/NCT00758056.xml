      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help&#xD;
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study is looking at genetic susceptibility to cancer and interactions between&#xD;
      genes and the environment in patients with endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain epidemiological information and biological material on a population-based&#xD;
           series of endometrial cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the proportion of endometrial cancer incidence attributable to mutations in&#xD;
           known predisposing genes such as MSH2 and MLH1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the risk associated with these predisposing mutations by examining the&#xD;
           cancer risk in relatives of patients who are shown to be carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect of nongenetic risk factors in mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pathological and clinical characteristics of endometrial cancers&#xD;
           occurring in mutation carriers as compared with that in noncarriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish whether mutations at other loci may predispose to endometrial cancer by&#xD;
           comparing the frequency of alterations in endometrial cancer patients with the&#xD;
           corresponding frequency in cancer-free controls identified through the European&#xD;
           Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete an epidemiological questionnaire. The questionnaire will request&#xD;
      identifying information about the patient's first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected from patients. DNA is extracted from these blood samples and from&#xD;
      samples collected from cancer-free control participants in MREC-SEARCH-CONTROL as well as&#xD;
      from additional controls through the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)&#xD;
      study (a population based study of diet and health based in Norfolk, East Anglia). DNA&#xD;
      samples are analyzed for polymorphisms of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the endometrial cancer patients recruited for this study, patients with&#xD;
      breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, brain and esophageal&#xD;
      cancer, malignant melanoma, and lymphoma cancer are recruited in the following related&#xD;
      clinical trials: MREC-SEARCH-BREAST, MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN, MREC-SEARCH-PROSTATE,&#xD;
      MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL, and MREC-SEARCH-CANCER.&#xD;
