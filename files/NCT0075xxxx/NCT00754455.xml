      A Phase 2a Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of a Seasonal Influenza Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine (recombinant) in&#xD;
      Healthy Adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the tolerability and safety of Influenza VLP Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of Influenza VLP Vaccine as measured by hemagglutination&#xD;
           inhibition (HAI) antibody titers to each of the three component viral strains&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cross-strain immunogenicity of Influenza VLP Vaccine as measured by&#xD;
           hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers against drifted strains&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify antibody against neuraminidase and hemagglutinin following administration of&#xD;
           Influenza VLP Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to Influenza VLP Vaccine as quantified by&#xD;
           interferon-gamma (IFNg) and Granzyme-B produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
           (PBMCs).&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunogenicity of three dose levels (low, middle or high) of Influenza VLP&#xD;
      Vaccine or placebo in healthy adults(18 to 49 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will provide a blood sample for baseline evaluation of immunological&#xD;
      measures followed by a single intramuscular (IM) injection of Influenza VLP Vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored in the clinic for a period of at least 30 minutes following&#xD;
      vaccination for the occurrence of adverse events including local injection site reactions and&#xD;
      systemic responses. For 7 days following vaccination and beginning the day of vaccination,&#xD;
      subjects will maintain a symptom diary for daily recording of injection-site reactions as&#xD;
      well as generalized systemic reactions including measurement of body temperature. Clinic&#xD;
      staff will contact the subjects by telephone 2 days post vaccination (Day 3) to check for&#xD;
      adverse events and to answer any questions related to collection of symptom diary&#xD;
      information. Subjects will return to the clinic 7 days following vaccination (Day 8) for&#xD;
      safety evaluation that will include a review of diary card information. A subset of subjects&#xD;
      will additionally return to the clinic 10-14 days following vaccination (Days 11-15) to&#xD;
      provide a blood sample for evaluation of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. All subjects&#xD;
      will return to the clinic 21 days following injection (Day 22) for a safety evaluation and to&#xD;
      provide a blood sample for measurement of humoral immunological parameters. A final safety&#xD;
      evaluation (telephone contact) will occur at approximately 6 months following vaccination&#xD;
      (Day 181).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a parallel group design with a total of approximately 300&#xD;
      subjects (18 to 49 years of age) randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment arms (high, middle,&#xD;
      low and placebo) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio. The following is a summary of subject allocation to&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Allocation Treatment Condition Number of Subjects High dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 100&#xD;
      Middle dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 100 Low dose vaccine/ 0.5 mL - 50 Placebo (0.5 mL) - 50&#xD;
