      Rationale: The standard treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis is corticosteroid injections.&#xD;
      Corticosteroid injection give temporarily pain reduction, but no healing. Blood platelets&#xD;
      initiate the natural healing rate. GPS ® gives an eightfold concentrate platelets of patients&#xD;
      own blood. Injection of these platelets in the tendon might induce a healing rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the efficacy of autologous platelet concentrate injections with&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection in patients suffering from plantar fasciitis with respect to pain&#xD;
      and function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of foot complaints in the United States, making up&#xD;
      11 to 15 percent of the foot symptoms requiring professional care among adults (Pfeffer et&#xD;
      al., 1999; Cole et al., 2005). A 2004 publication found that there are approximately 1&#xD;
      million patient visits per year to office-based physicians and hospital outpatient&#xD;
      departments in the United States for plantar fasciitis (Riddle et al., 2004). This figure&#xD;
      does not consider podiatric physicians visits, including these numbers would raise the&#xD;
      overall physician visits related to plantar fasciitis considerably. The incidence of plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis peaks in people between the ages of 40 to 60 years with no bias towards either sex&#xD;
      (Taunton et al., 2002) The underlying condition that causes plantar fasciitis is a&#xD;
      degenerative tissue condition that occurs near the site of origin of the plantar fascia at&#xD;
      the medial tuberosity of the calcaneous (Buchbinder, 2004). In acute cases, plantar fasciitis&#xD;
      is characterized by classical signs of inflammation including pain, swelling and loss of&#xD;
      function. For more chronic conditions, however, inflammation is not the underlying tissue&#xD;
      disruption. In fact, histology of chronic cases has shown no signs of inflammatory cell&#xD;
      invasion into the affected area (Lemont et al., 2003). The tissue instead is characterized&#xD;
      histological by infiltration with macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells; tissue&#xD;
      destruction; and repair involving immature vascularization and fibrosis (Lemont et al.,&#xD;
      2003). The normal fascia tissue is replaced by an angiofibroblastic hyperplastic tissue which&#xD;
      insuitates itself throughout the surrounding tissue creating a self-perpetuating cycle of&#xD;
      degeneration (Lemont et al., 2003). In these chronic cases, the suffix 'itis' is a misnomer&#xD;
      with plantar fasciosis being a more apt description of the underlying histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatments including stretching protocols and foot orthoses resolve many cases&#xD;
      of plantar fasciitis, with reports for patients in orthopedic practices being around 80&#xD;
      percent resolution (Cole et al., 2005; Wolgin et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1998; Davies et&#xD;
      al., 1999). For more chronic cases, a number of non-surgical interventions are utilized&#xD;
      including extracorperal shock wave therapy and corticosteroid injections (Cole et al., 2005;&#xD;
      Speed et al., 2003; Acevedo, Beskin, 1998). The use of corticosteroids is particularly&#xD;
      troubling as several studies have linked plantar fascial rupture to repeated local injections&#xD;
      of a corticosteroid (Cole et al., 2005; Sellman, 1994; Leach et al., 1978; Acevedo, Beskin,&#xD;
      1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these methods are limited in their efficacy for cases of chronic plantar fasciitis due&#xD;
      to the fact that none of them adequately addresses the full scope of the underlying tissue&#xD;
      degeneration. This frequently leaves surgical intervention as the only viable option in these&#xD;
      chronic cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of treatment for chronic plantar fasciitis should be to cease and ultimately reverse&#xD;
      the degenerating tissue disruption that is at the root of the condition. The three steps&#xD;
      critical to full repair of the effected tissue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enhancing the influx and proliferation of fibroblasts into the effected area. This will&#xD;
           allow for a tissue bed that is extremely receptive to vascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Promote angiogenesis to develop a mature vascular structure in the effected area&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. With a mature vascularization, collagen deposition can then occur, resulting in the&#xD;
           organization of fully mature tendon tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection of platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) into the effected tissue addresses all three&#xD;
      healing stages necessary to reverse the degenerative process. The individual cytokines&#xD;
      present in the platelet α-granules have been shown to enhance fibroblast migration and&#xD;
      proliferation, upregulate vascularization, and increases collagen deposition in a variety of&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo settings [Molloy 2004]. Autologous PRP contains concentrated white blood&#xD;
      cells and platelets that are suspended in plasma. Since an acidic anticoagulant&#xD;
      (Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution A) is used to allow for processing of the whole&#xD;
      blood via centrifugation, the PRP must be buffered to increase the pH to normal physiologic&#xD;
      levels prior for injection into the effected tissue. This is accomplished with the addition&#xD;
      of an 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution at a ratio 0.05cc of sodium bicarbonate solution to&#xD;
      1cc of platelet concentrate. The resulting buffered platelet concentrate contains&#xD;
      approximately 6 to 8 times concentration of platelets compared to baseline whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokines present in platelet α-granules have been shown to affect the three healing&#xD;
      stages necessary to reverse a chronic plantar fasciitis condition (Molloy et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Additionally, many of these cytokines have been seen to work in a dose dependent manner&#xD;
      (Molloy et al., 2003). A PRP injection into the effected area of tissue would provide&#xD;
      concentrated levels of cytokines that should result in a healing cascade that halts and&#xD;
      ultimately reverses the underlying pathology of elbow tendinosis. This treatment concept&#xD;
      directly addresses the existing condition and should prove to be a superior alternative to&#xD;
      current conservative treatments for chronic plantar fasciitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to compare the efficacy of autologous&#xD;
      platelet concentrate injections with corticosteroid injection in patients suffering from&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis with respect to pain and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary question Does injection with autologous platelet concentrate results in a larger&#xD;
      percentage of successfully treated patients after 6 month as injection corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions Does injection with autologous platelet concentrate has a larger pain&#xD;
      reduction as injection of corticosteroid injection? (VAS) Does injection with autologous&#xD;
      platelet concentrate has a larger improvement in function as corticosteroid injection?&#xD;
      (AOFAS, WHOQol) Does injection with autologous platelet concentrate has a larger amount of&#xD;
      satisfied patients as of corticosteroid injection? (WHOQol, satisfaction)&#xD;
