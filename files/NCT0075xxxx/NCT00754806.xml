      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Although there are some comparative studies between laparoscopy and hand-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) in splenomegaly cases, there is no study of the differences&#xD;
      between HALS and open splenectomy (OS). Our aim was to compare the HALS and OS techniques in&#xD;
      splenomegaly cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective study included 27 patients undergoing splenectomy for splenic&#xD;
      disorders at the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Medical Faculty between February&#xD;
      2007 and October 2007. OS was performed on 14 patients, and HALS was performed in the other&#xD;
      13 patients.&#xD;

      Key words: HALS, open splenectomy, splenomegaly&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of laparoscopic surgery, increasing experience in its performance and advances in&#xD;
      techniques and surgical devices have all greatly influenced general surgery. The usefulness&#xD;
      of laparoscopic surgery has already been well proven in cholecystectomy, esophageal&#xD;
      antireflux surgery, and splenectomy for benign diseases (1). Laparoscopy is also now gaining&#xD;
      recognition for procedures accompanied by lymph node dissection, such as gastric and&#xD;
      colorectal surgery (2, 3). The development of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has&#xD;
      also brought about improvements in regard to various disadvantages that have previously been&#xD;
      associated with laparoscopic surgery, including lack of tactile sensation feedback, poor&#xD;
      depth perception, lack of quick access in the event of unexpected hemorrhage, and&#xD;
      difficulties with intracorporal suturing. Such improvements have enabled the performance of&#xD;
      advanced laparoscopic surgery (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve the problems associated with a long learning curve and long operating times, hand&#xD;
      ports have been introduced. Through the hand port, the surgeon's hand can be introduced into&#xD;
      the abdomen while the pneumoperitoneum is preserved. The use of a hand port reduces operating&#xD;
      time and shortens the learning curve (5). It has already been suggested that procedures&#xD;
      requiring an incision to remove a specimen or organ are most suitable for HALS (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) for the normal-sized spleen has been shown to be a safe&#xD;
      procedure, resulting in short hospital stays, low postoperative pain scores, technical&#xD;
      hurdles and, as a result, can be more difficult. LS has advantages over open splenectomy (7),&#xD;
      and it is now considered by many surgeons to be the procedure of choice for normal-sized&#xD;
      spleens. Splenectomy for giant spleens using solely laparoscopic approaches is feasible, but&#xD;
      it can be time consuming and challenging to any surgeon despite his or her high level of&#xD;
      experience with laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increased splenic sizes, LS becomes more technically challenging, although the procedure&#xD;
      is still feasible (8,5). Hand-assisted laparoscopic technique allows the surgeon to place one&#xD;
      hand into the abdominal cavity while maintaining the pneumoperitoneum, recovering tactile&#xD;
      sense and improving the accuracy of manipulation. This has been verified in various&#xD;
      complicated laparoscopic procedures, including colectomies, nephrectomies, and hepatectomies.&#xD;
      Based on these experiences, HALS may be well suited for the removal of splenomegaly when the&#xD;
      final spleen weight is greater than 500 g (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be of interest to assess whether outcomes of the HALS hybrid technique approximate&#xD;
      those obtained with laparoscopy or with the open approach. Since comparative studies between&#xD;
      laparoscopy and HALS have been already carried out, we compared open splenectomy with HALS&#xD;
      for splenomegaly cases. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to compare the&#xD;
      results of HALS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study included 27 patients undergoing splenectomy for splenic disorders at&#xD;
      the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Medical Faculty between February 2007 and October&#xD;
      2007. Patients were selected randomly according to numbers on a random table and assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two different surgical procedures. Twenty-seven patients with splenomegaly and&#xD;
      primary splenic tumors were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups&#xD;
      according to the surgical procedure performed: open splenectomy (Group 1 :OS, n=14) and&#xD;
      hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (Group 2:HALS, n=13). The study plan was reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by our institutional ethical committee, and informed consent was obtained for all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n=11) were the main indication for splenectomy in this study. There&#xD;
      were also rarely encountered primary splenic hemangiomas (n=2) (Table 1). Splenomegaly was&#xD;
      identified clinically by palpation of the spleen below the coastal margin and/or by&#xD;
      radiological examination of computerized tomography (CT) scans (15 cm or longer in&#xD;
      craniocaudal diameter), with final intact splenic weight ≥ 500 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study parameters included age, sex, the greatest splenic diameter, preoperative platelet&#xD;
      count, preoperative hematocrit level and postoperative diagnosis. Body Mass Index (BMI) was&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio of weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). All the patients were&#xD;
      evaluated with the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (10). Operative data&#xD;
      included operative time as measured from first skin incision to the application of dressings,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, splenic weight after intact removal, conversion, pain score, and&#xD;
      postoperative length of hospital stay. Complications were classified as intraoperative or&#xD;
      postoperative. The pain of all patients was scored during postoperative days. The visual&#xD;
      analogue scale defined by Wewers (11) was used for the evaluation of the degree of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were vaccinated against pneumococci with Pneumovax 23 (Merck &amp; Co Inc.,&#xD;
      Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) two weeks before the operation. All patients received antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis (Sulbactam and ampicillin 1 g, intravenously). All patients received general&#xD;
      anesthesia during surgery and a standardized analgesic regimen. HALS and OS were performed by&#xD;
      the same surgical team. Post-operative analgesia was achieved by patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      via a pump containing a standard narcotic analgesic solution. All patients received the same&#xD;
      non-steroidal antinflammatory drug (lornoxicam 8 mg, twice a day, intravenously) and the same&#xD;
      narcotic analgesic (pethidine 50 mg, twice a day, intramuscularly) on the first and second&#xD;
      postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery Open Surgery(Group 1) Patients were placed in supine position. Since all patients had&#xD;
      splenomegaly, preferred incisions were left subcostal. Only three patients requiring&#xD;
      synchronous cholecystectomy had upper midline laparotomy incisions (18 cm, 18 cm and 20 cm in&#xD;
      length). After routine whole abdominal exploration, with the assistance of abdominal&#xD;
      retractors and the first assistance, the inferior pole and medial splenogastric ligament were&#xD;
      dissected first, and then the splenorenal ligament and superior pole of the splenophrenic&#xD;
      ligament were dissected. The LigaSure vessel sealing system (Valleylab division of Tyco&#xD;
      Healthcare, Mansfield, MA) was used for the majority of the dissection. After this, the&#xD;
      splenic vascular pedicule was separated from the pancreatic tail with careful dissection. In&#xD;
      splenomegaly cases, if the splenic and perisplenic anatomy was appropriate, the ideal&#xD;
      ligation of the splenic hilum was outside the abdomen (Figure 1). The splenic artery and&#xD;
      splenic vein were ligated with silk (00) and sectioned. In the cases of massive splenomegaly,&#xD;
      the main truncus of the splenic artery was ligated before the dissection to minimize blood&#xD;
      loss and to allow the return of blood inside the spleen back to the circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1- Splenic hilum ligation outside of the abdominal cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the removal of the spleen, hemostasis was rechecked, and an aspirative drain was&#xD;
      routinely placed. The abdominal wall was closed with loop polydioxanone (no: 1) in two layers&#xD;
      with running sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HALS procedure(Group 2) Patients were placed in a semilateral position with the left side&#xD;
      elevated 30˚. The surgeon stood on the patients' right side with the camera operator. First,&#xD;
      a hand port incision was made in the upper midline (Figure 2). The incision measured 7-8 cm&#xD;
      (depending on the size of the surgeon's glove) in all cases. Then, the hand-assisted device&#xD;
      Omniport (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Co. Wicklow, Ireland) was installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 2- Omniport placed through an 8 cm upper midline incision in the HALS technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon's left (non-dominant) hand was placed into the abdominal cavity through the&#xD;
      device. The 10-mm 30˚ laparoscope was placed at the inferior or superior crease of the&#xD;
      umbilicus depending on the spleen size and location. The 10-mm main operating port was in the&#xD;
      midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus. Carbon dioxide was insufflated continuously&#xD;
      with 13 mmHg for constant pneumoperitoneum. An intraabdominal exploration for accessory&#xD;
      spleen was the first step. LigaSure was used as above. With the assistance of the&#xD;
      intraabdominal hand, the inferior pole and medial splenogastric ligament were dissected&#xD;
      first, and then the splenorenal ligament and superior pole of the splenophrenic ligament were&#xD;
      dissected. Then, the splenic vascular pedicule was separated from the pancreatic tail by&#xD;
      finger dissection. The splenic artery and splenic vein were either ligated with LigaSure or&#xD;
      silk (00) and sectioned or dissected with an endo vascular stapler (Endo-GIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cases of massive splenomegaly, the splenic artery was ligated before the dissection to&#xD;
      gain enough operative space; this was also the case for LS. Finally, the spleen was placed&#xD;
      into a retrieval bag and extracted intact via the hand port incision. Routinely, a suction&#xD;
      drain was placed in the splenic fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data are reported as the mean ± SD. The analysis was performed with the&#xD;
      statistical package SPSS 10.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Differences between variables were&#xD;
      compared with nonparametric Mann Whitney-U and Student's t and chi-square tests. Spearman&#xD;
      correlation analysis was performed for all patients. Results were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the two-tailed p value was less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1991, Delaitre et al. attempted the first laparoscopic LS (12). Since then, the&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach for splenectomy has gained wide acceptance and has been shown by&#xD;
      several groups to be a technically successful, safe, and effective procedure. LS is now&#xD;
      considered the standard approach to removing a normal-sized spleen for patients without other&#xD;
      contraindications. In cases of splenomegaly, LS is also feasible in experienced hands, but,&#xD;
      because the larger-sized spleen makes the operative space narrow, the exposure is limited,&#xD;
      and manipulations are difficult, the LS procedure becomes more technically challenging. The&#xD;
      hypervascularization and dense adhesions around the spleen hamper the surgeon's performance&#xD;
      as well. Moreover, once the dissection is completed, the extraction of a giant spleen with a&#xD;
      solely laparoscopic approach by placing it into a retrieval bag followed by morcellation can&#xD;
      be difficult, and it can add considerable time to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have suggested that LS for splenomegaly was associated with longer operation&#xD;
      times, more blood loss, and higher intraoperative and postoperative complication rates than&#xD;
      LS for normal-sized spleens (13). In addition, in some cases of splenomegaly, conversion is&#xD;
      inevitable because of a requirement for an intact specimen for pathologic examination or&#xD;
      because of serious hypervascularization and dense adhesion as the result of massive size (14,&#xD;
      15). Targarona et al. (14) indicated that the conversion rate was correlated with the spleen&#xD;
      weight: for spleens weighing 400 - 1000 g, it was 0, but it rose to 25% for weights &gt; 1000 g&#xD;
      and to 75% for weights &gt; 3000 g. In their LS group, conversions to laparoscopy-assisted&#xD;
      splenectomy occurred in four patients (25%), including one case (spleen weight of 1600 g) for&#xD;
      which pathologic examination determined a sarcoma and three cases of complicated procedures&#xD;
      due to spleen weight &gt; 3000 g (16). The median splenic weight in our HALS group was 800&#xD;
      (480-2110)g; we did not have any conversion to OS.&#xD;
