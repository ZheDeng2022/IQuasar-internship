      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify neurophysiologic effects of venlafaxine treatment in normal controls using&#xD;
           quantitative EEG (QEEG) cordance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the effects of venlafaxine on different rating scales measuring mood and&#xD;
           anxiety (e.g., Ham-D, BDI, SCL-90, POMS-BI, Visual Analog Mood Scale, SSRS, SASS,&#xD;
           Q-LES-Q and SF-36) as well as on measures of cognitive and psychosocial function (i.e.,&#xD;
           Stroop, PASAT, RAVLT, Trailmaking A and B, Digit-Symbol, Grooved Pegboard,&#xD;
           Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, Temperament and Character Inventory,&#xD;
           Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire, and Pittsburgh&#xD;
           Sleep Quality Index) in normal control subjects, and the association of changes in&#xD;
           cordance with changes in thinking and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify physiologic effects of venlafaxine treatment in normal controls using heart&#xD;
           rate and immune function measures&#xD;

      Pilot data suggest that in depressed patients treated with fluoxetine or venlafaxine, QEEG&#xD;
      cordance detects changes of brain function within individual subjects as soon as two days&#xD;
      after initiation of treatment. Changes in cordance appear to be specific (i.e., do not occur&#xD;
      in the absence of clinical improvement), and frequently precede examiner ratings of&#xD;
      improvement (Leuchter et al., 1997; Cook et al., in submission). In addition, patterns of&#xD;
      cordance at baseline may indicate which patients are most likely to respond to fluoxetine or&#xD;
      venlafaxine treatment (Cook et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings using cordance contrast with those reported in previous QEEG studies of&#xD;
      antidepressant medications, performed in depressed as well as normal control subjects. These&#xD;
      studies have shown QEEG effects of antidepressant medication, such as decreased theta or&#xD;
      alpha band activity, that are not related to changes in clinical state. In particular, normal&#xD;
      subjects receiving antidepressant medications have been reported to show changes in&#xD;
      conventional QEEG power measurements that may be useful characteristics of antidepressant&#xD;
      medication for medication development purposes. Similar changes in QEEG power have been&#xD;
      reported in depressed subjects who do not show clinical improvement (Saletu et al 1982, 1983,&#xD;
      1985, 1986, 1987, 1988; Sannita et al 1983, 1990; Itil et al 1984; Herrmann et al., 1991;&#xD;
      Luthringer et al., 1996). The relationship of these immediate EEG changes in control subjects&#xD;
      to eventual clinical response in a depressed population is unclear. Other QEEG work with&#xD;
      depressed subjects has found that changes from baseline in theta power early in the course of&#xD;
      treatment may characterize groups of depressed patients who are more likely to respond to&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment (Ulrich et al., 1994). Unfortunately, the changes lacked the&#xD;
      specificity to allow response prediction for individual subjects, and the physiologic meaning&#xD;
      of these changes in theta power is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously have shown that absolute and relative power are complementary measures of brain&#xD;
      activity (Leuchter et al., 1993). Cordance is a new QEEG measure that combines information&#xD;
      from both absolute and relative power measures (Leuchter et al., 1994). In validation against&#xD;
      data collected simultaneously with 15O positron emission tomography (PET), cordance values in&#xD;
      the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) were found to be positively correlated with cortical&#xD;
      perfusion, and this correlation was stronger than that between perfusion and either absolute&#xD;
      or relative theta power (Leuchter et al., 1999). The correlation of cordance with regional&#xD;
      cortical perfusion provides a physiologic context in which to interpret this measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of depressed subjects receiving open-label treatment, we previously have shown&#xD;
      that cordance detects changes in prefrontal activity (using a within-subjects design) as&#xD;
      early as after three days of treatment in patients who will later show clinical response to&#xD;
      antidepressant medication. Subjects who did not respond to antidepressant medication, as well&#xD;
      as those receiving placebo, did not show these early changes in cordance (Leuchter et al&#xD;
      1997; Cook et al 1998; Cook et al., in submission). These data suggest that QEEG cordance may&#xD;
      be a more specific indicator of antidepressant treatment effectiveness than traditional QEEG&#xD;
      power measures, since antidepressant non-responders and placebo treated subjects showed no&#xD;
      early change in this measure. It is important, however, to determine if the effects that we&#xD;
      have observed in depressed subjects during treatment are specific for this population, or are&#xD;
      seen in normal controls as well. First, examination of specificity in normal controls during&#xD;
      treatment is a logical first step in the process of examining other groups, eventually&#xD;
      including other patient groups. Second, examination of normal subjects will help us to&#xD;
      determine whether the observed changes in brain function are a pharmacodynamic effect of&#xD;
      antidepressant medication which could be seen in any individual, or an effect seen&#xD;
      exclusively in depressed subjects early in the course of effective antidepressant treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Matching capsules containing either venlafaxine 37.5 mg. or placebo will be prepared by the UCLA Pharmacy for the initial phase of the study. For the open-label phase of the study, subjects will receive the medication and dosage that is clinically indicated by the subject's primary physician in the community. After a one-week placebo lead-in, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one capsule of either venlafaxine or placebo, with the dosage increase every two days until subjects receive four capsules daily (subjects will achieve a dose 150 mg. of venlafaxine after 7 days). The first dose will be administered in the morning, with subsequent capsules added on a b.i.d. schedule.</description>
