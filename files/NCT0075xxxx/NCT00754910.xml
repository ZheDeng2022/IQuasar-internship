      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a&#xD;
      certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. This may be&#xD;
      effective against non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium&#xD;
      works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer and bronchial disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that the immune response in non-small cell lung cancer patients&#xD;
           treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) is T cell mediated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that PDT potentially affects survival rates in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that T lymphocytes mediate an immune response that affects&#xD;
           survival in PDT treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients deemed suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) are offered PDT. Patients&#xD;
      are divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they receive PDT. All patients are&#xD;
      referred to radiation and medical oncology for standard of care adjuvant therapy (beginning&#xD;
      after completion of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (PDT): Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 3-5 minutes and undergo&#xD;
           irradiation with red light 48 hours later. Patients receive 2 more treatments at 2-day&#xD;
           intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (non-PDT): Patients undergo a baseline bronchoscopy and a repeat bronchoscopy at&#xD;
           4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tumor tissue are collected after each&#xD;
      treatment (group 1) or at time of each bronchoscopy (group 2) and assayed for the presence of&#xD;
      lymphocyte phenotypes Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17. After completion of study therapy, patients&#xD;
      are followed at 1 month after PDT and then every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>The immune response that is established will be statistically correlated with the survival rate measured at 6 months and 1 year. This will allow us to discern if a higher survival rate is associated with a specific immune response.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, of any stage, with&#xD;
             obstructive or hemorrhagic endobronchial disease receiving PDT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have undergone PDT, chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 3&#xD;
             months will not be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking antioxidant therapy will be excluded from enrollment due to potential&#xD;
             interaction with the potential oxidative mechanism of action of PhotofrinÂ®. These&#xD;
             antioxidants would include beta-carotene, lutein, Lycopene, Selenium, Vitamin A,&#xD;
             Vitamin C, Vitamin E.&#xD;
