      The purpose of this study it to evaluate the safety and immune response of peptides (URLC10)&#xD;
      emulsified with Montanide ISA51 in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      URLC10 have been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in non small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. In a prior&#xD;
      study, it has been shown that URLC10 are upregulated in human esophageal tumors. The&#xD;
      investigators identified that peptides derived from these proteins significantly induce the&#xD;
      effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro. According to these findings, in this trial,&#xD;
      we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of URLC10 peptide. Patients will&#xD;
      be vaccinated once in one week to the eighth vaccine and will be vaccinated once in two weeks&#xD;
      from the ninth vaccine. On each vaccination day, the URLC10 peptide (1mg) mixed with&#xD;
      Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by endodermic injection&#xD;
