      This study will examine the long-term outcome of brain injuries, the effects of treatment on&#xD;
      outcome and the effects of brain injury on people s behavior and abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between 18 and 75 years of age who served in combat in the Iraq war may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. It will compare test results in those who sustained a traumatic&#xD;
      penetrating or blast-related brain injury during combat with those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures over a 5-day period of testing that lasts about&#xD;
      6 hours a day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test for genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI or CT scans of the brain to look at the structure and blood flow of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor blood flow in the front part of&#xD;
           the brain blood by measuring changes in near-infrared light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing, including questionnaires, pen-and-paper or computerized&#xD;
           tests, and performance of simple actions to measure brain function, language, memory and&#xD;
           other cognitive abilities..&#xD;

      The Warfighter Head Injury Study (WHIS) is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research study&#xD;
      of head-injured warfighters to be conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland. The goals of the WHIS include providing clinicians and scientists with&#xD;
      new insights into the short term recovery of function following traumatic brain injury (TBI),&#xD;
      the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive and social functions, and to identify&#xD;
      better predictors of short term outcome (including cognitive, neurological, and genetic&#xD;
      factors). With the assistance of the Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VA/VHA), we propose to contact all Iraqi-Afghan (IA) warfighters with&#xD;
      penetrating head injury (PHI), a cohort of blast injured warfighters, and a group of matched&#xD;
      (for time in service, combat exposure, age, gender, and preinjury Armed Services Vocational&#xD;
      Aptitude Battery [ASVAB] scores) healthy warfighter controls as well as healthy volunteers&#xD;
      with different blast exposures (i.e.: explosives experts, artillery operators, etc ) but no&#xD;
      documentation of brain injury. We will inquire about their willingness to participate in a&#xD;
      comprehensive, multidisciplinary outpatient evaluation conducted at the NIH. In addition to&#xD;
      IA warfighters, we also plan to enroll Vietnam warfighters who were included in the W. F.&#xD;
      Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study (VHIS) Registry, in order to conduct detailed comparisons&#xD;
      between groups. These cohorts represent a unique opportunity for study; they were healthy and&#xD;
      employed before injury, preinjury intelligence testing is available, and the VA/VHA permits&#xD;
      long-term follow-up. We have previously investigated Vietnam warfighters with PHI and the&#xD;
      published results of those studies have changed the management and evaluation of head-injured&#xD;
      warfighters, and contributed to knowledge of brain function and the long-term effects of head&#xD;
      injury. Furthermore, based on the knowledge acquired in our previous research with Vietnam&#xD;
      warfighters and our current interests in the functions of the human PFC, cognitive&#xD;
      neuroplasticity in the young brain, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic&#xD;
      epilepsy (PTE), caregiver stress, and genetic-plasticity relationships, we are proposing a&#xD;
      series of new cognitive neuroscience experiments and battery of standardized&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing to be conducted during the WHIS. In this effort, the experimental&#xD;
      testing will be complemented with structural imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or&#xD;
      computed tomography [CT]), diffusion tensor and perfusion imaging, electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and molecular genetics evaluations. This&#xD;
      combination of unique patients, cutting edge cognitive neuroscience experiments and state of&#xD;
      the art techniques will lead to new scientific knowledge and improved clinical management of&#xD;
      warfighters with TBI.&#xD;

&#xD;
        TBI PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will study up to 320 head-injured IA warfighters (200 PHI and 120 blast injuries), most&#xD;
        of whom have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),&#xD;
        and up to 500 who have been included in the VHIS Registry. PHI makes up about 20% of the&#xD;
        total TBI from OIF and OEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will ask all WHIS patients to travel to the NIH with their primary caregiver to serve as&#xD;
        their Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) (see Section X for more information on the DPA);&#xD;
        Caregivers will be asked to complete questionnaires and will execute a separate consent&#xD;
        (see Caregiver Consent Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of active duty military personnel is not essential to this study and can be&#xD;
        completed without them, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both sexes will be included, however we expect the cohort to be overwhelmingly (&gt;90%)&#xD;
             male,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range18-75;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 6 months post-head injury; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those patients who have previously participated in the VHIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Any medical condition that, in the judgment of investigators, would make participation&#xD;
        detrimental to the patient (e.g.: severe clinical depression, unstable heart disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will recruit 50 of the VHIS controls, 200 healthy IA warfighter control subjects, with&#xD;
        no history of neurologic or serious psychiatric disorder or any other medical condition&#xD;
        that would pose a risk from participation (e.g., unstable heart disease) and 120 healthy&#xD;
        volunteers with different exposures but no documentation of brain injury. An example of&#xD;
        this latter group would include someone who might be employed as a teacher of the proper&#xD;
        use of explosive devices (i.e. a trainer from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms)&#xD;
        and functions well in that position except for an occasional complaint. We will recruit up&#xD;
        to a total of 370 normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will ask all WHIS controls to travel to the NIH with a companion, some one deemed close&#xD;
        to them in terms of relationship (i.e.spouse, child, etc.), to serve as control&#xD;
        participants for the caregivers of warfighters. Companions will be asked to complete&#xD;
        questionnaires and will execute a separate consent (see Caregiver/Companion Consent Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control subjects will be healthy IA warfighter volunteers who are matched to&#xD;
             head-injured IA warfighters for time in service, combat exposure, age, gender and&#xD;
             preinjury ASVAB scores. All IA warfighter control participants must provide copies of&#xD;
             their ASVAB induction testing scores, if applicable; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have had different blast exposures (e.g., explosives expert) but no&#xD;
             documentation of brain injury; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those warfighter controls who have previously participated in the VHIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological or psychiatric conditions as mentioned above;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug abuse; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to travel independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CAREGIVERS/COMPANIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will enroll caregivers and companions (i.e.: family members, domestic partners, etc.) of&#xD;
        WHIS Warfighter participants in order to learn more about the potential burden and related&#xD;
        issues experienced by this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provides care to a Warfighter or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chosen by a control participant as a close companion; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their Warfighter provides informed consent and agrees to participate in the WHIS&#xD;
             project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No working knowledge of the English language.&#xD;
