  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine whether or not inhalation of hypertonic saline&#xD;
      will be tolerated by infants with cystic fibrosis and the effect of inhalation on their lung&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis lung disease is characterized by mucous retention which favors secondary&#xD;
      bacterial infection and inflammation, which leads to lung damage and ultimately respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Classically, therapeutic interventions are aimed to improve mucociliary clearance,&#xD;
      to reduce both bacterial load and lower airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertonic saline (HS) has been used for the induction of sputum production in all age groups&#xD;
      to obtain secretions from the lower respiratory for diagnostic purposes. Hypertonic saline is&#xD;
      also used in older children with CF, who do not produce sputum spontaneously, to obtain&#xD;
      representative samples for microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence from studies in patients with cystic fibrosis that HS can improve&#xD;
      mucociliary clearance. The improvement was more impressive in areas that were well&#xD;
      ventilated, making it likely that HS will work better in patients with relatively preserved&#xD;
      pulmonary function. Newer evidence also suggests that the osmotic effect on the airway&#xD;
      surface that was expected to be short lived, may actually persist for longer time periods (up&#xD;
      to 8 hours). All these data indicate that HS may be a useful agent in the treatment of CF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the effect on mucociliary clearance was found to be better in areas with adequate&#xD;
      ventilation, it is logical to assume that treatment with HS may be most efficacious when&#xD;
      initiated early in the disease process. So far, no data on the tolerability of inhalation of&#xD;
      HS are available for infants with cystic fibrosis. However, evidence from infants with AIDS&#xD;
      as well as recent studies in infants with bronchiolitis suggest that hypertonic saline can be&#xD;
      safely administered by inhalation in infants. Nevertheless, proof of tolerability in CF&#xD;
      infants is a prerequisite for longer term studies of HS in this age group. In older children,&#xD;
      tolerability has been tested by measuring pulmonary function both before and after inhalation&#xD;
      of HS saline. Similar data are not yet available for infants.&#xD;
