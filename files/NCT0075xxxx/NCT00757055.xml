      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the medicine ivabradine, a novel drug&#xD;
      which slows the heart rate has a favourable effect on patients with diastolic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine is a specific heart rate-lowering agent. It has a licence for treating patients&#xD;
      with angina who are intolerant of agents such as beta blockers or whose angina is not&#xD;
      adequately controlled. It has been shown to prolong exercise tolerance in these patients and&#xD;
      to reduce the frequency of chest pain. Its mechanism of action is felt to be purely due to&#xD;
      reducing heart rate, by as much as 10 beats per minute at rest, as well as by reducing the&#xD;
      heart rate response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diastolic heart failure often complain of breathlessness on exertion which&#xD;
      relates to the stiffness or lack of compliance of their heart i.e. the heart fails to relax&#xD;
      rapidly enough to allow it to fill with blood between each heart beat. This may result in&#xD;
      high pressure in the heart chamber which backs up in to the lungs and may be experienced as&#xD;
      breathlessness. There is little evidence that any specific therapy benefits patients with&#xD;
      this type of heart failure besides treating coexisting problems such as high blood pressure&#xD;
      or angina. By slowing the heart rate down with ivabradine, the heart would have a longer time&#xD;
      to fill during exercise which would make it more effective. This slowing of the heart rate&#xD;
      may therefore relieve the breathlessness experienced on activity such as walking to the shops&#xD;
      or up a flight of stairs etc.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost half of all patients with heart failure (HF) have preserved systolic function (PSHF)&#xD;
      or heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). Some of these have valvular&#xD;
      abnormalities such as severe mitral or aortic regurgitation, severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis&#xD;
      or rarer tropical causes for heart failure. However, the majority of those with PSHF often&#xD;
      have echocardiographic evidence of impaired diastolic function i.e. impaired relaxation and&#xD;
      increased stiffness. This diastolic dysfunction may be related to age, hypertension or&#xD;
      ischaemia. There is little evidence for any effective therapy in this large HF population&#xD;
      despite randomised trials comparing placebo to ACE inhibitors i.e. perindopril in PEP-HF or&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers i.e. candesartan in the CHARM Preserved trial. There are also&#xD;
      ongoing studies of aldosterone antagonists in diastolic heart failure i.e. eplerenone vs&#xD;
      placebo in TOPCAT which continues to recruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of a strong evidence base, many physicians treat these patients with drugs&#xD;
      that slow the heart rate, namely the calcium channel blocker verapamil and beta blockers.&#xD;
      This has the effect of prolonging diastole or filling time and theoretically improving stroke&#xD;
      volume thus reducing left ventricular end diastolic pressures (LVEDP) with resultant drop in&#xD;
      wall stress and therefore less stimulus for myocardial fibrosis which exacerbates diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction by impeding compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative mechanism for slowing the heart rate is with ivabradine, a novel If channel&#xD;
      blocker which acts purely on the sino atrial node with a mean heart rate lowering of 10 bpm&#xD;
      in angina patients. This may result in improved diastolic filling which could be demonstrate&#xD;
      by echocardiography, lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which could be determined by&#xD;
      measuring the E:E' ratio using tissue Doppler techniques, improving effort tolerance,&#xD;
      estimated by assessing change in distance walked over 6 minutes and both a physician&#xD;
      assessment using NYHA score as well as a patient Global Assessment and possibly better&#xD;
      quality of life, determined by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other theoretical improvements could be in the degree of stiffness or fibrosis due to reduced&#xD;
      LV wall stress secondary to the longer filling time. This could be assessed using surrogates&#xD;
      of wall strain such as brain natruretic peptide (BNP), wall stress as measured by strain rate&#xD;
      imaging on echocardiography.&#xD;
