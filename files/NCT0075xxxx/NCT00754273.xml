      Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second-most common nosocomial infection in hospitals&#xD;
      and the most common in the intensive care unit1. Mortality for HAP exceeds 20%2. Although&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation is the greatest risk factor and increases the risk of dying from HAP,&#xD;
      the organisms responsible for causing pneumonia in a given ICU are the same regardless of&#xD;
      whether patients are intubated3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus has become the leading pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia (HAP) and is responsible for about 20% of cases4. Staphylococcus aureus may be&#xD;
      either sensitive or resistant to oxacillin/methicillin. Oxacillin resistance rates are&#xD;
      increasing nationwide and the average rate of resistance to oxacillin currently exceeds 52%&#xD;
      nationwide5. While these &quot;MRSA&quot; isolates at UK represent only 47% of all staph aureus&#xD;
      isolates, rates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may approach 80% in&#xD;
      some institutions (unpublished observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence or absence of risk factors for MRSA determines whether or not MRSA drug therapy is&#xD;
      used7. If a patient is thought to have pneumonia and they possess risk factors for MRSA, then&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy active against MRSA will be used empirically and &quot;de-escalated&quot; if&#xD;
      objective culture data does not demonstrate MRSA. Empiric or culture-based therapy for MRSA&#xD;
      HAP includes one of the following: 1) the glycopeptide vancomycin or 2) the oxazoladinone&#xD;
      linezolid (Zyvox®). Antimicrobials with activity against MRSA but who do not currently have&#xD;
      licensed indication for use in HAP include: 3) the glycylcycline, tigecycline (Tygacil®) and&#xD;
      4) the streptogramin, quinupristin-dalfopristin (Synercid®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vancomycin is the primary antimicrobial choice for MRSA HAP worldwide. Vancomycin is&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive in per-dose pricing, generally effective and has a favorable safety&#xD;
      profile. However, staph aureus isolates which are incompletely sensitive or even resistant to&#xD;
      vancomycin have been reported8. These vancomycin-intermediately sensitive staph aureus (VISA)&#xD;
      and vancomycin-resistant staph aureus (VRSA) isolates are rare but increasing in prevalence9.&#xD;
      Since the first report of VISA in the United States in 1999, other reports have documented&#xD;
      the existence of staph aureus isolates with incomplete sensitivity to vancomycin, termed as&#xD;
      vancomycin &quot;heteroresistance&quot;9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate sensitive staph aureus (hetero-VISA, hVISA, hGISA)&#xD;
      isolates are those in which the prevalent colonies are vancomycin susceptible but in which&#xD;
      some of the isolates demonstrate phenotypes which are intermediate or resistant to&#xD;
      vancomycin9. Hetero-VISA has been proposed as an etiology for vancomycin treatment failure in&#xD;
      some patients. These hetero-VISA isolates may exhibit vancomycin-susceptibility when analyzed&#xD;
      by automated testing because automated systems are incapable of identifying rare hetero-VISA&#xD;
      colony forming units (CFU's) within single large inoculums10. Without plating and more&#xD;
      detailed testing, the true incidence of hetero-VISA isolates may be underestimated. No large&#xD;
      direct comparison of automated and non-automated MRSA isolate sensitivities to vancomycin has&#xD;
      been reported. This investigation seeks to determine the prevalence of hetero-VISA in sputum&#xD;
      isolates of MRSA in a major tertiary referral center and define the sensitivity of automated&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy improves outcome in patients with pneumonia11-13.&#xD;
      Conversely, inadequate empiric therapy worsens outcome compared to adequate therapy.&#xD;
      Clinicians should therefore seek to deliver adequate empiric antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and not wait until definitive cultures are obtained14. This&#xD;
      type of antibiotic approach which starts broad and then reduces therapy based upon objective&#xD;
      culture data is termed &quot;de-escalation&quot; therapy. De-escalation has led to reduced antibiotic&#xD;
      duration, less antibiotic administered, fewer occurrences of second pneumonias, and less&#xD;
      mortality15. The goal of pneumonia therapy is to start adequately and to narrow objectively&#xD;
      and as soon as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since adequate empiric therapy determines outcome, it is imperative that clinicians treating&#xD;
      patients at risk for MRSA with antimicrobials certain to eradicate MRSA. Traditional therapy&#xD;
      was almost exclusively the glycopeptide vancomycin but emerging evidence suggests that in&#xD;
      some cases vancomycin is not as effective as other available drugs. New antimicrobials have&#xD;
      emerged which may exhibit superior efficacy against MRSA. In 2004, Marin Kollef et al&#xD;
      reported improved clinical cure and survival in patients with MRSA ventilator-associated&#xD;
      pneumonia (VAP) who were treated with linezolid compared to those treated with vancomycin&#xD;
      (survival odds ratio 4.6 for linezolid vs vancomycin)16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the prevalence of MRSA among all Staph aureus isolates is increasing, in vitro evidence&#xD;
      of growing resistance of MRSA isolates to vancomycin is also increasing. In vitro&#xD;
      susceptibility testing for any organism and antimicrobial is expressed as minimal inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration (MIC). MIC is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that will inhibit&#xD;
      growth of an organism. That is, the higher the MIC for a given antimicrobial and organism,&#xD;
      the greater concentration of drug required to produce killing. Vancomycin MIC's for MRSA are&#xD;
      rising, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;MIC creep&quot;18. Wang et al reported mean vancomycin MIC's&#xD;
      for MRSA at UCLA to be ≤ 0.5ug/ml in 2000 and 1mg/dl in 2004 and the prevalence of isolates&#xD;
      with MIC=1ug/ml to be 70% in 2004 vs 20% in 2000. MIC's for a given isolate in a given&#xD;
      patient may change over time as well. Webster et al reported a MRSA isolate with an MIC&#xD;
      changing from ≤ 1 to 4ug/ml over several months, demonstrating the ability of MRSA to acquire&#xD;
      or alter its resistance patterns19. S. aureus isolates for which vancomycin MICs are 2-8&#xD;
      μg/mL are classified as vancomycin-intermediate, and isolates for which vancomycin MICs are&#xD;
      ≥16 μg/mL are classified as vancomycin-resistant by the Centers for Disease Control20.&#xD;
      Clinical outcome with vancomycin therapy now appears to correlate inversely with MIC's above&#xD;
      0.5ug/ml, so that as MIC's increase, clinical outcome worsens, suggesting that although MIC's&#xD;
      ≤ 2ug/ml are technically reported as &quot;Susceptible&quot;, the clinical efficacy of vancomycin may&#xD;
      vary between isolates with MIC's of 0.5ug/ml and isolates with MIC's of 1 or 2ug/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A confounding factor in the determination of MIC's for vancomycin or other antimicrobials is&#xD;
      the variability with which MIC's are measured. MIC's may be obtained by automated equipment&#xD;
      or by direct visual assessment of killing by antimicrobial disks or strips on a culture&#xD;
      plate. Automated equipment historically does not report specific vancomycin MIC's below or&#xD;
      equal to 2ug/ml. The limitation with such equipment is that as vancomycin MIC's for MRSA have&#xD;
      crept upward over time, we now have automated equipment that reports all MRSA isolates with&#xD;
      vancomycin MIC's ≤ 2 as susceptible-with no distinction of whether the MIC is 0.5, 1 or&#xD;
      2ug/ml. Automated equipment generally reports MIC's in doubling of antimicrobial&#xD;
      concentration. Furthermore, while the majority of the sample may contain isolates with&#xD;
      vancomycin MIC's in the susceptible range, we now know that susceptibility may vary within a&#xD;
      given sample. Some solitary organisms or colony-forming units (CFU's) may demonstrate a&#xD;
      phenotype in which vancomycin MIC's are higher than the majority of the sample but their&#xD;
      numbers are so small as to be unrecognized. This variability in MRSA resistance to vancomycin&#xD;
      is termed heteroresistance and heteroresistance may contribute to treatment failure.&#xD;
      Moreover, ideal methods to detect and address vancomycin heteroresistance in S. aureus&#xD;
      (hVISA) in every institution or laboratory have yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to automated testing is the use of E-test strips (AB Biodisk). E-tests are&#xD;
      strips with increasing concentration of the particular antimicrobial agent from one pole to&#xD;
      another which when applied to a plate of bacterial isolates produces a tear-drop shaped area&#xD;
      of killing, with greater killing toward the end with the greater concentration (Figure).&#xD;
      Though more cumbersome and expensive than automated testing, an accurate assessment of the&#xD;
      presence or absence of heteroresistance and the more precise determination of MIC's are&#xD;
      possible with E-tests compared to automated testing. Determination of prevalence of MRSA&#xD;
      heteroresistance to vancomycin and relationship between E-test and automated vancomycin MIC's&#xD;
      for MRSA are primary objectives of this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When combined with clinical cure data above, this in vitro evidence strongly questions the&#xD;
      prudence of using vancomycin as the empiric antimicrobial agent in patients known to be at&#xD;
      risk for MRSA, who may be critically ill with VAP and for whom a wealth of studies establish&#xD;
      that failure to adequately treat empirically increases mortality. Determining the prevalence&#xD;
      of MRSA isolates with marginal susceptibility to vancomycin or heteroresistance is the&#xD;
      primary aim of this investigation. An accurate measure of MIC reproducibility between&#xD;
      techniques and the current prevalence of MIC's which are only marginally susceptible will&#xD;
      allow our institution and the medical community to determine the most appropriate role for&#xD;
      vancomycin in the empiric antimicrobial regimen for patients thought to have VAP who are at&#xD;
      risk for MRSA.&#xD;
