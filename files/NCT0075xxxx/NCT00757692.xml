      Purpose To define the efficacy, tolerability and safety of Vandetanib in combination with&#xD;
      bicalutamide in patients with chemotherapy naive hormone refractory prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis There will be a PSA response when Vandetanib is given in combination with&#xD;
      Bicalutamide in Chemotherapy Naive Hormone refractory prostate cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of PSA surveillance, many patients diagnosed with hormone refractory disease,&#xD;
      have PSA rising disease only, are asymptomatic, with no evidence of metastatic disease. There&#xD;
      is no standard of care in this patient population. A standard treatment in this population&#xD;
      has been the addition of a non-steroidal anti androgen such as bicalutamide. PSA response&#xD;
      rate (defined as a 50% decrease) have been reported in 20% range with bicalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and metastases that have no&#xD;
      cancer related symptoms, initiation of chemotherapy is controversial given the palliative&#xD;
      nature of chemotherapy and potential for serious toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are generally well enough to to undergo trials of novel agents and achieve&#xD;
      adequate drug exposure, such that any cytostatic effect will be apparent.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have biochemically recurrent disease or metastatic disease that is&#xD;
             asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (total daily morphine dose &lt; 30mg.day) for which&#xD;
             no curative therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documented evidence od PSA progression while receiving androgen&#xD;
             ablative therapy (i.e. must be hormone refractory). Progression is defined as the&#xD;
             development of new metastatic lesions, or rising PSA defined as at least two rises in&#xD;
             PSA at least 1 week apart. If the second PSA is not rising, a thrid PSA is required to&#xD;
             show further increase; if not, a subsequent level must show further increase. The&#xD;
             third (or subsequent) PSA confirming progression must be within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The PSA must be =&gt; 2ug/L at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age =&gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No Prior chemotherapy is permissible for hormone refractory disease. Chemotherapy may&#xD;
             have been received in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting provided it was given 12&#xD;
             months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior hormone therapy in the form of either medical or surgical castration is&#xD;
                  required. If the patient is receiving medical androgen abalation a castrate level&#xD;
                  of testosterone (1.7nmol/L) must be present. Therapy with LHRH agonist must&#xD;
                  continue for those prostate cancer patients already receiving this treatment at&#xD;
                  the time of registration. If the patients has discontinued the LHRH agonist, this&#xD;
                  must be restarted and a castrate level of testosterone must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior use of nonsteroidal antiandrogens (including bicalutamide) is permitted but&#xD;
                  must have been discontinued 6 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 4 weeks has elapsed&#xD;
             between the last dose and registration in the trial. Exceptions will be made for&#xD;
             limited field, single fraction palliative radiation to bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent treatment with steriods unless steriods have been ingested for 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to commencing study at a dose of less than or equal to an equivalent of&#xD;
             prednisone 20mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent experimental trial medication is permitted. No prior use of VEGF/VEGFR&#xD;

          -  Laboratory Requirements- within 7 calendar days prior to registration Hematology:&#xD;
             haemoglobin &gt;= 100g/L neutrophils &gt;=1.5 x 10(9)/L Platelets &gt;=100 x 10(9)/L INR =&lt;1.5&#xD;
             x upper limit of normal Biochemistry: AST, ALT = &lt;1.5 x upperlimit of normal Bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QTc (Bazett's) &lt;480msec determined by the average of a least 3 consecutive&#xD;
             electrocardiograms (ECG) taken within 5-10 mins of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local institutional and/or University&#xD;
             Research and Ethic Board (REB) requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 7 calendar days of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancy, except:adequately treated non&#xD;
             melanoma skin cancer or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomemingeal disease are excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of nerologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions and/or sensitivity attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biological composition to Vandetanib or other agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other serious intercurrent illness or medical condition that might be aggravated by&#xD;
             protocol treatment including;myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry, congestive heart failure, unstable angina,cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias,OTc (Bazett's) &gt;480msec Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;160, diatolic&#xD;

             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with Marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination ant-retroviral therapy are excluded from study because of possible risk of&#xD;
             lethal infection and additionally because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with Vandetanib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require escalating amounts of narcotic therapy to control pain e.g.&#xD;
             morphine equivalent dose &gt;30mg/day) since these patients would more appropriately be&#xD;
             offered systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require the following medication:concomittant use of warfarin, Class 1A&#xD;
             antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) Class&#xD;
&#xD;
             1C antiarrhythmics (e.g.,flecainide, propafenone), Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g.,&#xD;
             amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide), antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine, chlorpromazine,&#xD;
             pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol), tri/tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g.,&#xD;
             amitriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline), ketoconazole, antiepileptics and macrolide&#xD;
             antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot stop ingestion of grapefruit/juice.&#xD;
