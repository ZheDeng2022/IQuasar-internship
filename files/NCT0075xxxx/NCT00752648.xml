      The objectives are: to compare the oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      TMC435350 for 2 different solid formulations to those of TMC435350 formulated as a powder&#xD;
      blend in a capsule, after a single oral dose of 200 mg in healthy volunteers; to determine&#xD;
      the short term safety and tolerability of TMC435350 after a single oral dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      formulated in capsules with 2 different formulations and as a tablet in healthy volunteers&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, open-label, 3-way crossover trial in 12 healthy adult volunteers to&#xD;
      compare the oral bioavailability of a single 200 mg intake of TMC435350 salt, formulated as 2&#xD;
      different solid formulations (a tablet and a capsule) to that of a single 200 mg intake of&#xD;
      TMC435350 salt, formulated as a powder blend in a capsule. TMC435350 is a protease inhibitor&#xD;
      in development for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. During 3 sessions,&#xD;
      each volunteer will receive 3 treatments according to a classical 6-sequence, 3-period&#xD;
      Williams design.The treatments administered are: Treatment A: single dose of 200 mg TMC435350&#xD;
      salt, formulated as a powder blend filled in a capsule. Treatment B: single dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      TMC435350 salt, formulated in a tablet. Treatment C: single dose of 200 mg. MC435350 salt,&#xD;
      formulated in beads filled in a capsule. All medication intakes will be oral and under fed&#xD;
      conditions. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between medication intakes in&#xD;
      subsequent treatment sessions. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC435350 will be determined&#xD;
      up to 72 hours after administration in each session. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously throughout the trial. Treatments A, B and C: TMC435350 200mg on Day 1&#xD;
      of each session.Intakes will be oral and in fed conditions.&#xD;
