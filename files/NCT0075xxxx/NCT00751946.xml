      This study will compare treatment outcomes of 90 adolescent girls who are (a) at high risk&#xD;
      for delinquency and/or are juvenile justice involved, and (b) who are experiencing symptoms&#xD;
      of PTSD: 45 of the girls will receive Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and&#xD;
      Therapy (TARGET, Frisman, Ford, Lin, Mallon, &amp; Chang, in press), and their outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared to 45 girls who receive Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU). As part of their&#xD;
      involvement, participants will make phone calls to provide data via an interactive voice&#xD;
      response system (IVR), meet 3 times for a research interview, and be invited to participate&#xD;
      in a cognitive assessment substudy at the Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center at Hartford&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

      Hypotheses, Objectives and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the GIRLS study is to provide counseling to adolescent girls who are (a) at&#xD;
      high risk for delinquency and/or are juvenile justice involved and (b) are experiencing&#xD;
      symptoms of PTSD, in order to help them regulate their emotions, planning, decision-making,&#xD;
      and actions/ interactions in ways that will reduce PTSD and enhance their safety, responsible&#xD;
      civic involvement, learning, peer, family, and adult relationships, and physical and&#xD;
      psychological well-being. The study will be the first randomized clinical trial of a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)with girls: 1)&#xD;
      Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET; Frisman, Ford, Lin,&#xD;
      Mallon, &amp; Chang, in press), compared to Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU). Both&#xD;
      interventions will provide 12 one-to-one manualized, educational and therapeutic sessions&#xD;
      that teach coping skills and stress reduction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) To test if participation in TARGET results in clinically and statistically significant&#xD;
      improvements in PTSD symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and emotion/impulse regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) To compare the differential affects of TARGET and ETAU on affect regulation, social&#xD;
      support, stress-related information processing and cognitive coping, and the reduction of&#xD;
      impulsive or aggressive thinking/behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) To identify changes in daily self-regulation after TARGET and ETAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethnically diverse sample of girls at high risk for delinquency and/or with current or&#xD;
      past juvenile justice-involvement between 13 and 17 years of age will be recruited in clinic,&#xD;
      community, detention, schools, and residential programs. After screening for eligibility and&#xD;
      obtaining valid signed consent forms, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      two experimental conditions. Within each condition, trained clinicians will administer 12&#xD;
      sessions of individualized counseling using a manual for the intervention. Psychometric&#xD;
      self-report and daily monitoring measures will be obtained at baseline, post-treatment, and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up assessments and multivariate statistical techniques will be used for&#xD;
      analysis of treatment effects.&#xD;

    <description>Trauma Affect Regulation: Guidelines for Education and Therapy (TARGET; Ford &amp; Russo, 2006) is a manualized gender-specific treatment for PTSD. The 12-session individual therapy version in the present study is being adapted for adolescent girls based on a parallel version for young mothers and a group version that has been field tested with more than 20 adolescent girls.&#xD;
TARGET teaches a practical 7-step sequence of skills for processing and managing trauma-related reactions to current stressful experiences. The skills are designed in a sequence mirroring the three phases of complex traumatic stress disorder treatment (Ford, Courtois, Van der Hart, Nijenhuis &amp; Steele, 2005), summarized by an acronym &quot;FREEDOM&quot;. TARGET also uses creative arts activities: personalized &quot;lifelines&quot; via collage, drawing, poetry, and writing.</description>

    <intervention_name>Enhanced Treatment As Usual</intervention_name>
    <description>Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU) is a 12-session supportive therapy adapted from the Present Centered Therapy co-developed by the first author (McDonagh-Coyle, Friedman, McHugo, Ford, Mueser, &amp; Sengupta, 2005). In ETAU therapists invite the participant to talk about goals or problems that are important to her. The therapist's focus is on providing the core conditions of client centered psychotherapy (nonjudgmental acceptance, empathy, interpersonal warmth) and engaging the participant in a strengths-based solution-focused reflection on how she is successful (or has been in the past) in managing stressors, handling problems, achieving personal goals, and developing healthy relationships with peers, family, and other community members.</description>
