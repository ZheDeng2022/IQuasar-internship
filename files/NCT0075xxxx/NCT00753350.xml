      This will be an open label, single-center, feasibility study comprised of two sequential&#xD;
      cohorts( cohort 1: 2 participants; cohort 2: 8 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in generally healthy participants aged 25 to 55 years with&#xD;
      non-morbid obesity and a pre-screening body mass index between 35 and 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo screening to determine their health status and their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Eligible patients will undergo an endoscopic device delivery&#xD;
      procedure during which the device will be anchored in the inner stomach wall at the distal&#xD;
      anterior antrum. Physical examination and/or endoscopic safety evaluations will be conducted&#xD;
      on day 14 and 28. The device and its anchor will be completely removed endoscopically after 8&#xD;
      weeks. The participants will be followed-up for safety evaluation for an additional period of&#xD;
      2 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Effective and safe methods are required to achieve substantial and long-lasting weight-loss&#xD;
      with minimal and preferably no impact on the non-morbid obese individuals' pre-procedure&#xD;
      lifestyle. The current available treatments for obesity in general and non-morbid obesity in&#xD;
      particular, are, for the most part, ineffective in the long run and are associated with&#xD;
      material adverse events and potentially lethal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensate™, is an endoscopically-delivered, inner-stomach-wall-anchored, low-profile device&#xD;
      (practically the exact size and shape of the famous Given Imaging PillCam™ swallowable&#xD;
      device), which is advantageous in comparison to both open and minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      methods for treating obesity. The reason for that is because of the simple endoscopic&#xD;
      delivery, inner-antrum-wall-anchoring and removal procedures are safe, minimally-invasive,&#xD;
      requiring minimal participant sedation (not deep anesthesia), not requiring unique&#xD;
      gastroenterologist skills, and can be done in an outpatient clinic setting just like in the&#xD;
      hospital setting. Moreover, Sensate™ is designed to modestly reduce food consumption&#xD;
      concurrently with the generation of greater satiety, and thus maintain balanced and healthier&#xD;
      weight loss over a long period of time without mandating complementary radical lifestyle&#xD;
      changes and nutritional changes which have been proven to be very hard and impractical on the&#xD;
      obese individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first study in humans, and it is focused on examining and validating&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Sensate™ in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sensate™ study is comprised of two sequential cohorts of generally healthy patients with&#xD;
      non-morbid obesity, with two participants in the first cohort and eight subjects in the&#xD;
      second cohort. The first cohort is starting with just 2 subjects, in order to validate the&#xD;
      absolute safety of the device and its delivery before additional subjects are being&#xD;
      recruited. The sample size is the minimal one required to collect safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy data. Participants will undergo screening to determine their health&#xD;
      status and their eligibility to participate in the study. Screening examinations include&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, vital signs, weight measurement and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments. Eligible patients will undergo an endoscopic device delivery procedure during&#xD;
      which the device will be anchored in the inner stomach wall at the distal anterior antrum.&#xD;
      Patients will be requested to complete a detail daily diary based on visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) to record their eating sensations during and after each meal throughout the study.&#xD;
      Physical examination, recording of adverse events and weight measurements will be conducted&#xD;
      on day 14 and 28. In addition, phone calls are made every week during the study period to ask&#xD;
      the patient about any health alterations. Endoscopic safety evaluation to validate that the&#xD;
      device is anchored properly with no safety issues will be performed on Days 14 and 28 in the&#xD;
      first two subjects and at day 28 for the remaining eight subjects. The device and its anchor&#xD;
      will be completely removed endoscopically after 8 weeks. The participants will be followed-up&#xD;
      for safety evaluation for an additional period of 2 weeks. Safety evaluations include&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs, adverse events and laboratory assessments.&#xD;
