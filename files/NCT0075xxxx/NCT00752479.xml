      This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and biological/mechanistic effect of the&#xD;
      systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs in living-related kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG&#xD;
      induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test&#xD;
      the feasibility of safely achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional&#xD;
      tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for&#xD;
      FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC&#xD;
      infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will assess at different time up to 12 months post transplant. In addition the safety&#xD;
      profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and&#xD;
      biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients&#xD;
      will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at&#xD;
      the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the&#xD;
      cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be&#xD;
      performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the&#xD;
      development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy&#xD;
      study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included&#xD;
      and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive&#xD;
      patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated&#xD;
      according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation the immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically improved&#xD;
      the life of transplant recipients over the past 30 years, but two notable problems&#xD;
      remain:drug-associated toxicities, and failure of these drugs to prevent chronic graft&#xD;
      dysfunction and extend long-term graft survival. Given these circumstances, the scientific&#xD;
      discussion is dominated by designing effective ways to induce transplantation tolerance.&#xD;
      'Transplantation tolerance' describes a state in which a donor is 'accepted' without chronic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy, while the remainder of the immune system is left intact. Thus,&#xD;
      lack of a pathogenic response to the alloantigen is specific, and the recipient is capable of&#xD;
      responding to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and malignancies. There is abundant&#xD;
      evidence for active immunoregulatory mechanisms, which may operate to maintain transplant&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problems of immunosuppressive drug toxicity could be alleviated by induction of immune&#xD;
      tolerance.Over the last 25 years, several strategies have been used successfully to induce&#xD;
      transplantation tolerance. Each of these has been validated in at least one rodent model,&#xD;
      with varying degrees of success upon extension to large animals, including nonhuman primates.&#xD;
      Very small minorities of patients, who discontinue their immunosuppression, provide rare&#xD;
      examples of clinical transplantation tolerance. To this purpose, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#xD;
      infusion could represent a novel tolerogenic cell therapy in kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human bone marrow stem cells, more recently referred to as MSCs, are multipotential cells&#xD;
      that reside within the bone marrow and can differentiate into various components of the&#xD;
      marrow microenvironment, in addition to supporting growth of hematopoietic progenitors.There&#xD;
      is also evidence that MSCs escape the immune system, and therefore could be infused into an&#xD;
      allogeneic host without being rejected and without requirement of conditioning regimens.&#xD;
      Moreover, they exert an immunoregulatory activity, although the exact mechanism of action is&#xD;
      unknown. On this line, evidence is available that MSC inhibit naïve T cells and lock&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC) into a semi-mature state, thereby favoring peripheral tolerance. It&#xD;
      should be also pointed out that experimental in vitro evidence has shown that mouse MSCs&#xD;
      inhibit the response of memory antigen-specific T cells to their cognate peptide. We expect&#xD;
      that, in kidney transplant recipients, MSC infusion would allow inhibition of&#xD;
      alloantigen-specific memory T cell response contributing to long-term graft survival.&#xD;
      Moreover in vitro studies have documented that the CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population&#xD;
      increased significantly in MLR when human MSCs were present compared to controls without&#xD;
      MSCs. These findings suggest that MSC may modulate T cell response even through a regulatory&#xD;
      mechanism. Furthermore an immunosuppressive effect of MSCs in vivo has been shown in a baboon&#xD;
      model, in which infusion of ex-vivo expanded matched donor or third-party MSCs delayed the&#xD;
      time to rejection of histoincompatible skin graft. The immunomodulatory function of MSCs has&#xD;
      been also documented in preliminary in vivo studies in humans, where cell infusion did exert&#xD;
      preventive effects on the development of acute and chronic GVHD. Thus, although no data so&#xD;
      far are available in human kidney transplantation, we expect that peri-transplant intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs under peripheral T-cell depletion/blockade with&#xD;
      basiliximab and low dose RATG (as induction therapy) and the cover of low dose maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs would allow to safety achieving graft tolerance in living-related&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients. This could be through inhibition of both naïve and memory T&#xD;
      cells, and promotion of development and activation of regulatory T cells, eventually leading&#xD;
      to indefinite graft survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now there is no clinical study that MSC infusion has an immunomodulatory effect in&#xD;
      patients undergoing kidney transplant. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the present study is to test a cell therapy with syngeneic ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded MSC as a strategy to induce tolerance in living-related kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. MSC will be prepared accordingly to established protocols, starting from bone&#xD;
      marrow explants of living-related recipients obtained 3-4 months before kidney transplant.&#xD;
      From these samples, MSC will be expanded in vitro and used for the present study in patients&#xD;
      undergoing kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND STUDY DESIGN This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and&#xD;
      biological/mechanistic effect of the systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo&#xD;
      expanded MSCs in living-related kidney transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype&#xD;
      mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test the feasibility of safely&#xD;
      achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study. Indeed, to complement the&#xD;
      research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study&#xD;
      of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of&#xD;
      biological/mechanistic tests will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an&#xD;
      immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional&#xD;
      tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for&#xD;
      FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC&#xD;
      infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, at different time up to 12 months post transplant, the plan is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effect of the treatment on absolute and percent count of circulating CD4+,&#xD;
           CD8+ T cells (and the CD4/CD8 ratio), B cells and NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine whether changes in circulating naïve and memory T cell count may occur&#xD;
           (CD45RA/CD45RO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the emergence in the circulation of T cell subpopulations with&#xD;
           immunoregulatory phenotype (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+; CD8+CD28-, CD3-CD56bright).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphocyte functional assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To detect whether donor-specific hyporesponsiveness develops post-operatively by&#xD;
           monitoring T cell activation in response to alloantigen stimulation by mixed lymphocyte&#xD;
           reaction (MLR), by ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma and by cell-mediated lympholysis (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether T cell deletion/anergy develops by repeating T cell stimulation in&#xD;
           MLR and in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the presence of high doses of IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To monitor the regulatory properties of T cells circulating in the peripheral blood by&#xD;
           in vitro proliferative assay, in particular of CD4+CD25high, CD8+CD28- T cells, and&#xD;
           CD56bright NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary FOXP3 messenger RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      a)To evaluate whether measurement in urinary cells of mRNA level for FoxP3, a functional&#xD;
      factor for regulatory T lymphocytes, may provide insight into the immunologic events within&#xD;
      the renal allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the&#xD;
      development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy&#xD;
      study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow. The criteria to document the development of a&#xD;
      pro-tolerogenic microenvironment (at 12 months post-kidney transplant) are the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of inhibition of memory T cell response (by IFN-gamma ELISPOT) and/or naïve T&#xD;
           cell response (by MLR) versus donor antigens higher than 15-20% in patients receiving&#xD;
           peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive&#xD;
           therapy alone, in the context of normal immune responses versus third party antigens,&#xD;
           mitogens (PHA) and recall antigens (mumps, pertussis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of donor-reactive T cell anergy in a percentage higher than 15-20% in patients&#xD;
           receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to those given the immunosuppressive&#xD;
           therapy alone (evaluated by addition of high dose IL-2 in ELISPOT assay) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appearance in the peripheral blood of regulatory T cells in a percentage higher than 80%&#xD;
           in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the&#xD;
           immunosuppressive therapy alone and reversal of the inhibition of donor-specific immune&#xD;
           response (evaluated by depletion of specific regulatory cells in ELISPOT and/or MLR&#xD;
           assays) in a percentage higher than 50% in MSC-treated as compared with non MSC-treated&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC&#xD;
      infusion at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls),&#xD;
      both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be&#xD;
      performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the&#xD;
      study. This will be when the patients fulfill all the criteria to enter the waiting list for&#xD;
      kidney transplant from living donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first patient will receive a single i.v infusion of syngeneic MSC (2x106 MSCs per&#xD;
      kilogram body weight). If the procedure is safe and no major adverse events related to the&#xD;
      i.v cell infusion will occur within the first month (early peri-infusion side effects, severe&#xD;
      infections possibly due to over-immunosuppression), the second patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Should the procedure be safe also in this case, the third kidney transplant patient will be&#xD;
      enrolled and undergo syngeneic MSC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complement this research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a&#xD;
      pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of&#xD;
      maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of&#xD;
      biological/mechanistic tests (at 12 months post-transplant) will document that MSC infusion&#xD;
      allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, as higher&#xD;
      inhibition of donor specific memory T cells and/or higher generation of alloantigen-specific&#xD;
      regulatory T cells than the drug immunosuppressive treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included&#xD;
      and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive&#xD;
      patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated&#xD;
      according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.&#xD;
