    <textblock>
      The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation have been clearly demonstrated. In particular exercise&#xD;
      training is recognized to be part of modern management after coronary artery disease. However&#xD;
      methods of prescribing exercise-training programs and the exercise intensity are difficult to&#xD;
      determine. The objective of this randomised clinical trial is to determine whether&#xD;
      appropriate endurance exercise training improves the ventilatory threshold, the exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and the quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to continuous training or aerobic interval training respectively: 80%-versus&#xD;
      maximal-workload at the ventilatory threshold. For each patient, the intensity of exercise&#xD;
      training is determined by a first exercise test with gas analysis using parameters of sub&#xD;
      maximal exercise capacity such as ventilatory threshold. Others parameters of functional&#xD;
      capacity are also considered. Duration of the rehabilitation stage is between 7 to 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Dyspnoea assessment at maximal intensity, quality of life measurement by SF36, drugs and&#xD;
      events are reported. Maximal exercise tests with gas exchange measurements are performed&#xD;
      after training program and at 6 months follow-up to compare the different cardio respiratory&#xD;
      parameters in the two groups before and after exercise training and to evaluate the more&#xD;
      effective endurance training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  Outline of the training program: Duration of the rehabilitation course is 7 or 10 weeks,&#xD;
           2 or 3 training sessions a week, 21 sessions altogether. Each training session consist&#xD;
           in cycling on an ergometer. In the interval training group, the training session&#xD;
           alternates one minute at 100% workload at the ventilatory threshold and one minute&#xD;
           active pause at 50% workload at the ventilatory threshold; total exercise time is 20&#xD;
           minutes. In continuous training, the training session lasts 20 minutes at 80% workload&#xD;
           at the ventilatory threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise testing: Exercise capacity is measured before and at the end of the exercise&#xD;
           training program and at 6 month follow-up. A first exercise test with respiratory gas&#xD;
           exchange is performed 2 weeks after hospitalization: this is the baseline exercise test.&#xD;
           The protocol consists of 3-min warm up at a workload of 30 watts. At each stage, the&#xD;
           workload is increased by 10 or 15 watts per min. Patients are instructed to maintain a&#xD;
           speed of 55 to 65 rotations per min. Four exercise tests with gas analysis are&#xD;
           programmed during cardiac rehabilitation: three maximal tests (before exercise training&#xD;
           program to precise exercise intensity during the sessions, after training program to&#xD;
           evaluate the primary end point and at 6 months) and one sub maximal exercise test during&#xD;
           the tenth session to adjust the intensity of training exercises (this test is stopped&#xD;
           when the ventilatory threshold is obtained).&#xD;
