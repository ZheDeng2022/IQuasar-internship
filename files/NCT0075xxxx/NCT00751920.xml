    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to apply the techniques of dynamic MRI imaging enhancement to&#xD;
      research participants with one or more pulmonary nodule to determine if meaningful&#xD;
      information about the nature of the nodule can be obtained. This data will then be compared&#xD;
      with follow up information about nodule growth or histology obtained by biopsy or surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The gold standard for investigating the detection of pulmonary metastases is Multi-Detector&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (MDCT). Computed Tomography (CT) is routinely used in the staging of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with primary tumors which commonly metastasize to the lungs (with&#xD;
      approximate percentage incidence of pulmonary metastases at presentation) are Ewing's sarcoma&#xD;
      (15-20%), osteosarcoma (15-20%), Wilm's Tumor (10%), rhabdomyosarcoma (10%), and&#xD;
      hepatoblastoma (10%). However, CT scanning has two central limitations. Firstly, it carries&#xD;
      associated radiation risks. This risk is increased if multiple scans need to be performed&#xD;
      during treatment and follow up. This is of particular concern in children who frequently have&#xD;
      curable disease and may have years to live with the radiation risk. Secondly, CT is limited&#xD;
      in its ability to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lung has been shown to be a feasible&#xD;
      alternative to CT for the detection of pulmonary metastases in adults with sensitivities and&#xD;
      specificities of over 90% for the detection of nodules 5mm or larger. It has also shown&#xD;
      promise in the characterization of nodules as benign or malignant. Since MRI does not involve&#xD;
      radiation, it may prove to be a preferable imaging technique for children. We wish to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential for MRI to complement or even replace CT in the imaging of pulmonary&#xD;
      metastatic disease in children.&#xD;
