    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is treatment of choice for inoperable lung cancer. Research has shown that the&#xD;
      local control rate is low and the radiation often causes pneumonitis and/or esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To predict to lung damage the mean lung dose can be calculated. This allows us to give a&#xD;
      higher total dose to the tumor and to improve the local control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: It will be safe to administer a radiation dose as high as possible to the&#xD;
      tumor, taking into account the mean lung dose, calculated by the treatment planning system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is treatment of choice for inoperable lung cancer. Research has shown that the&#xD;
      survival rate as well as the local control rate is low. If chemotherapy treatment is added it&#xD;
      leads to a slightly better outcome. The radiotherapy treatment often causes pneumonitis&#xD;
      and/or esophagitis. So damage to the normal tissue restricts the radiation dose that can be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several studies have shown that higher doses lead to better local control.&#xD;
      Furthermore it is evident that the radiotherapy treatment should be given in a short time,&#xD;
      preferably the treatment time should not exceed 32 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid a higher toxicity the normal tissue has to be spared, but to increase the local&#xD;
      control rate the tumor dose must be as high as possible. This dilemma can only be solved by&#xD;
      using very sophisticated treatment planning techniques in combination with a biologically&#xD;
      superior treatment schedule. This schedule consists of delivering radiation dose twice a day&#xD;
      instead of once, thus keeping the overall treatment time as low as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the whole patient population, the mean lung dose can to a great extend predict the&#xD;
      probability for developing radiation pneumonitis and the post-radiotherapy lung function. A&#xD;
      logical next step is to determine the dose of radiotherapy on an individualised calculation&#xD;
      of the maximum tolerated dose, being defined as the mean lung dose and the spinal cord dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to investigate whether individualised radiation dose&#xD;
      calculation based on a mean lung dose and the constraints of the spinal cord, in combination&#xD;
      with an overall treatment time of less than 32 days, and only irradiating the primary tumor&#xD;
      and the PET scan positive mediastinal areas is safe.&#xD;
