  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is 2-5 times more common in schizophrenia and it is a preventable; but the current&#xD;
      diabetes prevention guidelines are not suitable for implementation in the severely mentally&#xD;
      ill population. The principles of diabetes prevention are essentially dietary regulation,&#xD;
      increased physical activity and adjunctive use of oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin). In a&#xD;
      modified diabetes prevention protocol suitable for use in mentally ill population, we&#xD;
      packaged the original guide lines with an adventure and recreation program based on&#xD;
      principles of experiential learning, cognitive restructuring and behaviour modification. In&#xD;
      this proposed study, we plan to evaluate the feasibility of adopting the new protocol, and&#xD;
      examine its effectiveness in preventing diabetes.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From large international RCT studies, Type 2 Diabetes can be prevented / delayed for&#xD;
           overweight, pre-diabetic individuals by making basic lifestyle changes (regular moderate&#xD;
           exercise, healthy eating habits) and using metformin or other insulin resistance&#xD;
           inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with schizophrenia are in particular need of preventative intervention and&#xD;
           conventional approaches do not match their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research has not examined how to facilitate lifestyle changes in the lives of&#xD;
           individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We need to…&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and evaluate innovative diabetes prevention strategies tailored to meet the&#xD;
           needs of individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research how to make it work for pre-diabetic individuals being treated for&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the novel intervention will be tested using a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. A multi-factorial design enables a 2 x 2 analysis of the&#xD;
      independent effects of three interventions - a tailored lifestyle modification program,&#xD;
      metformin, and the standard conventional intervention. There is no anticipated interaction&#xD;
      effect between metformin and lifestyle interventions. Clients currently treated for&#xD;
      schizophrenia at a community outpatient clinic will be screened for diabetes, and those who&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria, and give written consent, following a three week run-in&#xD;
      period, will be randomized to one of four groups to receive either: the experimental&#xD;
      intervention with placebo, the experimental intervention with metformin or the conventional&#xD;
      intervention with placebo or conventional intervention with metformin.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. People who are at least 18 years old, diagnosed as having schizophrenia, confirmed&#xD;
             through a structured clinical interview (SCID-P) for DSM IV, treated with&#xD;
             antipsychotic drugs at least for 2 years and deemed clinically stable. Clinical&#xD;
             stability is operationally defined as absence of a relapse warranting hospitalization&#xD;
             in the preceding six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. People who are deemed as &quot;pre-diabetics&quot; in accordance with the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
             established by the American Diabetic Association (ADA, 2004) as following: impaired&#xD;
             fasting glucose (IFG) indicating fasting plasma glucose ranging between 100-125 mg/dl&#xD;
             or 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/l.; and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) indicating 2-h post-load&#xD;
             glucose ranging between 140-199 mg/dl or 7.8 - 11.0 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. People who have gained &gt; 10% body weight since??? Or body mass index &gt; 24 kg/m²,&#xD;
             except Asian decent at 22 kg/m² or greater??&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Competent to provide informed consent to voluntarily participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. People who meet the criteria for diabetes, (i.e., repeat fasting blood glucose (FBG)&#xD;
             &gt;7 mmol/l or, 2 hr. post-load glucose &gt;11.1 mmol. as determined by a 2 hr. glucose&#xD;
             tolerance test (GTT)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. People with evidence of clinically significant liver disease, renal or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal impairments, as suggested by clinical history and liver and kidney&#xD;
             functions tests. Any impairment deemed clinically significant would be a relative&#xD;
             contra-indication for the use of metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women in the child bearing age, who are not willing to use contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. People with other comorbid disorders such as clinically significant heart or lung&#xD;
             disease that may prevent participation in various physical activities or disorders of&#xD;
             glucose metabolism (e.g., Cushing's Syndrome, Acromegaly, and chronic pancreatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. People with treatments that would interfere with participation or completion of the&#xD;
             protocol (e.g., in shared care and planning to be discharged shortly from the clinic),&#xD;
             or having a confounding effect on the measurement of the primary outcomes of the study&#xD;
             (prescription weight loss drugs, lipid lowering agents?)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. People with weight loss &gt;10% in past 6 months&#xD;
