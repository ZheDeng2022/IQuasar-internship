  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of a melanoma vaccine. Study participants will have melanoma that invaded&#xD;
      deeply and spread to lymph nodes or another location. Although the participants' melanoma has&#xD;
      been removed, there is a greater than 1 out of 2 chance it will return. There will be&#xD;
      approximately 40 subjects in this study. The patients will have already taken part in a&#xD;
      melanoma vaccine study, and in this current study, they will continue to receive booster&#xD;
      injections of a similar vaccine given for two additional years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test an experimental vaccine. The vaccine contains peptides which are&#xD;
      fragments of substances made by most melanomas. The substances are tyrosinase, gpl00 and&#xD;
      melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1). The vaccine also includes an assistant&#xD;
      called Montanide ISA 51. The assistant stimulates the immune system. This study will also&#xD;
      test the effects of a second assistant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF). All participants will receive the vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51, but only&#xD;
      half will receive the assistant GM-CSF. The patients have a one in two chance of receiving&#xD;
      the assistant called GM-CSF. The main purpose of this study is to find out if the booster&#xD;
      injections increase the body's immunity to melanoma and prevent its level of immunity from&#xD;
      getting lower over time. The investigators also wish to know if the GM-CSF increases the&#xD;
      body's immunity to melanoma when given with the melanoma vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51 are not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). The assistant GM-CSF is approved by the FDA to increase&#xD;
      infection-fighting white blood cells after chemotherapy. It is not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of melanoma. However, the FDA is permitting the vaccine and the assistants to be&#xD;
      tested in this study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have completed protocol 10M-01-1 or 10M-00-4 are eligible for this study&#xD;
             provided that:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. They have received all injections with evidence of an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. They have not experienced recurrence of the melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Not more than twelve months have elapsed since the final injection on either&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. They experienced no grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to the prior vaccine&#xD;
                  regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less, total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dl or less and&#xD;
             SGOT/SGPT of 2.5 X institutional norm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total whte blood cell (WBC) of 3,000 or more with at least 1500 granulocytes,&#xD;
             hemoglobin of 9.0 gm/dl or more, and platelet count of 100,000 per cu mm or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for this trial if they have failed alpha-interferon, if it&#xD;
             is felt to be contraindicated due to a pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition&#xD;
             or if they have refused treatment with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to read, understand and willingness to sign an institutional review board&#xD;
             (IRB)-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had another malignancy but with no evidence of disease for greater&#xD;
             than 5 years from accrual to the current trial will be eligible if it is felt they are&#xD;
             likely to be cured. Patients with squamous or basal carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the cervix that have been treated with curative intent can be accrued to&#xD;
             this trial 30 days after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone any other systemic therapy for their melanoma, including&#xD;
             radiation therapy since completion of 10M-01-1 or 10M-00-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have major systemic infections like pneumonia or sepsis, coagulation or bleeding&#xD;
             disorders, or other major medical illnesses of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or&#xD;
             respiratory systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Require systemic, ocular or inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating, since the risk of autoimmune reactivity to tyrosinase, MART-1&#xD;
             or gp100 is felt to present a risk to the fetus or a breast feeding infant. Effective&#xD;
             birth control for men and women is required during and for four months after the study&#xD;
             is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be positive for hepatitis BsAg, hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody. Since&#xD;
             cells removed for ex vivo handling and tissue culture cannot be virus positive, and&#xD;
             the effects of melanoma peptides might be detrimental to HIV positive patients,&#xD;
             patients positive for the above viruses will not be treated in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a known allergic reaction to GM-CSF, Montanide ISA 51 (IFA) or any of the&#xD;
             peptides included in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a prior history of uveitis or autoimmune inflammatory eye disease, immune&#xD;
             hemolytic anemia or other active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
