  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators are researching the effects of the cholesterol&#xD;
      absorption inhibitor ezetimibe on postprandial lipemia and postprandial endothelial function&#xD;
      in patients with the metabolic syndrome. The lipid-lowering effect of high-dose statin&#xD;
      monotherapy on fasting lipids is equal to the combination therapy of low-dose statin and&#xD;
      ezetimibe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients at high risk for future cardiovascular events, more intensive LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      lowering with high doses statin therapy provides greater protection against death or major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events than does a standard regimen. Intensive LDL cholesterol lowering can be&#xD;
      achieved by high dose statin treatment or with combination therapy of lower doses statin and&#xD;
      ezetimibe. However, it is unclear whether this combination therapy results in the same or&#xD;
      more beneficial effects on cardiovascular prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several vascular risk factors (as abdominal obesity,&#xD;
      high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting glucose). The&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is still not fully clarified, but insulin resistance seems to be a&#xD;
      main characteristic of this syndrome. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome are at increased&#xD;
      risk for the development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and type II diabetes. The&#xD;
      prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high in patients with clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      vascular diseases and is associated with more vascular damage in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance is linked to endothelial dysfunction and decreased nitric oxide&#xD;
      bioavailability by several mechanisms including, inflammation (as reflected by elevated high&#xD;
      sensitive C Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) plasma levels), disruption of insulin receptor&#xD;
      signalling cascades, increased production of cytokines and activation of the renin&#xD;
      angiotensin system. However, other studies do not support an association between insulin&#xD;
      resistance and endothelial function, so this mechanism seems controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postprandial state, insulin resistance is associated with hyperlipidemia. Postprandial&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia may be an important determinant of endothelial dysfunction as well. Remnants&#xD;
      of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein metabolism impair endothelial dependent&#xD;
      vasodilatation. In line with the hypothesis that endothelial function can be used as a&#xD;
      surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular morbidity, therapeutic modulation of (postprandial)&#xD;
      endothelial function may potentially contribute to prevention of cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      patients with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statin therapy modulates (postprandial) endothelial function but it is not known whether this&#xD;
      is an indirect effect of lipid-lowering or a direct vascular effect of statins influencing&#xD;
      the stability and bioavailability of NOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS In the present study we propose to investigate the effects of the cholesterol absorption&#xD;
      inhibitor ezetimibe on postprandial lipemia and (postprandial) endothelial function in&#xD;
      patients with the metabolic syndrome. High-dose statin monotherapy has the same&#xD;
      lipid-lowering effect (on fasting lipids) as the combination therapy of low dose statin and&#xD;
      ezetimibe. The latter may reduce postprandial lipemia more effectively and may therefore have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on postprandial endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe is unlikely to have a direct vascular effect and therefore any observed change in&#xD;
      vascular function is due to a change in postprandial lipemia. As secondary objective of the&#xD;
      study, this enables us to differentiate between direct and indirect effects of statin therapy&#xD;
      on postprandial endothelial function comparing modulation of postprandial endothelial&#xD;
      function by monotherapy simvastatin with combination therapy of simvastatin and ezetimibe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis With comparable reduction in fasting plasma lipids, combination therapy of&#xD;
      low-dose statin and ezetimibe reduces postprandial lipemia better than high-dose statin&#xD;
      monotherapy. This leads to better postprandial endothelial function in patients with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effects of combination therapy of low-dose statin and ezetimibe on&#xD;
           postprandial hyperlipidemia compared to high-dose statin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of combination therapy of low-dose statin and ezetimibe on&#xD;
           postprandial endothelial (dys-)function compared to high-dose statin monotherapy.&#xD;
