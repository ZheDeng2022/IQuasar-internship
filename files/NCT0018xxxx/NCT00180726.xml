  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms whereby lung function is decreased in&#xD;
      asthma and sensitivity to treatment. The hypothesis is that in diseases such as asthma,&#xD;
      inflammatory cells (leukocytes) including eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes migrate to&#xD;
      the lung and release either more or different types of inflammatory mediators and/or&#xD;
      receptors compared to subjects without asthma, which are corticoid sensitive or insensitive.&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to identify which genes are specifically expressed in important&#xD;
      cells in patients with asthma with a view to identify novel targets for drug therapy.&#xD;

      We aim to investigate these separate cell types in the blood of subjects with asthma and&#xD;
      identify which genes are more highly expressed when compared to cells obtained from patients&#xD;
      without asthma. We will investigate corticosteroid sensitivity on gene expression in asthma&#xD;
      (corticoid naive to corticosteroid resistant asthma). We will also investigate the lung cells&#xD;
      (macrophages) from these subjects to identify whether the same or different genes are&#xD;
      expressed in these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will isolate different leukocyte populations from the blood and extract ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) from these samples. The type and quantity of RNA in these samples is a reflection of&#xD;
      the specific genes expressed in these cells. Gene expression is also evaluated by ELISA.This&#xD;
      RNA will be sent to Gene Logic in the USA and this company will test these samples to&#xD;
      identify which genes have been expressed using Gene Arrays. This technique will examine the&#xD;
      expression of all 33,000 human genes in each sample to examine activation of interacting&#xD;
      pathways rather than individual genes at a time. Samples will be analysed in the USA and&#xD;
      preliminary data shows that there are no problems involving sample transportation or&#xD;
      degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar experiments will be performed using cells (macrophages) obtained following&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage of these subjects. We would aim to examine the responses of cells from&#xD;
      two groups of subjects, namely (i) non-asthmatics controls and (ii) asthmatic subjects. The&#xD;
      isolated cells will either be immediately solubilized in solutions to purify RNA or we will&#xD;
      then use these isolated cells in vitro and following stimulation investigate whether&#xD;
      different genes are expressed or at a differential rate in the disease state. We will examine&#xD;
      both cells derived from peripheral blood and cells (macrophages) obtained from&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage with the aim to determine whether differences attributable to disease&#xD;
      can be identified in both circulating cells and those at the site of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a preliminary study to determine the profile of inflammatory mediator expression from&#xD;
      leukocytes and as such power calculations to determine the number of subjects is not&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to identify which genes are specifically expressed in important&#xD;
      cells in patients with asthma with a view to identify novel targets for drug therapy.&#xD;
