  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-acetylcysteine is a medication that has most commonly been used in the past to prevent&#xD;
      liver damage after an acetaminophen overdose. N-acetylcysteine has also been used in patients&#xD;
      with pre-existing kidney damage to prevent further kidney damage resulting from dye that is&#xD;
      used in tests such as angiograms (dye studies). This study hopes to prove that this&#xD;
      medication may also help to protect kidneys from the damage caused by the heart-lung machine&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery. This damage to the kidneys happens to patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery requiring the use of the heart-lung machine. Kidney failure after surgery is a&#xD;
      serious complication (2-30% of patients with kidney problems can develop it) and it can lead&#xD;
      to short term and long-term dialysis as well as death (there is up to a 30% death rate once&#xD;
      kidney failure develops). The study will test if intravenous N-acetylcysteine is safe and&#xD;
      effective in preventing kidney problems after cardiac surgery using the heart-lung machine.&#xD;
      Approximately 104 patients will be enrolled at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science&#xD;
      Centre. The study has been reviewed and approved by the ethics committee at Sunnybrook and&#xD;
      Women's College Health Science Centre. The study will compare the effects of N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
      with those of placebo (salt solution). The study medication (either N-acetylcysteine or&#xD;
      placebo) will be given in addition to your usual medication and surgical procedures.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an oral or intravenous agent that replenishes glutathione which in&#xD;
      turn allows for the formation of glutathione peroxidase, an important enzyme in the&#xD;
      degradation cascade of reactive free oxygen radicals. NAC has been shown to reduce recurrent&#xD;
      cardiac events in the setting of ischemic injury, and help prevent progression of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with chronic renal failure exposed to nephrotoxic dye for&#xD;
      radiographic studies. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been shown be nephrotoxic that may be&#xD;
      through the production of oxygen free radicals produced as a consequence of: a systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response to the pump, renal hypoperfusion and loss of pulsatile flow to the&#xD;
      kidney during CPB. Renal dysfunction post cardiac surgery can lead to short or long term&#xD;
      dialysis, and an increase in mortality rate. NAC therefore may be an ideal agent to preserve&#xD;
      renal function in those patients who require exposure to CPB and are at high risk of&#xD;
      developing postoperative renal dysfunction. The hypothesis tested in this study is that IV&#xD;
      NAC may minimize postoperative renal dysfunction sustained by exposure to the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer the question of whether perioperative intravenous N-Acetylcysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) will be effective in reducing postoperative renal dysfunction as measured by a change&#xD;
      peak creatinine from baseline values greater than or equal to 50μmol/L between placebo and&#xD;
      NAC groups in adult, elective patients at high risk of renal insufficiency following exposure&#xD;
      to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind&#xD;
      trial that addresses the following objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To determine if intravenous N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective in reducing post&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that IV NAC will provide renal protection and may be an effective&#xD;
      prophylactic option for patients at high risk of postoperative renal failure after exposure&#xD;
      to CPB, and avoiding the ensuing high mortality rate associated with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a single centre, randomized, stratified, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial of intraoperative use of placebo or IV N-acetylcysteine (n=104 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Includes those patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level 140&#xD;
      μmol/L or greater or a calculated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or less), or a risk&#xD;
      factor score for postoperative renal dysfunction that adds up to 6 or more based on the&#xD;
      following scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Risk Factor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 scheduled for redo cardiac surgery 3 scheduled for valve surgery 2 age greater than 69 at&#xD;
      time of surgery 2 known diabetic (Type I or II) 2 congestive heart failure 2 treated&#xD;
      hypertension 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2 preoperative stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 left ventricular function -grade 3 or 4 (seen on echo or angiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is participating in another trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has received NAC in the past 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has allergy to N-acetylcysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient scheduled for off-pump surgery or an extracardiac procedure (pericardiectomy&#xD;
           etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient requires emergent surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient scheduled for a procedure involving circulatory arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient requires chronic dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient unable to give informed consent (dementia, does not speak English, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has a recent history of cancer (in last five years) or untreated cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either placebo or IV NAC (one to one allocation). There will&#xD;
      be four strata. The four strata consist of the major divisions of isolated CABG surgery and&#xD;
      valve surgery and the subdivisions of risk factor only patients, and patients with&#xD;
      preoperative renal insufficiency. The patients will be randomized to each of these three&#xD;
      strata using a permuted-block randomization with block sizes of 4. The randomization number&#xD;
      will be kept by pharmacy personnel and be available for unblinding in case of any emergencies&#xD;
      which would include anaphylaxis, hypotension (mean bp less than 60 mmHg), and liver failure.&#xD;
      Blinding will be preserved as the IV NAC and placebo will be dispensed in identical IV&#xD;
      solution bags that cannot be distinguished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either NAC (150 mg/kg bolus over 15 minutes after&#xD;
      induction and 50 mg/kg/hr infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo (same amount of&#xD;
      saline both for bolus and infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also have provided standard guidelines suggested in the perioperative management of these&#xD;
      patients as it pertains to renal protection including the use of co-interventions such as IV&#xD;
      fluid management, pulsatile CPB, and use of vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion&#xD;
      pressures both during and following CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and caregivers will be blinded to the treatment group as the placebo will be&#xD;
      identical to the IV NAC in appearance. The research personnel collecting data will also be&#xD;
      blinded. The pharmacy personnel will be the only ones aware of the treatment assignments.&#xD;
      Blinding will not be breached except for emergency situations as outlined above. The cardiac&#xD;
      surgeon and anesthetist will be asked if they believe their patient is on study drug to&#xD;
      ensure blinding has been preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to Treat:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include those patients who do not tolerate NAC and do not receive the full NAC&#xD;
      dosage because of adverse events in an intention to treat manner. These patients who have not&#xD;
      have the full maneuver will therefore be included in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome that will be compared between NAC and placebo groups will be the increase&#xD;
      in serum creatinine from preoperative baseline level after exposure to CPB. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include glomerular filtration rate (as calculated by serum creatinine, and&#xD;
      demographic variables as well as serum cystatin C), blood urea nitrogen, early dialysis&#xD;
      (in-hospital), in-hospital mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), peak&#xD;
      troponin, stroke, and postoperative low output syndrome. Adverse events such as hypotension,&#xD;
      anaphylaxis and alteration of coagulation parameters will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implication of Potential Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study shows renal protection with IV NAC it could be used as an effective&#xD;
      prophylactic option for patients at high risk of postoperative renal failure and the ensuing&#xD;
      high mortality rate associated with this.&#xD;
