  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Croup is an illness of young children that is caused by a virus. With this illness, the child&#xD;
      has fever, cough, and hoarseness. Although the illness usually gets better in 2 to 4 days,&#xD;
      some children may be admitted to the hospital and a few infants may require an intervention&#xD;
      to help their breathing. This illness is most often caused by a virus called parainfluenza&#xD;
      virus type 1, but it can be caused by other viruses. The experimental vaccine that is being&#xD;
      investigated in this study is intended to try to prevent croup caused by parainfluenza virus&#xD;
      type 1. Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent this virus, or medications available to&#xD;
      treat the illness once infection has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is testing a new experimental live-virus vaccine that is given by placing&#xD;
      liquid drops in the nose. The Sendai virus is very similar to the virus that causes croup,&#xD;
      but it has never been found to cause illness in people. Previous studies in animals have&#xD;
      shown that the vaccine provided protection against the croup virus, and did not cause&#xD;
      illness. Many people have been exposed to the Sendai virus, but no one has been known to&#xD;
      develop illness. Several healthy adults have been given the Sendai virus vaccine being&#xD;
      studied, and they did not experience any serious side effects or illness.&#xD;

      The main aim of the study is to assess the tolerance and safety of escalating doses of&#xD;
      intranasal Sendai virus in children and toddlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the magnitude and duration of the immune&#xD;
      response elicited by intranasal Sendai virus. Responses between seropositive and seronegative&#xD;
      children will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also tests the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination at the highest&#xD;
      dose tolerated during primary immunization dose-escalation.&#xD;
