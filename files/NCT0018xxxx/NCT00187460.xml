      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EFFECT Study is one of the largest and most comprehensive initiatives in the world to&#xD;
      measure and improve the quality of cardiac care. A randomized trial of cardiac care report&#xD;
      cards, the study's objective is to determine whether developing and publishing report cards&#xD;
      based on clinical data collected from patient charts leads to greater use of evidence-based&#xD;
      therapy at hospitals that receive them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-phase study focuses on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure (CHF) and involves 85 hospital corporations (consisting of 103 acute care hospitals)&#xD;
      in Ontario. As part of the study design, the hospitals were randomized into two groups: Group&#xD;
      A-Early feedback hospitals (44 hospital corporations/53 hospitals) and Group B-Delayed&#xD;
      feedback hospitals (41 hospital corporations/50 hospitals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I A retrospective chart review of hospitalizations from 1999/00 and 2000/01 was&#xD;
      conducted in the participating Ontario hospital corporations. Findings from Phase I were&#xD;
      documented in two reports:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report 1. Report Cards on Group A-Early Feedback Hospitals, released January 2004;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report 2. Report Cards on Group B-Delayed Feedback Hospitals, to be released September&#xD;
           2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to demographic and treatment information, study data also focus on two sets of&#xD;
      quality indicators-one for AMI care and one for CHF care. Canadian Cardiovascular Outcomes&#xD;
      Research Team (CCORT) investigators, in conjunction with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society&#xD;
      (CCS), formed two expert panels to define Canadian AMI and CHF Quality Indicators. The expert&#xD;
      panels' membership included clinical leaders in cardiology, internal medicine, family&#xD;
      practice, nursing, pharmacy and epidemiology. The indicators are posted on the CCORT web site&#xD;
      (www.ccort.ca) and have been published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology. The study's&#xD;
      Technical Advisory Committee reviewed all of the proposed AMI and CHF quality indicators and&#xD;
      recommended a final list of indicators for inclusion in the EFFECT report cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Report Cards for Group A-Early Feedback Hospitals and Group B-Delayed Feedback&#xD;
      Hospitals based on a second phase of retrospective chart review of 2004/05 hospitalizations.&#xD;
      (Release in 2006/07)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III Final Report-Impact Assessment: A comparison of results/improvement from Phase I to&#xD;
      Phase II. (Release in 2006/07)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of Funding The EFFECT study is being funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Research (CHIR) Interdisciplinary Health Research Team (IHRT) Program and the Heart and&#xD;
      Stroke Foundation of Canada, with in kind support from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative&#xD;
      Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigators The EFFECT study is being led by Dr. Jack V. Tu, MD, PhD, Senior&#xD;
      Scientist, ICES, Canada Research Chair, Health Services Research.&#xD;
