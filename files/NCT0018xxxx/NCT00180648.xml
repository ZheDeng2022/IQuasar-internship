  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the theory that the plasma level of Glucagon like&#xD;
      peptide 2 (GLP-2) in patients with intestinal failure can predict their clinical recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When major segments of small bowel have been removed surgically, or damaged by disease, the&#xD;
      length of the residual bowel may be inadequate to maintain overall nutrition and the net&#xD;
      result is described as &quot;intestinal failure&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without medical intervention, patients with intestinal failure become malnourished and&#xD;
      dehydrated because their remaining intestine is unable to absorb enough water, vitamins and&#xD;
      other nutrients from the ingested food. Intravenous feeding offers life saving treatment but&#xD;
      causes complications like infections and liver problems. It also poses enormous strain on day&#xD;
      to day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is a naturally occurring hormone (or chemical messenger) that&#xD;
      is able to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining (or mucosal mass) and the&#xD;
      absorptive efficiency of the remaining intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal failure patients in whom not only parts of the small bowel but also the large&#xD;
      bowel have had to be surgically removed have been shown to have a markedly impaired rise in&#xD;
      GLP-2 levels following meals, in contrast to patients with a preserved large bowel who have&#xD;
      increased levels of GLP-2 and are known to have much better functional adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this we hypothesise that the GLP-2 level is directly related to, and could predict,&#xD;
      clinical recovery in intestinal failure as measured by Amount of parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      required Length of hospital stay Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also aim to compare GLP-2 levels of patients with acute intestinal failure with that of&#xD;
      patients with chronic intestinal failure as well as healthy controls&#xD;
