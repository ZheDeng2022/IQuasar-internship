      The study is a prospective multi-centre study to investigate the effect of a new bipolar&#xD;
      ablation strategy of the left atrium in patients with paroxysmal or permanent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation over time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrhythmia, prevalent in about 6% of&#xD;
      the population over 65 years of age. AF reduces the quality of life and increases mortality.&#xD;
      AF is particularly common in combination with mitral valve disease, but is also detected in&#xD;
      about 5% of patients with aortic valve and coronary artery disease. Surgical treatment of AF&#xD;
      with the Cox-maze III operation was developed by J. Cox during the 80ies. The aim of the&#xD;
      operation is to block spread of irregular electrical activity by creating lines of isolation&#xD;
      in the atrial musculature. The operation achieves sinus rhythm in over 90% in selected&#xD;
      patients. Nevertheless the method was only used in few heart surgical centres, because it is&#xD;
      complex and time consuming.In recent years alternative energy sources have been developed to&#xD;
      create isolating lines without cutting the tissue and thus making ablation treatment easier.&#xD;
      Bipolar radiofrequency ablation is special because the energy is delivered feedback&#xD;
      controlled until transmurality is achieved. This is a prerequisite for a good result and&#xD;
      makes using the equipment safer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the development of the Cox-maze procedure, our knowledge of atrial fibrillation and its&#xD;
      treatment has increased considerably. There is a consensus that the posterior part of the&#xD;
      left atrium and in particular the pulmonary veins are an important target for treatment.&#xD;
      Surgical ablation with alternative energy sources is a new method under continued development&#xD;
      and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal ablation treatment is unknown. A balance between invasiveness and achieving sinus&#xD;
      rhythm in as many as possible has to be found. Creating numerous ablation lines in both atria&#xD;
      is time consuming and leads probably to an increased need for permanent pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation and reduced contractility of the atrial tissue. On the other hand can a simple&#xD;
      bipolar ablation of pulmonary veins performed easily, but this is probably an insufficient&#xD;
      treatment for most patients. In the protocol a new method using solely bipolar ablation for&#xD;
      creation of several ablation lines in the left atrium is described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective multi-centre study to investigate the effect of a new bipolar&#xD;
      ablation strategy of the left atrium in patients with paroxysmal or permanent AF over time.&#xD;
