  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-year study tested the concept that an intervention, which reduces trauma-related&#xD;
      symptoms among adults who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are&#xD;
      experiencing trauma-related stress symptoms, and engaging in behavior that facilitates HIV&#xD;
      transmission, can reduce the transmission risk of (HIV). Our central premise was that by&#xD;
      first treating trauma symptoms, we would enhance the effects of a skills-building HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction intervention for adults experiencing trauma-related symptoms such as hyperarousal,&#xD;
      dissociation, and avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims were to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if decreasing trauma-related stress symptoms improves HIV risk reduction&#xD;
           behavior above a standard HIV risk reduction intervention alone post-intervention and 3&#xD;
           months after the small group intervention sessions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether key variables moderate the intervention's effects. For instance,&#xD;
           gender, age, ethnicity, or psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) may&#xD;
           interact with the intervention to affect risky sexual or drug-related behavior; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether there is evidence that the theoretical mediator variables, which&#xD;
           include trauma-related stress symptoms, self-efficacy, communication skills, and social&#xD;
           support mediate the intervention's effects on outcomes. This information addresses the&#xD;
           theoretical question of why the intervention works.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no published longitudinal studies examining the impact of traumatic events on risk&#xD;
      behavior among HIV-positive men and women. As a result, we know very little about how stress,&#xD;
      particularly trauma-related stress, influences HIV risk behavior. This study will be one of&#xD;
      the first randomized studies to examine the efficacy of reducing HIV risk behavior by&#xD;
      combining a trauma-focused stress reduction intervention with a standard HIV prevention&#xD;
      skills intervention. This study is specifically targeting a low-income, urban population, a&#xD;
      group that experiences a disproportionate rate of crime as well as HIV infection. Findings of&#xD;
      the research will likely provide information on the relationship between trauma and risk&#xD;
      behavior. Furthermore, this research can identify key issues related to stress, psychosocial&#xD;
      factors, and overall health that will be relevant to investigate in future, larger-scale&#xD;
      studies of HIV-positive as well as HIV-negative populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who reported living with HIV, engaging in HIV risk behavior in the past 3 months,&#xD;
      experiencing a traumatic stressor and trauma-related symptoms in the past 3 months were&#xD;
      assigned to one of three conditions: 1) standard HIV prevention skills; 2) standard HIV&#xD;
      prevention skills + trauma-focused stress reduction skills training; or 3) trauma-focused&#xD;
      stress reduction skills training.&#xD;
