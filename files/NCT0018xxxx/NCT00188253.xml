  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer involves either radiation alone or radiation&#xD;
      plus chemotherapy. Before the start of treatment,patients require an imaging scan to assess&#xD;
      the extent of disease. The most commonly used test is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to examine the value of a new imaging technology that has recently&#xD;
      become available at the University Health Network Hospitals called Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography scanning (PET). PET scanning involves the injecting a small amount of a drug&#xD;
      through a vein in the arm called 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). This drug is special in that&#xD;
      it is radioactive and will be detected by the PET machine. Cancer cells are believed to be&#xD;
      more active than normal cells and have a high rate of metabolism. Therefore, cancer cells are&#xD;
      thought to take up glucose (a kind of sugar) faster than normal cells in the body. Because&#xD;
      18FDG is a modified type of glucose, it is also taken up by cancer cells. Special imaging&#xD;
      cameras will be able to visualize the areas of uptake and reveal sites of cancer involvement.&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate whteher the scan is able to detect the presence of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) both before and after treatment and to specifically compare it&#xD;
      to findings on magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to doing the PET scans, we are asking patients to have blood samples drawn&#xD;
      throughout their treatment and follow-up, for a research test called Epstein Barr virus (EBV)&#xD;
      DNA levels. The Epstein Barr virus is thought to have a role in the development of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancer, and many patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are found to have high&#xD;
      levels of EBV DNA levels in their blood. The second goal of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      changes in EBV DNA levels are associated with the treatment and the disease course in&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancer, and whether they help to predict any changes in the cancer. This part&#xD;
      of the study involves the sampling of a small amount of venous blood at a time prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of therapy and at regular intervals following treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are staged according to the 2002 American Joint&#xD;
           Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for staging&#xD;
           and follow-up of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The goal is to conduct a pilot study to&#xD;
           compare the staging findings on MRI with those on PET scanning in both pre- and&#xD;
           post-therapy patients. The end point is to document the degree of concordance between&#xD;
           the two modalities with respect to the anatomic location and volume of disease at the&#xD;
           time of initial staging and on follow up and to determine how any differences observed&#xD;
           may alter staging and management including radiation planning. We hypothesize that PET&#xD;
           scanning will be able to detect recurrence and residual disease within the radiated&#xD;
           tissue earlier than MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is associated with elevated titers of Epstein Barr virus (EBV)&#xD;
           cell free, plasma DNA. Fluctuation i.e. - elevation in EBV DNA levels following therapy&#xD;
           may serve as a potential marker for recurrent or residual disease. We believe that a&#xD;
           change in EBV DNA titer precedes changes on conventional MRI and possibly PET scans in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent disease. We also predict, that due to its sensitivity, that EBV&#xD;
           titer levels will be more sensitive in the evaluation of tumor response to therapy, as&#xD;
           well predicting tumor recurrence. The second goal is to conduct a trial to compare the&#xD;
           sensitivity of MRI, PET and EBV titers in the assessment of recurrent disease.&#xD;
