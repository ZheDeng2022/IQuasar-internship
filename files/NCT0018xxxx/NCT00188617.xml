      Primary and Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the pathologic and radiological response rate after neoadjuvant Gefitinib&#xD;
                treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the toxicity of neoadjuvant Gefitinib treatment in clinical stage 1A &amp; 1B&#xD;
                NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients may be identified by thoracic&#xD;
      surgeons, respirologists and/or interventional chest radiologists for study participation&#xD;
      upon clinical and radiographic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Diagnostic biopsy, Pretreatment Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have already had a core or FNA biopsy before referral, this material will be&#xD;
      sought from the original pathologist for review and inclusion in the study with appropriate&#xD;
      consent sought. If a patient does not have a biopsy upon presentation to the thoracic&#xD;
      surgeon, and consents to inclusion in the trial, baseline non-invasive assessment will be&#xD;
      carried out before a percutaneous biopsy will be mandated as part of entry into the study.&#xD;
      After non-invasive staging, patients will be subject to biopsy. In collaboration with&#xD;
      pathology, an immediate diagnosis will be made at the time of fine needle aspiration biopsy&#xD;
      (or bronchoscopy). After a pathologic diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, subjects will be&#xD;
      invited to have additional biopsies will be performed to obtain material for correlative&#xD;
      studies, assuming no complications or technical difficulties have arisen. These studies will&#xD;
      be done in collaboration with thoracic interventional radiologists from Diagnostic Imaging,&#xD;
      who supervises the lung fine needle aspirates and biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo pre-study assessments for symptoms, performance status,&#xD;
      radiographic assessment and blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and renal&#xD;
      function tests). Assessment of response will occur after the 4-week treatment period.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed continuously, with patient assessment weekly on treatment, repeat&#xD;
      blood tests at 2 weeks and imaging of measurable disease at 4 weeks. All subjects will be&#xD;
      invited to have their initial diagnostic biopsy and subsequent surgical tumor specimen&#xD;
      examined as part of the laboratory correlate component of the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      considered evaluable for pharmacodynamic assessment if they complete at least 21 of the&#xD;
      planned 28 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once competed, oral Gefitinib will be administered at a dose of 250 mg (1 pill) daily for 28&#xD;
      days prior to the planned mediastinoscopy. Patients may take the pill either with or without&#xD;
      food, and are encouraged to take the medication at approximately the same time each day. If&#xD;
      the patient forgets to take a dose, they should take the last missed dose as soon as they&#xD;
      remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. If patient vomits&#xD;
      after taking the dose, the dose may be retaken if the tablet is seen in the emesis. The last&#xD;
      dose of Gefitinib will be administered not less than 48 hours prior to mediastinoscopy or&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mediastinoscopy reveals the presence of Stage III disease, the patient's&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy samples may still be analysed as part of the correlative study. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 90 days or as long as required after the last dose of Gefitinib to ensure&#xD;
      resolution of any Gefitinib-related toxicities. However these patients will be offered&#xD;
      standard therapy for stage III disease off of study protocol, for example a combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation plus or minus surgical resection. If these patients do proceed to&#xD;
      thoracotomy post-chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, their resection specimen will not be&#xD;
      eligible for this correlative protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Duration of Therapy and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      As outlined above, patients will be treated for 28 days before surgery and will also be&#xD;
      followed for 90 days post-operatively after thoracotomy to ensure the recovery from surgery.&#xD;
      Accrual is estimated at 2 patients per month, for 18 to 24 months, based on accrual rates to&#xD;
      other thoracic surgical studies at UHN. Study duration is planned from August 2004 to June&#xD;
      2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed in the current standard of care at University Health Network.&#xD;
      That is, clinic visits with chest x-ray every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in the&#xD;
      third year, and annually thereafter. Recorded information will only include vital status and&#xD;
      presence or absence of disease recurrence.&#xD;
