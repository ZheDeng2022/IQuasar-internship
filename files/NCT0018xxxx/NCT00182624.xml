  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether scanning the prostate using special magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) techniques can detect prostate cancers with greater accuracy than other&#xD;
      methods. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to produce images of body tissues. Unlike&#xD;
      many cancers, prostate cancer is difficult to see on most imaging studies like x-rays,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans, and conventional MRI scans. This study will use a magnet&#xD;
      twice as strong as the magnets commonly used in MRI tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confirmed by prostate biopsy may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and review of pathology reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo MRI of the prostate and possibly a biopsy of the prostate gland, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before coming to the NIH Clinical Center for the biopsy, patients take a Fleets enema to&#xD;
      empty the rectum of fecal matter. For the MRI, an endorectal coil (a tube containing a&#xD;
      specially designed antenna) is placed in the rectum, which is just behind the prostate. The&#xD;
      coil increases the amount of signal received by the MRI unit. Additional coils may be wrapped&#xD;
      around the pelvis to further improve the quality of the scan. The patient lies on a stretcher&#xD;
      that moves into the scanner. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein for injection&#xD;
      of a contrast agent called gadolinium, which brightens the images. Patients may also be asked&#xD;
      to breathe an oxygen-rich gas through a mask during the scan to test the use of oxygen as a&#xD;
      contrast agent in MRI. Patients may be asked to repeat the MRI to test the reproducibility of&#xD;
      the procedure. The repeat test is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate Biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the MRI findings, patients may be asked to undergo a prostate biopsy to obtain a&#xD;
      sample of tumor tissue. The tissue is obtained with a needle placed through the rectum.&#xD;
      Medicines may be used to reduce pain during the biopsy and to reduce the chance of infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Progress in effective local therapy of prostate cancer has been stymied by the lack of an&#xD;
      imaging technique capable of reliably identifying the location of cancer within the prostate.&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a promising candidate for imaging the prostate because of its&#xD;
      high soft tissue contrast, multiplanar capabilities, and the potential for providing unique&#xD;
      biologic information not available with other modalities. In addition to conventional&#xD;
      T2-weighted imaging MRI techniques that provide unique biologic information include MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy, diffusion weighted MRI, dynamic enhanced MRI and hypoxia imaging. All have&#xD;
      shown promise in imaging tumors at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 Tesla but all have been&#xD;
      limited by sensitivity. Since MR signal is proportional to magnetic field strength, 3.0 Tesla&#xD;
      clinical systems potentially could improve overall diagnostic accuracy. A comprehensive&#xD;
      imaging package which incorporates all these techniques to study prostate cancer on a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art 3.0 Tesla magnet has not yet been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study we seek to develop and evaluate a comprehensive prostate MR exam at 3.0&#xD;
      Tesla. Patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer will undergo an MRI with endorectal and&#xD;
      surface phased array coils which will include conventional sequences, MR spectroscopy,&#xD;
      Diffusion weighted MRI, Dynamic enhanced MR and Hypoxia imaging. In the development phase of&#xD;
      this trial (30 patients), the robustness of the techniques and test-retest reproducibility&#xD;
      will be evaluated. In the second phase, the comprehensive prostate MRI exam will be validated&#xD;
      against the results of prostate biopsy (50 patients). The expected accrual period is two&#xD;
      years. We hope that this method will offer prostate cancer patients a more accurate method of&#xD;
      localizing their prostate cancer than is now possible which should improve outcomes and&#xD;
      minimize complications of treatment.&#xD;
