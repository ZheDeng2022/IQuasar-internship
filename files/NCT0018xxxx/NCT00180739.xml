        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Subject with uterine fibroids, who desire pregnancy within 12 months and has the&#xD;

             have egg donation. Women above 38 should test for normal ovarian function as judged by&#xD;
             endocrinological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the couple has failed to conceive for more that 1 year, the woman should test for normal&#xD;
        ovarian function as judged by endocrinological evaluation, and the male must have adequate&#xD;
        sperm test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women undergoing fertility treatment or plan to have sperm donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Use or non use of non-steroidal treatments for excessive vaginal bleeding such as&#xD;
             antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. Tranexamic acid) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             drugs (e.g. Mefanamic Acid) has been maintained for the three months prior to the&#xD;
             planned date of the study procedure and the patient has agreed to maintain this use or&#xD;
             non-use through the 6-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Clinically normal PAP smear within timing of National Guidelines in the country of&#xD;
