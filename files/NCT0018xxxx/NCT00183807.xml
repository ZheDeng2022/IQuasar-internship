      This study is for patients with cancer of the esophagus. This study uses the drugs&#xD;
      irinotecan, cisplatin and celecoxib. Irinotecan (also known as CPT-11) was recently approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colon cancer, but has not been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of cancers of the esophagus. Cisplatin is a drug&#xD;
      that is commonly used to treat patients with cancer of the esophagus. We are combining these&#xD;
      two chemotherapy drugs with a drug called Celebrex. Celebrex (also called Celecoxib) is an&#xD;
      oral medication that is approved by the FDA for pain in the treatment of arthritis. There is&#xD;
      some information to suggest that this drug may have anti-cancer activity. In prior studies&#xD;
      combining irinotecan and cisplatin, tumors of the esophagus have been shown to shrink. We are&#xD;
      adding Celebrex to these drugs to see if it makes the drugs work better to shrink cancer or&#xD;
      cause fewer side effects.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinically documented unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer&#xD;
             and histologic confirmation of the diagnosis with tumor. To be unresectable a patient&#xD;
             must have been examined by a surgeon and declared unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue from tumor must be available. This may be paraffin embedded tissue from&#xD;
             previous biopsy/resection or if it is not available, a repeat biopsy must be&#xD;
             performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to have a sample 20 cc drawn in addition to routine labs with each&#xD;
             cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan. If prior&#xD;
             radiation therapy was administered, measurable disease must be outside the radiation&#xD;
             field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy; this must have been completed&#xD;
             at least 6 months prior to the initiation of therapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a pre-treatment granulocyte count (i.e., segmented neutrophils +&#xD;
             bands) of &gt;1,500/mm3, a hemoglobin level of greater than or equal to9.0 gm/dl, and a&#xD;
             platelet count of &gt;100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as documented by&#xD;
&#xD;
             1) creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal OR 2)&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min as calculated with&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as documented by a serum bilirubin less&#xD;
             than or equal to 2x the institutional upper limit of normal, regardless of whether&#xD;
             patients have liver involvement secondary to tumor. Aspartate transaminase (SGOT) must&#xD;
             be less than or equal to 3x institutional upper limit of normal, unless the liver is&#xD;
             involved with tumor, in which case the aspartate transaminase must be less than or&#xD;
             equal to 5x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No major surgery within 1 month of starting study drug.&#xD;
