  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been treated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have failed to&#xD;
      respond to anti-viral treatment are often concerned about their ongoing liver disease and are&#xD;
      therefore looking for alternative treatments which might prevent fibrosis progression. This&#xD;
      view is endorsed by patient representative groups (including Charles Gore at the HepC Trust)&#xD;
      who have welcomed this trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single centred, prospective, open labelled design. Practical as well as safety&#xD;
      concerns dictated that the study could not be conducted in a blinded fashion, since patients&#xD;
      taking anticoagulation require monitoring. The study consisted of two 8 week phases: Phase 1&#xD;
      and Phase 2. Phase 1 (observation phase, 0 to 8 weeks) and Phase 2 (treatment phase with&#xD;
      warfarin anticoagulation, 8 to 16 weeks). Study completed at end of Phase 2.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convincing evidence exists outlining a role for the coagulation system in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      liver fibrosis. In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a role for thrombin and FXa in&#xD;
      activating hepatic stellate cells and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      prothrombotic states accelerate liver fibrosis (Wright et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence if prothrombotic states accelerate liver fibrosis, conversely anticoagulation should&#xD;
      slow liver fibrosis. Animal studies have confirmed this (Anstee et al., 2008; Duplantier et&#xD;
      al., 2004), and confirmed the beneficial effect of inhibiting the coagulation cascade. The&#xD;
      number of patients with HCV infection on anticoagulants is small and there is no published&#xD;
      case series. Similarly there are problems assessing disease progression using patients with&#xD;
      haemophilia and HCV infection. The therapeutic use of anticoagulation to prevent fibrosis in&#xD;
      humans is not without precedent, and warfarin has demonstrated a survival benefit in&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (Kubo et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antifibrotic potential of warfarin anticoagulation needs to be formally assessed in the&#xD;
      setting of a clinical trial using patients with documented liver fibrosis. Most previous&#xD;
      human studies of antifibrotics have taken place in patients with chronic HCV infection who&#xD;
      have failed anti-viral therapy, as they are a model of progressive fibrosis (Anstee et al.,&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate if any potential effect on the progression of liver fibrosis in patients&#xD;
           infected with Hepatitis C virus, with moderate severity liver fibrosis is demonstrable&#xD;
           with anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of anticoagulation in patients infected with Hepatitis C virus&#xD;
           infection, with moderate severity liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the St. Mary's Hospital Ethics committee and conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Potential participants were&#xD;
      identified via the departmental Hepatitis C database. All potential candidates were screened&#xD;
      for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged greater than 17 years of age, had&#xD;
      evidence of active Hepatitis C viral replication (HCV RNA PCR positive), ALT of greater than&#xD;
      40 iu/ml, a modified histology activity index fibrosis score (Ishak et al., 1995) of greater&#xD;
      than 2 but less than 5 on liver biopsy within the last five years, and had failed antiviral&#xD;
      therapy for Hepatitis C in the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring anticoagulation for existing clinical indications; standard&#xD;
      contraindications to anticoagulation (active peptic ulcer disease, past history of&#xD;
      haemorrhagic stroke, thrombocytopaenia, platelets count &lt; 100 x109 /L); clinical evidence of&#xD;
      portal hypertension; known cerebrovascular abnormalities; HIV antibody positive; alcohol&#xD;
      abuse (&gt; 40 units/week); menhorragia and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential qualifying subjects were initially contacted by telephone to be informed about the&#xD;
      study and arrange a formal screening visit. During the screening visit, entry criteria were&#xD;
      confirmed and all patients who agreed to participate were required to give written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study employed a single centred, prospective, open labelled design. Practical as well as&#xD;
      safety concerns dictated that the study could not be conducted in a blinded fashion, since&#xD;
      patients taking anticoagulation require monitoring. The study consisted of two 8 week phases:&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Week 0 to Week 8) Phase 1 of the study consisted of 8 weeks of observation, which&#xD;
      commenced following a baseline visit at week 0. At the baseline study routine blood tests and&#xD;
      non-invasive markers of fibrosis were performed. No placebo was given during the observation&#xD;
      period. At week 8 patients underwent their second study visit during which routine blood&#xD;
      tests and evaluation with non-invasive markers of fibrosis were repeated. The week 8 study&#xD;
      visit marked the completion of Phase 1, following which patients entered Phase 2 of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Week 8 to Week 16) Phase 2 of the study consisted of 8 weeks of anticoagulation with&#xD;
      warfarin. In previous animal studies (Anstee et al., 2008), warfarin anticoagulation to&#xD;
      achieve a whole blood clotting of twice the normal range was sufficient to retard fibrosis&#xD;
      significantly, hence the international normalised ration (INR) was aimed to be maintained&#xD;
      between 2 to 3 during the treatment period. Patients were given a standard induction regimen&#xD;
      of warfarin in keeping with the outpatient warfarin loading protocol of the hospital's&#xD;
      anticoagulation clinic. Warfarin was supplied by the hospital pharmacy. Routine INR&#xD;
      monitoring and warfarin dosing was undertaken by the anticoagulation clinic on a weekly&#xD;
      basis. Patients were monitored at these visits for any adverse events related to the&#xD;
      treatment. At week 16, following 8 weeks of anticoagulation, a further study visit was&#xD;
      organised. Routine bloods tests and non-invasive markers of fibrosis were performed at this&#xD;
      visit, which marked the completion of each patient's participation in the study.&#xD;

A single adverse event was noted in one subject during the anticoagulation period. This was classed as minor in severity and related to an episode of minor haemorrhage secondary to an episode of gingivitis, which resolved following antibiotics and did not require blood transfusion, but did require cessation of the anticoagulation for a short period of 2 days. This patient was not included in the analysis. No other subjects required cessation of treatment during the anticoagulation period.</description>
