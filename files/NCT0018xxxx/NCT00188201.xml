  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estimated global prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) infection is approximately 3% (170&#xD;
      million individuals). In Canada there are an estimated 240,000 people infected with HCV. The&#xD;
      current study addresses the hypothesis that neurocognitive and neurochemical abnormalities&#xD;
      may occur in individuals with HCV-infection who do not have liver cirrhosis or vasculitic&#xD;
      neuropathy, and this may result from a direct effect of HCV on the Central Nervous System&#xD;
      (CNS). The purpose of this study is to assess whether infection with the Hepatitis-C virus is&#xD;
      associated with changes in thinking skills and brain chemistry, in patients who do not have&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis. In addition, we are examining whether such changes in thinking skills and&#xD;
      brain chemistry are reversed by antiviral treatment. We are also studying whether factors&#xD;
      such as fatigue and depression have an effect on thinking skills in people with Hepatitis-C.&#xD;
      In order to take into account the impact of having viral hepatitis, we will be comparing the&#xD;
      results of the Hepatitis-C group to the results of a group of patients with Hepatitis-B, and&#xD;
      to a group of individuals who do not have Hepatitis.&#xD;

      The current proposal addresses the hypothesis that neurocognitive and neurochemical&#xD;
      abnormalities may occur in individuals with HCV-infection who do not have liver cirrhosis or&#xD;
      vasculitic neuropathy, and that this phenomenon may result from a direct effect of HCV on the&#xD;
      Central Nervous System (CNS). Our hypothesis originated from the frequently reported&#xD;
      complaints of forgetfulness and decreased ability to concentrate ('brain fog') in our&#xD;
      patients with chronic HCV-infection, as well as from clinical observation of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in a moderate proportion of non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients. Patients with&#xD;
      HCV-infection also report significant impairment in most realms of everyday function, and&#xD;
      greater reductions in quality of life (QOL) than individuals infected with the Hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus (HBV). These results cannot be attributed to degree of liver inflammation, or the mode&#xD;
      of acquisition of infection. Based on the well-established association between neurocognitive&#xD;
      function and quality of life, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these QOL differences&#xD;
      between HCV and HBV are the result of cerebral compromise in individuals infected with HCV,&#xD;
      and consequent neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients were found to be impaired on speeded measures of&#xD;
      sustained attention and working memory relative to control subjects. MRS results from the&#xD;
      same study suggested that there may also be neurochemical changes associated with HCV that&#xD;
      can be observed even in infected individuals with normal liver status (as determined by&#xD;
      biopsy). In particular, an increase in choline ratios, was detected in the basal ganglia and&#xD;
      white matter. This pattern appears to be specific to HCV-infection as abnormalities were not&#xD;
      found in patients with Hepatitis-B infection. Furthermore, the degree of neurochemical&#xD;
      abnormality was correlated with neuropsychological performance. Similar increases in choline&#xD;
      levels have been reported in subcortical brain regions in individuals infected with HIV-1,&#xD;
      even prior to the onset of symptomatic infection and signs of cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Mechanism through which HCV may have direct CNS effects A plausible mechanism for&#xD;
      direct CNS effects of HCV involves passage of the virus into brain tissue through infection&#xD;
      of circulating lymphocytes. In fact, a number of studies have revealed the presence of HCV&#xD;
      RNA-negative strand (an intermediate of viral replication) within peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PMBC). However, the issue of extra-hepatic replication in PBMC remains&#xD;
      controversial due to contrary findings and methodological criticisms. However, more recently&#xD;
      Laskus and colleagues demonstrated the presence of HCV RNA-negative strand in PBMC in 40-60%&#xD;
      of HCV-infected individuals with HIV-1 co-infection, and in a separate investigation&#xD;
      determined the presence of HCV RNA-negative strand in monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+&#xD;
      lymphocytes, and CD19+ cells in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individuals. Thus, it is plausible that&#xD;
      HCV enters the brain through circulating lymphocytes, and that consequent neuropsychiatric,&#xD;
      neurocognitive, and neurochemical abnormalities are related to the presence of HCV in the CNS&#xD;
      in a way that is not yet understood. Corroborating this hypothesis is the recent observation&#xD;
      by Thomas and colleagues (personal communication) that HCV can be detected in the brain&#xD;
      tissue of infected individuals upon neuropathological examination of autopsy tissue. This&#xD;
      proposed mechanism for direct CNS effects of HCV-infection is similar to that which is&#xD;
      thought to be the cause of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive impaiiment. Early in the course of&#xD;
      the HIV-1 epidemic came the realization of frequent neurological complications, including&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive, and motor dysfunction. These symptoms could not be&#xD;
      attributed to opportunistic infection of the CNS (e.g. toxoplasmosis; neoplasms), and often&#xD;
      progressed to a stage of dementia, which came to be known as HIV-associated dementia (HAD).&#xD;
      The incidence of HAD has declined drastically subsequent to the advent of antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment. HIV-1 is thought to enter the brain very early in the course of initial infection,&#xD;
      possibly through the infection of peripheral monocytes and macrophages that cross the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier. In HAD, there is a complex and indirect mechanism of CNS damage that may&#xD;
      occur years after initial HIV-1 infection, usually under conditions of immunocompromise.&#xD;
      HIV-1 does not directly infect neurons, but rather replicates within brain macrophages and&#xD;
      microglia. These cells subsequently become immunoactive, and release secretory neurotoxic&#xD;
      substances that ultimately lead to a breakdown of homeostatic mechanisms, and a consequent&#xD;
      cascade of inflammatory events. The resulting metabolic encephalopathy damages, and&#xD;
      eventually destroys CNS neurons. The most prominent neuropathological features of HAD occur&#xD;
      in white matter and deep grey matter regions of the brain, and include myelin pallor,&#xD;
      multinucleated giant cells, and occasionally encephalitis characterized by disseminated,&#xD;
      multifocal microgranulomas composed of elongated microglia, macrophages, and lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Thus, given preliminary findings of extra-hepatic replication within PBMC as a plausible&#xD;
      mechanism for infiltration of CNS by HCV-infected lymphocytes, neuropathological detection of&#xD;
      HCV within the CNS, clinical observation and patient complaints of cognitive deficits, and&#xD;
      reduction in HRQOL beyond that observed in chronic HBV-infection, it is possible that HCV may&#xD;
      have direct CNS effects that elicit a consequent inflammatory reaction that interferes with&#xD;
      neuronal function in a manner similar to the neuropathological processes associated with&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, there are parallels between MRS findings for HIV-1 and those&#xD;
      reported in HCV-infection in non-cirrhotic patients. In particular, HIV-1 is marked by an&#xD;
      increase in choline-containing compounds (Cho), similar to the preliminary findings of Forton&#xD;
      and colleagues (1999; 2000). This increase in subcortical Cho can be found in HIV-1 positive&#xD;
      patients even in the absence of cognitive dysfunction, suggesting it may be a very early&#xD;
      marker of CNS involvement. Other changes, notably a decrease in N-acetylaspartate, are&#xD;
      apparent in HIV-1 infected individuals with significant neuropsychological impairment,&#xD;
      indicating an evolution of CNS disease. Of importance, antiretroviral therapy appears to&#xD;
      reverse the Cho abnormalities, and also results in significant improvements in neurocognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Phase I In the first phase, we will determine whether non-cirrhotic individuals&#xD;
      with chronic HCV-infection (who do not have cryoglobulinemia) manifest abnormalities in brain&#xD;
      biochemistry and neurocognitive performance. This will be accomplished by comparing&#xD;
      HCV-infected individuals to subjects with HBV-infection (to control for the effects of viral&#xD;
      hepatitis), and to an age-matched control group on measures of neurocognitive performance and&#xD;
      MRS after careful screening to rule out the presence of other conditions that may affect&#xD;
      cognitive performance. We will also determine whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      MRS-quantified brain biochemistry and neurocognitive performance. Finally, we will reveal the&#xD;
      determinants of neurocognitive impairment and neurochemical abnormalities using multivariate&#xD;
      analyses, to evaluate the relative contribution of other clinical parameters associated with&#xD;
      HCV-infection, such as fatigue, mood / psychiatric symptoms, serum aminotransferase levels,&#xD;
      degree of fibrosis, viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II In the second phase of our investigation, we will determine whether HCV-infected&#xD;
      patients who achieve a sustained virological response to antiviral therapy (no HCV RNA&#xD;
      detectable in serum) will show amelioration of cerebral metabolite abnormalities and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment), compared&#xD;
      to patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment and compared to an age-matched control&#xD;
      group (the same control subjects tested in Phase I of the investigation). In the group that&#xD;
      does not respond to treatment, MRS abnormalities will remain unchanged, or may worsen. A&#xD;
      control group is particularly important for the NP assessment aspect of the investigation, in&#xD;
      order to account for practice effects that may result from repeated administration of NP&#xD;
      tests. Patients with HBV-infection will not be re-tested at this point, because we do not&#xD;
      expect to see any abnormalities in this group at the initial assessment point. In addition,&#xD;
      if HBV-infected patients were started on antiviral treatment following their liver biopsy, it&#xD;
      is likely that they will still be receiving treatment 1-5 years later. The rationale for&#xD;
      timing the final assessment of HCV patients 6 months after the cessation of antiviral therapy&#xD;
      involves the known neuropsychiatric sequelae of treatment with Interferon (which may&#xD;
      otherwise affect the cognitive assessment). Efficacy of antiviral treatment of HCV with&#xD;
      Interferon and ribavirin At the time of this submission, treatment with IFNa2b plus ribavirin&#xD;
      is the standard of care for patients with chronic HCV-infection. However, recently published&#xD;
      data indicates that when interferon is pegylated (covalently bound to polyethylene glycol),&#xD;
      efficacy is markedly enhanced in comparison to standard IFNa2b plus ribavirin. Enhanced&#xD;
      efficacy is likely due to the sustained elevation of IFN in serum, due to delay of its renal&#xD;
      excretion. Thus, weekly (rather than three times weekly) injections are required. Pilot study&#xD;
      data indicates that the efficacy of pegylated IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin is even more&#xD;
      effective. This portion of the investigation is an add-on to a safety study involving&#xD;
      treatment with 6 or 12 months of Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a plus ribabvirin (UHN #&#xD;
      01-0082). We expect that the rate of sustained virological responders in non-cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients will be approximately 54%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Subjects - In total, 150 subjects will participate in the investigation, 100 of&#xD;
      which will be assessed on two different occasions, approximately 1.5 years apart. Fifty&#xD;
      patients with chronic Hepatitis C infection (HCV), fifty with chronic Hepatitis B infection&#xD;
      (HBV), and fifty healthy control subjects will be recruited to participate in the&#xD;
      investigation. All participants will undergo screening procedures to rule out conditions that&#xD;
      can affect cognitive function. Those that are deemed eligible on the basis of the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will participate in the first phase of the investigation in which they&#xD;
      will be assessed with Physical, Neurological, Psychiatric, and Neuropsychological&#xD;
      examinations, as well as with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. In the second phase of the&#xD;
      investigation, HCV patients and control subjects will be reassessed after an interval of 1.0&#xD;
      to 1.5 years to determine whether antiviral treatment is effective at ameliorating&#xD;
      neurocognitive and brain biochemical abnormalities identified in the first phase of the&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials: Assessments and Procedures Screening Assessments Liver Biopsy All HCV and BBV&#xD;
      patients who have received a liver biopsy as part of their clinical management will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the current investigation, although no patient will receive a&#xD;
      biopsy for the purposes of this investigation. Instead, participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      the pool of subjects who are receiving clinical care at the UHNTWH Liver Clinic who have had&#xD;
      a recent liver biopsy performed, and will be progressing to treatment (both HBV and HCV&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessment HCV and HBV patients will undergo a screening laboratory assessment&#xD;
      that will consist of hematological assessment, blood chemistry, and urinalysis as per the&#xD;
      protocol for the clinical trial that this investigation is being added on to (UHN # 01-0082).&#xD;
      In addition, supplementary laboratory assessments will be conducted to screen for other&#xD;
      parameters that may be related to cognitive function. In particular, the following tests will&#xD;
      be performed: RBC/Folate, Hb Urea, Electrolytes, Bl2, TSH, Cryoglobulins, INR, Albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Evaluation All HCV and HBV patients will be assessed by the Principle Investigator&#xD;
      for clinical signs of liver disease, and will also have a general physical examination as&#xD;
      specified in the clinical trial protocol (UHN # 01-0082). HBV patients will be assessed by&#xD;
      the Principle Investigator in a similar manner. The results of this assessment will be used&#xD;
      to screen for signs of clinically significant liver disease (e.g. stigmata, asterixis, liver&#xD;
      size, spleen size, jaundice, ascites or edema, as well as for other conditions related to&#xD;
      liver disease that could possibly affect cognition and thus exclude the participant from&#xD;
      participation in the investigation (e.g. cryogloubulinemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological Examination: Patients will be examined by the study neurologist for the presence&#xD;
      of conditions that would result in exclusion from the investigation. The neurologist will&#xD;
      also examine the patients for signs of peripheral neuropathy that could indicate the presence&#xD;
      of cryoglobulinemia (e.g. dysesthesia or hypesthesia, motor weakness, exaggerated deep tendon&#xD;
      reflexes, and positive pyramidal signs). In addition, the neurological examination will be&#xD;
      conducted during the final visit in order to determine whether any of the neurological side&#xD;
      effects known to be associated with Interferon therapy have persisted beyond the 6 month&#xD;
      wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric Examination: The patient will be examined by the study psychiatrist to determine&#xD;
      current and lifetime presence of psychiatric diagnoses that could result in their exclusion&#xD;
      from the investigation. Of specific concern are psychiatric diagnoses that could have an&#xD;
      impact on cognitive function (e.g. Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Substance Abuse&#xD;
      disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder).&#xD;
