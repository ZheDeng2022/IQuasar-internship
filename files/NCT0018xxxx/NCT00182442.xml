  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People affected by schizophrenia often experience poor concentration, lapses in memory and&#xD;
      difficulty with completing tasks; and this set of problems are known as neuro-cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. Traditional medications used in the treatment of schizophrenia have not been&#xD;
      particularly useful in improving these problems, while the recently introduced medications&#xD;
      are expected to be superior in this respect. The proposed research study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the effect of two of the new medications (Zyprexa and Seroquel) in improving the&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating psychiatric disorder with complex clinical&#xD;
      presentation, partially responsiveness to treatment and varied outcomes. Though modern&#xD;
      anti-psychotic drugs have been used to treat the illness for the past 50 years, it has been&#xD;
      consistently observed that a significant proportion of people diagnosed with schizophrenia do&#xD;
      not respond adequately to these medications. Even among those people who show symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement, the benefit does not translate into improved functioning in real life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in the past 10 years revealed two significant findings: 1) it is now known that a&#xD;
      proportion of people with schizophrenia have neurocognitive deficits as part of their&#xD;
      clinical profile. Neuro-cognitive deficits refer to impairments in attention, concentration,&#xD;
      memory, use of language, decision making and subtle aspects of judgment. 2) Traditional&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs have not been useful in improving neurocognitive deficits, while claims&#xD;
      have been made that novel antipsychotic drugs (Quetiapine, Olanzapine and Risperidone) may&#xD;
      have some beneficial effects in improving the neurocognitive deficits associated with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In an earlier investigation, we have noticed that Quetiapine produced&#xD;
      clinically significant improvement in neurocognitive deficits compared to other antipsychotic&#xD;
      drugs; and there have been two additional reports confirming this distinctive advantage of&#xD;
      Quetiapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these preliminary results, the present study is designed to address the following&#xD;
      questions. 1) To examine whether the neurocognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia&#xD;
      have an impact on the community functioning and quality of life of individuals affected by&#xD;
      this illness, and 2) whether Quetiapine (Seroquel) is significantly more effective than&#xD;
      Olanzapine (Zyprexa) in improving neurocognitive deficits, community functioning and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will include a total of 120 patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, who will require antipsychotic drug treatment. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on the expected differences between the two compared medications, in&#xD;
      terms of their ability to improve the neurocognitive cluster score on PANSS (Positive and&#xD;
      negative symptoms scale) detected in our earlier study.The study is designed as a prospective&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial, using Quetiapine and Olanzapine as drugs for&#xD;
      comparison. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline clinical and neurocognitive&#xD;
      evaluation and randomly assigned to receive either Quetiapine or Olanzapine treatment. Both&#xD;
      patients and controls are blinded to the nature of the medication being prescribed. However,&#xD;
      the clinicians will have the flexibility to increase the dose as clinically appropriate. The&#xD;
      goal is to achieve symptom stability and monitor the progress in community functioning, and&#xD;
      changes in perceived quality of life. The participants will continue with the medication at&#xD;
      least for a period of one year, and the outcome evaluations will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 month points. These include re-assessment of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive&#xD;
      deficits and community functioning, using appropriate measurement tools.&#xD;

             change of medication from conventional medications or Risperidone is indicated due to&#xD;
             lack of efficacy, side-effects or poor subjective tolerability.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Substance dependence, mental retardation, head injury or other primary neurological&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imminent risk due to suicidal or aggressive behavior (a score of five or more on the&#xD;
