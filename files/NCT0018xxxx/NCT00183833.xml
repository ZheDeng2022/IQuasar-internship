  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with solid tumors cancer for which the standard chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      have not worked. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the side effects of Xeloda (also&#xD;
      called capecitabine) in combination with a new anticancer agent called Gleevec (also called&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate). Xeloda is an anticancer drug, and can be taken by mouth. The active&#xD;
      ingredient is a well-studied cancer drug called 5-FU. Xeloda is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of colon cancer. Gleevec is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with a&#xD;
      leukemia called CML (increase of white blood cells) after failure of standard therapy. It is&#xD;
      also approved by the FDA for patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (a rare tumor in&#xD;
      the digestive tract).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test how much Gleevec we can safely give with Xeloda. Xeloda will be given at&#xD;
      the recommended dose for colorectal cancer and Gleevec will be given in increasing amounts.&#xD;
