      Airway hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic feature of the asthma. It is known that there&#xD;
      is an association between airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic airway inflammation.&#xD;
      However, even though inflammation can be reduced with appropriate asthma therapy, it is&#xD;
      typical that airway hyperresponsiveness improves only modestly with treatment. The&#xD;
      determinants of airway hyperresponsiveness are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also not clear as to the site of airway narrowing in asthma. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      airways beyond the 4th order have the greatest resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to determine the relationships between the airway inflammation, remodeling of the&#xD;
      airway and airway hyperresponsiveness. Through local instillation of methacholine at&#xD;
      bronchoscopy we will be able to study proximal and distal airways and the extent to which&#xD;
      they constrict in vivo&#xD;

      Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a characteristic feature of the asthmatic condition in&#xD;
      humans. There is an association between AHR and eosinophilic airway inflammation. However,&#xD;
      even though eosinophilic inflammation can be abolished with appropriate therapy, it is&#xD;
      typical that AHR improves only modestly with treatment. The determinants of AHR are poorly&#xD;
      understood. Recent data implicate mediators such as the cytokine Interleukin-13 (IL-13),&#xD;
      structural changes to the airway wall (remodeling), increased contractility of airway smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells (ASMC) and loss of mechanical connections or tethering, as potential factors&#xD;
      contributing to AHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also uncertainty around the site of airway narrowing in asthma. In normal airways,&#xD;
      bronchii around the 4th order have the greatest contribution to total resistance. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the site of greatest resistance is moved distally in asthma and might even&#xD;
      involve quite small airways close to the level of terminal bronchioles. Non-invasive methods&#xD;
      to assess airway caliber in vivo are still unproven. One untested concern is that the airways&#xD;
      of subjects with severe AHR have the potential to close completely putting them at risk of&#xD;
      severe and even fatal airflow obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study AHR in humans with asthma: we will determine the relationships between&#xD;
      AHR and (i) eosinophilic inflammation in the airway (sputum cellularity) via sputum&#xD;
      induction, (ii) soluble mediators of inflammation (IL-13, IL-4, IL-5), (iii) remodeling of&#xD;
      the airway wall (sub-epithelial fibrosis, ASMC accumulation)via biopsy. In addition we will&#xD;
      compare measurements of AHR assessed by inhalation challenge with the results of direct,&#xD;
      local installation of methacholine. At bronchoscopy, methacholine is delivered to the airway&#xD;
      and bronchoconstriction is assessed directly. This method will allow study of proximal and&#xD;
      distal airways, identification of heterogeneity of responses among airways and the extent to&#xD;
      which human airways can constrict in vivo.&#xD;
