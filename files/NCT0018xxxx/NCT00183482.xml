    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus&#xD;
      educational treatment in preventing depression in the children of parents with a history of&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious condition that can affect a person's work, relationships, and quality&#xD;
      of life. Studies have shown that children of depressed parents are at a higher risk for&#xD;
      developing depression than those whose parents have not experienced depression. Safe and&#xD;
      effective treatments that can help prevent children of depressed parents from becoming&#xD;
      depressed are needed. This study will compare CBT to depression education to determine which&#xD;
      is more effective in preventing depression in the children of depressed parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of either CBT or depression&#xD;
      education for 12 weeks. Parents in the CBT group will be taught skills to more effectively&#xD;
      raise their children and to better manage their depressive symptoms; their children will be&#xD;
      taught skills to cope with the stress of their parents' depression. Families in the education&#xD;
      group will be informed about the ways that depression can affect individuals with depression&#xD;
      and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at study entry and at Week 12. Several follow-up visits will occur&#xD;
      for up to 2 years after the interventional part of the study. At each visit, a clinician will&#xD;
      make direct observations of the depressed parent's interaction with his or her children. In&#xD;
      addition, families will be interviewed and will complete questionnaires about the parent's&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and family interaction.&#xD;
