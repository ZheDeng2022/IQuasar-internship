  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have poor&#xD;
      general health and a higher risk of heart attack and bone loss (osteoporosis) compared to the&#xD;
      general population. Some of the risks associated with heart attacks and bone loss are&#xD;
      modifiable (can be changed). For example, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking,&#xD;
      lack of exercise are risk factors associated with heart attacks that can be changed. Whereas,&#xD;
      age and a family history of heart attacks are risk factors that can not be changed.&#xD;
      Similarly, a diet low in calcium, smoking and lack of exercise are modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      associated with osteoporosis; while, family history and age are not modifiable. The Health&#xD;
      Improvement and Prevention Program (HIPP) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus was developed to&#xD;
      increase the general health in persons who have lupus and to help reduce the risk of heart&#xD;
      attacks and bone loss. This intervention program gives comprehensive&#xD;
&#xD;
      information about lupus and provides tools on how to live better with lupus. The program&#xD;
      includes visits with a nurse case manager who will work in close collaboration with the lupus&#xD;
      team. She will work on an individual basis with each participant to develop a mutually agreed&#xD;
      upon personalized care plan aimed at improving general health, coping skills and heart and&#xD;
      bone health.&#xD;

      HIPP STUDY (Health Improvement And Prevention Program)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Paul Fortin Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary objectives:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To improve adherence to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To help persons with Lupus move toward wellness by increasing knowledge.&#xD;

           disease, cardiovascular disease in Lupus, bone health in Lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIPP now patients will be followed by nurse coordinator and receive an individualized&#xD;
           risk assessment, telephone follow-up, smoking cessation counseling. For those found at&#xD;
           risk stress reduction (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) and or bone health program&#xD;
           will be provided. Hipp now patients will attend Cardiac Rehabilitation Program at TWH.&#xD;
           All HIPP now pts will attend the Cardiac Rehabilitation program at the TWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

      The survival rate in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) exceeds 90% at 10 years but health&#xD;
      status is severely impaired and comparable with that of advanced cardiac or respiratory&#xD;
      diseases. Since these issues are often overlooked in clinical practice and because SLE&#xD;
      affects primarily young women in their productive life, a specific intervention is needed to&#xD;
      heighten health status and coping, and to reduce complications such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD) and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary goal is to demonstrate: 1- that a coordinated intervention, named the Health&#xD;
      Improvement and Prevention Program (HIPP), will improve health status in SLE compared with&#xD;
      usual care, and 2- that the same intervention will decrease significantly the number of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and improve the flow-mediated dilatation (FMD - a non-invasive&#xD;
      measure of endothelial health that we will use as a surrogate marker of CVD) in persons with&#xD;
      SLE. Our secondary goals are to demonstrate that HIPP will: 1- improve bone health behaviors&#xD;
      and prevent decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), 2- improve adherence to treatments, 3-&#xD;
      help persons with lupus move towards wellness on the illness-wellness continuum by increasing&#xD;
      their knowledge of lupus, and 4- be shown to be a cost-effective intervention that could&#xD;
      become standard of care in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our population will consist of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of SLE (revised 1997 ACR&#xD;
      criteria) from the lupus clinics of the University of Toronto and McGill University. All&#xD;
      those without cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis will be approached for this study. These&#xD;
      two centres follow annually a total of close to 700 persons with SLE and offer standard HIPP&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study design is a randomized prospective study of HIPP compared to usual care. As we&#xD;
      believe that HIPP will be superior to usual care, we will crossover those in the usual care&#xD;
      group to the HIPP group at 12 months. We will collect information for 24 months on all&#xD;
      participants. The Health Improvement and Prevention Program is a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      intervention that will be coordinated by a case manager nurse in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      lupus treating team. After providing consent, each person will fill in demographic, health&#xD;
      status, cost, SLE knowledge, coping, cardiovascular and osteoporosis risk questionnaires and&#xD;
      will undergo a clinical evaluation to measure lupus disease activity and damage as well as a&#xD;
      FMD and BMD. They will be randomized to HIPP or to usual care for 12 months after which the&#xD;
      usual care group will be crossed over to HIPP. HIPP participants will be invited to attend a&#xD;
      4-week, 6 hour course that will cover the following four topics: 1) Knowledge of SLE, 2)&#xD;
      Coping with a Chronic Disease, 3) Cardiovascular Disease in SLE and 4) Bone Health in SLE.&#xD;
      Four to six weeks after entry into HIPP, there will be a second visit to the case manager&#xD;
      during which an individualized program will be proposed to the patient. For all patients,&#xD;
      this will include a standardized CVD prevention program. For those found to be at risk at&#xD;
      baseline, it will also include a stress-reduction and/or a bone-health program. The case&#xD;
      manager will follow HIPP participants individually by phone or in person according to their&#xD;
      needs. Follow-up questionnaires on health status, cost and coping will be done by phone at 6&#xD;
      and 18 months; repeat clinical assessments for lupus activity and damage, questionnaires and&#xD;
      FMD will be done at 12 and 24 months; and BMD will be repeated at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and analyses. We will need to enroll 120 patients in our study to ensure 80% power to&#xD;
      detect at least a 10% improvement in the SF-36 MCS and PCS and a 20% CVD risk reduction.&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses, univariate and multivariate analyses will be carried out. For our&#xD;
      primary goals, we will test whether HIPP is better than usual care in improving the SF-36&#xD;
      MCS, PCS and CVD risk profile. Our outcome will be change in the SF-36 MCS or PCS scores, FMD&#xD;
      or CVD risk assessment, and our predictive variable will be HIPP. We will adjust for age,&#xD;
      gender, and baseline SF-36 MCS and PCS, depression score, education, lupus activity and&#xD;
      damage. Other secondary outcomes will be analysed using similar models. Cost will be&#xD;
      calculated and cost-effectiveness analyses of HIPP will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. A valid, cost-effective and comprehensive program to ameliorate the health and&#xD;
      coping status and to prevent CVD and osteoporosis would have a high impact on the long-term&#xD;
      health and quality of life of persons with SLE.&#xD;
