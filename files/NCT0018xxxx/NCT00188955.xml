      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with sirolimus, in combination&#xD;
      with low-dose tacrolimus and prednisone, is effective for the treatment of chronic allograft&#xD;
      nephropathy (progressive scarring) in children who have previously received a kidney&#xD;
      transplant. This treatment is compared to the standard therapy which uses low-dose&#xD;
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study that will determine whether treatment with sirolimus reduces or&#xD;
      improves the rate of scarring seen on kidney biopsy of the transplanted kidney over time,&#xD;
      compared to children who continue to be treated with mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title Of Study: A Single Center, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Study Of Two Chronic&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive Protocols Using Sirolimus Or Mycophenolate Mofetil To Prevent Or Reverse&#xD;
      Disease Progression In Pediatric Renal Transplants With Chronic Allograft Nephropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Title: Winnipeg-CAN-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial: Phase-IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This prospective, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two different chronic immunosuppressive protocols in the treatment of chronic allograft&#xD;
      nephropathy (CAN) in children. One protocol will continue with standard immunosuppression&#xD;
      which includes mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and the other will substitute MMF with sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â· To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with sirolimus in pediatric renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients with established CAN compared to MMF at reducing the rate of progression of CAN as&#xD;
      measured by prospective histological evaluation of sequential kidney biopsies using&#xD;
      quantification of interstitial fibrosis by image analysis and a validated standardized&#xD;
      scoring schema (Banff 97 criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with sirolimus in pediatric renal transplant&#xD;
           recipients with established CAN compared to MMF at slowing the rate of clinical&#xD;
           deterioration associated with progression of CAN as measured by the change of serum&#xD;
           creatinine and corrected glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the effect of treatment with sirolimus in pediatric renal transplant&#xD;
           recipients with established CAN compared to MMF on the incidence of late AR as&#xD;
           identified by prospective histological evaluation of sequential kidney biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the effect of treatment with sirolimus in pediatric renal transplant&#xD;
           recipients with established CAN compared to MMF on the incidence graft failure as&#xD;
           defined by a return to dialysis, re-transplantation or death from uremic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the differences in the expression of molecular markers of fibrosis in&#xD;
           pediatric renal transplant recipients with established CAN treated with sirolimus&#xD;
           compared to MMF by immunohistochemical identification of extracellular matrix protein&#xD;
           expression and remodeling and quantification by image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be a prospective, single-centre, randomized, controlled trial in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with functioning kidney transplants who have biopsy-proven CAN. The study&#xD;
      is designed to compare the efficacy of two chronic immunosuppression regimens intended for&#xD;
      the treatment of CAN. Patients (aged 1-17 years) who have CAN demonstrated on protocol biopsy&#xD;
      or on biopsy done for clinical suspicion of CAN, will be considered for enrollment. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and treatment will be randomized between one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups: Group A will receive sirolimus in combination with low-dose tacrolimus and&#xD;
      prednisone; Group B will receive the current local standard therapy, which is MMF, low-dose&#xD;
      tacrolimus and prednisone. All other transplant care will be according to standard local&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed for a period of 2 years, and will undergo protocol&#xD;
      biopsies at 1 and 2 years. The timing of these biopsies will coincide with already planned&#xD;
      protocol biopsies. Clinical, laboratory and histological data will be gathered prospectively&#xD;
      to determine efficacy according to pre-defined criteria measuring the extent of CAN and&#xD;
      interstitial fibrosis. Study visits will coincide with routine clinic visits, except for&#xD;
      weekly visits at the study onset to titrate drug dosing according to trough levels. Blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, blood pressure monitoring, timed urine collections and nuclear GFR testing will&#xD;
      be performed according to the normal clinical care protocols. Additional pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      testing will occur at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled over a 2-year period and will be followed according to study&#xD;
      protocol for 2 years. 40 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosages, Route and Dose Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Group A will receive an initial oral loading dose of sirolimus 3 mg/m2&#xD;
      in 2 divided doses (1.5 mg/m2/dose bid) on study day 1. Beginning on study day 2, patients&#xD;
      will receive 1mg/m2/day orally in divided doses (0.5 mg/m2/dose) every 12 hours. Therapeutic&#xD;
      drug monitoring of 12-hour trough concentrations will be performed at weeks 1-4, then monthly&#xD;
      for the first 3 months, then at least every 3 months, and dose adjustments will be made in&#xD;
      order to achieve 12-hour trough levels between 8 ng/ml and 12 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Group B will continue to receive MMF 1200 mg/m2/day orally in divided&#xD;
      doses (600 mg/m2/dose) every 12 hours starting on Study Day 1. Therapeutic drug monitoring of&#xD;
      12-hour trough concentrations will be performed at weeks 1-4, then monthly for the first 3&#xD;
      months, then at least every 3 months, and dose adjustments will be made in order to achieve&#xD;
      12-hour trough mycophenolic acid (MPA) levels of between 2.0 mg/ml and 4.0 mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be determined by monitoring AEs, vital signs, and laboratory parameters (clinical&#xD;
      chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) during the follow-up period. In particular, signs and&#xD;
      symptoms associated with known medication side effects such as infection, malignancy, anemia&#xD;
      (sirolimus), thrombocytopenia (sirolimus), hyperlipidemia (sirolimus), leukopenia (MMF) and&#xD;
      GI effects (MMF). Serial monitoring of renal function will indicate acute rejection or drug&#xD;
      toxicity, to be confirmed on biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy And Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative changes in CAN will be used to determine efficacy. Protocol renal allograft&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed at 12 and 24 months after study enrollment and will be compared to&#xD;
      the baseline histology obtained from routine protocol surveillance biopsy during the&#xD;
      screening period which are performed at 1, 3, 6 12 months post-transplant, and yearly&#xD;
      thereafter. The amount of CAN will be measured by semi-quantitative scoring of histological&#xD;
      changes characteristic of CAN according to the Banff 97 schema, and interstitial fibrosis&#xD;
      will be quantified using image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include changes of renal function, proteinuria, rates of acute rejection,&#xD;
      graft survival, and the expression of proteins important in interstitial matrix remodelling&#xD;
      by immunohistochemistry. Renal function will be monitored at each clinical visit and will be&#xD;
      compared with baseline function over the duration of the study. In addition, quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of GFR corrected for body surface area will be obtained at baseline, 1 and 2&#xD;
      years, by nuclear GFR measurement. Proteinuria will be quantified by 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
      at baseline and every 6 months during the study or by spot protein:creatinine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. Quantitative TFR will be compared between&#xD;
      groups using the change in TFR over time (DTFR) and the percent change from baseline (%DTFR).&#xD;
      The Student's t-test will be used to compare the change between groups for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. One-way ANOVA will be used to detect significant change for multiple time-points,&#xD;
      and multiple ANOVA to examine correlation between interval variables. Multiple regression&#xD;
      analysis is used to determine the predictive value of different, possibly independent&#xD;
      quantitative variables. Non-parametric variables will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed&#xD;
      Rank Test, and treatment differences over time using the Quade test. A difference of &lt;0.05 is&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
