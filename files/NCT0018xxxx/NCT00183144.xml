  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Therapeutic Workplace is effective in&#xD;
      increasing and maintaining long-term drug abstinence in homeless, alcohol dependent adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few populations are beset with the constellation of economic, social and health problems that&#xD;
      afflict homeless individuals. At the heart of much of this misfortune are staggering rates of&#xD;
      alcoholism and drug addiction. While it is not clear whether substance abuse is a cause,&#xD;
      consequence, or simply a correlate of homelessness, there is no question that substance abuse&#xD;
      is among the most common and most serious problems facing the homeless. Given their unique&#xD;
      set of serious and chronic problems, the Institute of Medicine has identified the homeless as&#xD;
      a group of people in need of specialized substance abuse interventions. Prior research has&#xD;
      shown that the Therapeutic Workplace intervention is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronically unemployed heroin and cocaine dependent individuals. The intervention integrates&#xD;
      abstinence reinforcement contingencies of proven efficacy into a model supported work&#xD;
      program. Under this intervention, patients are paid to perform data entry jobs in the&#xD;
      Therapeutic Workplace. Those lacking needed skills are given intensive training in basic&#xD;
      academic and job skills. To reinforce abstinence from alcohol and drugs, patients are&#xD;
      required to provide an alcohol-free breath sample and drug-free urine sample to gain entrance&#xD;
      to the workplace each day. In this way, patients can work and earn salary only when they&#xD;
      abstain from alcohol and drugs. Patients are paid in vouchers instead of cash to reduce the&#xD;
      chance they will use their earnings to purchase alcohol or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in homeless,&#xD;
      alcohol-dependent adults who completed an inpatient alcohol detoxification. After the&#xD;
      detoxification, 124 participants were invited to attend the workplace for 6 months. They were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three groups that differed in the requirements for voucher&#xD;
      reinforcement. One group received the full therapeutic workplace intervention in which&#xD;
      vouchers were contingent on both abstinence and work (Abstinence and Work group). A second&#xD;
      group was paid for work, but did not have to provide an alcohol-free breath sample or&#xD;
      drug-free urine sample to gain access to the workplace; their vouchers were contingent on&#xD;
      work only (Work-Only group). A third group was invited to attend the therapeutic workplace&#xD;
      but received no vouchers for work performed or abstinence achieved during treatment (No&#xD;
      Voucher group).&#xD;
