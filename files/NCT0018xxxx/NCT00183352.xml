      This study will determine the effect of medication for bipolar disorder on the reproductive&#xD;
      function and whether mood changes occur during the menstrual cycle in women with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a serious condition that can have devastating effects on social and&#xD;
      psychological functioning. Evidence suggests that medications for bipolar disorder may&#xD;
      influence reproduction function among women. This study will determine reproductive function&#xD;
      and mood changes in women who are currently on medication for bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will comprise women with bipolar disorder and age- and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI)-matched healthy controls. Participants will have their reproductive function and mood&#xD;
      changes assessed for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Daily, participants will report about&#xD;
      their mood, sleep patterns, life events, and any psychiatric medications; this information&#xD;
      will be entered into a computerized system named ChronoRecord. In addition, participants will&#xD;
      measure their basal body temperature and collect their urine every morning to assess for&#xD;
      ovulation. Blood collection will occur at study entry and between Days 3 and 6 of every&#xD;
      menstrual cycle to determine levels of reproductive hormones. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      fast for 12 hours prior to every blood collection. During the first month of the study, an&#xD;
      extra study visit will occur. Participants will undergo a physical exam for determination of&#xD;
      excessive hair growth (hirsutism) and BMI. Additionally, insulin resistance will be measured,&#xD;
      and participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will be used to determine&#xD;
      their past and current menstrual function, as well as the reproductive and psychiatric&#xD;
      history of their families.&#xD;
