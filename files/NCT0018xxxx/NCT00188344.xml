    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare pneumatic dilatation and laparoscopic Heller myotomy&#xD;
      in patients with achalasia in order to learn which of these two treatments should be&#xD;
      recommended to patients in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a rare disease of the esophagus. It can cause difficulty swallowing,&#xD;
      regurgitation of swallowed food, and chest pain. In achalasia, there are two problems in the&#xD;
      esophagus. First, the esophagus does not properly push swallowed food down towards the&#xD;
      stomach. Second, the valve at the lower end of the esophagus, called the lower esophageal&#xD;
      sphincter, does not relax to allow food to pass from the esophagus into the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achalasia cannot be &quot;cured&quot;. However, the symptoms of achalasia can be improved by treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment is usually directed towards reducing the degree of blockage caused by the lower&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter. the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter can be stretched using a&#xD;
      technique called pneumatic dilatation, or it can be divided (cut in half) during a surgical&#xD;
      operation. The operation is called laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and is done by laparoscopic&#xD;
      (&quot;keyhole&quot;) surgery, where small incisions are used and patients usually stay in hospital 1-2&#xD;
      nights. Other treatments for achalasia, such as medications or injection of Botulinum Toxin&#xD;
      Type A are not often used because they do not provide effective long-term improvement.&#xD;

    <description>The patient is on a liquid diet for 2 days prior to procedure. A sedative and pain killer by IV are given and the throat will be sprayed with local anesthetic.&#xD;
The gastroenterologist may perform an endoscopy prior to the dilatation to safely guide the dilator into position. A special dilator with a small balloon will be passed down the esophagus until it meets the stomach then the balloon will be inflated with air until the narrow part of the esophagus is opened. The patient will then be assessed for any perforation of the esophagus and monitored in the post-procedure unit for a few hours.</description>

    <description>The abdomen is inflated with gas and cameras and instruments are inserted. The junction between the esophagus and stomach is identified. The muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter is divided. A portion of the stomach wall is secured to the lower esophagus. After surgery the patient is taken to the recovery room and when well enough moved to a ward. The patient may be discharged the following day.</description>
