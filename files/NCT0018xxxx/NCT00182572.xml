  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are increasingly abusing and becoming dependent on heroin and other opioids. The&#xD;
      number of emergency room visits related to heroin among 12-17 year olds rose almost 600%, and&#xD;
      the self-reported prevalence of heroin use among this group more than doubled in the last&#xD;
      decade. As a result of the increased availability of high-potency, low-cost heroin, many&#xD;
      adolescents initiate heroin use by snorting it; however, many often then progress to&#xD;
      injection of heroin. Despite the critical need to identify efficacious treatments for this&#xD;
      population, virtually no research has been conducted to systematically characterize or&#xD;
      evaluate treatment interventions for adolescent heroin and opioid abusers. We recently&#xD;
      conducted the first controlled study funded by NIDA to systematically evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of several pharmacotherapies as detoxification agents along with intensive behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in the treatment of this population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      ways to further improve on the promising outcomes from our initial study via combined&#xD;
      behavioral-buprenorphine treatment for opioid-dependent youth. The primary aim is to examine&#xD;
      if improved treatment outcomes can be achieved if the duration of buprenorphine&#xD;
      detoxification is lengthened (when the rate of decrease in buprenorphine dose is slower,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms may be of reduced intensity and youth are provided with a greater&#xD;
      opportunity to learn new skills and behaviors addressing how they might best discontinue&#xD;
      their opiate use, prevent relapse, and meet treatment goals). A secondary aim is to examine&#xD;
      if the provision of monetary voucher-based incentives contingent on consumption of the opioid&#xD;
      antagonist, naltrexone, reduces rates of relapse to opiate use in adolescents&#xD;
      post-detoxification compared to when no such incentives are provided. This analysis may&#xD;
      provide critical empirical information regarding how to best prevent relapse to opioid use&#xD;
      among opioid-dependent youth. Another secondary aim is to identify significant predictors of&#xD;
      treatment outcome. We will thus conduct an exploratory evaluation of demographic, baseline&#xD;
      drug use, psychological and other history variables that may predict successful treatment&#xD;
      outcomes. This work may help inform the refinement of treatment interventions for various&#xD;
      sub-populations of opioid-dependent youth. Outcome measures will include opiate and other&#xD;
      drug abstinence, retention, opiate withdrawal symptoms, HIV risk behavior, family&#xD;
      relationships, as well as a variety of other secondary outcome measures. We plan to collect&#xD;
      these measures at intake, during treatment and at several post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      timepoints. Overall, this research will contribute new empirical information that will inform&#xD;
      the development of effective treatment interventions for the largely unstudied and rapidly&#xD;
      expanding population of opioid-dependent youth.&#xD;
