      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the severity of retinal arteriolar narrowing and other microvascular&#xD;
           changes, as determined from retinal photographs and video imaging, to measures of&#xD;
           coronary microvascular function in women evaluated for chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate measures of vascular compliance with applanation tonometry and&#xD;
           photoplethysmography using a nasal alar probe.&#xD;

      Women who meet study eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will have a&#xD;
      baseline physical exam, including measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, weight. Medical&#xD;
      history will be updated, specifically cardiovascular events (hospitalizations, procedures)&#xD;
      since last contact and current medications. Patients will be scheduled for retinal&#xD;
      photography. Those who are currently being screened and qualify for EWISE or other ancillary&#xD;
      studies will have retinal photography scheduled as close to the index CFR as possible and&#xD;
      prior to receiving randomized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retinal photography will follow a standardized written protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second protocol, 100 patients will be scheduled for an appointment in the Eye clinic&#xD;
      where they will meet the Women's Ischemic Syndrome Evaluation (WISE)/Atherosclerosis Risk in&#xD;
      Communities (ARIC) staff and complete the baseline information and have a brief physical&#xD;
      examination. They will then have provocative testing completed with retinal imaging.&#xD;
