  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the long-term health outcome of children diagnosed&#xD;
      with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). We are inviting subjects that were previously followed in&#xD;
      the Pediatric GI programs at Massachusetts General and Children's Hospital, Boston. We have&#xD;
      compiled a database of more than 300 subjects that completed diagnostic testing for GER in&#xD;
      the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's. Subjects are being contacted initially by mail using a&#xD;
      previously approved recruitment letter. Subjects that fail to respond to this recruitment&#xD;
      letter are called by phone. In each case, contact information has been abstracted from the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital database. Subjects are then given the opportunity to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire either by phone or in hard copy. Subjects receive no compensation for their&#xD;
      participation in this study. Subjects will be compared to controls. Controls will complete&#xD;
      the same questionnaire as the subjects. Inclusion of potential controls will be determined by&#xD;
      a lack of medical history of gastroenterological diseases before the age of 21 and whether&#xD;
      the potential control was born within a year of a subject in the study. Controls will receive&#xD;
      $25 to participate in the study.&#xD;
