      The presence of insulin resistance (IR) appears to be a key factor in the development of&#xD;
      steatosis and disease progression in patience with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1&#xD;
      infections similar to levels in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether Pioglatizone, when given along with Interferon and&#xD;
      Ribavirin, reduces insulin resistance and lowers HCV viral levels and improved response in&#xD;
      patients who have HCV genotype-1 infection when compared to a placebo.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S.&#xD;
      and is the most common cause for liver transplantation. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      remains problematic and unsatisfactory. Several factors influence the response to treatment&#xD;
      most importantly hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (sustained virological response/SVR seen in&#xD;
      40-45% vs. 75-80% using pegylated IFN + ribavirin combination therapy genotype 1 vs. 2/3).&#xD;
      Recently, the presence of hepatic steatosis has been shown to be an important predictor of&#xD;
      disease progression and also response to antiviral therapy especially in patients with&#xD;
      genotype 1 infection. The mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in HCV are multi-factorial; the&#xD;
      presence of insulin resistance (IR) appears to be a key factor especially in genotype 1&#xD;
      (metabolic steatosis) similar to that seen in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (NAFLD). Whereas metabolic steatosis appears to be a factor in resistance to antiviral&#xD;
      therapy, viral steatosis (direct viral induced as in genotype 3) is reduced in those who&#xD;
      achieve an SVR. We recently also observed that IR is common in type 1 HCV infection even at&#xD;
      low BMIs and is present even in the non-steatotic hepatitis C patients, suggesting a direct&#xD;
      effect of viral infection on insulin sensitivity and that IR may precede hepatic steatosis.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, therapy aimed at improving&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in conjunction with standard antiviral therapy may not only reduce the&#xD;
      insulin resistance in hepatitis C but also improve hepatic steatosis, decrease expression of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce oxidative stress thereby preventing disease&#xD;
      progression. In addition, we also hypothesize that improvement in IR and hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      may also result in improved virological response to antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study introduces a novel concept of using the insulin sensitizing thiazolidinedione&#xD;
      agent pioglitazone to improve insulin sensitivity, improve hepatic steatosis and possibly&#xD;
      result in a higher rate of virological response when given in conjunction with standard&#xD;
      antiviral therapy in treatment naïve patients with genotype 1 infection. Our main goals are&#xD;
      to study the effect of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in addition&#xD;
      to its effect on SVR along with confirming the safety of pioglitazone in patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis C. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study of an&#xD;
      insulin sensitizing agent in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We hope that&#xD;
      the findings in this study will shed new light into the mechanisms associated with the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of hepatitis C and lead to new and effective treatments in the management of&#xD;
      this very important disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance (IR), a key factor in the development of steatosis, is a common finding in&#xD;
      patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In patients with genotype 1 infection, IR&#xD;
      has been noted in up to 80% of patients in some studies. In patients with non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD) who have evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the role of&#xD;
      IR leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation, increased production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and increased oxidative stress had been proposed as an important mechanism leading&#xD;
      to steatosis and subsequent liver cell injury. Recently, an association between steatosis and&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis has been emphasized in HCV infection, similar to that described in patients&#xD;
      with NAFLD. While IR and hepatic steatosis are common findings in patients with HCV&#xD;
      infection, the latter with prevalence rates of 40% to 70%, and different HCV genotypes&#xD;
      confers distinct risks for steatosis; a greater degree of steatosis is seen in patients with&#xD;
      genotype 3 infection compared to others. Similar to that seen in patients with NAFLD,&#xD;
      patients infected with genotype 1 HCV show a relationship between body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      risk for steatosis. However, in up to 30% of patients with HCV infection and hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis, no other risk factors for steatosis can be identified. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary data will show that even in HCV infected individuals with low BMI and no&#xD;
      steatosis, there is IR and the risk for steatosis is increased when directly compared to&#xD;
      NAFLD patients. Recent data also suggest that the presence of hepatic steatosis is an&#xD;
      independent predictor of decreased response to antiviral therapy even when controlling for&#xD;
      genotype. This is especially important in patients with type 1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, treatment with&#xD;
      antiviral therapy will have a partial effect on reducing insulin resistance (IR) and&#xD;
      steatosis and this is augmented by the addition of an insulin sensitizing thiazolidinedione&#xD;
      (TZD) agent such as pioglitazone to the treatment regimen. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) will be higher in the antiviral regimen&#xD;
      + pioglitazone treated group compared to patients receiving antiviral therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' specific aims are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the improvement in insulin sensitivity in patients with treatment naïve&#xD;
           genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treated with standard antiviral therapy + pioglitazone or&#xD;
           placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the improvement in hepatic steatosis in patients with treatment naïve genotype&#xD;
           1 chronic hepatitis C after treatment with standard antiviral therapy + pioglitazone or&#xD;
           placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the rates of sustained virological response (SVR) among patients with&#xD;
           treatment naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treated with standard antiviral therapy +&#xD;
           pioglitazone compared to standard antiviral therapy + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pioglitazone given in&#xD;
      combination with standard antiviral therapy for the treatment of genotype 1 infected&#xD;
      hepatitis C patients who are treatment naïve. We will determine the rates of improvement in&#xD;
      homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hepatic steatosis after 48&#xD;
      weeks of therapy compared to baseline along with determining the rate of SVR in the two&#xD;
      treatment groups. In addition, we will also assess the safety of pioglitazone in patients&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will have undergone a percutaneous liver biopsy within 6 months of&#xD;
      enrollment to assess the severity of hepatitis C, steatosis and features of steatohepatitis&#xD;
      by the study pathologist. A period of 6 months prior to enrollment was selected in order to&#xD;
      have a more recent representation of the degree of steatosis and histologic severity of&#xD;
      hepatitis C as the effect of therapy on these histologic features is one of the important&#xD;
      aims in this study. A HOMA index value of &gt; 2.0 was selected to define IR in this study (see&#xD;
      below: Inclusion criteria) as this value is considered abnormal and indicative of decreased&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. Histological severity of chronic hepatitis C will be done using the&#xD;
      modified histological activity index (HAI) scoring system by Ishak for grading and staging&#xD;
      chronic viral hepatitis and that for steatosis and steatohepatitis will be done using the&#xD;
      scoring system that is currently being used in the NIH-funded Virahep-C study, which the PI&#xD;
      is currently a member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We currently have an IRB approved protocol at the University of Michigan to collect a sample&#xD;
      of liver tissue at the time of liver biopsy in all patients with hepatitis C and NAFLD to&#xD;
      study fat gene expression. We will collect samples on patients being considered for this&#xD;
      study who are undergoing a liver biopsy at initial evaluation. We will also collect similar&#xD;
      samples at the time of repeat liver biopsies in this study. This will give us a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to study the effect of pioglitazone on fat-related gene expression and its&#xD;
      relationship to responses being studied in this study (changes in IR and steatosis and&#xD;
      virological response to therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this is a pilot study of pioglitazone in patients with hepatitis C and the&#xD;
      potential hepatotoxicity of this drug in hepatitis C is not well known due to limited&#xD;
      available data, we plan to enroll treatment-naïve patients with evidence of at least some&#xD;
      fibrosis on liver biopsy (a minimum Ishak fibrosis score of 1) although we do not have any&#xD;
      reason to expect any significant drug induced liver injury with this drug. Patients with&#xD;
      evidence of cirrhosis on liver biopsy (Ishak fibrosis score 5 and 6) will be excluded since&#xD;
      cirrhosis itself can be associated with IR and thereby bias the findings. Although we do not&#xD;
      expect to see any increased hepatotoxicity due to pioglitazone in patients with hepatitis C&#xD;
      in general, whether cirrhosis increases potential risk is unknown at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, we also plan to exclude patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM) to minimize any&#xD;
      bias especially since interferon therapy itself can affect glucose tolerance and may lead to&#xD;
      difficult control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. In our hepatitis C patient&#xD;
      population, although prevalence of DM is less than 15%, the addition of diabetic patients may&#xD;
      also confound the analysis unless we stratify randomization based on presence or absence of&#xD;
      DM and since this is a pilot study with a limited sample size, we decided to exclude&#xD;
      diabetics. Another factor would be correcting the influence of glucose controlling agents on&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients who are interested in the study will be invited to come to the GCRC at&#xD;
      regular intervals for study assessment. During these visits, a brief physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed and blood will be collected and stored for future research purposes. The&#xD;
      current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 1 infection is a&#xD;
      combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks. Treatment response is defined&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained Virological Responder (SVR) - undetectable HCV RNA in serum during therapy and&#xD;
           at 24 weeks follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapser - undetectable HCV RNA in serum during and end of treatment and reappearance of&#xD;
           RNA once therapy is stopped; we expect less than 15% of initial responders to relapse&#xD;
           after stopping treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-Responder - presence of HCV RNA in serum at the end of therapy and during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients with genotype 1 who have detectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks of therapy are&#xD;
      usually labeled as non-responders and treatment is stopped in clinical practice, all patients&#xD;
      in this study will complete 48 weeks of treatment unless the regimen has to be stopped due to&#xD;
      side effects or patient preference. This is because of potential beneficial effects of&#xD;
      therapy (addition of pioglitazone to antiviral therapy) on IR and hepatic steatosis and&#xD;
      possibly even fibrosis even among viral non-responders when treated for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment is completed, all patients will be invited to come to GCRC 12 weeks following&#xD;
      the end of treatment to undergo a repeat liver biopsy. Total follow-up once treatment is&#xD;
      stopped will be 24 weeks in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible adult patients with compensated liver disease due to chronic infection with HCV&#xD;
      and genotype 1 infection who are treatment naïve will be enrolled into the study. All racial&#xD;
      and ethnic groups will be recruited into this study. Patients with cirrhosis and&#xD;
      decompensated liver disease and any patient, in whom a liver biopsy is contraindicated, will&#xD;
      be excluded. Race (African American/Black or non-Hispanic white or other) will be assigned&#xD;
      based on the information given by the patient. It reflects the individual's recognition in&#xD;
      the community. This assignment of race/ethnicity will be similar to that practiced by&#xD;
      governmental agencies including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Center for Disease Control.&#xD;
      All patients will sign an IRB approved HIPAA compliant consent form before enrolling into the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All eligible adult patients with compensated liver disease due to chronic infection&#xD;
             with HCV and genotype 1 infection who are treatment naïve will be enrolled into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All racial and ethnic groups will be recruited into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females: age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis C: history of serum positive for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) and HCV&#xD;
             RNA. Patients should have evidence of chronic hepatitis with a minimum fibrosis score&#xD;
             of 1 on liver biopsy done within 6 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insulin resistance based on HOMA index value (HOMA-IR) of &gt; 2.0 during screening.&#xD;
             HOMA-IR is a well recognized and validated index of insulin resistance in both&#xD;
             non-diabetic and diabetic populations and has been shown to have a good correlation&#xD;
             with 'clamp' techniques that are intensive. HOMA is also used routinely to assess&#xD;
             longitudinal changes including assessment of the effects of treatment. In general, a&#xD;
             HOMA-IR value of &gt; 1.5 is considered abnormal based on repeat testing measurements&#xD;
             performed by both HOMA assessment and by euglycemic clamp technique and is considered&#xD;
             representative of decreased insulin sensitivity. Although insulin secretion is&#xD;
             pulsatile, the correlation between HOMA computed from repeat sampling (using a mean of&#xD;
             three samples taken at 5-minute intervals to compute HOMA) and the value obtained from&#xD;
             a single basal sample to determine insulin sensitivity has been shown to be near&#xD;
             perfect even in patients with type 2 diabetes (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.0001). The&#xD;
             investigators will use a HOMA-IR value of &gt; 2.0 as part of the inclusion criteria in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent&#xD;

          -  Hepatitis C patients who underwent previous therapy for their liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genotype other than type 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological evidence of cirrhosis or confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease and any patient, in whom a&#xD;
             liver biopsy is contraindicated, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of other causes of chronic liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification for cardiac disease: class&#xD;
             III and IV patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with solid organ transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding&#xD;
